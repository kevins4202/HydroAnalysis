4275,understanding how precipitation is partitioned into evapotranspiration and streamflow is important for assessing water availability in the budyko framework this partitioning is quantified through the ω parameter previous studies have modeled the physical representation of ω however the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between ω and the variables that it represents has not been investigated this study uses a geographically weighted regression model to identify spatial variations in the factors that control the water balance in 126 reference watersheds with minimal human disturbance and 765 non reference watersheds in the continental united states results show that snowfall and forest coverage are important predictors of ω in the reference watersheds relative cumulative moisture surplus dam storage and developed land in riparian areas are important predictors in non reference watersheds climate is a primary control of the relative importance of forest coverage the importance of forest coverage is greater in arid watersheds than in humid watersheds snowfall is more important than forest coverage in the northeast and midwest this study demonstrates that dam construction and urban sprawl have a significant impact in non reference watersheds dam storage is the most important predictor in 21 of the non reference watersheds and riparian developed land is more important in 13 of the non reference watersheds overall there are statistically significant relationships between climatic physiographic and human related factors and the ω parameter the spatial variations in the relationship quantified in this study can help to improve regional watershed management keywords streamflow budyko spatial heterogeneity geographically weighted regression ordinary least squares regression 1 introduction understanding how precipitation is partitioned into evapotranspiration and streamflow is important for understanding global and regional water availability climate variability watershed physiographic characteristics and anthropogenic activities can substantially impact the surface water balance berghuijs et al 2017 gentine et al 2012 quantification of the relative importance of these factors is critical for improving water resources management and decision making process based hydrological models are one method of quantifying the impacts of these factors dey and mishra 2017 however it can be time consuming to apply these models across many watersheds due to the labor intensive model calibration process fatichi et al 2016 in the last decade a conceptual hydrological framework known as the budyko framework has been successfully applied for many applications such as quantifying runoff sensitivity berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2016 renner et al 2012 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 unravelling the effects of climate and anthropogenic factors on streamflow jiang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 patterson et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 wang et al 2020 modeling streamflow and evapotranspiration abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 chen et al 2013 fang et al 2016 nayak et al 2020 and improving the calibration of global hydrological models greve et al 2020 the advantages of the budyko framework are multifold first it is physically based the budyko hypothesis relates the evaporative ratio et p to the aridity index pet p the relationship is constrained by the energy limit when pet equals to et and the water limit when et equals to p the second advantage is that it has a low computational cost making it more efficient to apply over a large number of watersheds to examine spatial variability abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 padrón et al 2017 xu et al 2013 lastly it has fewer data requirements than process based hydrological models making it preferable for applications over longer time periods and larger spatial scales in the version of the budyko framework that is known as fu s equation fu 1981 long term streamflow is simulated using mean annual precipitation p mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet and other factors that are represented by the shape parameter ω the ω parameter is used to partition the water balance input precipitation and output evapotranspiration and streamflow however it does not have a specific physical meaning abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 previous studies have explored the meaning of ω and related it to climatic factors such as seasonality storminess and snowfall conditions as well as watershed characteristics for example potter et al 2005 found that for a given aridity index the ratio of mean annual e to p was larger when p and pet were in phase when higher temperatures coincide with higher moisture surplus this can increase evapotranspiration abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 found a significant negative correlation between ω and the seasonal asynchronicity between p and pet the importance of seasonality or synchronicity in p and pet was also emphasized by milly 1994 wolock and mccabe 1999 shao et al 2012 and xing et al 2018 snowfall is another climate related element that can affect the water balance using the budyko framework berghuijs et al 2014 found that streamflow is likely to decrease when precipitation shifts from snowfall to rainfall this is consistent with a negative correlation between ω and the fraction of precipitation falling as snow shown in abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 finally storminess such as average storm depth and storm frequency has also been shown to influence ω donohue et al 2012 shao et al 2012 xing et al 2018 yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2004 watershed characteristics such as vegetation soil properties and topography can also influence ω vegetation related variables that can change ω include vegetation coverage and vegetation type abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 chen et al 2020 donohue et al 2007 2010 li et al 2013 shao et al 2012 sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 for example yang et al 2008a found a significant correlation between the curve parameter η which is a shape parameter of choudhury s equation and the leaf area index forested watersheds have a higher ω than grassland dominated watersheds because they typically have greater evapotranspiration zhang et al 2004 soil related variables such as saturated hydraulic conductivity and available water holding capacity can also impact ω abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 donohue et al 2012 yang et al 2007 for example the ratio of available water capacity to precipitation has been shown to have a statistically significant positive correlation with ω as available plant water regulates the available water for q abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 watershed topography variables such as slope aspect relief ratio and elevation have also been found to influence ω abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 shao et al 2012 sinha et al 2019 xing et al 2018 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2007 2009 for example slope is negatively correlated with ω because watersheds with steeper slopes tend to have higher runoff abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 yang et al 2007 2009 human activities such as the modification of land use land cover urbanization and irrigation have been observed to alter the hydrological cycle worldwide debbage and shepherd 2018 destouni et al 2013 rodell et al 2018 although the non parametric budyko framework was initially developed for large scale watersheds with minimal human interference the parametric budyko framework such as the fu s equation fu 1981 can be applied to human impacted watersheds liang et al 2015 patterson et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 some recent studies have attempted to directly relate ω to factors such as irrigated area cultivated land area percentage of farmland and population bai et al 2020 bao et al 2019 han et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 xing et al 2018 a positive correlation between ω and irrigated areas was found in 96 watersheds in china xing et al 2018 this is also found in sub watersheds of the yellow river basin in china bao et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 in the united states human activities have been found to have greater impacts on streamflow than climate change in the high plains and western u s wang and hejazi 2011 however it is unclear which specific human related factors are dominant and how they vary regionally abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 modeled ω in hdcn and mopex watersheds in the continental u s and found that it was strongly influenced by climate factors soil characteristics and watershed topography they pointed out that their model performed slightly worse in the mopex watersheds because the watersheds are influenced by irrigation and land use changes abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 the impacts of human activities on the hydrological cycle have been observed in many regions in the continental u s such as the northeast hodgkins et al 2019 midwest kelly et al 2016 and southeast debbage and shepherd 2018 therefore it is important to identify how human disturbance influences ω in these watersheds previous studies have evaluated how multiple factors control ω concurrently abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 donohue et al 2012 li et al 2013 xing et al 2018 xu et al 2013 for example xu et al 2013 used a multiple linear regression model and a neural network model in the mopex watersheds and 32 global watersheds they found that most of the variance in ω can be explained by geographic locations normalized difference vegetation index ndvi slope and elevation at the continental scale abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 used a generalized additive model to model ω in 382 watersheds in the continental u s they found that climate seasonality snow fraction the ratio of available water capacity to precipitation and slope can explain 81 2 of the variability in ω xing et al 2018 used a multivariate adaptive regression spline model to simulate η in choudhury s equation in 96 watersheds in china they found that the three most influential factors were average storm depth vegetation coverage and precipitation seasonality they also found significant interaction effects from cultivated land irrigation drought and precipitation variability despite excellent prior work modeling ω in different locations around the world the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between ω and the independent variables has not been studied a negative correlation between ω and ndvi was found in a total of 211 hcdn watersheds in the u s abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 and 286 watersheds in china bai et al 2020 however a positive correlation between ω and ndvi was found in 224 mopex watersheds in the u s xu et al 2013 26 global watersheds li et al 2013 and 96 watersheds in china xing et al 2018 the contrasting relationship between ω and vegetation coverage was also shown by yang et al 2009 in china and sinha et al 2019 in india bao et al 2019 found no significant correlation between ω and forest coverage in a watershed in china the findings of these previous studies indicate that there may be spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between ω and explanatory variables a generalized model may not be helpful for uncovering the relationship the lack of consideration of human related factors and spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between ω and environmental variables may hinder our understanding of ω motivated by this research gap three research questions are answered in this study 1 do the factors that influence ω differ between watersheds with and without human disturbance 2 what are the most important factors that influence ω in watersheds with human disturbance 3 how does the influence of these factors vary spatially to answer the three questions a geographically weighted regression model was used to investigate the spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between ω and 38 independent variables in 891 watersheds 126 reference and 765 non reference watersheds from 1950 to 2009 water years in the continental u s 2 data and methods 2 1 study area this study evaluates 891 watersheds covering a wide range of scales climate types and topographic conditions in the contiguous u s the watersheds consist of 126 reference watersheds and 765 non reference watersheds with continuous gauging records from 1950 to 2009 water years the reference and non reference watersheds are classified by the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version ii gages ii dataset falcone et al 2010a the reference watersheds have minimal human disturbance while non reference watersheds have been disturbed by human activities such as development irrigation reservoirs roadways and fragmented land the watersheds range in size from 480 km2 to 49592 km2 they also span a wide range of climate regions with a range of the aridity index from 0 3 to 5 3 the slope of these watersheds is also highly variable ranging from 0 1 to 55 8 table 1 watersheds smaller than 480 km2 were not included in the study because of the possible inaccuracies of the representation of meteorological conditions from using the 4 km prism dataset abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 the reference watersheds are generally smaller than the non reference watersheds and less variable in size table 1 2 2 budyko framework the budyko framework is a conceptual hydrological framework for estimating long term water availability several parametric forms of the budyko framework have been developed and they have similar abilities in estimating streamflow and evapotranspiration jiang et al 2015 yang et al 2008a 2008b fu s version of the budyko equation is used in this study fu 1981 in fu s equation the evaporative ratio et p is a function of the aridity index pet p and the ω parameter the equation is expressed as 1 et p 1 pet p 1 pet p ω 1 ω where et represents evapotranspiration p represents precipitation and pet represents potential evapotranspiration all three variables are at the mean annual timescale the ω controls partitioning of the water balance into input p and output et and streamflow q the ω represents the residual influence other than pet and p on water balance greve et al 2020 the ω is calibrated by minimizing the mean absolute difference between observed et p and simulated et p by using ω values ranging from 1 to 9 the budyko framework assumes that the water storage is negligible at long timescales therefore the observed et is calculated from p minus q the residual influence represented by ω is then modeled by independent variables in section 2 3 to quantify the impacts of climatic physiographic and anthropogenic factors on the water balance previous studies have applied the budyko framework in reference and non reference watersheds with varied study periods jiang et al 2015 wang and hejazi 2011 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the minimum study length was six years yang et al 2007 and the maximum length was 100 years berghuijs et al 2017 we believe our study period of 60 water years is long enough to assume that water storage is negligible s 0 only the watersheds that obey the water balance assumption p q and p q pet were used in this study precipitation data were obtained from the 4 km prism parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model an81m dataset prism climate group 2014 daily potential evapotranspiration was estimated using the hargreaves and samani equation hargreaves and samani 1982 which requires daily minimum and maximum temperature that were obtained from the 800 m topowx gridded dataset oyler et al 2015 p and pet were aggregated for each watershed at the annual timescale for the 1950 to 2009 water years streamflow data were acquired from the united states geological survey 2 3 independent variables of ω based on an extensive review of previous studies the ω parameter in the budyko equation has been shown to be related to climatic physiographic and human related variables the frequently identified variables are climate seasonality abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 shao et al 2012 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2004 vegetation coverage ning et al 2019 shao et al 2012 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2004 available water holding capacity of the soil or hydraulic conductivity abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 yang et al 2009 slope abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2009 and human related variables such as irrigated area or agricultural area bai et al 2020 bao et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 oliveira et al 2019 xing et al 2018 therefore in this study a total of 38 independent variables that represent various climatic physiographic and human related factors were considered in this study table 1 there are two climate variables relative cumulative moisture surplus rcms abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 and fraction of precipitation falling as snow sf berghuijs et al 2014 the rcms represents climate seasonality and it is calculated as rcms i 1 j a n 12 d e c p i pet i p ann w h e n p i pet i where p i and pet i are monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration p ann is the annual precipitation monthly precipitation and mean temperature were used to calculate sf using the method from dai 2008 a total of 18 physiographic variables were evaluated including soil properties vegetation topography morphology and drainage area variables no 3 18 in table 1 the soil properties are the ratio of awc to mean annual precipitation awc p abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 and average soil permeability permave the soil permeability represents the ability of soil to transmit water and is related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity used in yang et al 2009 the vegetation variables considered in this study are percentage of forest coverage forest mainstem 100 m buffer forest mains100 forest and riparian 100 m buffer forest rip100 forest in the watershed mains100 forest is the percent of forest coverage at the 100 m buffer at each side of the centerline of the main course of a river rip100 forest is the percent of forest coverage at the 100 m buffer at each side of the centerline of all streams in the watershed mains100 forest and rip100 forest have not been used in previous modeling studies but they might be important since the spatial configuration of land use has been shown to influence streamflow characteristics debbage and shepherd 2018 the topographic variables include the mean maximum minimum median and standard deviation of the watershed elevation elevation at the gage location relief ratio for the watershed shao et al 2012 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2004 mean watershed slope abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2009 mean watershed aspect sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 and mean topographic wetness index sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 the topographic wetness index is calculated from the natural logarithm of the ratio of the watershed drainage area to the tangent of the slope gradient wolock and mccabe 1995 the watershed compactness ratio is defined as the ratio of the drainage area and the square of the watershed perimeter the compactness ratio is used because it provides a morphological representation of the watershed watershed shape is shown to influence the concentration time of streamflow jung et al 2017 there are also a total of 18 variables associated with human activities in the watershed these include variables related to irrigation planted cultivated area developed area the number of dams in the watershed dam density in the watershed total dam storage in the watershed freshwater withdrawal and road density in the watershed variables no 21 38 in table 1 the freshwater withdrawal includes surface water and groundwater maupin et al 2014 these variables are chosen because land use change water use and dam construction can directly impact water availability magilligan and nislow 2005 wada et al 2014 wang and hejazi 2011 the physiographic variables and human related factors are obtained from the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version ii gages ii dataset falcone et al 2010a falcone 2011 the gages ii dataset was published by the u s geological survey usgs and developed as part of a national effort to characterize stream gauges falcone et al 2010a these data were checked using standard usgs review procedures classification of reference and non reference watersheds were determined using multiple sources of information including a gis derived hydrologic disturbance index falcone et al 2010b local expert judgment and a visual inspection of gauges using high resolution imageries and topographic maps falcone et al 2010a 2010b watershed characteristics were compiled from commonly used quality controlled national data sources such as the national land cover database national inventory of dams 100 m national elevation dataset and state soil geographic dataset a potential source of uncertainty could be the impacts of the spatial resolution of the elevation dataset on the aggregated topographic variables at watershed levels however considering the size of the watersheds 480 km2 used in this study a resolution of 100 m should be adequate another potential uncertainty may come from the accuracy of the land use and land cover classification the primary source of low accuracy of the classification is from distinguishing the context of grass wickham et al 2013 however the land use types considered in this study forests urban areas and agricultural areas have accuracies around 80 wickham et al 2013 watershed characteristics from the gages ii dataset have been successfully employed in many hydrological applications such as analyzing runoff ratio chang et al 2014 characterizing hydrologic change sawicz et al 2014 and evaluating streamflow trends rice et al 2015 therefore the gages ii dataset is considered to be reliable and appropriate for this study 2 4 ordinary least squares ols regression ols is a global regression method that assumes the relationship between dependent and independent variables is spatially stationary i e location independent ols assumes that the dependent variable and the residual of the model are normally distributed and no collinearity exists between independent variables therefore ω values were log transformed to adjust the skewed gamma distribution greve et al 2015 pairwise pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to check for collinearity between independent variables and tested at p 0 05 level the independent variables are z standardized by differencing between the variable and the mean then dividing by the standard deviation bring 1994 the purpose of this standardization is to obtain standardized beta coefficients in the ols model to compare variable importance the lm function in r was used to model ω the variance inflation factor vif was used to evaluate the collinearity of independent variables selected by the model variables that have vif higher than a threshold of 5 were removed menard 2002 both forward and backward stepwise variable selections were conducted to obtain the optimal model whose independent variables are all statistically significant p 0 05 and that has the highest adjusted r2 and the lowest mean absolute error mae the independent variables selected by the stepwise regression model are used for further spatial analysis using geographically weighted regression 2 5 geographically weighted regression gwr the gwr model is a local spatial regression model and assumes that the relationship between dependent and independent variables is spatially nonstationary or location specific gwr has been used in previous hydrological studies at a continental scale to explore the spatial controls of runoff variability chang et al 2014 minimum river discharge rennermalm et al 2012 and hydrologic responses to urbanization li et al 2020 gwr is an expanded form of simple multiple regression equation and can be expressed as 2 y x α u i v i k β i u i v i x k e i where y x is a matrix of the dependent variable as a function of a matrix of independent variable α is the regression constant at the ith location u i v i u i v i is the spatial location β i is the coefficient for the kth independent variable at the ith location u i v i x k is the kth independent variable and e i is the residual at the ith location therefore the coefficients β i s vary continuously as a function of the location gwr achieves the spatially varying coefficients by fitting equations for observations falling within a fixed or adaptive bandwidth the adaptive schemes can adjust the bandwidth according to the density of data similar to li et al 2020 an adaptive bandwidth was used in this study because the observations are not distributed evenly in the continental u s the bandwidth can be determined by cross validation cv minimization or corrected akaike information criterion aicc minimization cv minimization is generally relevant to the accuracy of the model while the aicc takes model complexity into account within each bandwidth observations closer to a given location have greater weights in estimating the coefficients than observations further away the weights matrices are created using a kernel estimator gaussian and bi square kernels are commonly used kernel estimators chang et al 2014 mohammadinia et al 2017 yacim and boshoff 2019 the two methods of determining bandwidth cv and aicc minimization and the two kernel estimators gaussian and bi square were tested to determine the optimal gwr model the model whose bandwidth is determined by cv minimization and weights matrices are determined by the bi square kernel has the highest adjusted r2 and lowest aic in both reference and non reference watersheds fig s1 this model is used in this paper the number of nearest neighbors in an adaptive bandwidth is 20 in reference watersheds and 31 in non reference watersheds the gwr analysis was conducted using the gwmodel package in r gollini et al 2013 the global moran s i index was used to test the statistical significance of the spatial autocorrelation of the ω values and the residuals of the ols and the gwr model a monte carlo test was used to test the significance of the spatial variability of the model s coefficients gwr coefficients may have local collinearity issues even if the collinearity does not show up in the ols model wheeler and tiefelsdorf 2005 thus the vif was used to evaluate local collinearity in gwr the variables that have vif 5 were removed to ensure that variables are independent at a local scale and the model form is the simplest with the fewest independent variables fig s2 although gwr allows the coefficients of the independent variables varied over space the set of independent variables is usually constant across space since it is hypothesized that the water balance in reference watersheds has different controls than in non reference watersheds the two sets of watersheds are modeled separately a flowchart showing an overview of the research design of this study is shown in fig 1 3 results 3 1 spatial patterns of ω high values of ω 3 are found in the great plains and florida and low values of ω 2 are in the northeast and northwest fig 2 these spatial patterns are consistent for both reference and non reference watersheds although the number of non reference watersheds 765 is much larger than the reference watersheds 126 the range and variability of ω values in the two sets of watersheds are similar the ω values in reference watersheds range from 1 1 to 4 0 with a mean and standard deviation of 2 2 0 5 in non reference watersheds ω values range from 1 3 to 4 1 with a mean and standard deviation of 2 2 0 4 table 1 a kolmogorov smirnov test showed that distributions of ω values from the two sets of watersheds are not statistically significantly different p 0 05 moran s i for ω is 0 19 p 0 05 in reference watersheds and 0 57 p 0 05 in non reference watersheds this indicates that the ω values of both sets of watersheds have statistically significant spatial autocorrelation 3 2 exploratory data analysis in reference watersheds ω values have the highest negative correlation with rcms r 0 74 and the highest positive correlation with awc p r 0 71 fig 3 other variables that are strongly correlated with ω r 0 7 are forest r 0 74 and rip100 forest r 0 73 in non reference watersheds rcms has the highest negative correlation with ω r 0 64 and the topographic wetness index topwet has the highest positive correlation r 0 41 fig 4 none of the variables has a r 0 7 in the non reference watersheds generally variables that have statistically significant correlations with ω are similar in the reference and non reference watersheds except for a few variables such as average soil permeability permave and relief ratio rrmean the ω in the reference watersheds has a correlation of 0 21 with permave but the correlation is not statistically significant in non reference watersheds in contrast ω in the non reference watersheds has a correlation of 0 17 with rrmean but the relationship is not statistically significant in reference watersheds the signs of the relationships are generally consistent between reference and non reference watersheds the ω is negatively correlated with rcms sf slope elevation mean max median and std forest mains100 forest rip100 forest and mains100 dev the ω is positively correlated with awc p topwet area planted cultivated lands plant mains100 plant and rip100 plant irrigation lands pct irrig ag number of dams ndams dam density ddens and developed land dev although the sign of the correlation is consistent between both sets of watersheds their magnitudes differ for example the correlation between ω and forest is 0 74 in reference watersheds and 0 58 in non reference watersheds this indicates the two types of watersheds may have somewhat different relationships and therefore should be modeled separately statistically significant correlations also exist between some of the exploratory variables variables that belong to the same category have a high correlation such as forest mains100 forest and rip100 forest the climatic variable rcms has a positive correlation with slope r 0 80 in ref and r 0 68 in non ref sf has a positive correlation with the median of watershed elevation r 0 68 in ref and r 0 71 in non ref plant has a positive correlation with topographic wetness index r 0 55 in non ref and r 0 70 in non ref the collinearity was removed by retaining only one variable from each pair that are collinear the variable was selected based on adjusted r2 aicc and mae 3 3 spatial pattern of the controls and variable importance of ω in reference watersheds the ols model shows that forest is the most important exploratory variable followed by sf table 2 both sf and forest have negative effects on ω in non reference watersheds the important exploratory variables are different from the reference watersheds relative cumulative moisture surplus rcms is the most important exploratory variable of ω followed by dam storage stor nor and riparian 100 m buffer developed land rip100 dev table 2 this demonstrates that the controls of ω vary between watersheds with and without human disturbance human activities have a pronounced impact on ω in non reference watersheds especially those related to the construction of dams and urban sprawl however even in non reference watersheds ω represents more than just human activities climate variables such as rcms also influence ω increases in stor nor tend to increase ω while increases in rcms and rip100 dev tend to decrease ω the ols model for ω has an adjusted r2 of 0 65 and an aicc value of 127 08 in reference watersheds and an adjusted r2 of 0 50 and an aicc value of 865 71 in non reference watersheds in comparison the gwr model has an adjusted r2 of 0 85 in reference watersheds and 0 80 in non reference watersheds the aicc value decreases to 194 29 in reference watersheds and 1367 57 in non reference watersheds in gwr the relationship between ω and independent variables varies across space in both types of watersheds a monte carlo mc test shows that all coefficients have statistically significant spatial non stationarity p 0 05 table 2 in reference watersheds the coefficients of sf are negative in most watersheds in the eastern half of the country but they are positive in the northeast and several states such as north dakota nebraska and texas fig 5 a for forest negative coefficients are found in most watersheds especially in the northern great plains fig 5b in the northeast and northwest coefficients of forest are positive fig 5b in non reference watersheds most watersheds have negative coefficients of rcms especially in minnesota in contrast positive coefficients of rcms are clustered in states such as illinois mississippi florida and maine fig 5c for stor nor positive coefficients are found in most watersheds they are distributed evenly across the country except in the northwest where most watersheds have negative coefficients of stor nor fig 5d for rip100 dev the western part mostly has positive coefficients while in the eastern part the number of watersheds with positive and negative coefficients is evenly split fig 5e about 80 of the watersheds 64 out of 80 in the southwest have negative coefficients of rip100 dev especially in colorado the gwr model shows that sf is the most important variable in most reference watersheds especially in the northeast and midwest a total of 42 reference watersheds have forest as the most important variable most of them are along the west coast fig 6 a a total of 506 non reference watersheds have rcms as the most important variable and they are primarily located in the eastern half of the country fig 6b this is consistent with the ols model in that rcms is the most important variable stor nor is the most important variable in 159 watersheds 21 and they are mostly located in the midwest and oregon the remaining 13 non reference watersheds have rip100 dev as the most important variable and they are in colorado idaho and parts of california 3 4 spatial pattern of local r2 the local r2 values of ω in reference watersheds are generally quite high and have a mean value of 0 87 the relatively low r2 values 0 6 are primarily found in missouri fig 7 a the modeled and observed ω have a correlation value of 0 93 p 0 05 and the mean absolute error is 0 12 as seen from the spatial pattern of the residuals actual minus predicted larger residuals tend to occur in watersheds in north dakota nebraska and california fig 7b moran s index for the ols model is 0 05 p 0 05 and for the gwr model it is 0 02 p 0 05 this indicates that the residuals in the gwr model are randomly distributed table 2 the modeled q closely matches the observed q with an mae of 26 38 mm and a mape of 9 59 fig 8 a in non reference watersheds the local r2 values of ω are generally high and have a mean value of 0 79 which is slightly lower than the mean local r2 in the reference watersheds the locations with relatively low local r2 values 0 5 are primarily found in indiana nevada and parts of california fig 7c the modeled and observed ω have a correlation value of 0 92 p 0 05 and the mean absolute error is 0 11 the high values of residual of ω occur in several watersheds in california and florida fig 7d moran s index for the ols model is 0 49 p 0 05 and decreases drastically to 0 04 p 0 05 in gwr model this indicates that the residuals in the gwr model do not exhibit spatial autocorrelation table 2 the modeled q matches the observed q with an mae of 21 14 mm and a mape of 8 70 fig 8b while the mean value of r2 values of ω in non reference watersheds is slightly lower than in reference watersheds the error in q is also lower this may be because the flow volume in reference watersheds is generally higher than in non reference watersheds mean value of 502 5 mm in ref vs 380 1 mm in non ref the same absolute difference of ω in humid and arid regions may not lead to the same absolute difference in streamflow 4 discussion 4 1 spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between ω and predictors according to the monte carlo test all the independent variables in the gwr model have statistically significant spatial heterogeneity table 2 in the reference watersheds coefficients of forest are negatively correlated with aridity index r 0 79 p 0 05 fig 9 this indicates that climate is a major controlling factor of the effects of forest coverage on streamflow arid watersheds generally have higher absolute coefficients than humid watersheds this is consistent with zhang et al 2016 who found that the budyko shape parameter is more sensitive to vegetation change in dry watersheds watersheds with positive coefficients of forest are mostly located in regions where the aridity index 1 fig 9 this indicates that in humid regions when forest coverage increases ω and the evaporative ratio increase and this reduces q p a positive correlation is also found in li et al 2013 xu et al 2013 and xing et al 2018 however most watersheds have negative coefficients for the forest variable especially when the aridity index is 1 2 yang et al 2009 also found a negative correlation between ω and vegetation coverage in 30 basins with an aridity index ranging from 1 12 to 2 60 the negative correlation suggests that decreases in ω and in e p tend to be associated with an increase in forest coverage the physical mechanisms that are responsible for these relationships are due to the interactions between vegetation coverage climate types and water cycle gan et al 2020 changes in ω can be due to changes in pet p or et p when pet p increases with an unchanged evaporative ratio et p ω decreases this causes a horizontal shift in the budyko curves fig 10 a forest coverage also decreases with increases in pet p as arid regions tend to have less forest fig 10b in this case ω has a positive correlation with forest coverage when et p increases and the evaporative ratio pet p remains unchanged ω increases this causes a vertical shift in the budyko curves fig 10a et p is negatively correlated with forest coverage when pet p 1 and it is positively correlated with forest coverage when pet p 1 fig 10c therefore in humid regions when pet p remains unchanged ω tends to have a positive correlation with forest coverage in contrast in arid regions ω tends to have a negative correlation with forest coverage in other words increases in forest coverage tend to increase et p and decrease q p in humid regions while in arid regions the opposite is true it should be noted that the influences that are discussed here are specifically focused on the variation in relationships over space since arid watersheds are more widely dispersed in the contiguous united states than humid watersheds the influence of forest coverage on water balance in arid watersheds may primarily be controlled by climate while in humid watersheds the influence may primarily be controlled by land use types most reference watersheds in this study have pet p 1 and the changes in ω are mainly due to a vertical shift in the budyko curves thus the correlation between ω and forest coverage in most reference watersheds is negative which is consistent with bai et al 2020 and abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 the decreases in forest coverage with increases in both the pet p and et p was also found by huo et al 2021 the spatial heterogeneity of coefficients of sf in the reference watersheds may be related to the threshold of the fraction of precipitation falling as snow as seen from fig 9 most watersheds 85 out of 126 have negative coefficients of sf this is consistent with berghuis et al 2014 who found a decrease in streamflow because of the precipitation shift from snow towards rain the findings in berghuis et al 2014 do not apply to watersheds with marginal sf values 15 there are also 3 out of 97 watersheds used in berghuis et al 2014 that have opposite sensitivity of q p to sf the watersheds with relatively high positive coefficients of sf 0 1 in this study have sf values smaller than 17 regions with relatively low sf values may have higher chances that the increases in sf can lead to an increase in ω and e p and a decrease in q p the mechanisms that determine the influence of sf on streamflow may be a combination of vegetation and topography and vary from watershed to watershed berghuijs et al 2014 the decreases in streamflow as a result of a reduction of sf may be associated with increases in evapotranspiration due to declines in snow cover milly and dunne 2020 or increases in atmospheric demand for water in a warming climate neto et al 2020 in non reference watersheds coefficients of rcms are negative in most watersheds except in the regions around wisconsin illinois and indiana this may be related to the climate region as seen from fig 11 watersheds that have relatively high positive coefficients of rcms are clustered around pet p 1 results in the transitional areas where pet p 1 may have greater uncertainties this is because the calculation of the rcms is based on the difference between pet and p and the two variables have similar values in the transitional areas this may explain the relatively low local r2 in regions in midwest around great lakes the negative coefficients of rcms indicate that higher values of rcms influence water balance by lowering ω values and increasing q p this is because high values of rcms represent an out of phase relationship between pet and p i e p is higher while pet is lower in this case a greater fraction of p can be converted to q instead of et wolock and mccabe 1999 stor nor and rip100 dev are two human related factors represented by ω in the gwr model in non reference watersheds the spatial distributions of their coefficients are more varied and the controlling factors require further investigation about 64 of the non reference watersheds have positive coefficients of stor nor this suggests that an increase in dam storage can increase ω and e p and decrease q p this is consistent with the discussion in wang and hejazi 2011 that evaporation can be enhanced due to increases in the surface area of water bodies for rip100 dev about half of the watersheds have negative coefficients the negative coefficients mean that increases in developed land in the riparian zone can decrease ω and e p and increase q p the impacts of urban sprawl on increases in streamflow is also observed in previous studies in regions that have negative coefficients of rip100 dev such as in texas olivera and defee 2007 the charlanta megaregion debbage and shepherd 2018 and colorado bhaskar et al 2020 the increasing impacts on streamflow are likely due to increases in impervious areas and decreases in infiltration the positive coefficients may be associated with other processes during urbanization such as cross basin transfers of public and or sewer water oudin et al 2018 different signs of the coefficients of developed land are also observed in li et al 2020 using the gwr model in exploring the impacts of urbanization on hydrology elevation may be a controlling factor of the importance of rip100 dev as shown in the relationship between absolute values of the coefficients of rip100 dev and the mean elevation in the watershed the importance of rip100 dev increases with elevation r 0 71 fig 10 this indicates that there may be a confounding effect between developed land and topography urban expansion in high elevation regions may have a greater impact on runoff generation than in low lying regions debbage and shepherd 2018 also found that clustering impervious surfaces in source areas of the watershed played an important role in increasing high flow frequency 4 2 bivariate relationship low values of ω characterize conditions where precipitation is quickly converted to runoff while high values of ω characterize a high ratio of et to p dingman 2015 this section discusses the possible physical mechanisms that are responsible for the relationship between ω and the variables that are not discussed in section 4 1 physiographic variables that have statistically significant negative correlations with ω include slope elevation and watershed compactness ratio the slope has a negative correlation with ω because p is quickly converted to q in steeply sloping watersheds leading to a smaller value of ω this is consistent with abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 and yang et al 2007 elevation has a similar physical mechanism influencing ω and the negative correlation we found is consistent with the results of xu et al 2013 the watershed compactness ratio represents the watershed shape and its bivariate relationship with ω was not explored in previous studies a high value of the compactness ratio means a more compact and regular shape of a watershed such as a circle or a rectangle bogaert et al 2000 which leads to a shorter concentration time of flow a faster conversion from p to q and a smaller value of ω physiographic variables that are positively correlated with ω include awc p topographic wetness index drainage area and relief ratio a higher ratio of awc p characterizes greater subsurface storage which reduces the conversion from p to q and increases the value of ω abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 xing et al 2018 yang et al 2007 the topographic wetness index measures the long term soil moisture availability kopecký and čížková 2010 and thus as it increases so does potential et and the value of ω drainage area has a similar physical mechanism influencing ω and a positive correlation was also found in xu et al 2013 high values of the relief ratio characterize broad and level surfaces with several depressions pike and wilson 1971 reducing q potential and increasing the ω value a negative correlation between relief ratio and ω was found in xing et al 2018 but their relief ratio was calculated as the ratio of the difference between the maximum and minimum elevations and the longest flow path high values of the relief ratio in xing et al 2018 represent a larger elevation change per unit length of the river which is the opposite topographic conditions from the level surfaces indicated by the high relief ratio used in this study in this study relief ratio is calculated as the ratio of the difference between mean and minimum elevation and the difference between maximum and minimum elevation table 1 therefore our results agree with theirs positive correlations were found between most human related variables and ω for example ω is positively correlated with planted cultivated land which is consistent with previous studies bao et al 2019 han et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 the physical mechanism may be because the irrigation in the planted cultivated land leads to the enhanced et wang and hejazi 2011 4 3 implications limitations and future studies this study has implications for integrated watershed management at the local scale our study found that in reference watersheds the impacts of forest coverage is more important in dry regions than in wet regions this indicates that changes in forest coverage in water limited regions should be undertaken with caution because they can have a dramatic impact on et and q in non reference watersheds rip100 dev is the most important human related variable this indicates that these watersheds are particularly sensitive to development in riparian areas local water resources managers should carefully consider the spatial location and type of development that takes place in the watersheds especially development in proximity to streams in addition the importance of rip100 dev increases with elevation watershed managers and city planners should be cautious about expanding urban areas in high elevation areas expansion of impervious surfaces in regions with high elevation can lead to a shorter concentration time and greater streamflow since this study identifies the most important variable in each watershed this can be used to identify where water resources management efforts should be focused overall we demonstrated that there are statistically significantly variations in terms of which variable has the strongest influence on the water balance in the contiguous united states this indicates that effective water resources management should consider the local climate land use types and topographic conditions and that a one size fits all approach to water management will not be effective although this study considers a comprehensive list of climatic physiographic and human related independent variables not all possible independent variables are included for example the average storm depth was found to be important for explaining ω in previous studies shao et al 2012 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2004 but it was not considered in this study even though it is not included as an independent variable the performance of the current gwr model adjusted r2 0 85 for reference and 0 80 for non reference watersheds is reasonable for analyzing the spatial heterogeneity in the controls of streamflow storm depth is also likely correlated with other climate variables such as rcms in addition climate seasonality can be represented by multiple variables such as milly s index milly 1994 the seasonality index developed by walsh and lawler 1981 precipitation seasonality developed by markham 1970 and relative cumulative moisture surplus wolock and mccabe 1999 this study only uses rcms because of its simple calculation and the strong correlation with ω reported by abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 future studies could consider other measures of seasonality gwr assumes no collinearity among the independent variables in the model wheeler 2019 therefore this study removed variables where the local vif 5 for example the original best global multiple regression model of ω in reference watersheds is ω exp 0 09 rcms 0 08 sf 0 08 elev median 0 10 forest the adjusted r2 is 0 76 and all the variables have vif 5 however if all four variables are used in the gwr model many local observations have vif 5 this is because local collinearity effects can be present even when no global collinearity is detected wheeler 2007 the absence of collinearity in the global regression model is not a reliable indicator for the absence of local collinearity wheeler 2007 to deal with this issue we removed variables that lead to local vif 5 in both gwr and the counterpart ols model the final gwr model has all the observations with local vif 5 fig s2 and the best set of model performance measures r2 aic and mae removing variables is a simple and effective way to address local collinearity this study provides reasonably good performance of the gwr model and uncovers the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between ω and dominant independent variables future studies may consider using penalized versions of gwr such as the geographically weighted ridge regression gwrr to retain all the variables in the global regression model while properly addressing local collinearity issues the gwr model can accurately predict ω values and it has an adjusted r2 of 0 85 in reference watersheds this is higher than the r2 of 0 812 obtained from a generalized additive model in 211 reference watersheds in the continental u s abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 also validated their model in an independent set of watersheds and had an r2 of 0 65 this study does not validate the gwr model because it focuses on exploring the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between ω and the environmental predictors future studies can compare the accuracy of the gwr model with other modeling methods using validation watersheds for prediction purposes although the gwr model has good model accuracy there are regions with relatively low values of local r2 such as non reference watersheds in indiana ohio and michigan the regions may have important independent variables in explaining ω other than rcms stor nor and rip100 dev identified in this study such as irrigation agriculture or planted cultivated land percentage wang and hejazi 2011 future studies can conduct separate modeling at regional scales to improve the model accuracy 5 conclusions this study improves our understanding of the controls of surface water balance by uncovering the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between budyko shape parameter ω and environmental variables the spatial varying relationships help to clarify the relative importance of forest coverage as a function of climate human related variables were also considered this is an improvement over previous studies that only considered climatic and physiographic variables a geographically weighted regression model was used to identify the set of variables that best explain the spatial variability of ω in 126 reference and 765 non reference watersheds in the contiguous u s an ordinary least squares model was used to uncover the global relationship between the ω and the same set of environmental predictors our new findings are as follows 1 the representations of ω are different in reference and non reference watersheds in reference watersheds ω is represented by precipitation falling as snow and forest coverage in non reference watersheds ω is represented by relative cumulative moisture surplus normal dam storage and riparian developed land the gwr model explains 85 of the variability in ω in reference watersheds and 80 of the variability ω in non reference watersheds 2 in non reference watersheds human disturbance primarily consists of dam construction and urbanization dam storage is the most important variable in 21 of non reference watersheds most of them are in parts of the midwest and oregon riparian developed land is more important in 13 of non reference watersheds and they are mostly in colorado idaho and parts of california 3 there are statistically significant spatial variations in the relationship between ω and the independent variables p 0 05 in reference watersheds climate is a dominant factor controlling the spatial heterogeneity of coefficients of forest coverage the relative importance of forest coverage is higher in dry watersheds than in humid watersheds in non reference watersheds the spatial patterns of coefficients of dam storage and riparian developed land are more varied the impact of riparian developed land on streamflow increases with elevation r 0 71 the spatially varying importance of environmental and anthropogenic predictors identified in this study can be used for guiding local water resources management watershed managers and city planners should be cautious about changing forest coverage in reference watersheds in dry regions and expanding riparian developed areas in non reference watersheds in high elevation areas this study identifies the most important variables other than precipitation that control local water availability national watershed management strategies should be adapted at the local scale to reflect these spatially varying relationships credit authorship

4275,understanding how precipitation is partitioned into evapotranspiration and streamflow is important for assessing water availability in the budyko framework this partitioning is quantified through the ω parameter previous studies have modeled the physical representation of ω however the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between ω and the variables that it represents has not been investigated this study uses a geographically weighted regression model to identify spatial variations in the factors that control the water balance in 126 reference watersheds with minimal human disturbance and 765 non reference watersheds in the continental united states results show that snowfall and forest coverage are important predictors of ω in the reference watersheds relative cumulative moisture surplus dam storage and developed land in riparian areas are important predictors in non reference watersheds climate is a primary control of the relative importance of forest coverage the importance of forest coverage is greater in arid watersheds than in humid watersheds snowfall is more important than forest coverage in the northeast and midwest this study demonstrates that dam construction and urban sprawl have a significant impact in non reference watersheds dam storage is the most important predictor in 21 of the non reference watersheds and riparian developed land is more important in 13 of the non reference watersheds overall there are statistically significant relationships between climatic physiographic and human related factors and the ω parameter the spatial variations in the relationship quantified in this study can help to improve regional watershed management keywords streamflow budyko spatial heterogeneity geographically weighted regression ordinary least squares regression 1 introduction understanding how precipitation is partitioned into evapotranspiration and streamflow is important for understanding global and regional water availability climate variability watershed physiographic characteristics and anthropogenic activities can substantially impact the surface water balance berghuijs et al 2017 gentine et al 2012 quantification of the relative importance of these factors is critical for improving water resources management and decision making process based hydrological models are one method of quantifying the impacts of these factors dey and mishra 2017 however it can be time consuming to apply these models across many watersheds due to the labor intensive model calibration process fatichi et al 2016 in the last decade a conceptual hydrological framework known as the budyko framework has been successfully applied for many applications such as quantifying runoff sensitivity berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2016 renner et al 2012 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 unravelling the effects of climate and anthropogenic factors on streamflow jiang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 patterson et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 wang et al 2020 modeling streamflow and evapotranspiration abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 chen et al 2013 fang et al 2016 nayak et al 2020 and improving the calibration of global hydrological models greve et al 2020 the advantages of the budyko framework are multifold first it is physically based the budyko hypothesis relates the evaporative ratio et p to the aridity index pet p the relationship is constrained by the energy limit when pet equals to et and the water limit when et equals to p the second advantage is that it has a low computational cost making it more efficient to apply over a large number of watersheds to examine spatial variability abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 padrón et al 2017 xu et al 2013 lastly it has fewer data requirements than process based hydrological models making it preferable for applications over longer time periods and larger spatial scales in the version of the budyko framework that is known as fu s equation fu 1981 long term streamflow is simulated using mean annual precipitation p mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet and other factors that are represented by the shape parameter ω the ω parameter is used to partition the water balance input precipitation and output evapotranspiration and streamflow however it does not have a specific physical meaning abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 previous studies have explored the meaning of ω and related it to climatic factors such as seasonality storminess and snowfall conditions as well as watershed characteristics for example potter et al 2005 found that for a given aridity index the ratio of mean annual e to p was larger when p and pet were in phase when higher temperatures coincide with higher moisture surplus this can increase evapotranspiration abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 found a significant negative correlation between ω and the seasonal asynchronicity between p and pet the importance of seasonality or synchronicity in p and pet was also emphasized by milly 1994 wolock and mccabe 1999 shao et al 2012 and xing et al 2018 snowfall is another climate related element that can affect the water balance using the budyko framework berghuijs et al 2014 found that streamflow is likely to decrease when precipitation shifts from snowfall to rainfall this is consistent with a negative correlation between ω and the fraction of precipitation falling as snow shown in abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 finally storminess such as average storm depth and storm frequency has also been shown to influence ω donohue et al 2012 shao et al 2012 xing et al 2018 yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2004 watershed characteristics such as vegetation soil properties and topography can also influence ω vegetation related variables that can change ω include vegetation coverage and vegetation type abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 chen et al 2020 donohue et al 2007 2010 li et al 2013 shao et al 2012 sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 for example yang et al 2008a found a significant correlation between the curve parameter η which is a shape parameter of choudhury s equation and the leaf area index forested watersheds have a higher ω than grassland dominated watersheds because they typically have greater evapotranspiration zhang et al 2004 soil related variables such as saturated hydraulic conductivity and available water holding capacity can also impact ω abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 donohue et al 2012 yang et al 2007 for example the ratio of available water capacity to precipitation has been shown to have a statistically significant positive correlation with ω as available plant water regulates the available water for q abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 watershed topography variables such as slope aspect relief ratio and elevation have also been found to influence ω abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 shao et al 2012 sinha et al 2019 xing et al 2018 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2007 2009 for example slope is negatively correlated with ω because watersheds with steeper slopes tend to have higher runoff abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 yang et al 2007 2009 human activities such as the modification of land use land cover urbanization and irrigation have been observed to alter the hydrological cycle worldwide debbage and shepherd 2018 destouni et al 2013 rodell et al 2018 although the non parametric budyko framework was initially developed for large scale watersheds with minimal human interference the parametric budyko framework such as the fu s equation fu 1981 can be applied to human impacted watersheds liang et al 2015 patterson et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 some recent studies have attempted to directly relate ω to factors such as irrigated area cultivated land area percentage of farmland and population bai et al 2020 bao et al 2019 han et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 xing et al 2018 a positive correlation between ω and irrigated areas was found in 96 watersheds in china xing et al 2018 this is also found in sub watersheds of the yellow river basin in china bao et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 in the united states human activities have been found to have greater impacts on streamflow than climate change in the high plains and western u s wang and hejazi 2011 however it is unclear which specific human related factors are dominant and how they vary regionally abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 modeled ω in hdcn and mopex watersheds in the continental u s and found that it was strongly influenced by climate factors soil characteristics and watershed topography they pointed out that their model performed slightly worse in the mopex watersheds because the watersheds are influenced by irrigation and land use changes abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 the impacts of human activities on the hydrological cycle have been observed in many regions in the continental u s such as the northeast hodgkins et al 2019 midwest kelly et al 2016 and southeast debbage and shepherd 2018 therefore it is important to identify how human disturbance influences ω in these watersheds previous studies have evaluated how multiple factors control ω concurrently abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 donohue et al 2012 li et al 2013 xing et al 2018 xu et al 2013 for example xu et al 2013 used a multiple linear regression model and a neural network model in the mopex watersheds and 32 global watersheds they found that most of the variance in ω can be explained by geographic locations normalized difference vegetation index ndvi slope and elevation at the continental scale abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 used a generalized additive model to model ω in 382 watersheds in the continental u s they found that climate seasonality snow fraction the ratio of available water capacity to precipitation and slope can explain 81 2 of the variability in ω xing et al 2018 used a multivariate adaptive regression spline model to simulate η in choudhury s equation in 96 watersheds in china they found that the three most influential factors were average storm depth vegetation coverage and precipitation seasonality they also found significant interaction effects from cultivated land irrigation drought and precipitation variability despite excellent prior work modeling ω in different locations around the world the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between ω and the independent variables has not been studied a negative correlation between ω and ndvi was found in a total of 211 hcdn watersheds in the u s abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 and 286 watersheds in china bai et al 2020 however a positive correlation between ω and ndvi was found in 224 mopex watersheds in the u s xu et al 2013 26 global watersheds li et al 2013 and 96 watersheds in china xing et al 2018 the contrasting relationship between ω and vegetation coverage was also shown by yang et al 2009 in china and sinha et al 2019 in india bao et al 2019 found no significant correlation between ω and forest coverage in a watershed in china the findings of these previous studies indicate that there may be spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between ω and explanatory variables a generalized model may not be helpful for uncovering the relationship the lack of consideration of human related factors and spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between ω and environmental variables may hinder our understanding of ω motivated by this research gap three research questions are answered in this study 1 do the factors that influence ω differ between watersheds with and without human disturbance 2 what are the most important factors that influence ω in watersheds with human disturbance 3 how does the influence of these factors vary spatially to answer the three questions a geographically weighted regression model was used to investigate the spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between ω and 38 independent variables in 891 watersheds 126 reference and 765 non reference watersheds from 1950 to 2009 water years in the continental u s 2 data and methods 2 1 study area this study evaluates 891 watersheds covering a wide range of scales climate types and topographic conditions in the contiguous u s the watersheds consist of 126 reference watersheds and 765 non reference watersheds with continuous gauging records from 1950 to 2009 water years the reference and non reference watersheds are classified by the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version ii gages ii dataset falcone et al 2010a the reference watersheds have minimal human disturbance while non reference watersheds have been disturbed by human activities such as development irrigation reservoirs roadways and fragmented land the watersheds range in size from 480 km2 to 49592 km2 they also span a wide range of climate regions with a range of the aridity index from 0 3 to 5 3 the slope of these watersheds is also highly variable ranging from 0 1 to 55 8 table 1 watersheds smaller than 480 km2 were not included in the study because of the possible inaccuracies of the representation of meteorological conditions from using the 4 km prism dataset abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 the reference watersheds are generally smaller than the non reference watersheds and less variable in size table 1 2 2 budyko framework the budyko framework is a conceptual hydrological framework for estimating long term water availability several parametric forms of the budyko framework have been developed and they have similar abilities in estimating streamflow and evapotranspiration jiang et al 2015 yang et al 2008a 2008b fu s version of the budyko equation is used in this study fu 1981 in fu s equation the evaporative ratio et p is a function of the aridity index pet p and the ω parameter the equation is expressed as 1 et p 1 pet p 1 pet p ω 1 ω where et represents evapotranspiration p represents precipitation and pet represents potential evapotranspiration all three variables are at the mean annual timescale the ω controls partitioning of the water balance into input p and output et and streamflow q the ω represents the residual influence other than pet and p on water balance greve et al 2020 the ω is calibrated by minimizing the mean absolute difference between observed et p and simulated et p by using ω values ranging from 1 to 9 the budyko framework assumes that the water storage is negligible at long timescales therefore the observed et is calculated from p minus q the residual influence represented by ω is then modeled by independent variables in section 2 3 to quantify the impacts of climatic physiographic and anthropogenic factors on the water balance previous studies have applied the budyko framework in reference and non reference watersheds with varied study periods jiang et al 2015 wang and hejazi 2011 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the minimum study length was six years yang et al 2007 and the maximum length was 100 years berghuijs et al 2017 we believe our study period of 60 water years is long enough to assume that water storage is negligible s 0 only the watersheds that obey the water balance assumption p q and p q pet were used in this study precipitation data were obtained from the 4 km prism parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model an81m dataset prism climate group 2014 daily potential evapotranspiration was estimated using the hargreaves and samani equation hargreaves and samani 1982 which requires daily minimum and maximum temperature that were obtained from the 800 m topowx gridded dataset oyler et al 2015 p and pet were aggregated for each watershed at the annual timescale for the 1950 to 2009 water years streamflow data were acquired from the united states geological survey 2 3 independent variables of ω based on an extensive review of previous studies the ω parameter in the budyko equation has been shown to be related to climatic physiographic and human related variables the frequently identified variables are climate seasonality abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 shao et al 2012 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2004 vegetation coverage ning et al 2019 shao et al 2012 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2004 available water holding capacity of the soil or hydraulic conductivity abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 yang et al 2009 slope abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2009 and human related variables such as irrigated area or agricultural area bai et al 2020 bao et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 oliveira et al 2019 xing et al 2018 therefore in this study a total of 38 independent variables that represent various climatic physiographic and human related factors were considered in this study table 1 there are two climate variables relative cumulative moisture surplus rcms abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 and fraction of precipitation falling as snow sf berghuijs et al 2014 the rcms represents climate seasonality and it is calculated as rcms i 1 j a n 12 d e c p i pet i p ann w h e n p i pet i where p i and pet i are monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration p ann is the annual precipitation monthly precipitation and mean temperature were used to calculate sf using the method from dai 2008 a total of 18 physiographic variables were evaluated including soil properties vegetation topography morphology and drainage area variables no 3 18 in table 1 the soil properties are the ratio of awc to mean annual precipitation awc p abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 and average soil permeability permave the soil permeability represents the ability of soil to transmit water and is related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity used in yang et al 2009 the vegetation variables considered in this study are percentage of forest coverage forest mainstem 100 m buffer forest mains100 forest and riparian 100 m buffer forest rip100 forest in the watershed mains100 forest is the percent of forest coverage at the 100 m buffer at each side of the centerline of the main course of a river rip100 forest is the percent of forest coverage at the 100 m buffer at each side of the centerline of all streams in the watershed mains100 forest and rip100 forest have not been used in previous modeling studies but they might be important since the spatial configuration of land use has been shown to influence streamflow characteristics debbage and shepherd 2018 the topographic variables include the mean maximum minimum median and standard deviation of the watershed elevation elevation at the gage location relief ratio for the watershed shao et al 2012 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2004 mean watershed slope abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2009 mean watershed aspect sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 and mean topographic wetness index sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 the topographic wetness index is calculated from the natural logarithm of the ratio of the watershed drainage area to the tangent of the slope gradient wolock and mccabe 1995 the watershed compactness ratio is defined as the ratio of the drainage area and the square of the watershed perimeter the compactness ratio is used because it provides a morphological representation of the watershed watershed shape is shown to influence the concentration time of streamflow jung et al 2017 there are also a total of 18 variables associated with human activities in the watershed these include variables related to irrigation planted cultivated area developed area the number of dams in the watershed dam density in the watershed total dam storage in the watershed freshwater withdrawal and road density in the watershed variables no 21 38 in table 1 the freshwater withdrawal includes surface water and groundwater maupin et al 2014 these variables are chosen because land use change water use and dam construction can directly impact water availability magilligan and nislow 2005 wada et al 2014 wang and hejazi 2011 the physiographic variables and human related factors are obtained from the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version ii gages ii dataset falcone et al 2010a falcone 2011 the gages ii dataset was published by the u s geological survey usgs and developed as part of a national effort to characterize stream gauges falcone et al 2010a these data were checked using standard usgs review procedures classification of reference and non reference watersheds were determined using multiple sources of information including a gis derived hydrologic disturbance index falcone et al 2010b local expert judgment and a visual inspection of gauges using high resolution imageries and topographic maps falcone et al 2010a 2010b watershed characteristics were compiled from commonly used quality controlled national data sources such as the national land cover database national inventory of dams 100 m national elevation dataset and state soil geographic dataset a potential source of uncertainty could be the impacts of the spatial resolution of the elevation dataset on the aggregated topographic variables at watershed levels however considering the size of the watersheds 480 km2 used in this study a resolution of 100 m should be adequate another potential uncertainty may come from the accuracy of the land use and land cover classification the primary source of low accuracy of the classification is from distinguishing the context of grass wickham et al 2013 however the land use types considered in this study forests urban areas and agricultural areas have accuracies around 80 wickham et al 2013 watershed characteristics from the gages ii dataset have been successfully employed in many hydrological applications such as analyzing runoff ratio chang et al 2014 characterizing hydrologic change sawicz et al 2014 and evaluating streamflow trends rice et al 2015 therefore the gages ii dataset is considered to be reliable and appropriate for this study 2 4 ordinary least squares ols regression ols is a global regression method that assumes the relationship between dependent and independent variables is spatially stationary i e location independent ols assumes that the dependent variable and the residual of the model are normally distributed and no collinearity exists between independent variables therefore ω values were log transformed to adjust the skewed gamma distribution greve et al 2015 pairwise pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to check for collinearity between independent variables and tested at p 0 05 level the independent variables are z standardized by differencing between the variable and the mean then dividing by the standard deviation bring 1994 the purpose of this standardization is to obtain standardized beta coefficients in the ols model to compare variable importance the lm function in r was used to model ω the variance inflation factor vif was used to evaluate the collinearity of independent variables selected by the model variables that have vif higher than a threshold of 5 were removed menard 2002 both forward and backward stepwise variable selections were conducted to obtain the optimal model whose independent variables are all statistically significant p 0 05 and that has the highest adjusted r2 and the lowest mean absolute error mae the independent variables selected by the stepwise regression model are used for further spatial analysis using geographically weighted regression 2 5 geographically weighted regression gwr the gwr model is a local spatial regression model and assumes that the relationship between dependent and independent variables is spatially nonstationary or location specific gwr has been used in previous hydrological studies at a continental scale to explore the spatial controls of runoff variability chang et al 2014 minimum river discharge rennermalm et al 2012 and hydrologic responses to urbanization li et al 2020 gwr is an expanded form of simple multiple regression equation and can be expressed as 2 y x α u i v i k β i u i v i x k e i where y x is a matrix of the dependent variable as a function of a matrix of independent variable α is the regression constant at the ith location u i v i u i v i is the spatial location β i is the coefficient for the kth independent variable at the ith location u i v i x k is the kth independent variable and e i is the residual at the ith location therefore the coefficients β i s vary continuously as a function of the location gwr achieves the spatially varying coefficients by fitting equations for observations falling within a fixed or adaptive bandwidth the adaptive schemes can adjust the bandwidth according to the density of data similar to li et al 2020 an adaptive bandwidth was used in this study because the observations are not distributed evenly in the continental u s the bandwidth can be determined by cross validation cv minimization or corrected akaike information criterion aicc minimization cv minimization is generally relevant to the accuracy of the model while the aicc takes model complexity into account within each bandwidth observations closer to a given location have greater weights in estimating the coefficients than observations further away the weights matrices are created using a kernel estimator gaussian and bi square kernels are commonly used kernel estimators chang et al 2014 mohammadinia et al 2017 yacim and boshoff 2019 the two methods of determining bandwidth cv and aicc minimization and the two kernel estimators gaussian and bi square were tested to determine the optimal gwr model the model whose bandwidth is determined by cv minimization and weights matrices are determined by the bi square kernel has the highest adjusted r2 and lowest aic in both reference and non reference watersheds fig s1 this model is used in this paper the number of nearest neighbors in an adaptive bandwidth is 20 in reference watersheds and 31 in non reference watersheds the gwr analysis was conducted using the gwmodel package in r gollini et al 2013 the global moran s i index was used to test the statistical significance of the spatial autocorrelation of the ω values and the residuals of the ols and the gwr model a monte carlo test was used to test the significance of the spatial variability of the model s coefficients gwr coefficients may have local collinearity issues even if the collinearity does not show up in the ols model wheeler and tiefelsdorf 2005 thus the vif was used to evaluate local collinearity in gwr the variables that have vif 5 were removed to ensure that variables are independent at a local scale and the model form is the simplest with the fewest independent variables fig s2 although gwr allows the coefficients of the independent variables varied over space the set of independent variables is usually constant across space since it is hypothesized that the water balance in reference watersheds has different controls than in non reference watersheds the two sets of watersheds are modeled separately a flowchart showing an overview of the research design of this study is shown in fig 1 3 results 3 1 spatial patterns of ω high values of ω 3 are found in the great plains and florida and low values of ω 2 are in the northeast and northwest fig 2 these spatial patterns are consistent for both reference and non reference watersheds although the number of non reference watersheds 765 is much larger than the reference watersheds 126 the range and variability of ω values in the two sets of watersheds are similar the ω values in reference watersheds range from 1 1 to 4 0 with a mean and standard deviation of 2 2 0 5 in non reference watersheds ω values range from 1 3 to 4 1 with a mean and standard deviation of 2 2 0 4 table 1 a kolmogorov smirnov test showed that distributions of ω values from the two sets of watersheds are not statistically significantly different p 0 05 moran s i for ω is 0 19 p 0 05 in reference watersheds and 0 57 p 0 05 in non reference watersheds this indicates that the ω values of both sets of watersheds have statistically significant spatial autocorrelation 3 2 exploratory data analysis in reference watersheds ω values have the highest negative correlation with rcms r 0 74 and the highest positive correlation with awc p r 0 71 fig 3 other variables that are strongly correlated with ω r 0 7 are forest r 0 74 and rip100 forest r 0 73 in non reference watersheds rcms has the highest negative correlation with ω r 0 64 and the topographic wetness index topwet has the highest positive correlation r 0 41 fig 4 none of the variables has a r 0 7 in the non reference watersheds generally variables that have statistically significant correlations with ω are similar in the reference and non reference watersheds except for a few variables such as average soil permeability permave and relief ratio rrmean the ω in the reference watersheds has a correlation of 0 21 with permave but the correlation is not statistically significant in non reference watersheds in contrast ω in the non reference watersheds has a correlation of 0 17 with rrmean but the relationship is not statistically significant in reference watersheds the signs of the relationships are generally consistent between reference and non reference watersheds the ω is negatively correlated with rcms sf slope elevation mean max median and std forest mains100 forest rip100 forest and mains100 dev the ω is positively correlated with awc p topwet area planted cultivated lands plant mains100 plant and rip100 plant irrigation lands pct irrig ag number of dams ndams dam density ddens and developed land dev although the sign of the correlation is consistent between both sets of watersheds their magnitudes differ for example the correlation between ω and forest is 0 74 in reference watersheds and 0 58 in non reference watersheds this indicates the two types of watersheds may have somewhat different relationships and therefore should be modeled separately statistically significant correlations also exist between some of the exploratory variables variables that belong to the same category have a high correlation such as forest mains100 forest and rip100 forest the climatic variable rcms has a positive correlation with slope r 0 80 in ref and r 0 68 in non ref sf has a positive correlation with the median of watershed elevation r 0 68 in ref and r 0 71 in non ref plant has a positive correlation with topographic wetness index r 0 55 in non ref and r 0 70 in non ref the collinearity was removed by retaining only one variable from each pair that are collinear the variable was selected based on adjusted r2 aicc and mae 3 3 spatial pattern of the controls and variable importance of ω in reference watersheds the ols model shows that forest is the most important exploratory variable followed by sf table 2 both sf and forest have negative effects on ω in non reference watersheds the important exploratory variables are different from the reference watersheds relative cumulative moisture surplus rcms is the most important exploratory variable of ω followed by dam storage stor nor and riparian 100 m buffer developed land rip100 dev table 2 this demonstrates that the controls of ω vary between watersheds with and without human disturbance human activities have a pronounced impact on ω in non reference watersheds especially those related to the construction of dams and urban sprawl however even in non reference watersheds ω represents more than just human activities climate variables such as rcms also influence ω increases in stor nor tend to increase ω while increases in rcms and rip100 dev tend to decrease ω the ols model for ω has an adjusted r2 of 0 65 and an aicc value of 127 08 in reference watersheds and an adjusted r2 of 0 50 and an aicc value of 865 71 in non reference watersheds in comparison the gwr model has an adjusted r2 of 0 85 in reference watersheds and 0 80 in non reference watersheds the aicc value decreases to 194 29 in reference watersheds and 1367 57 in non reference watersheds in gwr the relationship between ω and independent variables varies across space in both types of watersheds a monte carlo mc test shows that all coefficients have statistically significant spatial non stationarity p 0 05 table 2 in reference watersheds the coefficients of sf are negative in most watersheds in the eastern half of the country but they are positive in the northeast and several states such as north dakota nebraska and texas fig 5 a for forest negative coefficients are found in most watersheds especially in the northern great plains fig 5b in the northeast and northwest coefficients of forest are positive fig 5b in non reference watersheds most watersheds have negative coefficients of rcms especially in minnesota in contrast positive coefficients of rcms are clustered in states such as illinois mississippi florida and maine fig 5c for stor nor positive coefficients are found in most watersheds they are distributed evenly across the country except in the northwest where most watersheds have negative coefficients of stor nor fig 5d for rip100 dev the western part mostly has positive coefficients while in the eastern part the number of watersheds with positive and negative coefficients is evenly split fig 5e about 80 of the watersheds 64 out of 80 in the southwest have negative coefficients of rip100 dev especially in colorado the gwr model shows that sf is the most important variable in most reference watersheds especially in the northeast and midwest a total of 42 reference watersheds have forest as the most important variable most of them are along the west coast fig 6 a a total of 506 non reference watersheds have rcms as the most important variable and they are primarily located in the eastern half of the country fig 6b this is consistent with the ols model in that rcms is the most important variable stor nor is the most important variable in 159 watersheds 21 and they are mostly located in the midwest and oregon the remaining 13 non reference watersheds have rip100 dev as the most important variable and they are in colorado idaho and parts of california 3 4 spatial pattern of local r2 the local r2 values of ω in reference watersheds are generally quite high and have a mean value of 0 87 the relatively low r2 values 0 6 are primarily found in missouri fig 7 a the modeled and observed ω have a correlation value of 0 93 p 0 05 and the mean absolute error is 0 12 as seen from the spatial pattern of the residuals actual minus predicted larger residuals tend to occur in watersheds in north dakota nebraska and california fig 7b moran s index for the ols model is 0 05 p 0 05 and for the gwr model it is 0 02 p 0 05 this indicates that the residuals in the gwr model are randomly distributed table 2 the modeled q closely matches the observed q with an mae of 26 38 mm and a mape of 9 59 fig 8 a in non reference watersheds the local r2 values of ω are generally high and have a mean value of 0 79 which is slightly lower than the mean local r2 in the reference watersheds the locations with relatively low local r2 values 0 5 are primarily found in indiana nevada and parts of california fig 7c the modeled and observed ω have a correlation value of 0 92 p 0 05 and the mean absolute error is 0 11 the high values of residual of ω occur in several watersheds in california and florida fig 7d moran s index for the ols model is 0 49 p 0 05 and decreases drastically to 0 04 p 0 05 in gwr model this indicates that the residuals in the gwr model do not exhibit spatial autocorrelation table 2 the modeled q matches the observed q with an mae of 21 14 mm and a mape of 8 70 fig 8b while the mean value of r2 values of ω in non reference watersheds is slightly lower than in reference watersheds the error in q is also lower this may be because the flow volume in reference watersheds is generally higher than in non reference watersheds mean value of 502 5 mm in ref vs 380 1 mm in non ref the same absolute difference of ω in humid and arid regions may not lead to the same absolute difference in streamflow 4 discussion 4 1 spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between ω and predictors according to the monte carlo test all the independent variables in the gwr model have statistically significant spatial heterogeneity table 2 in the reference watersheds coefficients of forest are negatively correlated with aridity index r 0 79 p 0 05 fig 9 this indicates that climate is a major controlling factor of the effects of forest coverage on streamflow arid watersheds generally have higher absolute coefficients than humid watersheds this is consistent with zhang et al 2016 who found that the budyko shape parameter is more sensitive to vegetation change in dry watersheds watersheds with positive coefficients of forest are mostly located in regions where the aridity index 1 fig 9 this indicates that in humid regions when forest coverage increases ω and the evaporative ratio increase and this reduces q p a positive correlation is also found in li et al 2013 xu et al 2013 and xing et al 2018 however most watersheds have negative coefficients for the forest variable especially when the aridity index is 1 2 yang et al 2009 also found a negative correlation between ω and vegetation coverage in 30 basins with an aridity index ranging from 1 12 to 2 60 the negative correlation suggests that decreases in ω and in e p tend to be associated with an increase in forest coverage the physical mechanisms that are responsible for these relationships are due to the interactions between vegetation coverage climate types and water cycle gan et al 2020 changes in ω can be due to changes in pet p or et p when pet p increases with an unchanged evaporative ratio et p ω decreases this causes a horizontal shift in the budyko curves fig 10 a forest coverage also decreases with increases in pet p as arid regions tend to have less forest fig 10b in this case ω has a positive correlation with forest coverage when et p increases and the evaporative ratio pet p remains unchanged ω increases this causes a vertical shift in the budyko curves fig 10a et p is negatively correlated with forest coverage when pet p 1 and it is positively correlated with forest coverage when pet p 1 fig 10c therefore in humid regions when pet p remains unchanged ω tends to have a positive correlation with forest coverage in contrast in arid regions ω tends to have a negative correlation with forest coverage in other words increases in forest coverage tend to increase et p and decrease q p in humid regions while in arid regions the opposite is true it should be noted that the influences that are discussed here are specifically focused on the variation in relationships over space since arid watersheds are more widely dispersed in the contiguous united states than humid watersheds the influence of forest coverage on water balance in arid watersheds may primarily be controlled by climate while in humid watersheds the influence may primarily be controlled by land use types most reference watersheds in this study have pet p 1 and the changes in ω are mainly due to a vertical shift in the budyko curves thus the correlation between ω and forest coverage in most reference watersheds is negative which is consistent with bai et al 2020 and abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 the decreases in forest coverage with increases in both the pet p and et p was also found by huo et al 2021 the spatial heterogeneity of coefficients of sf in the reference watersheds may be related to the threshold of the fraction of precipitation falling as snow as seen from fig 9 most watersheds 85 out of 126 have negative coefficients of sf this is consistent with berghuis et al 2014 who found a decrease in streamflow because of the precipitation shift from snow towards rain the findings in berghuis et al 2014 do not apply to watersheds with marginal sf values 15 there are also 3 out of 97 watersheds used in berghuis et al 2014 that have opposite sensitivity of q p to sf the watersheds with relatively high positive coefficients of sf 0 1 in this study have sf values smaller than 17 regions with relatively low sf values may have higher chances that the increases in sf can lead to an increase in ω and e p and a decrease in q p the mechanisms that determine the influence of sf on streamflow may be a combination of vegetation and topography and vary from watershed to watershed berghuijs et al 2014 the decreases in streamflow as a result of a reduction of sf may be associated with increases in evapotranspiration due to declines in snow cover milly and dunne 2020 or increases in atmospheric demand for water in a warming climate neto et al 2020 in non reference watersheds coefficients of rcms are negative in most watersheds except in the regions around wisconsin illinois and indiana this may be related to the climate region as seen from fig 11 watersheds that have relatively high positive coefficients of rcms are clustered around pet p 1 results in the transitional areas where pet p 1 may have greater uncertainties this is because the calculation of the rcms is based on the difference between pet and p and the two variables have similar values in the transitional areas this may explain the relatively low local r2 in regions in midwest around great lakes the negative coefficients of rcms indicate that higher values of rcms influence water balance by lowering ω values and increasing q p this is because high values of rcms represent an out of phase relationship between pet and p i e p is higher while pet is lower in this case a greater fraction of p can be converted to q instead of et wolock and mccabe 1999 stor nor and rip100 dev are two human related factors represented by ω in the gwr model in non reference watersheds the spatial distributions of their coefficients are more varied and the controlling factors require further investigation about 64 of the non reference watersheds have positive coefficients of stor nor this suggests that an increase in dam storage can increase ω and e p and decrease q p this is consistent with the discussion in wang and hejazi 2011 that evaporation can be enhanced due to increases in the surface area of water bodies for rip100 dev about half of the watersheds have negative coefficients the negative coefficients mean that increases in developed land in the riparian zone can decrease ω and e p and increase q p the impacts of urban sprawl on increases in streamflow is also observed in previous studies in regions that have negative coefficients of rip100 dev such as in texas olivera and defee 2007 the charlanta megaregion debbage and shepherd 2018 and colorado bhaskar et al 2020 the increasing impacts on streamflow are likely due to increases in impervious areas and decreases in infiltration the positive coefficients may be associated with other processes during urbanization such as cross basin transfers of public and or sewer water oudin et al 2018 different signs of the coefficients of developed land are also observed in li et al 2020 using the gwr model in exploring the impacts of urbanization on hydrology elevation may be a controlling factor of the importance of rip100 dev as shown in the relationship between absolute values of the coefficients of rip100 dev and the mean elevation in the watershed the importance of rip100 dev increases with elevation r 0 71 fig 10 this indicates that there may be a confounding effect between developed land and topography urban expansion in high elevation regions may have a greater impact on runoff generation than in low lying regions debbage and shepherd 2018 also found that clustering impervious surfaces in source areas of the watershed played an important role in increasing high flow frequency 4 2 bivariate relationship low values of ω characterize conditions where precipitation is quickly converted to runoff while high values of ω characterize a high ratio of et to p dingman 2015 this section discusses the possible physical mechanisms that are responsible for the relationship between ω and the variables that are not discussed in section 4 1 physiographic variables that have statistically significant negative correlations with ω include slope elevation and watershed compactness ratio the slope has a negative correlation with ω because p is quickly converted to q in steeply sloping watersheds leading to a smaller value of ω this is consistent with abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 and yang et al 2007 elevation has a similar physical mechanism influencing ω and the negative correlation we found is consistent with the results of xu et al 2013 the watershed compactness ratio represents the watershed shape and its bivariate relationship with ω was not explored in previous studies a high value of the compactness ratio means a more compact and regular shape of a watershed such as a circle or a rectangle bogaert et al 2000 which leads to a shorter concentration time of flow a faster conversion from p to q and a smaller value of ω physiographic variables that are positively correlated with ω include awc p topographic wetness index drainage area and relief ratio a higher ratio of awc p characterizes greater subsurface storage which reduces the conversion from p to q and increases the value of ω abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 xing et al 2018 yang et al 2007 the topographic wetness index measures the long term soil moisture availability kopecký and čížková 2010 and thus as it increases so does potential et and the value of ω drainage area has a similar physical mechanism influencing ω and a positive correlation was also found in xu et al 2013 high values of the relief ratio characterize broad and level surfaces with several depressions pike and wilson 1971 reducing q potential and increasing the ω value a negative correlation between relief ratio and ω was found in xing et al 2018 but their relief ratio was calculated as the ratio of the difference between the maximum and minimum elevations and the longest flow path high values of the relief ratio in xing et al 2018 represent a larger elevation change per unit length of the river which is the opposite topographic conditions from the level surfaces indicated by the high relief ratio used in this study in this study relief ratio is calculated as the ratio of the difference between mean and minimum elevation and the difference between maximum and minimum elevation table 1 therefore our results agree with theirs positive correlations were found between most human related variables and ω for example ω is positively correlated with planted cultivated land which is consistent with previous studies bao et al 2019 han et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 the physical mechanism may be because the irrigation in the planted cultivated land leads to the enhanced et wang and hejazi 2011 4 3 implications limitations and future studies this study has implications for integrated watershed management at the local scale our study found that in reference watersheds the impacts of forest coverage is more important in dry regions than in wet regions this indicates that changes in forest coverage in water limited regions should be undertaken with caution because they can have a dramatic impact on et and q in non reference watersheds rip100 dev is the most important human related variable this indicates that these watersheds are particularly sensitive to development in riparian areas local water resources managers should carefully consider the spatial location and type of development that takes place in the watersheds especially development in proximity to streams in addition the importance of rip100 dev increases with elevation watershed managers and city planners should be cautious about expanding urban areas in high elevation areas expansion of impervious surfaces in regions with high elevation can lead to a shorter concentration time and greater streamflow since this study identifies the most important variable in each watershed this can be used to identify where water resources management efforts should be focused overall we demonstrated that there are statistically significantly variations in terms of which variable has the strongest influence on the water balance in the contiguous united states this indicates that effective water resources management should consider the local climate land use types and topographic conditions and that a one size fits all approach to water management will not be effective although this study considers a comprehensive list of climatic physiographic and human related independent variables not all possible independent variables are included for example the average storm depth was found to be important for explaining ω in previous studies shao et al 2012 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2004 but it was not considered in this study even though it is not included as an independent variable the performance of the current gwr model adjusted r2 0 85 for reference and 0 80 for non reference watersheds is reasonable for analyzing the spatial heterogeneity in the controls of streamflow storm depth is also likely correlated with other climate variables such as rcms in addition climate seasonality can be represented by multiple variables such as milly s index milly 1994 the seasonality index developed by walsh and lawler 1981 precipitation seasonality developed by markham 1970 and relative cumulative moisture surplus wolock and mccabe 1999 this study only uses rcms because of its simple calculation and the strong correlation with ω reported by abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 future studies could consider other measures of seasonality gwr assumes no collinearity among the independent variables in the model wheeler 2019 therefore this study removed variables where the local vif 5 for example the original best global multiple regression model of ω in reference watersheds is ω exp 0 09 rcms 0 08 sf 0 08 elev median 0 10 forest the adjusted r2 is 0 76 and all the variables have vif 5 however if all four variables are used in the gwr model many local observations have vif 5 this is because local collinearity effects can be present even when no global collinearity is detected wheeler 2007 the absence of collinearity in the global regression model is not a reliable indicator for the absence of local collinearity wheeler 2007 to deal with this issue we removed variables that lead to local vif 5 in both gwr and the counterpart ols model the final gwr model has all the observations with local vif 5 fig s2 and the best set of model performance measures r2 aic and mae removing variables is a simple and effective way to address local collinearity this study provides reasonably good performance of the gwr model and uncovers the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between ω and dominant independent variables future studies may consider using penalized versions of gwr such as the geographically weighted ridge regression gwrr to retain all the variables in the global regression model while properly addressing local collinearity issues the gwr model can accurately predict ω values and it has an adjusted r2 of 0 85 in reference watersheds this is higher than the r2 of 0 812 obtained from a generalized additive model in 211 reference watersheds in the continental u s abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 also validated their model in an independent set of watersheds and had an r2 of 0 65 this study does not validate the gwr model because it focuses on exploring the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between ω and the environmental predictors future studies can compare the accuracy of the gwr model with other modeling methods using validation watersheds for prediction purposes although the gwr model has good model accuracy there are regions with relatively low values of local r2 such as non reference watersheds in indiana ohio and michigan the regions may have important independent variables in explaining ω other than rcms stor nor and rip100 dev identified in this study such as irrigation agriculture or planted cultivated land percentage wang and hejazi 2011 future studies can conduct separate modeling at regional scales to improve the model accuracy 5 conclusions this study improves our understanding of the controls of surface water balance by uncovering the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between budyko shape parameter ω and environmental variables the spatial varying relationships help to clarify the relative importance of forest coverage as a function of climate human related variables were also considered this is an improvement over previous studies that only considered climatic and physiographic variables a geographically weighted regression model was used to identify the set of variables that best explain the spatial variability of ω in 126 reference and 765 non reference watersheds in the contiguous u s an ordinary least squares model was used to uncover the global relationship between the ω and the same set of environmental predictors our new findings are as follows 1 the representations of ω are different in reference and non reference watersheds in reference watersheds ω is represented by precipitation falling as snow and forest coverage in non reference watersheds ω is represented by relative cumulative moisture surplus normal dam storage and riparian developed land the gwr model explains 85 of the variability in ω in reference watersheds and 80 of the variability ω in non reference watersheds 2 in non reference watersheds human disturbance primarily consists of dam construction and urbanization dam storage is the most important variable in 21 of non reference watersheds most of them are in parts of the midwest and oregon riparian developed land is more important in 13 of non reference watersheds and they are mostly in colorado idaho and parts of california 3 there are statistically significant spatial variations in the relationship between ω and the independent variables p 0 05 in reference watersheds climate is a dominant factor controlling the spatial heterogeneity of coefficients of forest coverage the relative importance of forest coverage is higher in dry watersheds than in humid watersheds in non reference watersheds the spatial patterns of coefficients of dam storage and riparian developed land are more varied the impact of riparian developed land on streamflow increases with elevation r 0 71 the spatially varying importance of environmental and anthropogenic predictors identified in this study can be used for guiding local water resources management watershed managers and city planners should be cautious about changing forest coverage in reference watersheds in dry regions and expanding riparian developed areas in non reference watersheds in high elevation areas this study identifies the most important variables other than precipitation that control local water availability national watershed management strategies should be adapted at the local scale to reflect these spatially varying relationships credit authorship

4276,the growing worldwide threat of urban flooding has stimulated research on flood resilience so that more targeted measures can be implemented in vulnerable areas to mitigate flood losses during flood events people generally show different risk perceptions for different inundation areas according to their population density economic degree and service function in this study the risk perception was quantified into weights and integrated into the resilience calculation to identify areas vulnerable to floods and posing a danger to human life and property an area in zhuhai china was selected as the research region with the proposed novel method the grid based flood resilience under different rainfall scenarios and different time periods of the day human work and rest hours was researched moreover the resilience of different land uses and the impacts of two critical parameters in the resilience equations were also studied the results indicated that the risk perception related to a given land use generally changed according to different periods of the day the overall resilience of the research region was lower when more severe rainstorm occurred in a given time period the resilience in the work hours was higher than that in the rest hours during the same rainstorm event indicating that the living working state of people affected the flood resilience in urban areas analyses of the two parameters provided plausibility verification for the parameters and indicated that a slight increase in the height of building doorsills substantially decreased the areas with low and very low resilience and this decrease effect was more pronounced in the rest hours than the work hours results of this study provide an in depth understanding of urban flood resilience and targeted guidance for engineering construction and flood management keywords urban area flood resilience system performance curve risk perception land use type 1 introduction urban pluvial flooding has become more frequent worldwide in recent years resulting in significant adverse effects on humans as well as damage to economies and the environment moy de vitry and leitão 2020 significant efforts have been made recently to mitigate urban flooding and minimize losses examples include numerical model development chen et al 2018 guidolin et al 2016 flood risk assessment li et al 2020 wang et al 2015 flood forecasting chang et al 2014 wu et al 2020 and low impact development eckart et al 2017 jia et al 2015 many countries have also proposed novel schemes for flood management such as the water sensitive urban design in australia kuller et al 2019 and the sponge city initiative in china jia et al 2017 recently flood resilience has become a popular topic because it provides a comprehensive perspective to investigate the interactions between humans and the environment during floods and encourages more efficient flood management by focusing more efforts on less resilient areas zhang et al 2019 the significance of resilience has resulted in a growing number of researchers to include it in urban flood management disse et al 2020 moura rezende et al 2019 for example the international conference on flood resilience icfr was held at the university of exeter in 2013 to discuss how to alleviate flood risk from the perspective of resilience however urban flood resilience has not been investigated extensively and thoroughly to date and no clear conceptual frameworks or quantification methods have been defined in regulations or guidelines hindering in depth exploration and efficient application of resilience in flood management manyena et al 2019 roach et al 2018 therefore additional research on flood resilience is required to develop more suitable and practical quantification methods and improve the urban flood management system the term resilience originated in the material sciences being firstly defined in the context of ecology by holling 1973 and then it was used adapted to several other contexts including engineering psychology disaster management and et al but for now there have not reached a consensus on the definition of resilience as it varies in different disciplines and research regions according to fisher 2015 more than 70 definitions of resilience exist across the scientific literature in the field of flood resilience specifically various definitions concerning fields of engineering social economic and et al have also been proposed recently tourbier 2012 keating et al 2017 following these definitions researchers have explored flood resilience from various perspectives wang et al 2019 referred to the resilience definition in engineering fields and flood resilience was explained as the capacity of a system to respond and recover from failures under exceptional conditions rainfall storm from the perspective of social ecological resilience kotzee and reyers 2016 assessed flood resilience through quantifying the capacity of a social ecological system to adapt to cope with and shape uncertainty brought by flood events leandro et al 2020 considered three aspects for the quantification of flood resilience physical social and economic they defined the household flood resilience to climate change as the capacity of a household to withstand adverse effects following extreme flooding events and the ability to recover to the household original conditions in this study we quantify flood resilience based on the definition in the engineering filed under this consideration urban flood resilience is defined as the resisting and restoring capacities of an urban system in coping with flood disasters meanwhile we argue that it is necessary to consider social factors for a holistic flood resilience assessment the risk perception of people therefore is incorporated into the assessment framework in this study risk perception of people which has been recognized as a crucial factor in realizing effective flood management strategies refers to the intuitive judgments on the potential impacts and consequences of a hazard slovic 1987 birkholz et al 2014 pointed out that there is a need to re examine and re invigorate flood risk perception research multi criteria indices based metrics and performance based metrics are two types of methods for evaluating resilience which have been proposed in some related literature argyroudis et al 2020 dong et al 2017 gotangco et al 2016 juan garcia et al 2017 leandro et al 2020 liu et al 2019 shafieezadeh and ivey burden 2014 simonovic and arunkumar 2016 uddin et al 2020 multi criteria indices based metrics which are relatively the mainstream of resilience assessment generally construct multi indices systems and then calculate resilience by assigning weights to indices miguez and veról 2016 proposed an integrated metric called the flood resilience index which was developed to support the decision making process and selected design alternatives to improve flood control responses when the design standards were exceeded bertilsson et al 2019 integrated hazards exposure and susceptibility to established a multi criteria index called the spatialized urban flood resilience index s fresi which was then used to evaluate and map flood resilience over time although multi criteria indices based metrics have strong systematic logic and are easy to manipulate moghadas et al 2019 they rely heavily on the subjective selection of indices and weight calculation methods determined by experts resulting in significant subjectivity and uncertainties in the assessment results performance based metrics are also used to calculate flood resilience and have been formally applied in the assessment of urban drainage systems mugume et al 2015 developed a new conceptual framework to evaluate the resilience of urban drainage systems globally based on the system performance curve a single resilience metric was utilized to quantify the residual functionality of the system at each link failure level in the drainage system wang et al 2019 proposed a grid based resilience metric based on the system performance curve to assess urban pluvial flood resilience in an urban watershed performance based metrics are often based on the simulation results of hydrological or hydraulic models and are therefore more precise and objective than multi criteria indices based metrics in addition performance based metrics provide a more flexible and efficient scheme to quantify flood resilience than multi criteria indices based metrics they not only provide high resolution resilience results but also allow for the dynamic assessment of the ability of regional systems to cope with floods therefore performance based metrics possess significant potential to standardize and rationalize the resilience evaluation process if they are appropriately applied although performance based metrics provide a more concise dynamic and objective resilience evaluation than multi criteria indices based metrics they are commonly based on only a few parameters and the needs of humans are not considered resulting in non targeted emergency strategies to mitigate flood losses or inappropriate engineering solutions to enhance flood resilience for example it is assumed that a flood event causes inundation depths of 0 5 m in a developed area with a dense population and buildings and 1 m in an underdeveloped area with a sparse population and buildings the underdeveloped area will be classified as a less resilient area if traditional performance based metrics are used however an inundation depth of 0 5 m in the developed area is likely to pose greater threats to human life and property thus more resources should be provided to the developed area therefore traditional performance based metrics do not consider the social aspects and are not suitable for providing efficient resilience assessments of human society the resilience quantification should consider the social environment and human requirements as well as the differences between natural and urban environments as a result improvements in performance based metrics are necessary so that precious rescue and engineering resources can be assigned to locations that are susceptible to floods while considering human needs when flooding occurs people generally show different perceptions of risk for locations with different population densities resources and land use functions in this paper we propose a novel performance based method for resilience quantification including the risk perception of the local population as a component of the method intending to address this feature and increase the research efforts in this field an area covering 95 28 km2 in zhuhai china is used as a case study to investigate the system performance resilience and sensitivity of two critical parameters in four design rainfall events and the human work and rest hours the objectives of this study are to 1 quantify the risk perception of people for different spatial locations during flood events 2 determine the system performance and resilience for different rainfall events and time periods while considering the human risk perception 3 classify the flood resilience levels and present the spatial distribution 4 assess the impacts of the parameters on the resilience results and determine the sensitivity a flowchart of the research is shown in fig 1 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides an introduction to the novel resilience quantification method and describes the two weight calibration methods followed by a description of the research region in section 3 the results and discussion are presented in section 4 and section 5 respectively the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 novel flood resilience quantification method 2 1 1 system performance curve for flood resilience quantification we used the common definition of engineering resilience i e the capacity of an engineering system to withstand resist and recover from an adverse event and return to the original condition linkov et al 2014 meng et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the system performance curve which is illustrated in fig 2 was selected to quantify urban flood resilience in this study the research region and its partial areas belonged to the engineering system of which the flood resilience was measured by calculating the average value of the system performance in the whole process of flood inundation simulation when a rainstorm occurs the system performance which ranges from 0 to 1 changes as the urban flood develops a two dimensional surface grid which was automatedly divided by infoworks icm model was considered as the computing cell in traditional flood resilience metrics wang et al 2019 the state for each grid g i t was calculated using eq 1 the total number of flooded grids n t was calculated using eq 2 system performance p t of a region was calculated using eq 3 and the overall resilience of the region res was calculated using eq 4 1 g i t 1 h i t h c 0 h i t h c w h e r e t 0 t n 2 n t i 1 n g i t 3 p t 1 n t n 4 res 1 t n t 0 t n p i t d t where n is the total number of grids in the region h i t represent inundation depth of grid i at time t t n is the total simulation time of a specific rainfall event in flood simulation models h c represents the threshold belonging to the land use type where grid i is located generally the flood depth thresholds are set according to the properties of different land use types and each land use type holds only one threshold 2 1 2 improved equations of system performance using two thresholds in traditional resilience metrics active g i t 0 and inactive g i t 1 are the states of each grid which means the system performance is only 0 or 1 for a system consisting of one grid however in actual cases the mutation between 0 and 1 is quite unreasonable for a grid for example floods of 2 cm depth will cause the risk of slipping for motor vehicles and shallow floods will bring inconvenience to pedestrians therefore we argue that the states of grids should be a gradually changed process which will make the resilience assessment result more accurate and more in line with reality in this assumption we ignored the grid states definition and considered each grid as an individual system and then we proposed improved equations for p i t by adopting two thresholds i e an upper threshold and a lower threshold thus p i t was calculated using eq 5 the resilience for grids and the region were calculated by eqs 6 and 7 respectively 5 p i t 1 h i t h low h up h i t h up h low 0 h i t h up h low h i t h up 6 r e s i 1 t n t 0 t n p i t d t 7 res 1 i 1 n a i i 1 n r e s i a i where h low and h up represent the lower threshold and the upper threshold respectively r e s i represent the resilience values of grid i a i represents the area of grid i in this study the lower threshold of each land use type was determined as the inundation depth that started influencing humans assets or infrastructures the upper threshold was determined as the inundation depth that severely affected humans assets or infrastructures the thresholds and the corresponding references of the threshold determination for the seven land use types are listed in table 1 2 1 3 incorporation of the human risk perception into the quantification of system performance human beings depend on their living environment for survival and development in the process of fighting against natural disasters people have gradually formed intuitive judgments about the potential risks of disasters related to hazard and vulnerability which is called risk perception and has been proposed as an important aspect for taking efficient flood management measures by some researchers bradford et al 2012 raaijmakers et al 2008 specify the definition of flood risk perception as a combination of three specific factors of risk awareness worry and preparedness which has gained wide recognition lechowska 2018 according to the concept of the worry component people generally have different risk perceptions levels of worry regarding the locations and time periods of severe flood events for example floods in companies or schools cause greater worry when people are at work whereas floods in residences are of greater worry when people are at home therefore it is meaningful to incorporate the human risk perception into the quantification of resilience to implement more effective flood mitigation measures in the inundation areas that affect people s work and home life due to the significant difference in the spatial distribution of people in different time periods it is necessary to divide a day into different periods to better determine the spatial distribution of people and investigate the flood resilience in detail in this study we classified the risk perception of people in the seven land use types for the time periods that people spend at work and at home the work hours correspond to the time of frequent activities when most people are at work or in school the rest hours represent the time when most people are at home the equation of p i t was rewritten as eq 8 the weights w were determined using the entropy weight method ewm and the analytic hierarchy process ahp the details are described in section 2 2 8 p i t 1 h i t h low 1 h i t h low h up h low w i 1 w i h i t h up h low h i t h up where w i represents the weight of the risk perception in grid i it is important to note that the lowest performance value of a grid remains 1 w i when the flood depth exceeds the upper threshold after using this resilience metric as a result the average values of p and res are relatively high the values of the system performance or resilience are relative values in this study a grid with a resilience value of 0 9 cannot be classified as high resilience unless the resilience of the other grids is less than 0 9 for an in depth analysis the resilience area ra and resilience area loss ral were defined in eqs 9 and 10 respectively 9 ra a r e s 10 ral a 1 r e s 2 2 calculation of the weights 2 2 1 the analytic hierarchy process in determining the risk perception weights for different land uses three aspects were considered the distribution of economy and assets the function of land uses serving for human society and the active state of people we used the ahp method which has been widely used for urban flood evaluation lin et al 2020 to calculate the weights of the risk perception related to the different land use types the subjective nature of the ahp fits well with the human risk perception the details of the ahp have been described by lyu et al 2018 ten experts including six professors and four senior engineers were invited to determine the weights this determination process consisted of two critical steps the first step was to rank the risk perception for the land uses in the two time periods the second step was to determine the values in the judgement matrix of the ahp to generate the weights of the land use types however in the second step the judgement matrix showed slight differences in the results for different experts fifteen sets of weights were generated for the work hours and the rest hours respectively the ewm was then utilized to distinguish the most informative set of weights 2 2 2 the entropy weight method the ewm was used to assign objective weights based on the discreteness of the data the method has been widely used for weight calibration and decision making the details of this method have been described by delgado and romero 2016 xu et al 2018 according to the information entropy theory which was proposed by shannon 1948 the information describes the degree of system order whereas the entropy describes the degree of system disorder the higher the uncertainty the greater the entropy is and the more information is contained in the system thus the data set with the highest score contains the most information we used the ewm to determine the optimum set of weights according to the scores for the work hours and the rest hours respectively in this manner we mitigated the influence of the subjective factors used in the ahp method 2 3 infoworks icm for flood modelling infoworks icm is a hydrodynamic model for urban pluvial flood modelling which integrates one dimensional 1d and two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic simulations in urban environments and river floodplains innovyze 2014 the 1d hydrodynamic simulation captured by the saint venant equations is generally for the flow modelling in the underground pipe networks while the 2d hydrodynamic simulation captured by the shallow water equations swe is utilized in the surface flood inundation modelling the modelling processes involved in the current research are the rainfall runoff calculation the 1d hydrodynamic simulation for the underground pipe networks and the 2d hydrodynamic simulation for surface inundation 3 case study 3 1 research region as shown in fig 3 the study area covers 95 28 km2 in the xiangzhou district of zhuhai south china located in the hinterland of the pearl river delta the research region is an area of high urbanization with dense population and buildings which is suitable for the investigation of urban flood resilience the area has a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average rainfall of 2061 9 mm and an annual average temperature of 22 4 c the rainfall distribution is uneven and 70 of the rainfall occurs in the wet season in the past few years heavy and frequent rainstorms have resulted in severe flood events in the research region adversely affecting people property and the environment eight land use types are included in the research region fig 4 i e agricultural land commercial land green land industrial land public land residential land traffic land and water these land use types cover 4 31 5 77 34 22 5 10 12 11 21 66 9 51 and 2 60 km2 respectively the land use diversity in the research region allows for applying the novel metric and will provide comprehensive results and guidance for urban flood resilience management the water areas including rivers pools and reservoirs were excluded from the flood simulation and resilience calculation zone the gis data of the one dimensional pipe network recorded rainfall recorded inundation areas and land use were provided by the zhuhai institute of urban planning design more information about the model development of the research region can refer to the supplementary material 3 2 design rainfalls design rainfalls with four return periods 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods were used in the simulation the design rainstorm equations in these return periods are displayed in fig 5 the equations were proposed by the zhuhai meteorological bureau in 2016 a rainfall event was defined as rainfall with 2 h duration a 1 minute time step and a peak coefficient of 0 521 the synthetic hyetograph is shown in fig 5 considering the duration of the design rainfalls and the convenience of resilience calculation we chose 4 h as the total simulation time t n 4 results 4 1 the weights of the risk perception in the seven land use types the ewm was used to compare the fifteen sets of weights obtained from the ahp for the work hours and the rest hours respectively table 2 shows the results for the work hours in which the weights in the last line and the scores in the last row were calculated using the ewm the optimum set of weights for the work hours was no 11 with a score of 0 1386 the public land traffic land and commercial land had the three largest weights the public land includes areas of public services such as electricity education administrative affairs and hospitals which are vital to the operation of the city and to people during the work hours due to frequent human activities in the work hours the traffic land plays an important role in transportation and rescue efforts during floods the commercial land provides employment for people and includes shopping centers and areas of business activities table 3 shows the results for the rest hours in which the weights in the last line and the scores in the last row were calculated using the ewm the optimum set of weights for the rest hours was no 7 with a score of 0 1412 the public residential and traffic lands had the three largest weights these results make sense because people mostly remain at home for entertainment or sleeping and public services such as water and electricity services are also necessary during the rest hours the comparison of the weights for the two time periods is shown in fig 6 there was a significant difference a change rate of 186 64 in the weights between the two time periods for the residential land the weights of the public land were the largest in both time periods indicating that floods on public lands posed the greatest threat to humans among all land uses in the traffic and commercial lands the weights were higher in the work hours than the rest hours indicating that the demand of people for transportation and work decreased was higher in the work hours than the rest hours the weights of the green and agricultural lands were similar for the two time periods and relatively low indicating that these areas were of low worry to people in the two time periods the differences in the weights between the two time periods indicated that the risk perception of people for the environment during flood events changed dynamically over time and was different for different locations the same adverse event occurring in different time periods resulted in disparate spatial influences this phenomenon should be considered in many aspects of flood management such as flood risk assessment project benefit evaluation and green infrastructure planning 4 2 flood resilience results eight scenarios were considered for modeling the floods i e the rainfall events of the 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods for the work hours and the rest hours the system performance of the entire research region and three representative sites for the eight scenarios are depicted in fig 7 in fig 7 a the overall system performance exhibited a similar trend in all scenarios the performance initially decreased sharply to the lowest point and then increased gradually the minimum values of all performance curves occurred at the same time 122 min exhibiting a slight lag behind the duration of the design rainfall 120 min statistical analysis indicated that the runoff volume exhibited strong similarity in many aspects of rainfall events in different return periods which was similar to the results reported by chen et al 2018 the largest inundation volume of the research region occurred at 124 min followed by that at 122 min it could be predicted at 122 min that the inundation volume of the research region was about to reach the maximum at this time the flood conditions of locations with high weight values were more serious than those at 124 min these findings explain why the minimum values of the performance curves occurred at the same time 122 min the results also demonstrated that the resilience of the system decreased with an increase in the rainfall return period indicating that the research region was more vulnerable during intense rainstorms the values of the system performance and resilience were close to 1 the reasons are that the proposed calculation method produced values close to 1 and most areas in the research region were not submerged even during a 100 year rainfall the research region performed better in the work hours than in the rest hours for the same rainfall event indicating that the resilience was higher in the work hours than the rest hours therefore the time period work or rest influenced the resilience of urban areas fig 7 b c and d show the system performances of the three representative sites s1 s2 and s3 respectively s1 the fuhuali business center is located in the core commercial area of zhuhai s2 the people s government of zhuhai is located on public land s3 the pingan apartment is located in a residential area unlike in the system performance curve of the entire research region the minimum values of the curve at the three sites were different for the four rainfall return periods the results indicated that different land uses showed different characteristics in different time periods that were closely related to the weights the ral of a land use type determines its impact on the overall resilience table 4 shows the resilience and the ral for the different land use types in the eight scenarios the ral values of the different land use types showed different characteristics for the two time periods in the work hours the public land and the traffic land had the two largest ral values and the traffic land had the lowest resilience value in the rest hours the public land and the residential land had the top two ral values and the public land had the lowest resilience value 4 3 analysis of resilience area loss ral the ral is an important attribute of land use types because it reveals the contribution to resilience loss when the ral of the research region and the land use types is compared therefore the analysis of the ral is necessary to investigate the characteristics of different land use types the contribution of the land use type to the overall ral alc was determined to assess the impact of the land use type on the overall resilience the alc is defined in eq 11 the resilience results indicated that there might be some relationships between the areas weights depth thresholds and alc of different land use types a higher alc can correspond to a larger area higher weight and lower thresholds for a specific land use type 11 alc i ral i totalral where alc i means alc of land use i the relationships between the alc area ratio a weight w and the reciprocal of the upper threshold t of the land use types are illustrated in fig 8 14 groups of symbols were generated for the combination of the seven land use types and the two time periods each group of symbols contained four points representing four return periods as shown in fig 8 a differences were observed in the alc of all land use types between the two time periods the points representing the same land use type were located at the same x axis value the alc values of any land use type exhibited relatively few differences between the four design rainfalls in the same time period in contrast the alc values generally exhibited large differences between the two time periods fig 8 b shows the relationship between a w and alc which implies the distribution of most points is linear after removing four outliers representing the residential land in the rest hours a regression line was fitted to the other points fig 8 c the regression line showed a good fit for the relationship between the products of a and w and alc r2 0 8978 indicating that the alc depended on the areas and weights for most urban land use types in summary the weight is a critical characteristic of the land use types in this resilience quantification method that considers the human risk perception the engineering resilience values were amplified or diminished according to actual human needs after adopting the novel resilience quantification method the integration of the human risk perception into the resilience assessment can guide more efficient resilience zoning and engineering planning 4 4 flood resilience mapping and analysis the grid based resilience values were classified into 5 levels very low low medium high and very high the spatial distributions of the resilience values in all scenarios are shown in fig 9 areas with very high resilience comprised the largest proportion of the total area in all scenarios whereas areas with relatively low resilience increased as the rainfall return period increased areas with different resilience levels exhibited different distribution characteristics for the two time periods for a given rainfall event the spatial distribution provides targeted guidance for flood mitigation measures rescue efforts and constructions to improve flood resilience in different rainfall return periods and the work and rest hours the area statistics of the different resilience levels are summarized in table 5 the areas with low and very low resilience to flood events were the most vulnerable locations from the human risk perception and should be considered for mitigation measures the results showed that areas with low and very low resilience increased as the rainfall return period increased in a given time period indicating that more people were influenced by more severe rainstorms a comparison of the areas in the 10 and 20 year return periods showed that the areas with low and very low resilience in the rest hours were larger than those in the work hours demonstrating that people were exposed to greater danger in the rest hours when encountering rainstorms with low return periods however for the 50 year and 100 year rainfall return periods the areas with low and very low resilience in the work hours were generally larger than those in the rest hours indicating that people were exposed to greater danger in the work hours when encountering rainstorms with high return periods 5 discussion in this study a novel metric for urban flood resilience that considers the active state of people the distribution of economy and assets and the function of land use types serving for human society was proposed to investigate the flood resilience characteristics in an urban area in contrast to the use of multi criteria indices based metrics the proposed method considers the dynamics and provides more precise results to guide flood risk management compared to traditional performance based metrics the novel method considers social aspects to achieve more practical resilience mapping although significant results were obtained some parameters are subjective such as the total simulation time t n and depth thresholds and the proposed method has certain limitations these issues are discussed to provide an in depth understanding of this method and guidance for future research and flood management 5 1 sensitivity analysis 5 1 1 influence of the total simulation time t n scenarios with a 50 year rainfall return period with 3 4 6 and 10 hour simulation durations in the work hours were analyzed to determine the influence of t n on resilience the resilience results of different t n are shown in fig 10 and table 6 it was found that areas of low and very low resilience increased as t n increased from 3 h to 10 h it can be predicted that the overall resilience will be close to 1 for a large t n because many inundated areas will return to the original system performance overall it can be concluded that as t n increases from 2 h to longer durations the resilience of the research region decreases initially and then gradually increases approaching 1 as t n increased areas with very low resilience increased whereas areas with low resilience decreased table 6 the areas with low and very low resilience were 1 371 1 874 1 861 and 1 702 km2 for 3 4 6 and 10 h of t n respectively therefore it was relatively more reasonable and conservative to choose 4 h as the total simulation time because more regions with low and very low resilience were obtained it is worth noting that 4 h is only a local value in this study which depends on the time of concentration of a basin and the functional state of the drainage system but it provides theoretical guidance for other studies that the approach presented in this paper can determine the optimal scheme of t n related to the local typical rainfalls which will provide more information for local engineering planning and construction 5 1 2 impacts of the depth thresholds an increase in the depth thresholds may be a suitable method to improve flood resilience it is unrealistic to raise the depth thresholds of the traffic agricultural and green lands because automobile exhausts crop varieties and plant species cannot be changed however it is possible to raise the depth thresholds of the public residential commercial and industrial lands by elevating the height of building doorsills in this study we raised the height of building doorsills by 0 2 m to investigate the impacts of different depth thresholds on urban flood resilience in this scheme the depth thresholds of the public residential commercial and industrial lands were 0 0 35 m 0 25 0 35 m 0 25 0 35 m and 0 25 0 35 m respectively scenarios with a 50 year rainfall return period in both time periods were used to determine the influence of a change in the building doorsills on resilience the resilience results of the original and the novel threshold schemes are shown in fig 11 and table 7 scenario 1 and scenario 2 represented the work hours for the original and novel threshold schemes respectively scenario 3 and scenario 4 represented the rest hours for the original and novel threshold schemes respectively a comparison of the results in fig 11 e and f or g and h indicated that an increase in the thresholds of the buildings increased resilience the results indicated that although an increase in the depth threshold only slightly increased the resilience of the entire research region it significantly decreased the areas with low and very low resilience in both time periods the use of the new threshold scheme increased the overall resilience by 0 07 and 0 09 in the work hours and rest hours respectively demonstrating that the overall resilience was not sensitive to a change in the depth threshold however areas with very low resilience low resilience showed decreases in the resilience of 7 88 and 20 38 9 43 and 10 41 in the work hours and rest hours respectively the finding indicated that an increase in the thresholds of buildings significantly reduced areas with low and very low resilience and this effect was more pronounced in the rest hours the ral and the change rates are shown in table 7 raising the building doorsills decreased the ral of the land use types in which the depth thresholds were designed to be elevated while it had no strengthening or weakening effect on the land use types with unchanged depth thresholds the ral change rates of commercial industrial public and residential lands all varied the same ratio between two time periods indicating that the weights and time periods did not affect the change rates of the ral moreover the largest decrease in the ral and the ral change rate were observed for the residential land implying that raising the building doorsills substantially reduced the ral or increased the resilience of the residential land the change rates of the ral were higher in the commercial industrial and residential lands than the public land it is worth noting that the commercial industrial and residential lands have high impervious ratios therefore it could be concluded that the depth thresholds had more impacts on the impervious than non impervious areas which was consistent with the results reported by wang et al 2019 5 2 limitations and improvements the proposed metric did not consider the coping and recovery abilities of human society such as disaster warning systems and disaster insurance generally it is difficult to obtain indicators of social aspects at high spatial resolution kotzee and reyers 2016 questionnaire surveys and social media may be possible solutions allaire 2016 although this approach is time and resource intensive a more thorough and comprehensive result can be obtained if more resilience indices related to socioeconomic perspectives are used to develop the system performance curve the proposed metric is not suitable for larger research regions such as the entire zhuhai city establishing a detailed two dimensional hydrodynamic model at the city or larger scales requires large amounts of data and extensive work lyu et al 2019 most importantly there are significant spatial differences in the same land use type in large regions and the same time period the resilience results would not be precise if the proposed metric were applied to a large region in this case accurate spatial population and economic data should be utilized to optimize the resilience equations these data can be obtained using modern technologies such as the baidu heat map li et al 2019 and nighttime light observations from remote sensing data wu et al 2013 in addition the novel flood resilience metric assumes that the system performance changes linearly with the inundation depth provided that the depth is within the two thresholds with the help of the vulnerability curve more improvement works can be done to these functions in the future which will make the resilience assessment result more in line with reality 6 conclusions a novel flood resilience quantification method that considers human risk perceptions including the living working environment and the risk perception for different land use during flood events was proposed to investigate the resilience to floods in an urban area in zhuhai south china two depth thresholds and weights of the risk perception for different land use types were used to improve the system performance curve the proposed method could identify areas vulnerable to floods while considering the living working environment of people eight scenarios four design rainfall return periods and the work and rest hours of people were used to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of resilience to flood in the research region in addition sensitivity analyses of the total simulation time and the depth thresholds were conducted the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the work hours the top three land use types with the largest weights of risk perceptions during flood events were the public traffic and commercial lands in the rest hours the top three land use types were the public residential and traffic lands there were significant differences in the weights between the work hours and the rest hours indicating that the dependence of humans on the environment during flood events changed dynamically over time and in space the residential land exhibited the largest differences in weights between the two time periods 2 in both time periods the overall resilience decreased as the rainfall return period increased and the areas of low and very low resilience also increased the research region exhibited less resilience in the rest hours than the work hours for the same rainfall event indicating that the active state of people in different time periods influenced the resilience of urban areas to floods 3 there were only slight differences in the alc values of each land use type in the same time period whereas significant differences were observed between the two time periods the areas and weights had a strong influence on the alc values for most urban areas 4 as the total simulation time increased from 2 h to larger values the resilience of the research region initially decreased and then increased in this study a total simulation time of 4 h provided the most reasonable and conservative results as the largest areas of low and very low resilience were revealed therefore this simulation scheme provided excellent guidance for providing critical rescue resources and engineering planning although this scheme cannot be generalized to any case other studies can use similar procedures for optimizing the parameters 5 although an increase in the height of building doorsills slightly increased the resilience of the overall system it substantially decreased the areas with low and very low resilience and this effect was more pronounced in the rest hours elevating the building thresholds reduced the ral significantly and increased the resilience of the residential land moreover a change in the depth thresholds had more impacts on the resilience of impervious lands than on pervious lands although a novel flood resilience quantification method is proposed and some meaningful results have been drawn in this paper the definition of the upper and the lower depth thresholds in system performance functions related to different land use types should be deeply researched in future studies more detailed data including building structures road capacity flood tolerance of plants and related numerical models are expected to be included in the decision of depth thresholds in addition more resilience

4276,the growing worldwide threat of urban flooding has stimulated research on flood resilience so that more targeted measures can be implemented in vulnerable areas to mitigate flood losses during flood events people generally show different risk perceptions for different inundation areas according to their population density economic degree and service function in this study the risk perception was quantified into weights and integrated into the resilience calculation to identify areas vulnerable to floods and posing a danger to human life and property an area in zhuhai china was selected as the research region with the proposed novel method the grid based flood resilience under different rainfall scenarios and different time periods of the day human work and rest hours was researched moreover the resilience of different land uses and the impacts of two critical parameters in the resilience equations were also studied the results indicated that the risk perception related to a given land use generally changed according to different periods of the day the overall resilience of the research region was lower when more severe rainstorm occurred in a given time period the resilience in the work hours was higher than that in the rest hours during the same rainstorm event indicating that the living working state of people affected the flood resilience in urban areas analyses of the two parameters provided plausibility verification for the parameters and indicated that a slight increase in the height of building doorsills substantially decreased the areas with low and very low resilience and this decrease effect was more pronounced in the rest hours than the work hours results of this study provide an in depth understanding of urban flood resilience and targeted guidance for engineering construction and flood management keywords urban area flood resilience system performance curve risk perception land use type 1 introduction urban pluvial flooding has become more frequent worldwide in recent years resulting in significant adverse effects on humans as well as damage to economies and the environment moy de vitry and leitão 2020 significant efforts have been made recently to mitigate urban flooding and minimize losses examples include numerical model development chen et al 2018 guidolin et al 2016 flood risk assessment li et al 2020 wang et al 2015 flood forecasting chang et al 2014 wu et al 2020 and low impact development eckart et al 2017 jia et al 2015 many countries have also proposed novel schemes for flood management such as the water sensitive urban design in australia kuller et al 2019 and the sponge city initiative in china jia et al 2017 recently flood resilience has become a popular topic because it provides a comprehensive perspective to investigate the interactions between humans and the environment during floods and encourages more efficient flood management by focusing more efforts on less resilient areas zhang et al 2019 the significance of resilience has resulted in a growing number of researchers to include it in urban flood management disse et al 2020 moura rezende et al 2019 for example the international conference on flood resilience icfr was held at the university of exeter in 2013 to discuss how to alleviate flood risk from the perspective of resilience however urban flood resilience has not been investigated extensively and thoroughly to date and no clear conceptual frameworks or quantification methods have been defined in regulations or guidelines hindering in depth exploration and efficient application of resilience in flood management manyena et al 2019 roach et al 2018 therefore additional research on flood resilience is required to develop more suitable and practical quantification methods and improve the urban flood management system the term resilience originated in the material sciences being firstly defined in the context of ecology by holling 1973 and then it was used adapted to several other contexts including engineering psychology disaster management and et al but for now there have not reached a consensus on the definition of resilience as it varies in different disciplines and research regions according to fisher 2015 more than 70 definitions of resilience exist across the scientific literature in the field of flood resilience specifically various definitions concerning fields of engineering social economic and et al have also been proposed recently tourbier 2012 keating et al 2017 following these definitions researchers have explored flood resilience from various perspectives wang et al 2019 referred to the resilience definition in engineering fields and flood resilience was explained as the capacity of a system to respond and recover from failures under exceptional conditions rainfall storm from the perspective of social ecological resilience kotzee and reyers 2016 assessed flood resilience through quantifying the capacity of a social ecological system to adapt to cope with and shape uncertainty brought by flood events leandro et al 2020 considered three aspects for the quantification of flood resilience physical social and economic they defined the household flood resilience to climate change as the capacity of a household to withstand adverse effects following extreme flooding events and the ability to recover to the household original conditions in this study we quantify flood resilience based on the definition in the engineering filed under this consideration urban flood resilience is defined as the resisting and restoring capacities of an urban system in coping with flood disasters meanwhile we argue that it is necessary to consider social factors for a holistic flood resilience assessment the risk perception of people therefore is incorporated into the assessment framework in this study risk perception of people which has been recognized as a crucial factor in realizing effective flood management strategies refers to the intuitive judgments on the potential impacts and consequences of a hazard slovic 1987 birkholz et al 2014 pointed out that there is a need to re examine and re invigorate flood risk perception research multi criteria indices based metrics and performance based metrics are two types of methods for evaluating resilience which have been proposed in some related literature argyroudis et al 2020 dong et al 2017 gotangco et al 2016 juan garcia et al 2017 leandro et al 2020 liu et al 2019 shafieezadeh and ivey burden 2014 simonovic and arunkumar 2016 uddin et al 2020 multi criteria indices based metrics which are relatively the mainstream of resilience assessment generally construct multi indices systems and then calculate resilience by assigning weights to indices miguez and veról 2016 proposed an integrated metric called the flood resilience index which was developed to support the decision making process and selected design alternatives to improve flood control responses when the design standards were exceeded bertilsson et al 2019 integrated hazards exposure and susceptibility to established a multi criteria index called the spatialized urban flood resilience index s fresi which was then used to evaluate and map flood resilience over time although multi criteria indices based metrics have strong systematic logic and are easy to manipulate moghadas et al 2019 they rely heavily on the subjective selection of indices and weight calculation methods determined by experts resulting in significant subjectivity and uncertainties in the assessment results performance based metrics are also used to calculate flood resilience and have been formally applied in the assessment of urban drainage systems mugume et al 2015 developed a new conceptual framework to evaluate the resilience of urban drainage systems globally based on the system performance curve a single resilience metric was utilized to quantify the residual functionality of the system at each link failure level in the drainage system wang et al 2019 proposed a grid based resilience metric based on the system performance curve to assess urban pluvial flood resilience in an urban watershed performance based metrics are often based on the simulation results of hydrological or hydraulic models and are therefore more precise and objective than multi criteria indices based metrics in addition performance based metrics provide a more flexible and efficient scheme to quantify flood resilience than multi criteria indices based metrics they not only provide high resolution resilience results but also allow for the dynamic assessment of the ability of regional systems to cope with floods therefore performance based metrics possess significant potential to standardize and rationalize the resilience evaluation process if they are appropriately applied although performance based metrics provide a more concise dynamic and objective resilience evaluation than multi criteria indices based metrics they are commonly based on only a few parameters and the needs of humans are not considered resulting in non targeted emergency strategies to mitigate flood losses or inappropriate engineering solutions to enhance flood resilience for example it is assumed that a flood event causes inundation depths of 0 5 m in a developed area with a dense population and buildings and 1 m in an underdeveloped area with a sparse population and buildings the underdeveloped area will be classified as a less resilient area if traditional performance based metrics are used however an inundation depth of 0 5 m in the developed area is likely to pose greater threats to human life and property thus more resources should be provided to the developed area therefore traditional performance based metrics do not consider the social aspects and are not suitable for providing efficient resilience assessments of human society the resilience quantification should consider the social environment and human requirements as well as the differences between natural and urban environments as a result improvements in performance based metrics are necessary so that precious rescue and engineering resources can be assigned to locations that are susceptible to floods while considering human needs when flooding occurs people generally show different perceptions of risk for locations with different population densities resources and land use functions in this paper we propose a novel performance based method for resilience quantification including the risk perception of the local population as a component of the method intending to address this feature and increase the research efforts in this field an area covering 95 28 km2 in zhuhai china is used as a case study to investigate the system performance resilience and sensitivity of two critical parameters in four design rainfall events and the human work and rest hours the objectives of this study are to 1 quantify the risk perception of people for different spatial locations during flood events 2 determine the system performance and resilience for different rainfall events and time periods while considering the human risk perception 3 classify the flood resilience levels and present the spatial distribution 4 assess the impacts of the parameters on the resilience results and determine the sensitivity a flowchart of the research is shown in fig 1 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides an introduction to the novel resilience quantification method and describes the two weight calibration methods followed by a description of the research region in section 3 the results and discussion are presented in section 4 and section 5 respectively the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 novel flood resilience quantification method 2 1 1 system performance curve for flood resilience quantification we used the common definition of engineering resilience i e the capacity of an engineering system to withstand resist and recover from an adverse event and return to the original condition linkov et al 2014 meng et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the system performance curve which is illustrated in fig 2 was selected to quantify urban flood resilience in this study the research region and its partial areas belonged to the engineering system of which the flood resilience was measured by calculating the average value of the system performance in the whole process of flood inundation simulation when a rainstorm occurs the system performance which ranges from 0 to 1 changes as the urban flood develops a two dimensional surface grid which was automatedly divided by infoworks icm model was considered as the computing cell in traditional flood resilience metrics wang et al 2019 the state for each grid g i t was calculated using eq 1 the total number of flooded grids n t was calculated using eq 2 system performance p t of a region was calculated using eq 3 and the overall resilience of the region res was calculated using eq 4 1 g i t 1 h i t h c 0 h i t h c w h e r e t 0 t n 2 n t i 1 n g i t 3 p t 1 n t n 4 res 1 t n t 0 t n p i t d t where n is the total number of grids in the region h i t represent inundation depth of grid i at time t t n is the total simulation time of a specific rainfall event in flood simulation models h c represents the threshold belonging to the land use type where grid i is located generally the flood depth thresholds are set according to the properties of different land use types and each land use type holds only one threshold 2 1 2 improved equations of system performance using two thresholds in traditional resilience metrics active g i t 0 and inactive g i t 1 are the states of each grid which means the system performance is only 0 or 1 for a system consisting of one grid however in actual cases the mutation between 0 and 1 is quite unreasonable for a grid for example floods of 2 cm depth will cause the risk of slipping for motor vehicles and shallow floods will bring inconvenience to pedestrians therefore we argue that the states of grids should be a gradually changed process which will make the resilience assessment result more accurate and more in line with reality in this assumption we ignored the grid states definition and considered each grid as an individual system and then we proposed improved equations for p i t by adopting two thresholds i e an upper threshold and a lower threshold thus p i t was calculated using eq 5 the resilience for grids and the region were calculated by eqs 6 and 7 respectively 5 p i t 1 h i t h low h up h i t h up h low 0 h i t h up h low h i t h up 6 r e s i 1 t n t 0 t n p i t d t 7 res 1 i 1 n a i i 1 n r e s i a i where h low and h up represent the lower threshold and the upper threshold respectively r e s i represent the resilience values of grid i a i represents the area of grid i in this study the lower threshold of each land use type was determined as the inundation depth that started influencing humans assets or infrastructures the upper threshold was determined as the inundation depth that severely affected humans assets or infrastructures the thresholds and the corresponding references of the threshold determination for the seven land use types are listed in table 1 2 1 3 incorporation of the human risk perception into the quantification of system performance human beings depend on their living environment for survival and development in the process of fighting against natural disasters people have gradually formed intuitive judgments about the potential risks of disasters related to hazard and vulnerability which is called risk perception and has been proposed as an important aspect for taking efficient flood management measures by some researchers bradford et al 2012 raaijmakers et al 2008 specify the definition of flood risk perception as a combination of three specific factors of risk awareness worry and preparedness which has gained wide recognition lechowska 2018 according to the concept of the worry component people generally have different risk perceptions levels of worry regarding the locations and time periods of severe flood events for example floods in companies or schools cause greater worry when people are at work whereas floods in residences are of greater worry when people are at home therefore it is meaningful to incorporate the human risk perception into the quantification of resilience to implement more effective flood mitigation measures in the inundation areas that affect people s work and home life due to the significant difference in the spatial distribution of people in different time periods it is necessary to divide a day into different periods to better determine the spatial distribution of people and investigate the flood resilience in detail in this study we classified the risk perception of people in the seven land use types for the time periods that people spend at work and at home the work hours correspond to the time of frequent activities when most people are at work or in school the rest hours represent the time when most people are at home the equation of p i t was rewritten as eq 8 the weights w were determined using the entropy weight method ewm and the analytic hierarchy process ahp the details are described in section 2 2 8 p i t 1 h i t h low 1 h i t h low h up h low w i 1 w i h i t h up h low h i t h up where w i represents the weight of the risk perception in grid i it is important to note that the lowest performance value of a grid remains 1 w i when the flood depth exceeds the upper threshold after using this resilience metric as a result the average values of p and res are relatively high the values of the system performance or resilience are relative values in this study a grid with a resilience value of 0 9 cannot be classified as high resilience unless the resilience of the other grids is less than 0 9 for an in depth analysis the resilience area ra and resilience area loss ral were defined in eqs 9 and 10 respectively 9 ra a r e s 10 ral a 1 r e s 2 2 calculation of the weights 2 2 1 the analytic hierarchy process in determining the risk perception weights for different land uses three aspects were considered the distribution of economy and assets the function of land uses serving for human society and the active state of people we used the ahp method which has been widely used for urban flood evaluation lin et al 2020 to calculate the weights of the risk perception related to the different land use types the subjective nature of the ahp fits well with the human risk perception the details of the ahp have been described by lyu et al 2018 ten experts including six professors and four senior engineers were invited to determine the weights this determination process consisted of two critical steps the first step was to rank the risk perception for the land uses in the two time periods the second step was to determine the values in the judgement matrix of the ahp to generate the weights of the land use types however in the second step the judgement matrix showed slight differences in the results for different experts fifteen sets of weights were generated for the work hours and the rest hours respectively the ewm was then utilized to distinguish the most informative set of weights 2 2 2 the entropy weight method the ewm was used to assign objective weights based on the discreteness of the data the method has been widely used for weight calibration and decision making the details of this method have been described by delgado and romero 2016 xu et al 2018 according to the information entropy theory which was proposed by shannon 1948 the information describes the degree of system order whereas the entropy describes the degree of system disorder the higher the uncertainty the greater the entropy is and the more information is contained in the system thus the data set with the highest score contains the most information we used the ewm to determine the optimum set of weights according to the scores for the work hours and the rest hours respectively in this manner we mitigated the influence of the subjective factors used in the ahp method 2 3 infoworks icm for flood modelling infoworks icm is a hydrodynamic model for urban pluvial flood modelling which integrates one dimensional 1d and two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic simulations in urban environments and river floodplains innovyze 2014 the 1d hydrodynamic simulation captured by the saint venant equations is generally for the flow modelling in the underground pipe networks while the 2d hydrodynamic simulation captured by the shallow water equations swe is utilized in the surface flood inundation modelling the modelling processes involved in the current research are the rainfall runoff calculation the 1d hydrodynamic simulation for the underground pipe networks and the 2d hydrodynamic simulation for surface inundation 3 case study 3 1 research region as shown in fig 3 the study area covers 95 28 km2 in the xiangzhou district of zhuhai south china located in the hinterland of the pearl river delta the research region is an area of high urbanization with dense population and buildings which is suitable for the investigation of urban flood resilience the area has a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average rainfall of 2061 9 mm and an annual average temperature of 22 4 c the rainfall distribution is uneven and 70 of the rainfall occurs in the wet season in the past few years heavy and frequent rainstorms have resulted in severe flood events in the research region adversely affecting people property and the environment eight land use types are included in the research region fig 4 i e agricultural land commercial land green land industrial land public land residential land traffic land and water these land use types cover 4 31 5 77 34 22 5 10 12 11 21 66 9 51 and 2 60 km2 respectively the land use diversity in the research region allows for applying the novel metric and will provide comprehensive results and guidance for urban flood resilience management the water areas including rivers pools and reservoirs were excluded from the flood simulation and resilience calculation zone the gis data of the one dimensional pipe network recorded rainfall recorded inundation areas and land use were provided by the zhuhai institute of urban planning design more information about the model development of the research region can refer to the supplementary material 3 2 design rainfalls design rainfalls with four return periods 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods were used in the simulation the design rainstorm equations in these return periods are displayed in fig 5 the equations were proposed by the zhuhai meteorological bureau in 2016 a rainfall event was defined as rainfall with 2 h duration a 1 minute time step and a peak coefficient of 0 521 the synthetic hyetograph is shown in fig 5 considering the duration of the design rainfalls and the convenience of resilience calculation we chose 4 h as the total simulation time t n 4 results 4 1 the weights of the risk perception in the seven land use types the ewm was used to compare the fifteen sets of weights obtained from the ahp for the work hours and the rest hours respectively table 2 shows the results for the work hours in which the weights in the last line and the scores in the last row were calculated using the ewm the optimum set of weights for the work hours was no 11 with a score of 0 1386 the public land traffic land and commercial land had the three largest weights the public land includes areas of public services such as electricity education administrative affairs and hospitals which are vital to the operation of the city and to people during the work hours due to frequent human activities in the work hours the traffic land plays an important role in transportation and rescue efforts during floods the commercial land provides employment for people and includes shopping centers and areas of business activities table 3 shows the results for the rest hours in which the weights in the last line and the scores in the last row were calculated using the ewm the optimum set of weights for the rest hours was no 7 with a score of 0 1412 the public residential and traffic lands had the three largest weights these results make sense because people mostly remain at home for entertainment or sleeping and public services such as water and electricity services are also necessary during the rest hours the comparison of the weights for the two time periods is shown in fig 6 there was a significant difference a change rate of 186 64 in the weights between the two time periods for the residential land the weights of the public land were the largest in both time periods indicating that floods on public lands posed the greatest threat to humans among all land uses in the traffic and commercial lands the weights were higher in the work hours than the rest hours indicating that the demand of people for transportation and work decreased was higher in the work hours than the rest hours the weights of the green and agricultural lands were similar for the two time periods and relatively low indicating that these areas were of low worry to people in the two time periods the differences in the weights between the two time periods indicated that the risk perception of people for the environment during flood events changed dynamically over time and was different for different locations the same adverse event occurring in different time periods resulted in disparate spatial influences this phenomenon should be considered in many aspects of flood management such as flood risk assessment project benefit evaluation and green infrastructure planning 4 2 flood resilience results eight scenarios were considered for modeling the floods i e the rainfall events of the 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods for the work hours and the rest hours the system performance of the entire research region and three representative sites for the eight scenarios are depicted in fig 7 in fig 7 a the overall system performance exhibited a similar trend in all scenarios the performance initially decreased sharply to the lowest point and then increased gradually the minimum values of all performance curves occurred at the same time 122 min exhibiting a slight lag behind the duration of the design rainfall 120 min statistical analysis indicated that the runoff volume exhibited strong similarity in many aspects of rainfall events in different return periods which was similar to the results reported by chen et al 2018 the largest inundation volume of the research region occurred at 124 min followed by that at 122 min it could be predicted at 122 min that the inundation volume of the research region was about to reach the maximum at this time the flood conditions of locations with high weight values were more serious than those at 124 min these findings explain why the minimum values of the performance curves occurred at the same time 122 min the results also demonstrated that the resilience of the system decreased with an increase in the rainfall return period indicating that the research region was more vulnerable during intense rainstorms the values of the system performance and resilience were close to 1 the reasons are that the proposed calculation method produced values close to 1 and most areas in the research region were not submerged even during a 100 year rainfall the research region performed better in the work hours than in the rest hours for the same rainfall event indicating that the resilience was higher in the work hours than the rest hours therefore the time period work or rest influenced the resilience of urban areas fig 7 b c and d show the system performances of the three representative sites s1 s2 and s3 respectively s1 the fuhuali business center is located in the core commercial area of zhuhai s2 the people s government of zhuhai is located on public land s3 the pingan apartment is located in a residential area unlike in the system performance curve of the entire research region the minimum values of the curve at the three sites were different for the four rainfall return periods the results indicated that different land uses showed different characteristics in different time periods that were closely related to the weights the ral of a land use type determines its impact on the overall resilience table 4 shows the resilience and the ral for the different land use types in the eight scenarios the ral values of the different land use types showed different characteristics for the two time periods in the work hours the public land and the traffic land had the two largest ral values and the traffic land had the lowest resilience value in the rest hours the public land and the residential land had the top two ral values and the public land had the lowest resilience value 4 3 analysis of resilience area loss ral the ral is an important attribute of land use types because it reveals the contribution to resilience loss when the ral of the research region and the land use types is compared therefore the analysis of the ral is necessary to investigate the characteristics of different land use types the contribution of the land use type to the overall ral alc was determined to assess the impact of the land use type on the overall resilience the alc is defined in eq 11 the resilience results indicated that there might be some relationships between the areas weights depth thresholds and alc of different land use types a higher alc can correspond to a larger area higher weight and lower thresholds for a specific land use type 11 alc i ral i totalral where alc i means alc of land use i the relationships between the alc area ratio a weight w and the reciprocal of the upper threshold t of the land use types are illustrated in fig 8 14 groups of symbols were generated for the combination of the seven land use types and the two time periods each group of symbols contained four points representing four return periods as shown in fig 8 a differences were observed in the alc of all land use types between the two time periods the points representing the same land use type were located at the same x axis value the alc values of any land use type exhibited relatively few differences between the four design rainfalls in the same time period in contrast the alc values generally exhibited large differences between the two time periods fig 8 b shows the relationship between a w and alc which implies the distribution of most points is linear after removing four outliers representing the residential land in the rest hours a regression line was fitted to the other points fig 8 c the regression line showed a good fit for the relationship between the products of a and w and alc r2 0 8978 indicating that the alc depended on the areas and weights for most urban land use types in summary the weight is a critical characteristic of the land use types in this resilience quantification method that considers the human risk perception the engineering resilience values were amplified or diminished according to actual human needs after adopting the novel resilience quantification method the integration of the human risk perception into the resilience assessment can guide more efficient resilience zoning and engineering planning 4 4 flood resilience mapping and analysis the grid based resilience values were classified into 5 levels very low low medium high and very high the spatial distributions of the resilience values in all scenarios are shown in fig 9 areas with very high resilience comprised the largest proportion of the total area in all scenarios whereas areas with relatively low resilience increased as the rainfall return period increased areas with different resilience levels exhibited different distribution characteristics for the two time periods for a given rainfall event the spatial distribution provides targeted guidance for flood mitigation measures rescue efforts and constructions to improve flood resilience in different rainfall return periods and the work and rest hours the area statistics of the different resilience levels are summarized in table 5 the areas with low and very low resilience to flood events were the most vulnerable locations from the human risk perception and should be considered for mitigation measures the results showed that areas with low and very low resilience increased as the rainfall return period increased in a given time period indicating that more people were influenced by more severe rainstorms a comparison of the areas in the 10 and 20 year return periods showed that the areas with low and very low resilience in the rest hours were larger than those in the work hours demonstrating that people were exposed to greater danger in the rest hours when encountering rainstorms with low return periods however for the 50 year and 100 year rainfall return periods the areas with low and very low resilience in the work hours were generally larger than those in the rest hours indicating that people were exposed to greater danger in the work hours when encountering rainstorms with high return periods 5 discussion in this study a novel metric for urban flood resilience that considers the active state of people the distribution of economy and assets and the function of land use types serving for human society was proposed to investigate the flood resilience characteristics in an urban area in contrast to the use of multi criteria indices based metrics the proposed method considers the dynamics and provides more precise results to guide flood risk management compared to traditional performance based metrics the novel method considers social aspects to achieve more practical resilience mapping although significant results were obtained some parameters are subjective such as the total simulation time t n and depth thresholds and the proposed method has certain limitations these issues are discussed to provide an in depth understanding of this method and guidance for future research and flood management 5 1 sensitivity analysis 5 1 1 influence of the total simulation time t n scenarios with a 50 year rainfall return period with 3 4 6 and 10 hour simulation durations in the work hours were analyzed to determine the influence of t n on resilience the resilience results of different t n are shown in fig 10 and table 6 it was found that areas of low and very low resilience increased as t n increased from 3 h to 10 h it can be predicted that the overall resilience will be close to 1 for a large t n because many inundated areas will return to the original system performance overall it can be concluded that as t n increases from 2 h to longer durations the resilience of the research region decreases initially and then gradually increases approaching 1 as t n increased areas with very low resilience increased whereas areas with low resilience decreased table 6 the areas with low and very low resilience were 1 371 1 874 1 861 and 1 702 km2 for 3 4 6 and 10 h of t n respectively therefore it was relatively more reasonable and conservative to choose 4 h as the total simulation time because more regions with low and very low resilience were obtained it is worth noting that 4 h is only a local value in this study which depends on the time of concentration of a basin and the functional state of the drainage system but it provides theoretical guidance for other studies that the approach presented in this paper can determine the optimal scheme of t n related to the local typical rainfalls which will provide more information for local engineering planning and construction 5 1 2 impacts of the depth thresholds an increase in the depth thresholds may be a suitable method to improve flood resilience it is unrealistic to raise the depth thresholds of the traffic agricultural and green lands because automobile exhausts crop varieties and plant species cannot be changed however it is possible to raise the depth thresholds of the public residential commercial and industrial lands by elevating the height of building doorsills in this study we raised the height of building doorsills by 0 2 m to investigate the impacts of different depth thresholds on urban flood resilience in this scheme the depth thresholds of the public residential commercial and industrial lands were 0 0 35 m 0 25 0 35 m 0 25 0 35 m and 0 25 0 35 m respectively scenarios with a 50 year rainfall return period in both time periods were used to determine the influence of a change in the building doorsills on resilience the resilience results of the original and the novel threshold schemes are shown in fig 11 and table 7 scenario 1 and scenario 2 represented the work hours for the original and novel threshold schemes respectively scenario 3 and scenario 4 represented the rest hours for the original and novel threshold schemes respectively a comparison of the results in fig 11 e and f or g and h indicated that an increase in the thresholds of the buildings increased resilience the results indicated that although an increase in the depth threshold only slightly increased the resilience of the entire research region it significantly decreased the areas with low and very low resilience in both time periods the use of the new threshold scheme increased the overall resilience by 0 07 and 0 09 in the work hours and rest hours respectively demonstrating that the overall resilience was not sensitive to a change in the depth threshold however areas with very low resilience low resilience showed decreases in the resilience of 7 88 and 20 38 9 43 and 10 41 in the work hours and rest hours respectively the finding indicated that an increase in the thresholds of buildings significantly reduced areas with low and very low resilience and this effect was more pronounced in the rest hours the ral and the change rates are shown in table 7 raising the building doorsills decreased the ral of the land use types in which the depth thresholds were designed to be elevated while it had no strengthening or weakening effect on the land use types with unchanged depth thresholds the ral change rates of commercial industrial public and residential lands all varied the same ratio between two time periods indicating that the weights and time periods did not affect the change rates of the ral moreover the largest decrease in the ral and the ral change rate were observed for the residential land implying that raising the building doorsills substantially reduced the ral or increased the resilience of the residential land the change rates of the ral were higher in the commercial industrial and residential lands than the public land it is worth noting that the commercial industrial and residential lands have high impervious ratios therefore it could be concluded that the depth thresholds had more impacts on the impervious than non impervious areas which was consistent with the results reported by wang et al 2019 5 2 limitations and improvements the proposed metric did not consider the coping and recovery abilities of human society such as disaster warning systems and disaster insurance generally it is difficult to obtain indicators of social aspects at high spatial resolution kotzee and reyers 2016 questionnaire surveys and social media may be possible solutions allaire 2016 although this approach is time and resource intensive a more thorough and comprehensive result can be obtained if more resilience indices related to socioeconomic perspectives are used to develop the system performance curve the proposed metric is not suitable for larger research regions such as the entire zhuhai city establishing a detailed two dimensional hydrodynamic model at the city or larger scales requires large amounts of data and extensive work lyu et al 2019 most importantly there are significant spatial differences in the same land use type in large regions and the same time period the resilience results would not be precise if the proposed metric were applied to a large region in this case accurate spatial population and economic data should be utilized to optimize the resilience equations these data can be obtained using modern technologies such as the baidu heat map li et al 2019 and nighttime light observations from remote sensing data wu et al 2013 in addition the novel flood resilience metric assumes that the system performance changes linearly with the inundation depth provided that the depth is within the two thresholds with the help of the vulnerability curve more improvement works can be done to these functions in the future which will make the resilience assessment result more in line with reality 6 conclusions a novel flood resilience quantification method that considers human risk perceptions including the living working environment and the risk perception for different land use during flood events was proposed to investigate the resilience to floods in an urban area in zhuhai south china two depth thresholds and weights of the risk perception for different land use types were used to improve the system performance curve the proposed method could identify areas vulnerable to floods while considering the living working environment of people eight scenarios four design rainfall return periods and the work and rest hours of people were used to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of resilience to flood in the research region in addition sensitivity analyses of the total simulation time and the depth thresholds were conducted the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the work hours the top three land use types with the largest weights of risk perceptions during flood events were the public traffic and commercial lands in the rest hours the top three land use types were the public residential and traffic lands there were significant differences in the weights between the work hours and the rest hours indicating that the dependence of humans on the environment during flood events changed dynamically over time and in space the residential land exhibited the largest differences in weights between the two time periods 2 in both time periods the overall resilience decreased as the rainfall return period increased and the areas of low and very low resilience also increased the research region exhibited less resilience in the rest hours than the work hours for the same rainfall event indicating that the active state of people in different time periods influenced the resilience of urban areas to floods 3 there were only slight differences in the alc values of each land use type in the same time period whereas significant differences were observed between the two time periods the areas and weights had a strong influence on the alc values for most urban areas 4 as the total simulation time increased from 2 h to larger values the resilience of the research region initially decreased and then increased in this study a total simulation time of 4 h provided the most reasonable and conservative results as the largest areas of low and very low resilience were revealed therefore this simulation scheme provided excellent guidance for providing critical rescue resources and engineering planning although this scheme cannot be generalized to any case other studies can use similar procedures for optimizing the parameters 5 although an increase in the height of building doorsills slightly increased the resilience of the overall system it substantially decreased the areas with low and very low resilience and this effect was more pronounced in the rest hours elevating the building thresholds reduced the ral significantly and increased the resilience of the residential land moreover a change in the depth thresholds had more impacts on the resilience of impervious lands than on pervious lands although a novel flood resilience quantification method is proposed and some meaningful results have been drawn in this paper the definition of the upper and the lower depth thresholds in system performance functions related to different land use types should be deeply researched in future studies more detailed data including building structures road capacity flood tolerance of plants and related numerical models are expected to be included in the decision of depth thresholds in addition more resilience

4277,stemflow has long been recognized as an important ecohydrological process in drylands and may influence dynamics of woody plants by altering rainfall redistribution however quantification of the effects of stemflow on woody plants dynamics remains largely unclear it is also unknown whether the effects of stemflow are consistent for individual plants and ecosystems where woody plants grow this study developed an ecohydrological model to explore how stemflow affected individual woody plants and ecosystems and how the effects changed along a rainfall gradient 10 600 mm in a dryland ecosystem this study demonstrated the positive effects of stemflow on woody plants in both individual by a degree of 16 48 and ecosystem scales by a degree of 8 45 stemflow started to promote woody plant growth in the individual scale even when annual rainfall was very low 50 mm whereas stemflow did not exert strong influences for the whole ecosystems until annual precipitation was higher than 130 mm however the effects of stemflow in ecosystem scale might surpass the counterpart in individual scale under some ranges of annual rainfall namely the effects of stemflow in individual and ecosystem scales mismatched the positive feedback between woody cover and stemflow may cause the unequal effects of stemflow for individual plants and ecosystems overall this study quantified how stemflow affected woody plants in individual and ecosystem scales which may contribute to dryland restorations by assisting vegetation configuration and being integrated into dynamic global vegetation model keywords stemflow ecohydrological model drylands woody plants individual ecosystem scale 1 introduction drylands cover approximately 41 of the global terrestrial land surface and support 38 of the global population cherlet et al 2018 reynolds et al 2007 the extent of global drylands may expand by 11 23 by the end of this century huang et al 2016 land degradations induced by soil erosion climate change and anthropogenic activities may become more severe emgun 2011 ipcc 2014 therefore the prevention of degradation and restoration of degraded ecosystems tend to be more urgent woody plants are important components of dryland ecosystems along with grasses and biological soil crusts biocrusts compound organisms containing cyanobacteria algae lichen and moss that cover land surface weber et al 2016 covering at least 18 of dryland surface globally fao 2016 woody plants play a significant role in controlling degradation and promoting restoration because they reduce wind water erosion shapotou 1991 wei et al 2007 thereby creating suitable conditions for grasses and biocrusts especially the latter zhang et al 2016a and by redistributing resources to facilitate self organization e g water nutrients ravi et al 2007 rietkerk et al 2002 although some previous studies suggested that shrubs which are woody plants may cause land degradation by increasing erosion connectivity d odorico et al 2013 eldridge et al 2011 the significance of woody plants tends to be more prominent in semiarid and dry subhumid regions which account for around 60 of dryland surface globally fao 2016 therefore it is critical to understand woody plant dynamics in dryland ecosystems under current and future climates among the effects of woody plants on degradation restoration water resource redistribution may be key as water is the main limiting factor in drylands woody plants can dramatically influence several hydrological processes such as horizontal water redistribution by creating runoff runon patches soil evaporation by shading d odorico et al 2013 turnbull et al 2010 and soil water redistribution by hydraulic redistribution horton and hart 1998 neumann and cardon 2012 in addition there is a unique process specific to woody plants known as stemflow defined as the proportion of rainfall that is intercepted by a woody plant canopy and then funneled into soils via stems johnson and lehmann 2006 levia et al 2011 pressland 1976 there have been few studies on stemflow until recently jian et al 2018 levia and germer 2015 pressland 1976 stan et al 2020 van and gordon 2018 previous studies mainly focused on the strength influencing factors and the associated ecohydrological effects of stemflow on soil water content stan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 for example the proportion of stemflow to annual rainfall decreases from 40 to 1 as the annual rainfall increase with an average value of around 10 in drylands levia and germer 2015 magliano et al 2019 stemflow as a preferential flow can be funneled into deep soils and then used by deep rooted woody plants johnson and lehmann 2006 van and gordon 2018 wang et al 2011 substantial field observations have suggested that the wetting island effect created by stemflow could be crucial to woody plant distribution growth and reproduction particularly in dryland ecosystems germer et al 2010 li et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 in spite of a relatively low ratio of stemflow to annual rainfall stemflow may disproportionately contribute to the replenishment of soil water and growth of individual woody plants and this phenomenon has had been extensively explored johnson and lehmann 2006 liang et al 2015 however the strong effects of stemflow on individual woody plants through the supply of extra water do not necessarily benefit the whole ecosystem because there are often large non woody areas e g bare land in drylands liang et al 2015 that is the patterns of stemflow effects on woody plant dynamics may differ at individual and ecosystem scales which is still largely unknown because the effects of stemflow at ecosystem scale is not paid enough attention previously levia and germer 2015 li et al 2008 stan et al 2020 wei et al 2007 furthermore increasing water input may alleviate the discrepancy between the effects of stemflow on individual plants and ecosystems because woody cover is high when there is high annual rainfall under global climate change rainfall regimes stemflow patterns and the coupling between stemflow production and woody plant dynamics may be altered huang et al 2016 ipcc 2014 and in turn affect woody plant distribution therefore the ecological effects of stemflow on woody plant dynamics need to be quantified which is still far from reaching e g jian et al 2018 levia and germer 2015 li et al 2008 martinezmeza and whitford 1996 this study developed an ecohydrological model and was parameterized according to a long term restoration project in the southeastern fringe of the tengger desert northwestern china shapotou region it explored the stemflow patterns and their effects on woody plant dynamics along an annual rainfall gradient two hypotheses were presented 1 stemflow may have a stronger effect on individual woody plants than on the ecosystem in which woody plants grow 2 the differences between the effects of stemflow at the individual and ecosystem levels may shrink as annual rainfall increases 2 materials and methods in this study an ecohydrological model instead of the observational or experimental approaches was employed to investigate the hypotheses because 1 the growth of woody vegetation is generally very slow i e decades to a century and thus a very long time is needed to monitor woody plant dynamics and 2 it is nearly infeasible to monitor and survey the effects of stemflow on vegetation dynamics along an annual rainfall gradient the process based ecohydrological model was revised from jia et al 2019 here we only give a brief introduction to the general model framework and more emphases is placed on what is new in the present model particularly with regards to stemflow production 2 1 general model framework there are two components in the model a water balance model and a vegetation model the water balance model consists of seven processes rainfall r mm day 1 stemflow sf mm land surface runoff r mm day 1 infiltration f mm day 1 evaporation e mm day 1 transpiration t mm day 1 and drainage d mm day 1 laio et al 2001 soil water processes i e the latter four are simulated by a multi layered soil which consists of biocrust z1 mm and subsurface z12 mm shallow z2 mm and deep soil layers z3 mm from the top to the bottom corradini et al 2011 rainfall is assumed to be the only water input into the ecosystems although fog or groundwater may be important in some dryland areas li et al 2018 a proportion of the rainfall captured by the woody canopy produces stemflow evaporation occurs in the upper three soil layers i e all except deep soil layer and the canopy ec mm day 1 also known as interception loss runoff and infiltration are functions of soil water content and the rainfall characteristics the vegetation model accounted for three major lifeforms in drylands deep rooted woody plants w shallow rooted grasses g and biocrusts b because they interact with each other directly or indirectly d onofrio et al 2015 donofrio et al 2018 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b biocrust is included as a system state variable because it is an important component of drylands and significantly influences ecohydrological processes chamizo et al 2016 chen et al 2018 woody plants mainly refer to shrubs because they are dominant woody growth form in drylands although forests may also be present fao 2016 vegetation cover is used to measure vegetation dynamics woody plants grasses and biocrusts can use the soil water stored in the deep s3 dimensionless shallow s2 dimensionless and subsurface soil s12 dimensionless and the biocrust s1 dimensionless layers respectively therefore the subsurface soil and shallow layers are also called the grass layer s22 dimensionless the deep layer is called woody layer the subsurface soil layer is included in the grass layer because it 1 is thick enough 2 significantly differs from the shallow soil layer which means that it should be considered separately and 3 is within the root distribution range of grasses chen et al 2017 jia et al 2019 li et al 2007 the growth gi dimensionless i w g b and death μi dimensionless i w g b rates of the vegetation are functions of soil water content si i 1 12 2 3 which is the coupling point for two integrant models d onofrio et al 2015 soil water in the corresponding layer is assumed to be negligible for the other lifeforms if not entirely unavailable due to the root depth separation among the three lifeforms chen et al 2017 schenk and jackson 2002 however root depth separation may be not valid for some ecosystems hutchings and john 2003 iversen et al 2017 and the assumption should be treated with caution overall the general model framework can be written as the following ordinary differential equations 1a ds 1 dt 1 n 1 z 1 f 1 e 1 t 1 d 1 1b ds 12 dt 1 n 12 z 12 f 12 e 12 t 12 d 1 d 12 1c ds 2 dt 1 n 2 z 2 f 2 e 2 t 2 d 12 d 2 1d ds 3 dt 1 n 3 z 3 f 3 s f t 3 d 2 d 3 1e db dt g b s 1 b 1 b μ b s 1 b 1f dg dt g g s 22 g 1 g μ g s 22 g 1g dw dt g w s 3 w 1 w μ w s 3 w where w g and b range from 0 to 1 and soil water content is the relative volumetric type divided by soil porosity ni unless specifically stated s22 is averaged over the soil water contents of the subsurface soil s12 and shallow soil layers s2 weighted by their thickness the time step is one day more detailed information about the meanings and dimensions of the variables and function symbols used in this study are given in table 1 2 2 precipitation the timing of the rainfall r was simulated using a poisson rainfall process with an average rainfall frequency λ event day 1 and a mean rainfall event size α mm event 1 the size of a rainfall event r can be modelled as f r 1 α e r α in this study the marked poisson process was not used to simulate the rainfall events sequence because it was necessary to explicitly describe the ineffective rainfall threshold rather than just setting a specific value laio et al 2001 in this study the rainfall frequency was a saturated function of annual precipitation otherwise the simulation of rainfall events may be unreasonable at the low or high ends for annual rainfall the relationship between rainfall frequency and annual precipitation was obtained by fitting the data for annual precipitation and precipitation frequency from the national meteorological information center china 2 3 stemflow in contrast to the original model proposed by jia et al 2019 on which our model was based this study considered and simulated stemflow processes using an ecohydrological model i e we connected ecological processes such as vegetation dynamics with hydrological processes because the stemflow process has been largely ignored in other ecohydrological modelling studies more specifically this study explored the dynamics of stemflow using a minimum model revised from gash 1979 and carlyle moses and price 1999 only stemflow processes and canopy evaporation were explicitly investigated the trunk evaporation was negligible due to the small stem surface relative to the leaves and lack of empirical data to be validated against and was ignored to avoid potential complexity in the simulation the effects of canopy structure e g canopy thickness branch inclination angle and bark properties e g bark roughness were not taken into account because they were outside the focus of this study a simple index of stemflow water flux in terms of percentage of incident rainfall was used to quantify the stemflow process so that it was compatible with the two scales individual and ecosystem scale investigated in this study levia and germer 2015 one rainfall event can be divided into two parts free throughfall and interception by the woody plant canopy the latter of which leads to stemflow canopy evaporation ec and released throughfall as opposed to free throughfall fig 1 a crockford and richardson 2000 dunkerley 2000 at the ecosystem scale the interception qeco and free throughfall peco portions are estimated as the absolute percentages of woody plant cover and non woody plant cover within a specific ground area respectively qeco 100 peco however at the individual scale the interception qind and free throughfall pind portions are measured using a relative cover approach qind 100 pind fig 1a previous studies generally investigated stemflow dynamics at the individual scale here stemflow dynamics at the ecosystem scale and their associated effects on vegetation were also investigated when the intercepted rainfall is less than the canopy water capacity ecc then all the intercepted rainfall will be lost to the atmosphere i e canopy evaporation no stemflow and released throughfall fig 1b laio et al 2001 when the intercepted rainfall is larger than the canopy water capacity then the largest amount of canopy water capacity is lost to the atmosphere and the residual intercepted rainfall is released as throughfall and stemflow the latter of which is a linear function of total intercepted rainfall named the stemflow coefficient pt therefore individual and ecosystem scales differ in the way that they simulate woody cover absolute vs relative cover here absolute and relative cover is defined as the proportion covered by woody plants against a specific land surface and against the land surface within canopy range respectively and thus the intercepted rainfall and stemflow the index used to quantify stemflow in this study slightly differs from the widely used index which is a function of total precipitation i e percentage of incident rainfall s r gash 1979 levia and germer 2015 we made this revision because the original index is not applicable for event sizes 3 mm below which threshold rainfall events may account for 50 of the annual rainfall in some ecosystems including the ecosystem investigated here 2a s f i 0 r ec c r e c c q i p t r e c c i e c o o r i n d 2b e c i r q i r ec c e c c q i r e c c i e c o o r i n d where eco and ind denote the ecosystem and individual scales respectively stemflow can funnel into the deep soil layer via root induced preferential flow fig 1b johnson and lehmann 2006 li et al 2009 liang et al 2015 martinezmeza and whitford 1996 for example liang et al 2009 found that when stemflow water was sprinkled onto shrubs the stemflow water could significantly recharge soil water 40 50 cm below ground but not the shallower layers i e 0 40 cm below ground in some cases root induced preferential flow can also recharge the shallow soil layer to a certain extent wang et al 2011 due to factors such as the shallow distributed roots of woody plants and or hydraulic lift when deep soil water levels are high yu and d odorico 2015 however we assumed that the funneled stemflow was only available to woody plants because stemflow production lags behind the infiltration process which directly recharges soil water especially shallow water stan et al 2020 that is besides the widely acknowledged infiltration and drainage processes woody plants have another water transport path stemflow therefore the effective rainfall r mm day 1 that directly arrives at the land surface i e overall throughfall including both free and released throughfall and then becomes infiltration or runoff water tends to be low 3 r r s f i e c i i e c o o r i n d 2 4 infiltration and runoff infiltration that directly recharges soil water is the major water source for woody plants grasses and biocrusts a simple bucket model is used to simulate the infiltration process in four layered soils chen et al 2018 laio et al 2001 unless one upper layer is saturated no infiltrated rainfall penetrates the deeper layers when all four layers are saturated extra rainfall will produce runoff which is supposed to be lost from the ecosystem thus rainfall infiltration in layered soils is expressed by the following equations 4a f 1 s 1 r r r i 1 1 n i z i m i δ t i 1 1 n i z i m i δ t r i 1 1 n i z i m i δ t 4b f 12

eq 4b f2 eq 4c and f3 eq 4d occur therefore the total infiltration for one layer is simulated as 4e f i 1 b f i v bf i b i 1 12 2 3 where fi b and fi v are infiltration terms for land with or without a biocrust respectively then the runoff term can be estimated as 5 r 0 r i 1 1 12 2 3 n i z i m i δ t r i 1 1 12 2 3 n i z i m i δ t r i 1 1 12 2 3 n i z i m i δ t 2 5 soil evaporation when the soil

ei reaches its maximum value efc i mm day 1 within this range ei is a function of soil water content and the overall step function can be described as follows d onofrio et al 2015 6a e i s i 0 s i s h

evaporation therefore the realized evaporation rate ei r mm day 1 is modeled as 6b e i r e i 1 g w e i θ g g θ w w where θg and θw dimensionless are the sheltering coefficients of grasses and woody plants respectively 2 6 transpiration the three lifeforms woody plant grass and biocrust consume soil water by transpiration ti the transpiration rate is also a step function of the soil water content below the soil wilting point sw i dimensionless the transpiration rate approaches zero and above soil field capacity the transpiration rate reaches its maximum value tmax mm day 1 overall the transpiration rate can be expressed by the following equation baudena et al 2007 d onofrio et al 2015 7 t i s i 0 s i s w i t m a x i s i s w i s f c i s w i s w i s i s f c i t m a x i s f c i s i 1

water content reaches soil field capacity and approaches saturated hydraulic conductivity ks i mm day 1 when the soil water content reaches 1 thus the drainage rate is expressed as d onofrio et al 2015 8 d i s i k s i e β i s i s fc i 1 e β i s i s fc i 1 i 1 12 2 3 where βi dimensionless denotes the water retention coefficient 2 8 vegetation growth the growth and death rates for the lifeforms woody plant grass and biocrust are functions of soil water content the direct interaction e g competition and facilitation between woody plants grasses and biocrusts are not considered here because hydrological processes are the focus of this study below the soil wilting point sw i vegetation cannot grow gi si 0 day 1 and the death rate reaches its maximum μi si μmax i day 1 in contrast when the

on the southeastern edge of the tengger desert northern china the mean annual temperature rainfall potential evaporation and wind velocity are 10 182 5 mm 2900 mm and 2 9 m s 1 respectively around 80 of the annual rainfall falls in the growth season which is late april to mid september around 200 days the mean rainfall frequency and event size are around 3 65 mm and 50 events respectively shapotou 1991 the water table is 60 m below ground and thus is unavailable to even deep rooted woody plants the region belongs to temperate cold deserts and is classified as desert steppe in 1956 the region was revegetated to protect the baotou lanzhou railway and in 2012 the vegetation cover was around 10 35 and 80 for woody plants grass and biocrust respectively the land surface is covered by biocrust and the underlying soil layer is a typically sandy soil that is the soil field capacity is much higher in the biocrust layer 24 than in the underlying sand layers i e shallow and deep soil layers 6 to initial the model we set the soil water content of biocrust and the subsurface shallow and deep soil layers to 5 5 3 and 3 respectively vegetation cover was set to 1 for all three lifeforms different initial soil water contents and vegetation cover produced similar results and conclusions these results are not reported the thickness of the biocrust and the subsurface shallow and deep soil layers were set to 0 18 0 57 225 300 and 1200 mm respectively jia et al 2019 li et al 2014 increasing rate of biocrust thickness was obtained by fitting a linear regression to empirical data and subsurface soil layer linearly increased in thickness with a rate of 0 4 mm year 1 li et al 2007 the left part of first 300 mm below ground belongs to shallow soil layer the stemflow and free throughfall coefficients were 20 and 70 respectively according to previous studies zhang et al 2015 please refer to table 2 and jia et al 2019 for more information about parameter meanings and values the model was run with a time step of one day to match the temporal scale of the hydrological processes and then the model simulation results were converted to a one year scale to match the temporal scale of the ecohydrological processes vegetation dynamics this enabled the effects of stemflow on woody plants to be explored two versions of the model at the individual and ecosystem scales were run the different versions simulated the same hydrological processes except for stemflow where different algorithms sfind and sfeco eqns 2 were used for the individual and ecosystem scales respectively refer to section 2 3 to calibrate the model we ran the two different versions for 59 years using the observed time series for annual rainfall and the observed rainfall frequency two kinds of model calibrations were conducted first we derived the simulation data for vegetation cover woody plant and grass and soil water content shallow and deep soil layers at the ecosystem scale with and without stemflow and compared the results with the observed time series data a two tailed paired wilcoxon signed test was used and the significance level was set to 0 05 the simulation data for the individual scale were not accurate and thus not used the observed time series data were obtained from the cern chinese ecosystem research network shaptou station database then we calculated the ratio of stemflow to incident rainfall from the simulation data at the individual scale i e s r and compared it with the reported values for this region please refer to fig 2 for the illumination of model calibration we conducted sensitivity analyses of the free throughfall coefficient because it could strongly affect the results another six free throughfall levels 40 50 60 80 90 and 100 in addition to the 70 used here were tested similar patterns were obtained although the exact values of the patterns differed slightly fig s1 2 10 simulations in hypotheses testing we are more interested in the final states of the model under different annual rainfall rather than dynamics during restoration in model calibration therefore the thickness of four soil soil layers were set to 18 57 225 and 1200 mm respectively to investigate the hypotheses raised above we first set up an annual rainfall sequence which was 10 600 mm and covered most of the dryland regions if not entirely d odorico et al 2013 emgun 2011 the annual rainfall increment was 10 mm when simulating rainfall events rainfall frequency is a saturated function of annual rainfall which means that a reasonable simulation can be obtained the simulation was based on the climate data from the national meteorological information center china 531 points located across the drylands we used the specific annual rainfall to tune the rainfall intensity so that it reached the corresponding rainfall frequency then the model was run for 300 years until it finally reached a stable state the last 10 years were used to conduct the calculations a total of 100 replications were used to smooth the potential fluctuation induced by the stochastic rainfall events these simulations were conducted using matlab r2018b the influence of stemflow on vegetation dynamics was quantified by two simulations without stemflow no stemflow was produced from canopy interception and all the intercepted rainfall was allocated to interception loss or released throughfall and with stemflow canopy intercepts some of the rainfall and produces stemflow another four levels of the stemflow coefficient 10 30 40 and 50 besides 0 and 20 were also tested to explore the generalization of the stemflow effects on vegetation dynamics 2 11 statistical analyses and hypotheses testing the effects of stemflow on woody plant dynamics were estimated from the differences in woody plant cover between with and without stemflow e g wi i 10 20 30 40 and 50 wi i 0 fig 2 to test hypotheses we fitted the trends in differences of the stemflow effects between the individual and ecosystem levels along an annual rainfall gradient using the generalized additive model gam realized by gam function in the mgcv package chen et al 2019 curtis and simpson 2014 the gam was used because it is robust to fit unknown relationships a gaussian distribution family an identity link function a maximum likelihood smoothing parameter estimation a newton numerical optimization and a cubic regression spline penalized smoothing basis in the smooth term were used in the gam fitting process the dimension of the basis used to represent the smoothing term was selected to minimize the akaike information criterion if the gam fitting of the difference of stemflow effects between the ecosystem and individual levels always showed negative values hypothesis 1 would be supported further if the gam fittings showed significant increasing trends unnecessary to be positive within some ranges of the annual rainfall gradient identified as the ranges where zero was not included in the 95 confidence interval of the first derivatives of the gam fittings then hypothesis 2 would be supported chen et al 2019 simpson 2011 all the statistical analyses were conducted using r software version 4 0 4 r core team 2021 please refer to fig 2 for the illumination of model simulation and hypothesis testing 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation fig 3 shows that the simulated values with stemflow blue lines captured the general pattern of the observed values black lines especially over the last 15 years although the simulated values with a stemflow coefficient of 0 i e without considering stemflow red lines also performed well when the soil water contents and grass cover were fitted that is the effect of stemflow was only significant for woody cover due to the preferential flow to deep rooted woody plants p value 0 001 fig 3e and was not significant for shallow and deep soil water contents and grass cover p values 0 933 0 312 0 409 respectively figs 3b d in addition the ratio of annual summed stemflow at the individual level to annual rainfall i e s r 8 2 was consistent with the 8 measured in the field which validated the model used here wang et al 2011 3 2 stemflow pattern along an annual rainfall gradient the amount of stemflow at the individual red lines and ecosystem blue lines scales linearly or exponentially increased with increasing annual rainfall respectively insert boxes in fig 4 a however the stemflow amount at the ecosystem scale tended to be 0 when annual rainfall was lower than 200 mm and increased much faster than that for the individual scale when annual rainfall was higher than 200 mm fig 4a under an annual rainfall of 600 mm stemflow amounts at the ecosystem scale 0 17 0 35 0 60 0 91 and 1 20 mm day 1 were larger than those at the individual scale 0 17 0 34 0 50 0 67 and 0 80 mm day 1 under stemflow coefficients of 10 20 30 40 and 50 respectively insert box in fig 4a therefore the differences in stemflow volume between the ecosystem and individual scales increased from negative as low as 0 19 mm day 1 to positive values as high as 0 37 mm day 1 as annual rainfall increased that is stemflow amount at the ecosystem scale caught up with or surpassed that at the individual scale as annual rainfall increased furthermore the higher stemflow coefficients strengthened the patterns fig 4a as the stemflow coefficient green to red lines increased the critical point in annual rainfall where stemflow amount at the ecosystem scale surpassed that at the individual scale came earlier from 600 mm under a stemflow coefficient of 10 to 400 mm under a stemflow coefficient of 50 fig 4a the percentage of incident rainfall s r had a similar pattern to stemflow volume except at the ecosystem scale where it increased asymptotically with annual rainfall instead of linearly for stemflow amount at the ecosystem scale fig 4b as the annual rainfall increased the percentage of incident rainfall at the individual level rose rapidly ranging from 4 to 20 and then stabilized at 6 11 17 22 and 28 stemflow coefficients of 10 20 30 40 and 50 respectively insert box in fig 4b the difference between the two scales quickly dropped to as low as 20 but then gradually increased toward positive values up to 12 fig 4b 3 3 effects of stemflow on woody cover woody cover increased with annual rainfall and stemflow generally benefited woody cover at both the individual and ecosystem scales although the effects at the ecosystem scale tended to be negligible when annual rainfall was lower than 130 mm fig 5 a b the positive effects of stemflow on woody cover at the individual scale increased significantly ranging from 16 to 48 when the stemflow coefficient increased from 10 to 50 blue lines when annual rainfall was lower than 300 mm but then shrunk significantly to 8 31 cyan lines fig 5a the positive effects at the ecosystem scale started to emerge when annual rainfall was higher than 130 mm and exhibited no shrink except for stemflow coefficient of 50 where the positive effects slightly decreased when annual rainfall was lower than 520 mm cyan line in fig 5b stemflow could boost the growth of woody plants by increasing woody cover 8 14 21 34 and 45 under stemflow coefficients of 10 20 30 40 and 50 fig 5b the differences in woody cover at ecosystem and individual scales showed similar patterns to the differences in the percentages of incident rainfall between the two scales figs 4b 5c relative to the ecosystem scale stemflow at the individual scale was more likely to contribute to higher woody cover at the low end of annual rainfall the values for annual rainfall where stemflow at the individual scale had stronger effects than those at the ecosystem scale decreased from 600 mm under a stemflow coefficient of 10 to 440 mm under a stemflow coefficient of 50 solid lines in fig 5c the critical points for annual rainfall 440 600 mm where the difference in the effects of stemflow on woody cover between the two scales switched from negative to positive values were higher than the points for the differences in the percentage of incident rainfall 400 600 mm 4 discussion although the effects of stemflow on vegetation dynamics have long been recognized studies on stemflow have generally focused on hydrological processes e g stemflow production and recharge of soil water from stemflow at timescales of 1 year these studies have used mainly observational or experimental approaches li et al 2008 pressland 1976 there has been no quantification of the effects of stemflow on vegetation dynamics over long periods of time the long term monitoring data 30 years and process based ecohydrological model used in this study showed that stemflow had a positive effect on woody plants at both the individual and ecosystem scales especially when annual rainfall was 130 mm however the positive effects of stemflow on individual plants do not necessarily cause equivalently positive effects in the ecosystems where woody plants grow i e higher woody cover when annual rainfall is high e g 440 mm increases in woody cover at the ecosystem scale due to the interaction between ecological and hydrological processes may be larger than that at the individual scale solely due to hydrological processes the quantification of the effects of stemflow are important when setting restoration targets and selecting species for restoration programs this study found that both the amount of stemflow and the percentage of incident rainfall increased with increasing annual rainfall which was generally opposite to previous findings llorens and domingo 2007 for instance magliano et al 2019 reported that the amount of stemflow was constant along an annual rainfall gradient and the percentage of incident rainfall decreased from 10 to 1 along an annual rainfall gradient of 100 800 mm vs increased from 0 to 11 along an annual rainfall gradient of 0 600 mm in this study when the stemflow coefficient 20 the primary reason for this discrepancy may be that previous studies generally used multi site synthetic world data rather than single site data along an annual rainfall gradient there were other differences such as measuring species change along an annual rainfall gradient using a multi site synthetic approach rather than the single site approach used in this study the turnover of woody species e g from short shrubs to tall trees along an annual rainfall gradient which was not taken into account in this study may significantly reduce the percentage of incident rainfall e g from 9 4 to 3 5 magliano et al 2019 navar 2011 however this study was generally consistent with many other single site studies which also demonstrated that the amount of stemflow and the percentage of incident rainfall increased along an incident annual rainfall gradient martinezmeza and whitford 1996 yang et al 2010 when the incident rainfall increases more water can be used to produce stemflow as the canopy interception loss does not exceed the canopy water capacity even during a very large rainfall event e g 20 mm fig s2 the annual rainfall gradient is realized by tuning rainfall intensity to reach a specific annual rainfall level because the rainfall event frequency along the annual rainfall gradient is obtained by fitting a saturated function of the observed values national meteorological information center china 13 75 events each year therefore the annual rainfall gradient used in this study was obtained using a similar incident rainfall density the simulated value for percentage of incident rainfall reported here was similar to previous studies in this region wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 and other dryland ecosystems levia and germer 2015 magliano et al 2019 martinezmeza and whitford 1996 yang et al 2010 this study quantified the contributions of stemflow to individual woody plants and ecosystems which has been largely ignored in previous ecohydrological research despite the important role stemflow plays in recharging soil water levia and germer 2015 pressland 1976 wang et al 2011 generally stemflow is produced by specific individual woody plants and it is regarded as an accessory hydrological process for woody plants levia et al 2011 van and gordon 2018 when studying stemflow alone from a hydrological perspective the temporal extent ranges from several rain events i e days to seasons and the spatial extent is based on the individual plant or several individuals magliano et al 2019 however when studying both stemflow and vegetation dynamics from an ecological perspective temporal extent can be years or even decades furthermore spatial extent is based on area and generally much larger than that of individual woody plants the primary reason for not quantifying the effects on vegetation dynamics may be the mismatch between the temporal days seasons vs years decades and spatial meters vs kilometers scales in stemflow and vegetation dynamics research van and gordon 2018 as expected stemflow has a positive role on both individual woody plants and ecosystems where woody plants grow because funneled stemflow into deep soils increases the water supply for woody plants liang et al 2015 however the effects of stemflow are different at the two scales the positive effects that stemflow has on individual plants may not be able to produce equivalent positive effects at the ecosystem scale or cause a stronger positive response in woody cover fig 5 the interaction between stemflow and woody cover and or other processes may form a positive feedback and thereby dramatically alter the effects of stemflow on woody cover that is high woody cover can intercept more rainfall and produce more root preferential flow into the deep soil layer which will benefit woody plants in return however when annual rainfall is low woody cover is generally low which substantially limits the strength of the positive feedback between stemflow and woody cover therefore although stemflow can increase the water resource for woody plants at very low annual rainfall levels e g 10 100 mm it cannot increase woody cover at the ecosystem scale until annual rainfall is 130 mm fig 5 s2 when the stemflow coefficient is low e g 10 it is more difficult for woody cover to reach a critical value where the positive feedback leads to greater woody cover at the ecosystem scale overall the positive feedback between stemflow and woody cover is an allee effect at the ecosystem scale which leads to a mismatch between individual and ecosystem scales about the effects of positive feedback between stemflow and woody cover allee and bowen 1932 in this study we developed a process based ecohydrological model to systematically quantify the role of stemflow on vegetation dynamics jia et al 2019 this model performed well and it can be applied to other dryland ecosystems with different soil characteristics e g soil field capacity and soil depths and species compositions however before applying this model framework the assumptions made in this study need to be emphasized the most important assumption was that the produced stemflow is totally funneled into the deep soil layer and thus only available to deep rooted woody plants different woody species may exhibit different root induced preferential flow strengths and thus influence the available stemflow induced rainfall input johnson and lehmann 2006 this assumption may need to be evaluated for ecosystems with large biocrust and subsurface and shallow soil layer field capacities and with overlapped root distributions between woody plants and grasses in the former case the upper soil layers may partially consume the funneled stemflow and reduce the amount that reaches the deep soil layer wang et al 2011 in this context the positive effects of stemflow on woody plants at the ecosystem scale may become less significant until the annual rainfall is very high which may be unrealistic for dryland ecosystems in the latter case shallow rooted woody plants i e woody plants with lateral root distribution can redistribute funneled stemflow to the shallow soil layers as well as the deep soil layers which would benefit non woody plants in addition the overlapped root distribution between shallow rooted woody plants and grasses may complicate the soil hydrological dynamics e g the competition for soil water between woody plants and grasses should be considered to understand ecosystem dynamics correctly another important hydrological process hydraulic redistribution is not considered here it can transfer soil water from the bottom to the top or the top to the bottom soil layers neumann and cardon 2012 root preferential flow to shallow soil layers for shallow rooted woody plants or to the deep soil layers for deep rooted woody plants may interact with hydraulic redistribution producing stronger or weaker hydraulic redistributions yu and d odorico 2015 other assumptions such as the water input from rainfall and the saturated function between rainfall frequency and annual rainfall may also affect the conclusions reached here and these need further investigation overall the effects of stemflow on grasses as a unified framework should be considered rather than taking a separated or isolated view the conclusions reported in this study have implications when attempting to understand predict and restore dryland ecosystems although the results are not limited to drylands first the effects of stemflow on woody plants at both the individual and ecosystem levels generally change along an annual rainfall gradient future climate change may alter rainfall regimes and the way by which stemflow influences individual plants and ecosystems ipcc 2014 second it may be not straightforward to infer the effects of a process at a larger spatial scale from a smaller spatial scale levin 1992 similarly a hydrological process does not necessarily induce similar ecological responses specific attention should be paid to this kind of mismatch between scales third when restoring degraded ecosystems with woody plants as the target lifeform choosing woody species with higher stemflow strength may help restorations by amplifying the positive feedback between woody plants and stemflow finally when dealing with ecohydrological processes stemflow should be considered when setting conditions for specific individual woody plants and when annual rainfall is 200 mm for woody plant dominated ecosystems this is particularly important for dynamic global vegetation models if they are to better simulate the land surface water cycle because stemflow may be able to strongly redistribute rainfall and thus influence vegetation dynamics however this aspect has generally been ignored foley et al 1996 5 conclusions in this study we used an ecohydrological model to investigate how stemflow processes influenced the dynamics of woody plants along an annual rainfall gradient first we validated that stemflow plays a substantial role in driving woody cover in drylands along an annual rainfall gradient of 10 600 mm second the effects of stemflow on woody plants differ between individual and ecosystem levels although stemflow influences individual plants along the entire annual rainfall gradient it does not have an effect on the ecosystems until annual rainfall reaches 130 mm finally stemflow at the ecosystem scale may lead to higher woody cover relative to that at the individual scale although with a much narrower range of annual rainfall ecosystem scale ranging from 0 to 160 mm vs individual scale ranging from 440 to 600 mm this study helps advance the research on stemflow and provides a modeling tool which can be used to predict vegetation dynamics especially under global climate change and thereby assist in the prevention of degradation and promote restoration d odorico et al 2013 6 code availability the matlab and r codes used in this study

4277,stemflow has long been recognized as an important ecohydrological process in drylands and may influence dynamics of woody plants by altering rainfall redistribution however quantification of the effects of stemflow on woody plants dynamics remains largely unclear it is also unknown whether the effects of stemflow are consistent for individual plants and ecosystems where woody plants grow this study developed an ecohydrological model to explore how stemflow affected individual woody plants and ecosystems and how the effects changed along a rainfall gradient 10 600 mm in a dryland ecosystem this study demonstrated the positive effects of stemflow on woody plants in both individual by a degree of 16 48 and ecosystem scales by a degree of 8 45 stemflow started to promote woody plant growth in the individual scale even when annual rainfall was very low 50 mm whereas stemflow did not exert strong influences for the whole ecosystems until annual precipitation was higher than 130 mm however the effects of stemflow in ecosystem scale might surpass the counterpart in individual scale under some ranges of annual rainfall namely the effects of stemflow in individual and ecosystem scales mismatched the positive feedback between woody cover and stemflow may cause the unequal effects of stemflow for individual plants and ecosystems overall this study quantified how stemflow affected woody plants in individual and ecosystem scales which may contribute to dryland restorations by assisting vegetation configuration and being integrated into dynamic global vegetation model keywords stemflow ecohydrological model drylands woody plants individual ecosystem scale 1 introduction drylands cover approximately 41 of the global terrestrial land surface and support 38 of the global population cherlet et al 2018 reynolds et al 2007 the extent of global drylands may expand by 11 23 by the end of this century huang et al 2016 land degradations induced by soil erosion climate change and anthropogenic activities may become more severe emgun 2011 ipcc 2014 therefore the prevention of degradation and restoration of degraded ecosystems tend to be more urgent woody plants are important components of dryland ecosystems along with grasses and biological soil crusts biocrusts compound organisms containing cyanobacteria algae lichen and moss that cover land surface weber et al 2016 covering at least 18 of dryland surface globally fao 2016 woody plants play a significant role in controlling degradation and promoting restoration because they reduce wind water erosion shapotou 1991 wei et al 2007 thereby creating suitable conditions for grasses and biocrusts especially the latter zhang et al 2016a and by redistributing resources to facilitate self organization e g water nutrients ravi et al 2007 rietkerk et al 2002 although some previous studies suggested that shrubs which are woody plants may cause land degradation by increasing erosion connectivity d odorico et al 2013 eldridge et al 2011 the significance of woody plants tends to be more prominent in semiarid and dry subhumid regions which account for around 60 of dryland surface globally fao 2016 therefore it is critical to understand woody plant dynamics in dryland ecosystems under current and future climates among the effects of woody plants on degradation restoration water resource redistribution may be key as water is the main limiting factor in drylands woody plants can dramatically influence several hydrological processes such as horizontal water redistribution by creating runoff runon patches soil evaporation by shading d odorico et al 2013 turnbull et al 2010 and soil water redistribution by hydraulic redistribution horton and hart 1998 neumann and cardon 2012 in addition there is a unique process specific to woody plants known as stemflow defined as the proportion of rainfall that is intercepted by a woody plant canopy and then funneled into soils via stems johnson and lehmann 2006 levia et al 2011 pressland 1976 there have been few studies on stemflow until recently jian et al 2018 levia and germer 2015 pressland 1976 stan et al 2020 van and gordon 2018 previous studies mainly focused on the strength influencing factors and the associated ecohydrological effects of stemflow on soil water content stan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 for example the proportion of stemflow to annual rainfall decreases from 40 to 1 as the annual rainfall increase with an average value of around 10 in drylands levia and germer 2015 magliano et al 2019 stemflow as a preferential flow can be funneled into deep soils and then used by deep rooted woody plants johnson and lehmann 2006 van and gordon 2018 wang et al 2011 substantial field observations have suggested that the wetting island effect created by stemflow could be crucial to woody plant distribution growth and reproduction particularly in dryland ecosystems germer et al 2010 li et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 in spite of a relatively low ratio of stemflow to annual rainfall stemflow may disproportionately contribute to the replenishment of soil water and growth of individual woody plants and this phenomenon has had been extensively explored johnson and lehmann 2006 liang et al 2015 however the strong effects of stemflow on individual woody plants through the supply of extra water do not necessarily benefit the whole ecosystem because there are often large non woody areas e g bare land in drylands liang et al 2015 that is the patterns of stemflow effects on woody plant dynamics may differ at individual and ecosystem scales which is still largely unknown because the effects of stemflow at ecosystem scale is not paid enough attention previously levia and germer 2015 li et al 2008 stan et al 2020 wei et al 2007 furthermore increasing water input may alleviate the discrepancy between the effects of stemflow on individual plants and ecosystems because woody cover is high when there is high annual rainfall under global climate change rainfall regimes stemflow patterns and the coupling between stemflow production and woody plant dynamics may be altered huang et al 2016 ipcc 2014 and in turn affect woody plant distribution therefore the ecological effects of stemflow on woody plant dynamics need to be quantified which is still far from reaching e g jian et al 2018 levia and germer 2015 li et al 2008 martinezmeza and whitford 1996 this study developed an ecohydrological model and was parameterized according to a long term restoration project in the southeastern fringe of the tengger desert northwestern china shapotou region it explored the stemflow patterns and their effects on woody plant dynamics along an annual rainfall gradient two hypotheses were presented 1 stemflow may have a stronger effect on individual woody plants than on the ecosystem in which woody plants grow 2 the differences between the effects of stemflow at the individual and ecosystem levels may shrink as annual rainfall increases 2 materials and methods in this study an ecohydrological model instead of the observational or experimental approaches was employed to investigate the hypotheses because 1 the growth of woody vegetation is generally very slow i e decades to a century and thus a very long time is needed to monitor woody plant dynamics and 2 it is nearly infeasible to monitor and survey the effects of stemflow on vegetation dynamics along an annual rainfall gradient the process based ecohydrological model was revised from jia et al 2019 here we only give a brief introduction to the general model framework and more emphases is placed on what is new in the present model particularly with regards to stemflow production 2 1 general model framework there are two components in the model a water balance model and a vegetation model the water balance model consists of seven processes rainfall r mm day 1 stemflow sf mm land surface runoff r mm day 1 infiltration f mm day 1 evaporation e mm day 1 transpiration t mm day 1 and drainage d mm day 1 laio et al 2001 soil water processes i e the latter four are simulated by a multi layered soil which consists of biocrust z1 mm and subsurface z12 mm shallow z2 mm and deep soil layers z3 mm from the top to the bottom corradini et al 2011 rainfall is assumed to be the only water input into the ecosystems although fog or groundwater may be important in some dryland areas li et al 2018 a proportion of the rainfall captured by the woody canopy produces stemflow evaporation occurs in the upper three soil layers i e all except deep soil layer and the canopy ec mm day 1 also known as interception loss runoff and infiltration are functions of soil water content and the rainfall characteristics the vegetation model accounted for three major lifeforms in drylands deep rooted woody plants w shallow rooted grasses g and biocrusts b because they interact with each other directly or indirectly d onofrio et al 2015 donofrio et al 2018 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b biocrust is included as a system state variable because it is an important component of drylands and significantly influences ecohydrological processes chamizo et al 2016 chen et al 2018 woody plants mainly refer to shrubs because they are dominant woody growth form in drylands although forests may also be present fao 2016 vegetation cover is used to measure vegetation dynamics woody plants grasses and biocrusts can use the soil water stored in the deep s3 dimensionless shallow s2 dimensionless and subsurface soil s12 dimensionless and the biocrust s1 dimensionless layers respectively therefore the subsurface soil and shallow layers are also called the grass layer s22 dimensionless the deep layer is called woody layer the subsurface soil layer is included in the grass layer because it 1 is thick enough 2 significantly differs from the shallow soil layer which means that it should be considered separately and 3 is within the root distribution range of grasses chen et al 2017 jia et al 2019 li et al 2007 the growth gi dimensionless i w g b and death μi dimensionless i w g b rates of the vegetation are functions of soil water content si i 1 12 2 3 which is the coupling point for two integrant models d onofrio et al 2015 soil water in the corresponding layer is assumed to be negligible for the other lifeforms if not entirely unavailable due to the root depth separation among the three lifeforms chen et al 2017 schenk and jackson 2002 however root depth separation may be not valid for some ecosystems hutchings and john 2003 iversen et al 2017 and the assumption should be treated with caution overall the general model framework can be written as the following ordinary differential equations 1a ds 1 dt 1 n 1 z 1 f 1 e 1 t 1 d 1 1b ds 12 dt 1 n 12 z 12 f 12 e 12 t 12 d 1 d 12 1c ds 2 dt 1 n 2 z 2 f 2 e 2 t 2 d 12 d 2 1d ds 3 dt 1 n 3 z 3 f 3 s f t 3 d 2 d 3 1e db dt g b s 1 b 1 b μ b s 1 b 1f dg dt g g s 22 g 1 g μ g s 22 g 1g dw dt g w s 3 w 1 w μ w s 3 w where w g and b range from 0 to 1 and soil water content is the relative volumetric type divided by soil porosity ni unless specifically stated s22 is averaged over the soil water contents of the subsurface soil s12 and shallow soil layers s2 weighted by their thickness the time step is one day more detailed information about the meanings and dimensions of the variables and function symbols used in this study are given in table 1 2 2 precipitation the timing of the rainfall r was simulated using a poisson rainfall process with an average rainfall frequency λ event day 1 and a mean rainfall event size α mm event 1 the size of a rainfall event r can be modelled as f r 1 α e r α in this study the marked poisson process was not used to simulate the rainfall events sequence because it was necessary to explicitly describe the ineffective rainfall threshold rather than just setting a specific value laio et al 2001 in this study the rainfall frequency was a saturated function of annual precipitation otherwise the simulation of rainfall events may be unreasonable at the low or high ends for annual rainfall the relationship between rainfall frequency and annual precipitation was obtained by fitting the data for annual precipitation and precipitation frequency from the national meteorological information center china 2 3 stemflow in contrast to the original model proposed by jia et al 2019 on which our model was based this study considered and simulated stemflow processes using an ecohydrological model i e we connected ecological processes such as vegetation dynamics with hydrological processes because the stemflow process has been largely ignored in other ecohydrological modelling studies more specifically this study explored the dynamics of stemflow using a minimum model revised from gash 1979 and carlyle moses and price 1999 only stemflow processes and canopy evaporation were explicitly investigated the trunk evaporation was negligible due to the small stem surface relative to the leaves and lack of empirical data to be validated against and was ignored to avoid potential complexity in the simulation the effects of canopy structure e g canopy thickness branch inclination angle and bark properties e g bark roughness were not taken into account because they were outside the focus of this study a simple index of stemflow water flux in terms of percentage of incident rainfall was used to quantify the stemflow process so that it was compatible with the two scales individual and ecosystem scale investigated in this study levia and germer 2015 one rainfall event can be divided into two parts free throughfall and interception by the woody plant canopy the latter of which leads to stemflow canopy evaporation ec and released throughfall as opposed to free throughfall fig 1 a crockford and richardson 2000 dunkerley 2000 at the ecosystem scale the interception qeco and free throughfall peco portions are estimated as the absolute percentages of woody plant cover and non woody plant cover within a specific ground area respectively qeco 100 peco however at the individual scale the interception qind and free throughfall pind portions are measured using a relative cover approach qind 100 pind fig 1a previous studies generally investigated stemflow dynamics at the individual scale here stemflow dynamics at the ecosystem scale and their associated effects on vegetation were also investigated when the intercepted rainfall is less than the canopy water capacity ecc then all the intercepted rainfall will be lost to the atmosphere i e canopy evaporation no stemflow and released throughfall fig 1b laio et al 2001 when the intercepted rainfall is larger than the canopy water capacity then the largest amount of canopy water capacity is lost to the atmosphere and the residual intercepted rainfall is released as throughfall and stemflow the latter of which is a linear function of total intercepted rainfall named the stemflow coefficient pt therefore individual and ecosystem scales differ in the way that they simulate woody cover absolute vs relative cover here absolute and relative cover is defined as the proportion covered by woody plants against a specific land surface and against the land surface within canopy range respectively and thus the intercepted rainfall and stemflow the index used to quantify stemflow in this study slightly differs from the widely used index which is a function of total precipitation i e percentage of incident rainfall s r gash 1979 levia and germer 2015 we made this revision because the original index is not applicable for event sizes 3 mm below which threshold rainfall events may account for 50 of the annual rainfall

but not the shallower layers i e 0 40 cm below ground in some cases root induced preferential flow can also recharge the shallow soil layer to a certain extent wang et al 2011 due to factors such as the shallow distributed roots of woody plants and or hydraulic lift when deep soil water levels are high yu and d odorico 2015 however we assumed that the funneled stemflow was only available to woody plants because stemflow production lags behind the infiltration process which directly recharges soil water especially shallow water stan et al 2020 that is besides the widely acknowledged infiltration and drainage processes woody plants have another water transport path stemflow therefore the effective rainfall r mm day 1 that directly arrives at the land surface i e overall throughfall including both free and released throughfall and then becomes infiltration or runoff water tends to be low 3 r r s f i e c i i e c o o r i n d 2 4 infiltration and runoff infiltration that directly recharges soil water is the major water source for woody plants grasses and biocrusts a simple bucket model is used to simulate the infiltration process in four layered soils chen et al 2018 laio et al 2001 unless one upper layer is saturated no infiltrated rainfall penetrates the deeper layers when all four layers are saturated extra rainfall will produce runoff which is supposed to be lost from the ecosystem thus rainfall infiltration in layered soils is expressed by the following equations 4a f 1 s 1 r r r i 1 1 n i z i m i δ t i 1 1 n i z i m i δ t r i 1 1 n i z i m i δ t 4b f 12

on the southeastern edge of the tengger desert northern china the mean annual temperature rainfall potential evaporation and wind velocity are 10 182 5 mm 2900 mm and 2 9 m s 1 respectively around 80 of the annual rainfall falls in the growth season which is late april to mid september around 200 days the mean rainfall frequency and event size are around 3 65 mm and 50 events respectively shapotou 1991 the water table is 60 m below ground and thus is unavailable to even deep rooted woody plants the region belongs to temperate cold deserts and is classified as desert steppe in 1956 the region was revegetated to protect the baotou lanzhou railway and in 2012 the vegetation cover was around 10 35 and 80 for woody plants grass and biocrust respectively the land surface is covered by biocrust and the underlying soil layer is a typically sandy soil that is the soil field capacity is much higher in the biocrust layer 24 than in the underlying sand layers i e shallow and deep soil layers 6 to initial the model we set the soil water content of biocrust and the subsurface shallow and deep soil layers to 5 5 3 and 3 respectively vegetation cover was set to 1 for all three lifeforms different initial soil water contents and vegetation cover produced similar results and conclusions these results are not reported the thickness of the biocrust and the subsurface shallow and deep soil layers were set to 0 18 0 57 225 300 and 1200 mm respectively jia et al 2019 li et al 2014 increasing rate of biocrust thickness was obtained by fitting a linear regression to empirical data and subsurface soil layer linearly increased in thickness with a rate of 0 4 mm year 1 li et al 2007 the left part of first 300 mm below ground belongs to shallow soil layer the stemflow and free throughfall coefficients were 20 and 70 respectively according to previous studies zhang et al 2015 please refer to table 2 and jia et al 2019 for more information about parameter meanings and values the model was run with a time step of one day to match the temporal scale of the hydrological processes and then the model simulation results were converted to a one year scale to match the temporal scale of the ecohydrological processes vegetation dynamics this enabled the effects of stemflow on woody plants to be explored two versions of the model at the individual and ecosystem scales were run the different versions simulated the same hydrological processes except for stemflow where different algorithms sfind and sfeco eqns 2 were used for the individual and ecosystem scales respectively refer to section 2 3 to calibrate the model we ran the two different versions for 59 years using the observed time series for annual rainfall and the observed rainfall frequency two kinds of model calibrations were conducted first we derived the simulation data for vegetation cover woody plant and grass and soil water content shallow and deep soil layers at the ecosystem scale with and without stemflow and compared the results with the observed time series data a two tailed paired wilcoxon signed test was used and the significance level was set to 0 05 the simulation data for the individual scale were not accurate and thus not used the observed time series data were obtained from the cern chinese ecosystem research network shaptou station database then we calculated the ratio of stemflow to incident rainfall from the simulation data at the individual scale i e s r and compared it with the reported values for this region please refer to fig 2 for the illumination of model calibration we conducted sensitivity analyses of the free throughfall coefficient because it could strongly affect the results another six free throughfall levels 40 50 60 80 90 and 100 in addition to the 70 used here were tested similar patterns were obtained although the exact values of the patterns differed slightly fig s1 2 10 simulations in hypotheses testing we are more interested in the final states of the model under different annual rainfall rather than dynamics during restoration in model calibration therefore the thickness of four soil soil layers were set to 18 57 225 and 1200 mm respectively to investigate the hypotheses raised above we first set up an annual rainfall sequence which was 10 600 mm and covered most of the dryland regions if not entirely d odorico et al 2013 emgun 2011 the annual rainfall increment was 10 mm when simulating rainfall events rainfall frequency is a saturated function of annual rainfall which means that a reasonable simulation can be obtained the simulation was based on the climate data from the national meteorological information center china 531 points located across the drylands we used the specific annual rainfall to tune the rainfall intensity so that it reached the corresponding rainfall frequency then the model was run for 300 years until it finally reached a stable state the last 10 years were used to conduct the calculations a total of 100 replications were used to smooth the potential fluctuation induced by the stochastic rainfall events these simulations were conducted using matlab r2018b the influence of stemflow on vegetation dynamics was quantified by two simulations without stemflow no stemflow was produced from canopy interception and all the intercepted rainfall was allocated to interception loss or released throughfall and with stemflow canopy intercepts some of the rainfall and produces stemflow another four levels of the stemflow coefficient 10 30 40 and 50 besides 0 and 20 were also tested to explore the generalization of the stemflow effects on vegetation dynamics 2 11 statistical analyses and hypotheses testing the effects of stemflow on woody plant dynamics were estimated from the differences in woody plant cover between with and without stemflow e g wi i 10 20 30 40 and 50 wi i 0 fig 2 to test hypotheses we fitted the trends in differences of the stemflow effects between the individual and ecosystem levels along an annual rainfall gradient using the generalized additive model gam realized by gam function in the mgcv package chen et al 2019 curtis and simpson 2014 the gam was used because it is robust to fit unknown relationships a gaussian distribution family an identity link function a maximum likelihood smoothing parameter estimation a newton numerical optimization and a cubic regression spline penalized smoothing basis in the smooth term were used in the gam fitting process the dimension of the basis used to represent the smoothing term was selected to minimize the akaike information criterion if the gam fitting of the difference of stemflow effects between the ecosystem and individual levels always showed negative values hypothesis 1 would be supported further if the gam fittings showed significant increasing trends unnecessary to be positive within some ranges of the annual rainfall gradient identified as the ranges where zero was not included in the 95 confidence interval of the first derivatives of the gam fittings then hypothesis 2 would be supported chen et al 2019 simpson 2011 all the statistical analyses were conducted using r software version 4 0 4 r core team 2021 please refer to fig 2 for the illumination of model simulation and hypothesis testing 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation fig 3 shows that the simulated values with stemflow blue lines captured the general pattern of the observed values black lines especially over the last 15 years although the simulated values with a stemflow coefficient of 0 i e without considering stemflow red lines also performed well when the soil water contents and grass cover were fitted that is the effect of stemflow was only significant for woody cover due to the preferential flow to deep rooted woody plants p value 0 001 fig 3e and was not significant for shallow and deep soil water contents and grass cover p values 0 933 0 312 0 409 respectively figs 3b d in addition the ratio of annual summed stemflow at the individual level to annual rainfall i e s r 8 2 was consistent with the 8 measured in the field which validated the model used here wang et al 2011 3 2 stemflow pattern along an annual rainfall gradient the amount of stemflow at the individual red lines and ecosystem blue lines scales linearly or exponentially increased with increasing annual rainfall respectively insert boxes in fig 4 a however the stemflow amount at the ecosystem scale tended to be 0 when annual rainfall was lower than 200 mm and increased much faster than that for the individual scale when annual rainfall was higher than 200 mm fig 4a under an annual rainfall of 600 mm stemflow amounts at the ecosystem scale 0 17 0 35 0 60 0 91 and 1 20 mm day 1 were larger than those at the individual scale 0 17 0 34 0 50 0 67 and 0 80 mm day 1 under stemflow coefficients of 10 20 30 40 and 50 respectively insert box in fig 4a therefore the differences in stemflow volume between the ecosystem and individual scales increased from negative as low as 0 19 mm day 1 to positive values as high as 0 37 mm day 1 as annual rainfall increased that is stemflow amount at the ecosystem scale caught up with or surpassed that at the individual scale as annual rainfall increased furthermore the higher stemflow coefficients strengthened the patterns fig 4a as the stemflow coefficient green to red lines increased the critical point in annual rainfall where stemflow amount at the ecosystem scale surpassed that at the individual scale came earlier from 600 mm under a stemflow coefficient of 10 to 400 mm under a stemflow coefficient of 50 fig 4a the percentage of incident rainfall s r had a similar pattern to stemflow volume except at the ecosystem scale where it increased asymptotically with annual rainfall instead of linearly for stemflow amount at the ecosystem scale fig 4b as the annual rainfall increased the percentage of incident rainfall at the individual level rose rapidly ranging from 4 to 20 and then stabilized at 6 11 17 22 and 28 stemflow coefficients of 10 20 30 40 and 50 respectively insert box in fig 4b the difference between the two scales quickly dropped to as low as 20 but then gradually increased toward positive values up to 12 fig 4b 3 3 effects of stemflow on woody cover woody cover increased with annual rainfall and stemflow generally benefited woody cover at both the individual and ecosystem scales although the effects at the ecosystem scale tended to be negligible when annual rainfall was lower than 130 mm fig 5 a b the positive effects of stemflow on woody cover at the individual scale increased significantly ranging from 16 to 48 when the stemflow coefficient increased from 10 to 50 blue lines when annual rainfall was lower than 300 mm but then shrunk significantly to 8 31 cyan lines fig 5a the positive effects at the ecosystem scale started to emerge when annual rainfall was higher than 130 mm and exhibited no shrink except for stemflow coefficient of 50 where the positive effects slightly decreased when annual rainfall was lower than 520 mm cyan line in fig 5b stemflow could boost the growth of woody plants by increasing woody cover 8 14 21 34 and 45 under stemflow coefficients of 10 20 30 40 and 50 fig 5b the differences in woody cover at ecosystem and individual scales showed similar patterns to the differences in the percentages of incident rainfall between the two scales figs 4b 5c relative to the ecosystem scale stemflow at the individual scale was more likely to contribute to higher woody cover at the low end of annual rainfall the values for annual rainfall where stemflow at the individual scale had stronger effects than those at the ecosystem scale decreased from 600 mm under a stemflow coefficient of 10 to 440 mm under a stemflow coefficient of 50 solid lines in fig 5c the critical points for annual rainfall 440 600 mm where the difference in the effects of stemflow on woody cover between the two scales switched from negative to positive values were higher than the points for the differences in the percentage of incident rainfall 400 600 mm 4 discussion although the effects of stemflow on vegetation dynamics have long been recognized studies on stemflow have generally focused on hydrological processes e g stemflow production and recharge of soil water from stemflow at timescales of 1 year these studies have used mainly observational or experimental approaches li et al 2008 pressland 1976 there has been no quantification of the effects of stemflow on vegetation dynamics over long periods of time the long term monitoring data 30 years and process based ecohydrological model used in this study showed that stemflow had a positive effect on woody plants at both the individual and ecosystem scales especially when annual rainfall was 130 mm however the positive effects of stemflow on individual plants do not necessarily cause equivalently positive effects in the ecosystems where woody plants grow i e higher woody cover when annual rainfall is high e g 440 mm increases in woody cover at the ecosystem scale due to the interaction between ecological and hydrological processes may be larger than that at the individual scale solely due to hydrological processes the quantification of the effects of stemflow are important when setting restoration targets and selecting species for restoration programs this study found that both the amount of stemflow and the percentage of incident rainfall increased with increasing annual rainfall which was generally opposite to previous findings llorens and domingo 2007 for instance magliano et al 2019 reported that the amount of stemflow was constant along an annual rainfall gradient and the percentage of incident rainfall decreased from 10 to 1 along an annual rainfall gradient of 100 800 mm vs increased from 0 to 11 along an annual rainfall gradient of 0 600 mm in this study when the stemflow coefficient 20 the primary reason for this discrepancy may be that previous studies generally used multi site synthetic world data rather than single site data along an annual rainfall gradient there were other differences such as measuring species change along an annual rainfall gradient using a multi site synthetic approach rather than the single site approach used in this study the turnover of woody species e g from short shrubs to tall trees along an annual rainfall gradient which was not taken into account in this study may significantly reduce the percentage of incident rainfall e g from 9 4 to 3 5 magliano et al 2019 navar 2011 however this study was generally consistent with many other single site studies which also demonstrated that the amount of stemflow and the percentage of incident rainfall increased along an incident annual rainfall gradient martinezmeza and whitford 1996 yang et al 2010 when the incident rainfall increases more water can be used to produce stemflow as the canopy interception loss does not exceed the canopy water capacity even during a very large rainfall event e g 20 mm fig s2 the annual rainfall gradient is realized by tuning rainfall intensity to reach a specific annual rainfall level because the rainfall event frequency along the annual rainfall gradient is obtained by fitting a saturated function of the observed values national meteorological information center china 13 75 events each year therefore the annual rainfall gradient used in this study was obtained using a similar incident rainfall density the simulated value for percentage of incident rainfall reported here was similar to previous studies in this region wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 and other dryland ecosystems levia and germer 2015 magliano et al 2019 martinezmeza and whitford 1996 yang et al 2010 this study quantified the contributions of stemflow to individual woody plants and ecosystems which has been largely ignored in previous ecohydrological research despite the important role stemflow plays in recharging soil water levia and germer 2015 pressland 1976 wang et al 2011 generally stemflow is produced by specific individual woody plants and it is regarded as an accessory hydrological process for woody plants levia et al 2011 van and gordon 2018 when studying stemflow alone from a hydrological perspective the temporal extent ranges from several rain events i e days to seasons and the spatial extent is based on the individual plant or several individuals magliano et al 2019 however when studying both stemflow and vegetation dynamics from an ecological perspective temporal extent can be years or even decades furthermore spatial extent is based on area and generally much larger than that of individual woody plants the primary reason for not quantifying the effects on vegetation dynamics may be the mismatch between the temporal days seasons vs years decades and spatial meters vs kilometers scales in stemflow and vegetation dynamics research van and gordon 2018 as expected stemflow has a positive role on both individual woody plants and ecosystems where woody plants grow because funneled stemflow into deep soils increases the water supply for woody plants liang et al 2015 however the effects of stemflow are different at the two scales the positive effects that stemflow has on individual plants may not be able to produce equivalent positive effects at the ecosystem scale or cause a stronger positive response in woody cover fig 5 the interaction between stemflow and woody cover and or other processes may form a positive feedback and thereby dramatically alter the effects of stemflow on woody cover that is high woody cover can intercept more rainfall and produce more root preferential flow into the deep soil layer which will benefit woody plants in return however when annual rainfall is low woody cover is generally low which substantially limits the strength of the positive feedback between stemflow and woody cover therefore although stemflow can increase the water resource for woody plants at very low annual rainfall levels e g 10 100 mm it cannot increase woody cover at the ecosystem scale until annual rainfall is 130 mm fig 5 s2 when the stemflow coefficient is low e g 10 it is more difficult for woody cover to reach a critical value where the positive feedback leads to greater woody cover at the ecosystem scale overall the positive feedback between stemflow and woody cover is an allee effect at the ecosystem scale which leads to a mismatch between individual and ecosystem scales about the effects of positive feedback between stemflow and woody cover allee and bowen 1932 in this study we developed a process based ecohydrological model to systematically quantify the role of stemflow on vegetation dynamics jia et al 2019 this model performed well and it can be applied to other dryland ecosystems with different soil characteristics e g soil field capacity and soil depths and species compositions however before applying this model framework the assumptions made in this study need to be emphasized the most important assumption was that the produced stemflow is totally funneled into the deep soil layer and thus only available to deep rooted woody plants different woody species may exhibit different root induced preferential flow strengths and thus influence the available stemflow induced rainfall input johnson and lehmann 2006 this assumption may need to be evaluated for ecosystems with large biocrust and subsurface and shallow soil layer field capacities and with overlapped root distributions between woody plants and grasses in the former case the upper soil layers may partially consume the funneled stemflow and reduce the amount that reaches the deep soil layer wang et al 2011 in this context the positive effects of stemflow on woody plants at the ecosystem scale may become less significant until the annual rainfall is very high which may be unrealistic for dryland ecosystems in the latter case shallow rooted woody plants i e woody plants with lateral root distribution can redistribute funneled stemflow to the shallow soil layers as well as the deep soil layers which would benefit non woody plants in addition the overlapped root distribution between shallow rooted woody plants and grasses may complicate the soil hydrological dynamics e g the competition for soil water between woody plants and grasses should be considered to understand ecosystem dynamics correctly another important hydrological process hydraulic redistribution is not considered here it can transfer soil water from the bottom to the top or the top to the bottom soil layers neumann and cardon 2012 root preferential flow to shallow soil layers for shallow rooted woody plants or to the deep soil layers for deep rooted woody plants may interact with hydraulic redistribution producing stronger or weaker hydraulic redistributions yu and d odorico 2015 other assumptions such as the water input from rainfall and the saturated function between rainfall frequency and annual rainfall may also affect the conclusions reached here and these need further investigation overall the effects of stemflow on grasses as a unified framework should be considered rather than taking a separated or isolated view the conclusions reported in this study have implications when attempting to understand predict and restore dryland ecosystems although the results are not limited to drylands first the effects of stemflow on woody plants at both the individual and ecosystem levels generally change along an annual rainfall gradient future climate change may alter rainfall regimes and the way by which stemflow influences individual plants and ecosystems ipcc 2014 second it may be not straightforward to infer the effects of a process at a larger spatial scale from a smaller spatial scale levin 1992 similarly a hydrological process does not necessarily induce similar ecological responses specific attention should be paid to this kind of mismatch between scales third when restoring degraded ecosystems with woody plants as the target lifeform choosing woody species with higher stemflow strength may help restorations by amplifying the positive feedback between woody plants and stemflow finally when dealing with ecohydrological processes stemflow should be considered when setting conditions for specific individual woody plants and when annual rainfall is 200 mm for woody plant dominated ecosystems this is particularly important for dynamic global vegetation models if they are to better simulate the land surface water cycle because stemflow may be able to strongly redistribute rainfall and thus influence vegetation dynamics however this aspect has generally been ignored foley et al 1996 5 conclusions in this study we used an ecohydrological model to investigate how stemflow processes influenced the dynamics of woody plants along an annual rainfall gradient first we validated that stemflow plays a substantial role in driving woody cover in drylands along an annual rainfall gradient of 10 600 mm second the effects of stemflow on woody plants differ between individual and ecosystem levels although stemflow influences individual plants along the entire annual rainfall gradient it does not have an effect on the ecosystems until annual rainfall reaches 130 mm finally stemflow at the ecosystem scale may lead to higher woody cover relative to that at the individual scale although with a much narrower range of annual rainfall ecosystem scale ranging from 0 to 160 mm vs individual scale ranging from 440 to 600 mm this study helps advance the research on stemflow and provides a modeling tool which can be used to predict vegetation dynamics especially under global climate change and thereby assist in the prevention of degradation and promote restoration d odorico et al 2013 6 code availability the matlab and r codes used in this study

4278,the budyko framework can effectively quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on runoff changes however the impact of specific ecological construction measure on water balance requires further investigation in this study a budyko framework was used to analyze the impact of ecological construction measures on the long term water energy balance and quantify the contribution of climate variables and ecological construction measures to runoff change first the explanatory variables of land surface parameters were selected and evaluated next the long term rainfall runoff models were established based on the budyko hypothesis with land surface parameters expressed as a function of explanatory variables finally the runoff elasticities of each explanatory variable were derived and the contribution of climate variables and ecological construction measures to runoff change at different sub periods were further analyzed the framework was applied to the wuding river which is a large tributary of the yellow river located in the loess plateau and a bootstrapping technique was applied to conduct cross validation of the proposed framework among the five ecological construction measures i e horizontal terrace check dam artificial grassland artificial afforestation and natural reforestation the most significant impact on the long term water energy balance was the natural reforestation the role of artificial grassland on runoff was also significant analysis of contribution rates to runoff change revealed that precipitation is the main factor associated with the decrease in runoff from the 1970s to the 1990s compared to the baseline period from 1957 to 1971 and the impact of vegetation measures increased and gradually became dominant after the year 2000 keywords runoff contribution quantification budyko framework ecological construction measures loess plateau 1 introduction the ongoing intensification of the water cycle as indicated by observations from many regions worldwide has exerted global scale impacts on water resources milly et al 2005 huntington 2006 the increasingly extreme weather events with accompanying increases in global temperature and changes in precipitation patterns affect streamflow discharge globally vörösmarty et al 2000 qin et al 2014 human activities such as land use change dam construction reservoir operation surface water and groundwater withdrawal and ecological construction have both direct and indirect impacts on streamflow changes sterling et al 2013 liang et al 2014 the loess plateau which belongs to the arid and semi arid climate of northwest china is vulnerable to disasters such as drought rainstorms and floods moreover afforestation returning farmland to forest land check dam construction and other ecological construction activities have led to changes in the underlying surface conditions of the loess plateau since the 1950s therefore runoff in the middle reaches of the yellow river especially in the coarse sandy hilly catchments of the loess plateau has decreased significantly under the combined influence of climate change and intensive human activities mu et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 three methods have been commonly used for the assessment of hydrological responses to climate change and human activity these include empirical statistics hydrological modelling and the budyko framework empirical statistics that establish a relationship between runoff and climate variable mainly include regression analyses and the double mass curve method schilling et al 2010 wang et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 however in this method only the linear relationship between runoff and climate variables is considered and physical hydrological processes remain unaccounted for hydrological modelling methods that employ complex models to simulate the hydrological cycle assess the impact of climate change by comparing simulations driven by different climatic scenarios chiew et al 2009 jones et al 2006 karlsson et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a zuo et al 2016 chang et al 2015 niraula et al 2017 joseph et al 2018 hydrological models have a sound physical basis however there are some uncertainties in the structure and parameters of such models leavesley 1994 mendoza et al 2016 moreover the lack of model validation can lead to significant bias in the assessment of climate change impacts on runoff legesse et al 2003 the budyko framework constitutes rainfall runoff models effectively based on the budyko hypothesis that actual evapotranspiration is controlled by both water and energy availability yang et al 2007 additionally the inclusion of evapotranspiration when calculating runoff yield makes the budyko framework more consistent with the true hydrological cycle than the empirical statistics the elasticity based methods based on the budyko framework which generate estimates of streamflow elasticity are simple and effective approaches to quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on runoff changes and have been widely used in hydrology donohue et al 2011 fu et al 2007 ma et al 2010 roderick and farquhar 2011 xu et al 2013b yang et al 2014b yang and yang 2011 zhang et al 2018b li et al 2019 sinha et al 2020 wu et al 2017 used changes in runoff in the yanhe river basin as a case study to compare the quantitative results obtained using the three main categories of modelling approaches and found that the elasticity based methods based on the budyko framework and hydrological modelling were essentially consistent in the loess plateau ecological construction measures have been implemented since the 1950s these measures include planting of vegetation natural vegetation rehabilitation terracing and construction of check dams all of which are potential influencing factors of runoff liang et al 2014 explored the runoff response of the loess plateau to climate change and ecological restoration based on a budyko hydrological model the contribution of ecological restoration to runoff reduction was on average 62 much larger than that of climate change 38 using the budyko framework and elasticity method gao et al 2016 found that land use cover played a primary role in 10 out of 15 catchments of the loess plateau with contributions of more than 60 and the contribution of land use cover changes was positively correlated with the relative area of soil and water conservation measures chen et al 2020 performed a meta analysis by using 22 hydrological modelling studies covering 25 different watersheds in the loess plateau and concluded that land use change accounted for 63 52 of the streamflow reduction despite the depth of research in this area several questions need further investigation first the previous studies mainly considered different human activities such as constructing terraces and check dams replanting trees and pasture establishment as a single category i e ecological restoration or land use cover change it is unclear which kind of ecological construction measure plays a leading role in the variation of runoff second the impact of climate variability and land use cover changes on runoff might be different in some sub periods bao et al 2019 showed that in the middle yellow river climate variability was the main factor for streamflow decrease from 1980 to 2000 whereas land use cover change was the main factor for streamflow decrease from 2001 to 2016 it is unclear the temporal effects of climate variability and ecological construction measure on the runoff reduction of the loess plateau to discuss these questions the land surface parameter of budyko hypothesis based formulas can be considered as a variable the relationship between vegetation variables and the budyko land surface parameter is previously established li et al 2013 xu et al 2013a zhang et al 2018b to quantify the impacts of vegetation change on hydrological partitioning however the budyko land surface parameter is not governed by vegetation characteristics exclusively sinha et al 2019 established the relationship between the land surface parameter of the fu formula and eight watershed characteristics ning et al 2019 identified the dominant factors applicable to estimate the budyko land surface parameter of china s loess plateau at different time scales besides the leaf area index vegetation coverage and topography variables the ecological construction measure implemented in the loess plateau i e horizontal terrace check dam artificial grassland artificial afforestation and natural reforestation are all possible explanatory variables of the land surface parameter in this study the relationship the budyko land surface parameter and ecological construction measures will be analyzed to identify the impact of ecological construction measures on the long term water energy balance the elasticity coefficients of climate variables and ecological construction measures to runoff will be calculated to quantify the contribution of specific ecological construction measures to runoff change at different sub periods sinha et al 2020 suggested that the selection of the method should be done cautiously while quantifying the impacts of changing parameters based on the budyko hypothesis therefore the formulas developed by mezentsev choudhury yang mezentsev 1955 choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 fu 1981 zhang et al 2001 and wang and tang 2014 each of which provides a budyko land surface parameter to reflect the watershed characteristics are all applied in our study in section 2 the budyko based long term rainfall runoff models are constructed and the elasticity coefficients to quantify hydrological responses to changes in climate and ecological construction measures are presented in section 3 the study area and the data of runoff precipitation evapotranspiration and ecological construction measure areas are introduced in section 4 the land surface parameter is linked with the ecological construction measure and the effects of climate variables and different ecological construction measures on runoff reduction are quantified the causes of runoff changes and the temporal effects of climate variability and ecological construction measures are discussed the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 methods 2 1 budyko hypothesis based runoff methods the water balance equation is fundamental for the establishment of the long term rainfall runoff model 1 r p e δ s where r p e and δs are the long term mean values of runoff precipitation actual evapotranspiration and water storage change respectively all variables are measured in units of millimeters per year mm yr 1 annual precipitation p is estimated as the watershed weighted average of the observed rain at meteorological stations within and around the watershed the budyko hypothesis which is represented as formulas relating actual evapotranspiration e to the aridity index ϕ e 0 p is usually applied to estimate actual evapotranspiration dooge 1992 kuhnel et al 1991 and the e 0 can be estimated through the widely used fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 donohue et al 2007 argued that the budyko framework s reliability is greatest when applied using long term averages and to large catchments both ning et al 2017 and liu et al 2018 found climate seasonality has a significant effect on the land surface parameter at the annual scale wang 2012 and shao et al 2021 revealed the interannual variability of storage change can be a significant component in annual water balance in both illinois and loess plateau thus analyzing the annual water balance ignoring climate seasonality and δs might lead to large errors gentine et al 2012 illustrated that seasonality between rainfall and potential evaporation does not alter the fit of the river basins to the budyko curve on a long term time scale shao et al 2021 found that ignoring δs at a 10 year scale had the least influence on water budget closure over the loess plateau therefore in our study the annual data were smoothed with an 11 year moving average to explore the factors that impacted the controlling parameters in the budyko framework the long term rainfall runoff model developed based on the budyko hypothesis with a land surface parameter is usually expressed as 2 r p 1 g e 0 p ω where g represents the functional relationship between actual evapotranspiration and the aridity index based on the budyko hypothesis and ω represents the budyko land surface parameter the mezentsev choudhury yang m c y fu zhang and wang formulas are presented in table1 to reveal how the land surface parameter in each budyko type equation would vary with ecological construction measures the budyko land surface parameter ω was expressed as the dependent variable of ecological construction measures jiang et al 2015 3 ω t exp β 0 β 1 x 1 t e β k x k t e where x 1 e x k e are the selected ecological construction measure variables in the time window centered with year t the exponent function is added in eq 3 to guarantee the land surface parameter is always greater than zero the series of ω might have highly discrete distributions with high skewness and kurtosis thus a semiparametric regression model named the generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss is applied when estimating the parameters of eq 3 gamlss relaxes the assumption that response variables belong to an exponential distribution family and overcomes the limitations of the generalized linear and generalized additive model and can describe the linear or non linear relationship between any statistical parameter of the dependent and explanatory covariates rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 in this study the gamma distribution function which is flexible and has been widely used in hydrologic analysis yue et al 2001 was chosen to describe the distribution of the ω series the mean value of ω was assumed to be a function of the explanatory variables and the coefficient of variation and skewness are assumed to be constants the accumulative areas of five ecological construction measures i e terracing check dam artificial grassland afforestation and natural reforestation are considered as candidate explanatory variables of ω as xu and wang 2011 found that the flow regime was closely correlated with these soil and water conservation measures rather than reservoirs the steps for selecting the explanatory variable of the land surface parameters have been detailed in the subsequent portion first the annual data are smoothed with an 11 year moving average then the land surface parameters of the budyko formulas are estimated based on runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data to meet the coupled water energy balance every 11 years the relationship between the land surface parameter and each explanatory variable is constructed the explanatory variable with minimum aic akaike information criterion value is selected and another variable is considered for addition from the set of explanatory variables based on the likelihood ratio test the inclusion of the variable if any is based on which variable provides the most significant improvement in the model fit this process is repeated until variable addition provides no further significant improvement in the model the flowchart of the methodology implemented in the study is presented in fig 1 the nash efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge coefficients were applied to evaluate the goodness of fit of the long term rainfall runoff models the kge gupta et al 2009 which combines the three components of the nse model errors i e correlation bias ratio of variances or coefficients of variation in a balanced way approach has been widely used for calibration and evaluation models in hydrology mathevet et al 2020 meles et al 2021 the p 0 9 factor and r 0 9 factor were used to assess model uncertainties the p 0 9 factor as the percentage of monitoring data covered by 90 prediction uncertainty 90 ppu and the r 0 9 factor as the average thickness of the 90 ppu band divided by the standard deviation of monitoring data are also applied and the effectiveness of calibration is assessed the proximities of the p and r factors to 1 and 0 respectively 2 2 quantification of hydrological response to changes in climate and ecological construction measure the elasticity based method which effectively estimates runoff elasticity was applied in our study to quantify runoff responses to changes in climate and ecological construction measures according to eq 3 runoff can be modelled as a function of climatic variables and ecological construction measure areas thus changes in runoff caused by changing climate and ecological construction measures can be approximated as follows 4 δ r r p δ p r e 0 δ e 0 r x 1 δ x 1 e r x k δ x k e where δ r δ p δ e 0 δ x 1 e δ x k e are the changes in runoff depth precipitation potential evapotranspiration and ecological construction measures respectively the elasticity of runoff ε is defined as the ratio of the runoff variation rate to the variation rate of a certain explanatory factor and is expressed as follows sankarasubramanian et al 2001 5 ε i r r x i x i where x represents the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and ecological construction measures used in this study thus eq 4 can be rewritten as 6 δ r ε p δ p p ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 ε x 1 e δ x 1 e x 1 e ε x k e δ x k e x k e r where ε p ε e 0 ε a d ε x 1 e ε x k e are the runoff elasticities for precipitation potential evapotranspiration and ecological construction measures respectively from eq 3 ε p ε e 0 ε x k e can be calculated as follows 7 ε p 1 ϕ g ϕ 1 g ϕ ω 8 ε e 0 ϕ g ϕ 1 g ϕ ω 9 ε x k e x k e β k ω g ω 1 g ϕ ω the elasticity coefficients are defined as the long term mean values of the explanatory variables roderick and farquhar 2011 the trend analysis of the hydro meteorological series and ecological construction measure areas was performed using the mann kendall test method to cross validate the rainfall runoff model bootstrapping was applied after selecting the explanatory variable of the land surface parameter resampling was performed 10 000 times with 30 years selected randomly to constitute a calibration period and the remaining 19 years constituting the validation period 3 study area and data 3 1 study area as a major tributary in the middle reach of the yellow river located in the loess plateau the wuding river 30261 km2 which is characterized by relatively less water and abundant sediment is the main source of sediment for the lower reaches of the yellow river li et al 2007 the wuding river basin has undergone a series of ecological construction measures since 1957 to control soil erosion the conservation measures included building terraces and check dams as well as land cover changes by planting trees and grasslands massive planting of vegetation terracing and construction of check dams were undertaken in the 1970s furthermore large scale water and soil conservation projects have been implemented since 2000 and the total area affected by ecological construction measures was 10 880 km2 by 2015 which is approximately 38 7 of the total basin area afforestation accounted for the largest areas of the ecological construction measures 26 5 of the total basin area followed by artificial grasslands 5 3 horizontal terraces 4 1 natural reforestation 2 1 and check dams 0 7 3 2 data sources annual runoff r data from baijiachuan the gauging station located at the outlet of the wuding river annual precipitation p from 29 precipitation stations annual potential evapotranspiration e 0 from 5 meteorological stations were selected for water balance analysis of the basin fig 2 the annual runoff and precipitation data used in this study were obtained from the hydrologic year book bureau of hydrology of the yellow river conservancy commission china http www hwswj gov cn swjcms the annual potential evapotranspiration was determined from

grassland area ag accumulative artificial afforestation area aaf and accumulative natural reforestation anf were selected as candidate explanatory variables of land surface parameters the areas of ad at aaf ag and anf were obtained from the loess plateau data center national earth system science data sharing infrastructure national science technology infrastructure of china http loess geodata cn 4 results 4 1 trends in annual hydro meteorological series and accumulative ecological construction measure areas the time series of hydro meteorological variables i e r p and e 0 from 1957 to 2015 are presented in fig 3 as well as the accumulative ecological construction measure areas i e ad at aaf ag and anf series the trend analysis of the hydrological series and ecological construction measure areas was performed using the mann kendall test method and the results are shown in table 2 it can be observed that r and e 0 have significant decreasing trends at the 5 significance level whereas the p series has an increasing but not significant trend however the ad at aaf ag and anf series all show significant increasing trends at the 5 significance level the decreasing trend of e 0 is consistent with the results of ning et al 2016 li et al 2007 found an abrupt change in the annual runoff of the wuding river in 1972 it can be observed from fig 3 that annual runoff value before 1971 was frequently more than 50 mm but the annual runoff value decreased sharply after 1971 and there was only one year whose annual runoff reach 50 mm after 1971 thus the baseline period was determined as 1957 to 1971 in our study the period from 1972 to 2015 was divided into two parts with the year 2000 when large scale ecological construction measures took place as the demarcator the statistical values of the hydro meteorological series and ecological construction measure series from 1957 to 1971 baseline period were compared with the values from 1972 to 1999 and from 2000 to 2015 table 2 it can be observed that the mean value of annual runoff r decreased from 15 23 mm during the baseline period to 10 00 mm during 1972 to 1999 and further to 7 90 mm during 2000 to 2015 the coefficient of skewness cs and coefficient of variation cv indicate that the variability of r during 1972 to 1999 was the largest compared with that in other periods the statistical values of the p series remained stationary between the different periods the statistical values of the e 0 series show that the mean value in the baseline period was slightly larger than that in the other two periods but the variability of e 0 was quite small compared to that of other hydrological variables the areal extent of ecological construction measures from 2000 to 2015 was the largest almost twice the area covered from 1972 to 1999 and more than five times that during the baseline period notably that the curve of anf was significantly different from that of the other ecological construction measures natural reforestation started only in 1980 and anf increased on a larger scale than that of areas under other interventions after 2000 4 2 linking the land surface parameter with the ecological construction measure the land surface parameter values required to satisfy the coupled water energy balance every 11 years were determined using the m c y fu zhang and wang formulas based on the observed r and p data and e 0 estimated from the fao 56 penman monteith equation the time series of land surface parameters estimated from the four formulas are presented in fig 4 where the year represents the centered time window all land surface parameters exhibited similar trends the parameters displayed a decreasing trend during the baseline period before 1970 had a slightly increasing trend from 1970 to 2000 and increased substantially after 2000 the moving average percent of accumulative ecological construction measure areas to the whole basin area is aslo shown in fig 4 it can be observed that the variation in land surface parameters is closely related to the area of natural reforestation anf the relationships between land surface parameters and ecological construction measure variables were constructed to select the explanatory variable of the land surface parameter the aic values of these relationships are listed in table 3 all the relationships indicate that anf is the main influencing factor of the land surface parameter thus anf was selected first the likelihood ratio test results indicated that anf is the only factor influencing the land surface parameter for the m c y fu and zhang formulas and anf and ag are influencing factors for the wang formula the results of all formulas indicate that the land surface parameter is closely related to the vegetation measure ning et al 2019 verified that the vegetation information is the key variable for the parameterization of the budyko model at a long term scale in the loess plateau compared with the natural reforestation the areas of artificial afforestation were quite large however the low survival rate of vegetation during the period from the 1950s to 1990s resulted in a limited effect of artificial afforestation measures on runoff reduction cao 2008 mcvicar et al 2010 4 3 cross validation of the long term rainfall runoff model to cross validate the long term rainfall runoff model the calibration period constituting 30 years was randomly selected 10 000 times through resampling and the remaining years were utilized as the validation period the parameters of eq 3 which describe the relationship between land surface parameters and ecological construction measure areas were estimated 10 000 times using the calibration period data for the m c y fu zhang and wang formulas the evaluation indicators nse kge p 0 9 factor and r 0 9 factor were calculated to assess the performance of these models and the elasticity coefficients of the explanatory variables were calculated by applying eqs 7 9 the box plots of the elasticity coefficients and the evaluation indicators in both the calibration period and validation period are illustrated in fig 5 the interquartile ranges 25 75 of these budyko hypothesis based runoff models from different calibration samples are were not large more than three quarters of the nse kge and p 0 9 factor values are larger than 0 8 during the calibration period and all r 0 9 factor values shown in the box plot are smaller than 2 the interquartile ranges and dispersion ranges 5 95 of all models for the validation periods were larger than those for the calibration periods but the median values of all evaluation indicators were comparable between the two periods all the results indicate that these budyko hypothesis based runoff models are robust and the conclusion is also verified by the elasticity coefficient results although the dispersion ranges of ε p and ε e 0 from the four budyko hypothesis based runoff models were all small the ε p and ε e 0 values were different the ε p value from the zhang formula was always the highest and that from the wang formula was always the lowest the results of ε e 0 showed the opposite trend the ε a nf results estimated from the m c y fu and zhang formulas were similar both the interquartile and dispersion ranges of ε a nf and ε a g from the wang formula were much larger but most of the ε a nf and ε a g values were also smaller than 0 forest vegetation directly reduces the amount of net precipitation through increases in precipitation interception and evaporation and thus has a great influence on reducing surface runoff brown et al 2005 winkler et al 2010 wang et al 2011 furthermore the increase in grassland cover and agricultural acreage also has an impact on increasing evapotranspiration resulting in reduced runoff farley et al 2005 thus the parameters of these runoff models were reasonable among the four budyko hypothesis based runoff models the performance of the m c y and fu formula based models were close to each other in terms of both elasticity coefficients and evaluation indicators the wang formula based model in which the land surface parameter has two explanatory variables ε a g and ε a nf showed a larger uncertainty with a higher r 0 9 factor value and much larger interquartile and dispersion ranges of ε a nf than those of the other models and the interquartile and dispersion ranges of ε a g are even larger than those of ε a nf 4 4 quantifying the impact of ecological construction measures and climate changes on runoff change to estimate the contributions of each explanatory variable to runoff change the median parameters of the 10 000 samplings table 4 were applied to establish the budyko hypothesis based long term rainfall runoff model a model with high accuracy will have reliable results in terms of contribution estimation thus the mean annual runoff values of the simulated series from the four models were calculated and compared with the observed series fig 6 and the quantile plot of 11 year moving average annual runoff estimated from the four models was drawn fig 7 a d to further evaluate the goodness of fit of these budyko hypothesis based long term rainfall runoff models it can be observed from fig 6 that the mean annual runoff values of all simulated series were very close to the observed values during the long term period from 1957 to 2015 and the relative bias errors of the four models were all smaller than 5 the time series in fig 7 shows that the simulated moving average annual runoff from all models is in good agreement with the observed values which is indicated by values higher than 0 8 for all nse and kge coefficients it also indicates that an overwhelming majority of observed moving average annual runoff points are located in the 90ppu band the p 0 9 factor values are all larger than 0 85 for all models and the 90ppu bands of all models are also small with all p 0 9 factor values being smaller than 1 5 the elasticity coefficients of the explanatory variables are presented in table5 the ε p ranged from 2 215 wang to 2 535 zhang ε e 0 from 1 488 zhang to 1 137 wang ε a nf from 0 230 yang to 0 111 wang and ε a g was 0 166 wang although the elasticity coefficients were different for each of the four models the elasticity coefficients of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are close to the results of gao et al 2016 ε p 2 3 ε e 0 1 3 in wuding river the contributions of each explanatory variable to change in long term runoff from 1972 to 2015 were calculated based on the elasticity coefficients and the results are shown in fig 8 the contribution rates of precipitation ranged from 34 9 wang to 39 9 zhang and of potential evapotranspiration ranged from 4 5 zhang to 3 4 wang the contribution rates of natural reforestation ranged from 28 0 wang to 57 6 m c y and that of artificial grassland was 29 7 as obtained by wang s formula 5 discussion 5 1 causes of changes in long term runoff the results obtained from the m c y fu zhang and wang formulas based long term rainfall runoff models showed similar influences of climatic variables i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration on long term runoff decline from 1972 to 2015 in the wuding river basin precipitation accounted for approximately 37 of the total runoff decline and potential evapotranspiration accounted for approximately 4 therefore the cumulative contribution rate of the climatic variables on runoff reduction from 1972 to 2015 was approximately 33 compared to the reference value from 1957 to 1971 and the results are comparable to the findings of liang et al 2014 and gao et al 2016 that that the reduction of runoff in wuding river due to climate change is around 30 all the models indicated that climate change was not the primary reason for the declines in long term runoff in the wuding river basin however the contribution rates of the described ecological construction measures estimated from the m c y fu and zhang formulas differed from those obtained using wang s formula the results of the m c y fu and zhang formulas indicate that natural reforestation is the main reason for long term runoff decline however the results obtained using wang s formula indicated that the influence of artificial grassland is slightly larger gerlein safdi et al 2020 found that protecting land and allowing natural reforestation to recolonize an area leads to an increase in vegetation cover and activity thus the key question is whether artificial grasslands have a large influence on runoff decline hu et al 2017 integrated and synthesized 43 articles including 331 runoff experimental plots in the loess plateau of china to quantify the impacts of land use transitions on runoff and found that artificial grasslands have as high a runoff reduction effectiveness as natural vegetation huo et al 2021 showed grassland plays a more important role in water conservation than forest vegetation in the typical gully watershed yanwachuan in the loess plateau thus the results of the wang formula are reasonable and will be further analyzed this indicates that both natural reforestation and artificial grassland are the main influencing factors of long term runoff reduction in the wuding river basin notably the change induced runoff decline estimated from the elasticity coefficients was not equal to the total runoff decline there are two potential reasons for the residual term one is that the interaction effect between the explanatory variables is ignored as only the first order partial derivatives of the model response are computed to estimate the elasticity coefficients of the explanatory variables there are interaction effects between climate soil and vegetation and both gentine et al 2012 and troch et al 2013 revealed that vegetation adapts to local climate conditions in ways that optimize water use efficiency and the long term surface hydrologic cycle could be a reflection of multiple vegetation adaptations ning et al 2019 revealed vegetation coverage is closely related to climate seasonality and asynchrony index at long term scale in the loess plateau the other likely reason for residual term is that there are other explanatory variables influencing runoff besides the selected variables of natural reforestation and artificial grassland as demonstrated by the relative bias errors between the observed and simulated mean annual runoff in different decades fig 6 the relative bias error of the long term rainfall runoff model based on the wang formula reached 15 in the 1990s and it was the smallest among the four models in addition to forest and grassland other ecological construction measures such as terraces and check dams can alter the underlying surface and increase infiltration and intercept runoff thus reducing runoff chen et al 2007 huang and zhang 2004 xu et al 2013c and check dams in particular can increase wet meadow vegetation and greenness at the basin scale bombino et al 2006 2014 hartman et al 2016 therefore the residual term donated as rt is resulted from the interaction effect between climate and vegetation and the runoff decline caused by other ecological construction measures i e terraces and check dams the contribution rate of rt on long term runoff reduction from 1972 to 2015 is approximately 11 5 2 contribution rates of the explanatory covariates to runoff change between different years the contribution of the explanatory covariates to runoff change was compared between different years using the wang formula based long term rainfall runoff model fig 9 the contribution reuslts were quite different from years to years the contribution rates of precipitation potential evapotranspiration natural reforestation and artificial grassland ranged from 14 0 to 83 4 0 1 to 4 8 0 1 to 50 1 and 11 5 to 37 2 respectively precipitation played a key role in increasing runoff in the 2010s with a contribution rate of 14 0 due to the high amount of precipitation the mean annual precipitation in the 2010s was 3 9 larger than in the baseline period but the mean annual runoff for this period decreased by 46 4 these results confirm the high efficiency of ecological construction measures in reducing runoff the contribution rates of the residual term on runoff decline were approximately 20 from the 1960s to the 1980s and reached 30 after the 1990s but the rate in the 1990s was negative this could be attributed to several reasons the artificial forest and grass would decay quickly owing to the decrease in anti drought capacity when they encounter heavy drought chen et al 2008 and the relative impact of trees on summer runoff in dry years is smaller than in wet years when the transpiration of trees is less limited by soil water availability iroumé and palacios 2013 zabret and šraj 2019 therefore the interaction effect between climate and vegetation might be negative and the role of vegetation was likely overestimated in the 1990s when the mean annual precipitation was the lowest among the decades furthermore the role of ecological construction measures on runoff is time dependent most the engineering based constructions that were built in the early stages were filled up or depleted by the 1990s xu 2010 thus their efficiency in decreasing runoff was limited during the 1990s precipitation has always been a key role in reducing runoff from the 1970s to the 1990s and the contribution of precipitation to the runoff decline in the 1990s was the largest reaching 83 4 this indicates that precipitation is the dominant factor influencing runoff decline from the 1960s to the 1990s lyu et al 2019 also showed that climate change was responsible for approximate 80 of runoff reductions over the period between 1975 and 1989 in chabagou which is a small tributary of the wuding river for the vegetation based ecological construction measures the role of natural reforestation and artificial grassland in reducing runoff gradually increase and the sum of natural reforestation and artificial grassland contribution rates were above 80 after the year 2000 wang et al 2017 also suggested re vegetation became important after the 1990s in the yellow river basin 6 conclusions this study stressed the influence of ecological construction measures on water energy balance and further quantified the contribution of climate variables and ecological construction measures to runoff change in the wuding river basin based on the mezentsev choudhury yang fu zhang and wang formulas the relationships between the budyko land surface parameter from four formulas and five ecological construction measures i e horizontal terrace silted check dam artificial grassland afforestation and natural reforestation were analyzed natural reforestation was found to have an important impact on the long term water energy balance based on the results from all formulas and the results from the wang formula indicate the role of artificial grassland on runoff is also significant the contributions of climate variables and specific ecological construction measures to runoff change at different sub periods were estimated the results from wang formulas based long term rainfall runoff model indicate precipitation and potential evapotranspiration accounted for 35 and 4 respectively of the long term runoff decline from 1972 to 2015 compared to the baseline period from 1957 to 1971 the role of vegetation i e natural reforestation and artificial grassland accounted for 58 and the role of residual term i e the interaction effect between climate and vegetation as well as terraces and check dams measures was 11 in total the results between different years show that precipitation is the main factor associated with the runoff decrease from the 1970s to the 1990s and the impact of vegetation measures became dominant after the year 2000 the study demonstrated the importance of natural reforestation on eco hydrologic processes and the results can provide some useful suggestions for land management for developing countries such as priority should be given to natural reforestation in future ecological construction practices however the data used in this study are limited to hydrological data and the areal extent of some ecological construction measures and the areas under artificial grassland and afforestation are not equivalent to those of natural grassland and forest the inclusion of normalized difference vegetation index vegetation coverage and leaf area index data can be introduced in future research to provide additional supporting evidence for quantifying the contribution of climate and land use variables to runoff change credit authorship

4278,the budyko framework can effectively quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on runoff changes however the impact of specific ecological construction measure on water balance requires further investigation in this study a budyko framework was used to analyze the impact of ecological construction measures on the long term water energy balance and quantify the contribution of climate variables and ecological construction measures to runoff change first the explanatory variables of land surface parameters were selected and evaluated next the long term rainfall runoff models were established based on the budyko hypothesis with land surface parameters expressed as a function of explanatory variables finally the runoff elasticities of each explanatory variable were derived and the contribution of climate variables and ecological construction measures to runoff change at different sub periods were further analyzed the framework was applied to the wuding river which is a large tributary of the yellow river located in the loess plateau and a bootstrapping technique was applied to conduct cross validation of the proposed framework among the five ecological construction measures i e horizontal terrace check dam artificial grassland artificial afforestation and natural reforestation the most significant impact on the long term water energy balance was the natural reforestation the role of artificial grassland on runoff was also significant analysis of contribution rates to runoff change revealed that precipitation is the main factor associated with the decrease in runoff from the 1970s to the 1990s compared to the baseline period from 1957 to 1971 and the impact of vegetation measures increased and gradually became dominant after the year 2000 keywords runoff contribution quantification budyko framework ecological construction measures loess plateau 1 introduction the ongoing intensification of the water cycle as indicated by observations from many regions worldwide has exerted global scale impacts on water resources milly et al 2005 huntington 2006 the increasingly extreme weather events with accompanying increases in global temperature and changes in precipitation patterns affect streamflow discharge globally vörösmarty et al 2000 qin et al 2014 human activities such as land use change dam construction reservoir operation surface water and groundwater withdrawal and ecological construction have both direct and indirect impacts on streamflow changes sterling et al 2013 liang et al 2014 the loess plateau which belongs to the arid and semi arid climate of northwest china is vulnerable to disasters such as drought rainstorms and floods moreover afforestation returning farmland to forest land check dam construction and other ecological construction activities have led to changes in the underlying surface conditions of the loess plateau since the 1950s therefore runoff in the middle reaches of the yellow river especially in the coarse sandy hilly catchments of the loess plateau has decreased significantly under the combined influence of climate change and intensive human activities mu et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 three methods have been commonly used for the assessment of hydrological responses to climate change and human activity these include empirical statistics hydrological modelling and the budyko framework empirical statistics that establish a relationship between runoff and climate variable mainly include regression analyses and the double mass curve method schilling et al 2010 wang et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 however in this method only the linear relationship between runoff and climate variables is considered and physical hydrological processes remain unaccounted for hydrological modelling methods that employ complex models to simulate the hydrological cycle assess the impact of climate change by comparing simulations driven by different climatic scenarios chiew et al 2009 jones et al 2006 karlsson et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a zuo et al 2016 chang et al 2015 niraula et al 2017 joseph et al 2018 hydrological models have a sound physical basis however there are some uncertainties in the structure and parameters of such models leavesley 1994 mendoza et al 2016 moreover the lack of model validation can lead to significant bias in the assessment of climate change impacts on runoff legesse et al 2003 the budyko framework constitutes rainfall runoff models effectively based on the budyko hypothesis that actual evapotranspiration is controlled by both water and energy availability yang et al 2007 additionally the inclusion of evapotranspiration when calculating runoff yield makes the budyko framework more consistent with the true hydrological cycle than the empirical statistics the elasticity based methods based on the budyko framework which generate estimates of streamflow elasticity are simple and effective approaches to quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on runoff changes and have been widely used in hydrology donohue et al 2011 fu et al 2007 ma et al 2010 roderick and farquhar 2011 xu et al 2013b yang et al 2014b yang and yang 2011 zhang et al 2018b li et al 2019 sinha et al 2020 wu et al 2017 used changes in runoff in the yanhe river basin as a case study to compare the quantitative results obtained using the three main categories of modelling approaches and found that the elasticity based methods based on the budyko framework and hydrological modelling were essentially consistent in the loess plateau ecological construction measures have been implemented since the 1950s these measures include planting of vegetation natural vegetation rehabilitation terracing and construction of check dams all of which are potential influencing factors of runoff liang et al 2014 explored the runoff response of the loess plateau to climate change and ecological restoration based on a budyko hydrological model the contribution of ecological restoration to runoff reduction was on average 62 much larger than that of climate change 38 using the budyko framework and elasticity method gao et al 2016 found that land use cover played a primary role in 10 out of 15 catchments of the loess plateau with contributions of more than 60 and the contribution of land use cover changes was positively correlated with the relative area of soil and water conservation measures chen et al 2020 performed a meta analysis by using 22 hydrological modelling studies covering 25 different watersheds in the loess plateau and concluded that land use change accounted for 63 52 of the streamflow reduction despite the depth of research in this area several questions need further investigation first the previous studies mainly considered different human activities such as constructing terraces and check dams replanting trees and pasture establishment as a single category i e ecological restoration or land use cover change it is unclear which kind of ecological construction measure plays a leading role in the variation of runoff second the impact of climate variability and land use cover changes on runoff might be different in some sub periods bao et al 2019 showed that in the middle yellow river climate variability was the main factor for streamflow decrease from 1980 to 2000 whereas land use cover change was the main factor for streamflow decrease from 2001 to 2016 it is unclear the temporal effects of climate variability and ecological construction measure on the runoff reduction of the loess plateau to discuss these questions the land surface parameter of budyko hypothesis based formulas can be considered as a variable the relationship between vegetation variables and the budyko land surface parameter is previously established li et al 2013 xu et al 2013a zhang et al 2018b to quantify the impacts of vegetation change on hydrological partitioning however the budyko land surface parameter is not governed by vegetation characteristics exclusively sinha et al 2019 established the relationship between the land surface parameter of the fu formula and eight watershed characteristics ning et al 2019 identified the dominant factors applicable to estimate the budyko land surface parameter of china s loess plateau at different time scales besides the leaf area index vegetation coverage and topography variables the ecological construction measure implemented in the loess plateau i e horizontal terrace check dam artificial grassland artificial afforestation and natural reforestation are all possible explanatory variables of the land surface parameter in this study the relationship the budyko land surface parameter and ecological construction measures will be analyzed to identify the impact of ecological construction measures on the long term water energy balance the elasticity coefficients of climate variables and ecological construction measures to runoff will be calculated to quantify the contribution of specific ecological construction measures to runoff change at different sub periods sinha et al 2020 suggested that the selection of the method should be done cautiously while quantifying the impacts of changing parameters based on the budyko hypothesis therefore the formulas developed by mezentsev choudhury yang mezentsev 1955 choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 fu 1981 zhang et al 2001 and wang and tang 2014 each of which provides a budyko land surface parameter to reflect the watershed characteristics are all applied in our study in section 2 the budyko based long term rainfall runoff models are constructed and the elasticity coefficients to quantify hydrological responses to changes in climate and ecological construction measures are presented in section 3 the study area and the data of runoff precipitation evapotranspiration and ecological construction measure areas are introduced in section 4 the land surface parameter is linked with the ecological construction measure and the effects of climate variables and different ecological construction measures on runoff reduction are quantified the causes of runoff changes and the temporal effects of climate variability and ecological construction measures are discussed the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 methods 2 1 budyko hypothesis based runoff methods the water balance equation is fundamental for the establishment of the long term rainfall runoff model 1 r p e δ s where r p e and δs are the long term mean values of runoff precipitation actual evapotranspiration and water storage change respectively all variables are measured in units of millimeters per year mm yr 1 annual precipitation p is estimated as the watershed weighted average of the observed rain at meteorological stations within and around the watershed the budyko hypothesis which is represented as formulas relating actual evapotranspiration e to the aridity index ϕ e 0 p is usually applied to estimate actual evapotranspiration dooge 1992 kuhnel et al 1991 and the e 0 can be estimated through the widely used fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 donohue et al 2007 argued that the budyko framework s reliability is greatest when applied using long term averages and to large catchments both ning et al 2017 and liu et al 2018 found climate seasonality has a significant effect on the land surface parameter at the annual scale wang 2012 and shao et al 2021 revealed the interannual variability of storage change can be a significant component in annual water balance in both illinois and loess plateau thus analyzing the annual water balance ignoring climate seasonality and δs might lead to large errors gentine et al 2012 illustrated that seasonality between rainfall and potential evaporation does not alter the fit of the river basins to the budyko curve on a long term time scale shao et al 2021 found that ignoring δs at a 10 year scale had the least influence on water budget closure over the loess plateau therefore in our study the annual data were smoothed with an 11 year moving average to explore the factors that impacted the controlling parameters in the budyko framework the long term rainfall runoff model developed based on the budyko hypothesis with a land surface parameter is usually expressed as 2 r p 1 g e 0 p ω where g represents the functional relationship between actual evapotranspiration and the aridity index based on the budyko hypothesis and ω represents the budyko land surface parameter the mezentsev choudhury yang m c y fu zhang and wang formulas are presented in table1 to reveal how the land surface parameter in each budyko type equation would vary with ecological construction measures the budyko land surface parameter ω was expressed as the dependent variable of ecological construction measures jiang et al 2015 3 ω t exp β 0 β 1 x 1 t e β k x k t e where x 1 e x k e are the selected ecological construction measure variables in the time window centered with year t the exponent function is added in eq 3 to guarantee the land surface parameter is always greater than zero the series of ω might have highly discrete distributions with high skewness and kurtosis thus a semiparametric regression model named the generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss is applied when estimating the parameters of eq 3 gamlss relaxes the assumption that response variables belong to an exponential distribution family and overcomes the limitations of the generalized linear and generalized additive model and can describe the linear or non linear relationship between any statistical parameter of the dependent and explanatory covariates rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 in this study the gamma distribution function which is flexible and has been widely used in hydrologic analysis yue et al 2001 was chosen to describe the distribution of the ω series the mean value of ω was assumed to be a function of the explanatory variables and the coefficient of variation and skewness are assumed to be constants the accumulative areas of five ecological construction measures i e terracing check dam artificial grassland afforestation and natural reforestation are considered as candidate explanatory variables of ω as xu and wang 2011 found that the flow regime was closely correlated with these soil and water conservation measures rather than reservoirs the steps for selecting the explanatory variable of the land surface parameters have been detailed in the subsequent portion first the annual data are smoothed with an 11 year moving average then the land surface parameters of the budyko formulas are estimated based on runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data to meet the coupled water energy balance every 11 years the relationship between the land surface parameter and each explanatory variable is constructed the explanatory variable with minimum aic akaike information criterion value is selected and another variable is considered for addition from the set of explanatory variables based on the likelihood ratio test the inclusion of the variable if any is based on which variable provides the most significant improvement in the model fit this process is repeated until variable addition provides no further significant improvement in the model the flowchart of the methodology implemented in the study is presented in fig 1 the nash efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge coefficients were applied to evaluate the goodness of fit of the long term rainfall runoff models the kge gupta et al 2009 which combines the three components of the nse model errors i e correlation bias ratio of variances or coefficients of variation in a balanced way approach has been widely used for calibration and evaluation models in hydrology mathevet et al 2020 meles et al 2021 the p 0 9 factor and r 0 9 factor were used to assess model uncertainties the p 0 9 factor as the percentage of monitoring data covered by 90 prediction uncertainty 90 ppu and the r 0 9 factor as the average thickness of the 90 ppu band divided by the standard deviation of monitoring data are also applied and the effectiveness of calibration is assessed the proximities of the p and r factors to 1 and 0 respectively 2 2 quantification of hydrological response to changes in climate and ecological construction measure the elasticity based method which effectively estimates runoff elasticity was applied in our study to quantify runoff responses to changes in climate and ecological construction measures according to eq 3 runoff can be modelled as a function of climatic variables and ecological construction measure areas thus changes in runoff caused by changing climate and ecological construction measures can be approximated as follows 4 δ r r p δ p r e 0 δ e 0 r x 1 δ x 1 e r x k δ x k e where δ r δ p δ e 0 δ x 1 e δ x k e are the changes in runoff depth precipitation potential evapotranspiration and ecological construction measures respectively the elasticity of runoff ε is defined as the ratio of the runoff variation rate to the variation rate of a certain explanatory factor and is expressed as follows sankarasubramanian et al 2001 5 ε i r r x i x i where x represents the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and ecological construction measures used in this study thus eq 4 can be rewritten as 6 δ r ε p δ p p ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 ε x 1 e δ x 1 e x 1 e ε x k e δ x k e x k e r where ε p ε e 0 ε a d ε x 1 e ε x k e are the runoff elasticities for precipitation potential evapotranspiration and ecological construction measures respectively from eq 3 ε p ε e 0 ε x k e can be calculated as follows 7 ε p 1 ϕ g ϕ 1 g ϕ ω 8 ε e 0 ϕ g ϕ 1 g ϕ ω 9 ε x k e x k e β k ω g ω 1 g ϕ ω the elasticity coefficients are defined as the long term mean values of the explanatory variables roderick and farquhar 2011 the trend analysis of the hydro meteorological series and ecological construction measure areas was performed using the mann kendall test method to cross validate the rainfall runoff model bootstrapping was applied after selecting the explanatory variable of the land surface parameter resampling was performed 10 000 times with 30 years selected randomly to constitute a calibration period and the remaining 19 years constituting the validation period 3 study area and data 3 1 study area as a major tributary in the middle reach of the yellow river located in the loess plateau the wuding river 30261 km2 which is characterized by relatively less water and abundant sediment is the main source of sediment for the lower reaches of the yellow river li et al 2007 the wuding river basin has undergone a series of ecological construction measures since 1957 to control soil erosion the conservation measures included building terraces and check dams as well as land cover changes by planting trees and grasslands massive planting of vegetation terracing and construction of check dams were undertaken in the 1970s furthermore large scale water and soil conservation projects have been implemented since 2000 and the total area affected by ecological construction measures was 10 880 km2 by 2015 which is approximately 38 7 of the total basin area afforestation accounted for the largest areas of the ecological construction measures 26 5 of the total basin area followed by artificial grasslands 5 3 horizontal terraces 4 1 natural reforestation 2 1 and check dams 0 7 3 2 data sources annual runoff r data from baijiachuan the gauging station located at the outlet of the wuding river annual precipitation p from 29 precipitation stations annual potential evapotranspiration e 0 from 5 meteorological stations were selected for water balance analysis of the basin fig 2 the annual runoff and precipitation data used in this study were obtained from the hydrologic year book bureau of hydrology of the yellow river conservancy commission china http www hwswj gov cn swjcms the annual potential evapotranspiration was determined from meteorological data using the fao 56 penman monteith equation and meteorological data were obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn the annual precipitation and annual potential evapotranspiration are areal mean data calculated using thiessen polygons accumulative horizontal terrace area at accumulative silted check dam area ad accumulative artificial grassland area ag accumulative artificial afforestation area aaf and accumulative natural reforestation anf were selected as candidate explanatory variables of land surface parameters the areas of ad at aaf ag and anf were obtained from the loess plateau data center national earth system science data sharing infrastructure national science technology infrastructure of china http loess geodata cn 4 results 4 1 trends in annual hydro meteorological series and accumulative ecological construction measure areas the time series of hydro meteorological variables i e r p and e 0 from 1957 to 2015 are presented in fig 3 as well as the accumulative ecological construction measure areas i e ad at aaf ag and anf series the trend analysis of the hydrological series and ecological construction measure areas was performed using the mann kendall test method and the results are shown in table 2 it can be observed that r and e 0 have significant decreasing trends at the 5 significance level whereas the p series has an increasing but not significant trend however the ad at aaf ag and anf series all show significant increasing trends at the 5 significance level the decreasing trend of e 0 is consistent with the results of ning et al 2016 li et al 2007 found an abrupt change in the annual runoff of the wuding river in 1972 it can be observed from fig 3 that annual runoff value before 1971 was frequently more than 50 mm but the annual runoff value decreased sharply after 1971 and there was only one year whose annual runoff reach 50 mm after 1971 thus the baseline period was determined as 1957 to 1971 in our study the period from 1972 to 2015 was divided into two parts with the year 2000 when large scale ecological construction measures took place as the demarcator the statistical values of the hydro meteorological series and ecological construction measure series from 1957 to 1971 baseline period were compared with the values from 1972 to 1999 and from 2000 to 2015 table 2 it can be observed that the mean value of annual runoff r decreased from 15 23 mm during the baseline period to 10 00 mm during 1972 to 1999 and further to 7 90 mm during 2000 to 2015 the coefficient of skewness cs and coefficient of variation cv indicate that the variability of r during 1972 to 1999 was the largest compared with that in other periods the statistical values of the p series remained stationary between the different periods the statistical values of the e 0 series show that the mean value in the baseline period was slightly larger than that in the other two periods but the variability of e 0 was quite small compared to that of other hydrological variables the areal extent of ecological construction measures from 2000 to 2015 was the largest almost twice the area covered from 1972 to 1999 and more than five times that during the baseline period notably that the curve of anf was significantly different from that of the other ecological construction measures natural reforestation started only in 1980 and anf increased on a larger scale than that of areas under other interventions after 2000 4 2 linking the land surface parameter with the ecological construction measure the land surface parameter values required to satisfy the coupled water energy balance every 11 years were determined using the m c y fu zhang and wang formulas based on the observed r and p data and e 0 estimated from the fao 56 penman monteith equation the time series of land surface parameters estimated from the four formulas are presented in fig 4 where the year represents the centered time window all land surface parameters exhibited similar trends the parameters displayed a decreasing trend during the baseline period before 1970 had a slightly increasing trend from 1970 to 2000 and increased substantially after 2000 the moving average percent of accumulative ecological construction measure areas to the whole basin area is aslo shown in fig 4 it can be observed that the variation in land surface parameters is closely related to the area of natural reforestation anf the relationships between land surface parameters and ecological construction measure variables were constructed to select the explanatory variable of the land surface parameter the aic values of these relationships are listed in table 3 all the relationships indicate that anf is the main influencing factor of the land surface parameter thus anf was selected first the likelihood ratio test results indicated that anf is the only factor influencing the land surface parameter for the m c y fu and zhang formulas and anf and ag are influencing factors for the wang formula the results of all formulas indicate that the land surface parameter is closely related to the vegetation measure ning et al 2019 verified that the vegetation information is the key variable for the parameterization of the budyko model at a long term scale in the loess plateau compared with the natural reforestation the areas of artificial afforestation were quite large however the low survival rate of vegetation during the period from the 1950s to 1990s resulted in a limited effect of artificial afforestation measures on runoff reduction cao 2008 mcvicar et al 2010 4 3 cross validation of the long term rainfall runoff model to cross validate the long term rainfall runoff model the calibration period constituting 30 years was randomly selected 10 000 times through resampling and the remaining years were utilized as the validation period the parameters of eq 3 which describe the relationship between land surface parameters and ecological construction measure areas were estimated 10 000 times using the calibration period data for the m c y fu zhang and wang formulas the evaluation indicators nse kge p 0 9 factor and r 0 9 factor were calculated to assess the performance of these models and the elasticity coefficients of the explanatory variables were calculated by applying eqs 7 9 the box plots of the elasticity coefficients and the evaluation indicators in both the calibration period and validation period are illustrated in fig 5 the interquartile ranges 25 75 of these budyko hypothesis based runoff models from different calibration samples are were not large more than three quarters of the nse kge and p 0 9 factor values are larger than 0 8 during the calibration period and all r 0 9 factor values shown in the box plot are smaller than 2 the interquartile ranges and dispersion ranges 5 95 of all models for the validation periods were larger than those for the calibration periods but the median values of all evaluation indicators were comparable between the two periods all the results indicate that these budyko hypothesis based runoff models are robust and the conclusion is also verified by the elasticity coefficient results although the dispersion ranges of ε p and ε e 0 from the four budyko hypothesis based runoff models were all small the ε p and ε e 0 values were different the ε p value from the zhang formula was always the highest and that from the wang formula was always the lowest the results of ε e 0 showed the opposite trend the ε a nf results estimated from the m c y fu and zhang formulas were similar both the interquartile and dispersion ranges of ε a nf and ε a g from the wang formula were much larger but most of the ε a nf and ε a g values were also smaller than 0 forest vegetation directly reduces the amount of net precipitation through increases in precipitation interception and evaporation and thus has a great influence on reducing surface runoff brown et al 2005 winkler et al 2010 wang et al 2011 furthermore the increase in grassland cover and agricultural acreage also has an impact on increasing evapotranspiration resulting in reduced runoff farley et al 2005 thus the parameters of these runoff models were reasonable among the four budyko hypothesis based runoff models the performance of the m c y and fu formula based models were close to each other in terms of both elasticity coefficients and evaluation indicators the wang formula based model in which the land surface parameter has two explanatory variables ε a g and ε a nf showed a larger uncertainty with a higher r 0 9 factor value and much larger interquartile and dispersion ranges of ε a nf than those of the other models and the interquartile and dispersion ranges of ε a g are even larger than those of ε a nf 4 4 quantifying the impact of ecological construction measures and climate changes on runoff change to estimate the contributions of each explanatory variable to runoff change the median parameters of the 10 000 samplings table 4 were applied to establish the budyko hypothesis based long term rainfall runoff model a model with high accuracy will have reliable results in terms of contribution estimation thus the mean annual runoff values of the simulated series from the four models were calculated and compared with the observed series fig 6 and the quantile plot of 11 year moving average annual runoff estimated from the four models was drawn fig 7 a d to further evaluate the goodness of fit of these budyko hypothesis based long term rainfall runoff models it can be observed from fig 6 that the mean annual runoff values of all simulated series were very close to the observed values during the long term period from 1957 to 2015 and the relative bias errors of the four models were all smaller than 5 the time series in fig 7 shows that the simulated moving average annual runoff from all models is in good agreement with the observed values which is indicated by values higher than 0 8 for all nse and kge coefficients it also indicates that an overwhelming majority of observed moving average annual runoff points are located in the 90ppu band the p 0 9 factor values are all larger than 0 85 for all models and the 90ppu bands of all models are also small with all p 0 9 factor values being smaller than 1 5 the elasticity coefficients of the explanatory variables are presented in table5 the ε p ranged from 2 215 wang to 2 535 zhang ε e 0 from 1 488 zhang to 1 137 wang ε a nf from 0 230 yang to 0 111 wang and ε a g was 0 166 wang although the elasticity coefficients were different for each of the four models the elasticity coefficients of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are close to the results of gao et al 2016 ε p 2 3 ε e 0 1 3 in wuding river the contributions of each explanatory variable to change in long term runoff from 1972 to 2015 were calculated based on the elasticity coefficients and the results are shown in fig 8 the contribution rates of precipitation ranged from 34 9 wang to 39 9 zhang and of potential evapotranspiration ranged from 4 5 zhang to 3 4 wang the contribution rates of natural reforestation ranged from 28 0 wang to 57 6 m c y and that of artificial grassland was 29 7 as obtained by wang s formula 5 discussion 5 1 causes of changes in long term runoff the results obtained from the m c y fu zhang and wang formulas based long term rainfall runoff models showed similar influences of climatic variables i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration on long term runoff decline from 1972 to 2015 in the wuding river basin precipitation accounted for approximately 37 of the total runoff decline and potential evapotranspiration accounted for approximately 4 therefore the cumulative contribution rate of the climatic variables on runoff reduction from 1972 to 2015 was approximately 33 compared to the reference value from 1957 to 1971 and the results are comparable to the findings of liang et al 2014 and gao et al 2016 that that the reduction of runoff in wuding river due to climate change is around 30 all the models indicated that climate change was not the primary reason for the declines in long term runoff in the wuding river basin however the contribution rates of the described ecological construction measures estimated from the m c y fu and zhang formulas differed from those obtained using wang s formula the results of the m c y fu and zhang formulas indicate that natural reforestation is the main reason for long term runoff decline however the results obtained using wang s formula indicated that the influence of artificial grassland is slightly larger gerlein safdi et al 2020 found that protecting land and allowing natural reforestation to recolonize an area leads to an increase in vegetation cover and activity thus the key question is whether artificial grasslands have a large influence on runoff decline hu et al 2017 integrated and synthesized 43 articles including 331 runoff experimental plots in the loess plateau of china to quantify the impacts of land use transitions on runoff and found that artificial grasslands have as high a runoff reduction effectiveness as natural vegetation huo et al 2021 showed grassland plays a more important role in water conservation than forest vegetation in the typical gully watershed yanwachuan in the loess plateau thus the results of the wang formula are reasonable and will be further analyzed this indicates that both natural reforestation and artificial grassland are the main influencing factors of long term runoff reduction in the wuding river basin notably the change induced runoff decline estimated from the elasticity coefficients was not equal to the total runoff decline there are two potential reasons for the residual term one is that the interaction effect between the explanatory variables is ignored as only the first order partial derivatives of the model response are computed to estimate the elasticity coefficients of the explanatory variables there are interaction effects between climate soil and vegetation and both gentine et al 2012 and troch et al 2013 revealed that vegetation adapts to local climate conditions in ways that optimize water use efficiency and the long term surface hydrologic cycle could be a reflection of multiple vegetation adaptations ning et al 2019 revealed vegetation coverage is closely related to climate seasonality and asynchrony index at long term scale in the loess plateau the other likely reason for residual term is that there are other explanatory variables influencing runoff besides the selected variables of natural reforestation and artificial grassland as demonstrated by the relative bias errors between the observed and simulated mean annual runoff in different decades fig 6 the relative bias error of the long term rainfall runoff model based on the wang formula reached 15 in the 1990s and it was the smallest among the four models in addition to forest and grassland other ecological construction measures such as terraces and check dams can alter the underlying surface and increase infiltration and intercept runoff thus reducing runoff chen et al 2007 huang and zhang 2004 xu et al 2013c and check dams in particular can increase wet meadow vegetation and greenness at the basin scale bombino et al 2006 2014 hartman et al 2016 therefore the residual term donated as rt is resulted from the interaction effect between climate and vegetation and the runoff decline caused by other ecological construction measures i e terraces and check dams the contribution rate of rt on long term runoff reduction from 1972 to 2015 is approximately 11 5 2 contribution rates of the explanatory covariates to runoff change between different years the contribution of the explanatory covariates to runoff change was compared between different years using the wang formula based long term rainfall runoff model fig 9 the contribution reuslts were quite different from years to years the contribution rates of precipitation potential evapotranspiration natural reforestation and artificial grassland ranged from 14 0 to 83 4 0 1 to 4 8 0 1 to 50 1 and 11 5 to 37 2 respectively precipitation played a key role in increasing runoff in the 2010s with a contribution rate of 14 0 due to the high amount of precipitation the mean annual precipitation in the 2010s was 3 9 larger than in the baseline period but the mean annual runoff for this period decreased by 46 4 these results confirm the high efficiency of ecological construction measures in reducing runoff the contribution rates of the residual term on runoff decline were approximately 20 from the 1960s to the 1980s and reached 30 after the 1990s but the rate in the 1990s was negative this could be attributed to several reasons the artificial forest and grass would decay quickly owing to the decrease in anti drought capacity when they encounter heavy drought chen et al 2008 and the relative impact of trees on summer runoff in dry years is smaller than in wet years when the transpiration of trees is less limited by soil water availability iroumé and palacios 2013 zabret and šraj 2019 therefore the interaction effect between climate and vegetation might be negative and the role of vegetation was likely overestimated in the 1990s when the mean annual precipitation was the lowest among the decades furthermore the role of ecological construction measures on runoff is time dependent most the engineering based constructions that were built in the early stages were filled up or depleted by the 1990s xu 2010 thus their efficiency in decreasing runoff was limited during the 1990s precipitation has always been a key role in reducing runoff from the 1970s to the 1990s and the contribution of precipitation to the runoff decline in the 1990s was the largest reaching 83 4 this indicates that precipitation is the dominant factor influencing runoff decline from the 1960s to the 1990s lyu et al 2019 also showed that climate change was responsible for approximate 80 of runoff reductions over the period between 1975 and 1989 in chabagou which is a small tributary of the wuding river for the vegetation based ecological construction measures the role of natural reforestation and artificial grassland in reducing runoff gradually increase and the sum of natural reforestation and artificial grassland contribution rates were above 80 after the year 2000 wang et al 2017 also suggested re vegetation became important after the 1990s in the yellow river basin 6 conclusions this study stressed the influence of ecological construction measures on water energy balance and further quantified the contribution of climate variables and ecological construction measures to runoff change in the wuding river basin based on the mezentsev choudhury yang fu zhang and wang formulas the relationships between the budyko land surface parameter from four formulas and five ecological construction measures i e horizontal terrace silted check dam artificial grassland afforestation and natural reforestation were analyzed natural reforestation was found to have an important impact on the long term water energy balance based on the results from all formulas and the results from the wang formula indicate the role of artificial grassland on runoff is also significant the contributions of climate variables and specific ecological construction measures to runoff change at different sub periods were estimated the results from wang formulas based long term rainfall runoff model indicate precipitation and potential evapotranspiration accounted for 35 and 4 respectively of the long term runoff decline from 1972 to 2015 compared to the baseline period from 1957 to 1971 the role of vegetation i e natural reforestation and artificial grassland accounted for 58 and the role of residual term i e the interaction effect between climate and vegetation as well as terraces and check dams measures was 11 in total the results between different years show that precipitation is the main factor associated with the runoff decrease from the 1970s to the 1990s and the impact of vegetation measures became dominant after the year 2000 the study demonstrated the importance of natural reforestation on eco hydrologic processes and the results can provide some useful suggestions for land management for developing countries such as priority should be given to natural reforestation in future ecological construction practices however the data used in this study are limited to hydrological data and the areal extent of some ecological construction measures and the areas under artificial grassland and afforestation are not equivalent to those of natural grassland and forest the inclusion of normalized difference vegetation index vegetation coverage and leaf area index data can be introduced in future research to provide additional supporting evidence for quantifying the contribution of climate and land use variables to runoff change credit authorship

4279,accurate and reliable mid to long term streamflow prediction is essential for water resources management however streamflow series exhibits strong non stationary and non linear thus the traditional single model may fail to capture the characteristic of hydrological series and hard to maintain the robustness of the model to overcome this problem the application of empirical wavelet transform combined with improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise iceewt is firstly to eliminate the redundant noise and decompose original series into several components as inputs secondly gated recurrent unit gru is employed to deep learn the relationship between historical streamflow series and those of the future finally balancing underfitting and overfitting the improved grey wolf optimizer igwo is adopted with the hybrid model to identify the approximate parameter combination the case study is conducted by monthly streamflow data at shangjingyou station and fenhe reservoir station in the upper reaches of fenhe river in comparison with parallel experiments using extreme learning machine elm and least squares support vector machine lssvm the validation results demonstrate that the gru model can exhibit satisfactory performance in monthly streamflow forecasting moreover the standard gru model is further improved by igwo which consistently remains the performance of in sample and out sample the proposed model iceewt igwo gru is superior to the single gru model average reducing mae and rmse by 50 and 52 for two stations which indicates its superiority with a more robust prediction keywords streamflow prediction gated recurrent unit empirical wavelet transform improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition

accurate and robust streamflow forecasting is of great importance for many water resource systems ahmed and sarma 2007 reservoir operation optimization niu et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 anghileri et al 2016 environmental protection he et al 2018 feng et al 2020a water resource management wang et al 2011 and flood control liu et al 2018a thus streamflow prediction has attracted increasing attention from many articles reporting the research of various methods applied in literature elshorbagy et al 2010 however it is a difficult task because streamflow series exhibits strong non stationary non linear and highly complex owing to numerous external factors such as precipitation underlying surfaces and evaporation therefore accurate and robust streamflow forecasting is expected to ensure the reliable operation of practical engineering systems up to now the existing models of streamflow forecasting can be roughly divided into two main categories process driven models and data driven models yaseen et al 2016b based on the physical process the predictive accuracy of process driven models rests on a lot of hydrological data and sometimes the insufficient data make it challenging to complete modelling unlike process driven models data driven models require fewer data and have simpler model structures suitable for such areas lacking hydrological data fan et al 2016 in general the data driven models can be further grouped into three categories statistical based models machine learning models and hybrid models the structure of statistical models are simple xue et al 2020 and many articles report the application of them in hydrological prediction such as autoregressive integrated moving average arima phan and nguyen 2020 autoregressive ar zhao and chen 2015 and et al whereas statistical models based on the hypothesis that the time series follows a linear correlation structure which condition streamflow series generally find hard to satisfy streamflow forecasting needs a stronger approach dealing with non linear and complex simulation many scholars recently developed forecasting models based on machine learning ml techniques with their strong ability to learn non linear relationships liao et al 2020 toth and brath 2007 see et al 2007 hu et al 2018 which are in their nascent stages for example extreme learning machine elm and least squares support vector machine lssvm have shown the potential of hydrological prediction yaseen et al 2016a adnan et al 2020 zhao et al 2017b elm requires fewer iterations to adjust hidden neuron parameters in comparison with other single artificial neural networks yaseen et al 2019 lssvm reduces the computational time of support vector machine svm adnan et al 2020 which is popular for the globally optimal solution in regression problems feng et al 2020b however these traditional machine learning algorithms as mentioned above belong to the theory of shallow learning xue et al 2020 increasingly many studies make use of deep learning techniques in which the intrinsic nature of the time series can be learned automatically using a general purpose learning procedure lecun et al 2015 in the field of deep learning recurrent neural networks rnn is one of the most popular neural networks hu and wang 2015 being a special rnn and simplifying the structure of long short term memory gated recurrent unit gru takes a long memory for significant information from previous data which can effectively model complex long time series zhang et al 2018 gru has been successfully applied in many fields for prediction issues such as dissolved oxygen electric loads pore water pressure and remaining useful life prediction li et al 2021 das et al 2020 wei et al 2021 chen et al 2019 but the investigation of how the deep learning model gru mine hidden information in long time series is insufficient especially in streamflow forecasting to the best of the authors knowledge the application of gru method is yet to be explored in forecasting of monthly streamflow thus gru is adopted as a basic forecasting module in our proposed model and many data driven models not only are based on historical values to predict the future but also multivariate model in the context of climate variabilities such as el nino southern oscillation phenomenon and the pacifific decadal oscillation westra and sharma 2009 erkyihun et al 2016 but becasue of the difficulties in data acquisition the history values based model still attracts a lot of scholars attention and in this paper the relationship between historical and future streamflow is learned by the gru model to further enhance the forecast accuracy hybrid models are becoming a promising alternative because of its outperformance over the single models ni et al 2020 there are two methods to build hybrid models integrating with optimization algorithms and applying decomposition techniques sun et al 2018 on the one hand the parameter tuning technique is used to identify the optimal parameter combination and calibrate models to enhance their robustness because of its superior exploitation ability many algorithms including genetic algorithm ga sedki et al 2009 hong et al 2016 grey wolf optimizer gwo tikhamarine et al 2020 and particle swarm optimization pso ch et al 2013 are applied to improve single model forecasting abilities in hydrology therein gwo belongs to the meta heuristic optimization which avoids several local solutions and balances exploration and exploitation efficiency tikhamarine et al 2020 what is more the gwo method is the gradient free optimizer adaptable to more situations such as short term pm2 5 concentration forecasting landslide susceptibility model and bankruptcy prediction jaafari et al 2019 niu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the gradient free optimizers are creative and not limited by the gradient mathematical chain which is different from the gradient based algorithm such as rmsprop and adam du et al 2018 particularly the objective function of gwo controls the algorithm which way to minimize and in most of articles it is the error in the test period which does not consider the model performance in the calibration period as a result with an inappropriate structure of employed gwo the model is likely to get into under fitting or over fitting conditions and provide unreliable prediction results to the best of the author s knowledge this kind of exiting problem has not solved therefore the improved gwo igwo method is exploited in this study to improve the robustness of the hybrid model considering the objective function of optimization algorithm on the other hand the main purpose of decomposition techniques is to simplify the forecasting process di et al 2014 and analyze non stationary and non linear features in datasets before being transformed in the model wen et al 2019 many data preprocessing methods can be applied to predictive models and improve the performance of time series forecasting including singular spectrum analysis ssa mi and zhao 2020 wu et al 2009 empirical mode decomposition emd zhao et al 2017a and improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise iceemdan ali and prasad 2019 recently the model adopted by the double processing strategy which combined with denoising approach ssa and decomposition methods iceemdan obtains satisfactory prediction performance wang et al 2019 furthermore treated ewt as a denoising approach to filter noise contained in the original series the performance of the model proves the data preprocessor is an excellent choice for time series prediction wang and hu 2015 hu and wang 2015 since the double processing strategy and novel data processing tools exhibit a strong ability of pursuing more accurate and stable forecasts this study chooses ewt iceemdan iceewt as the data preprocessing method of the streamflow forecasting model in general the main contribution of our work can be summarized as follows 1 the double processing strategy iceewt is employed to filter noise and decompose the original streamflow series into several subseries as inputs of the further predictive method 2 the deep learning model gru is utilized for learning the instinct relationship between the inputs and outputs 3 to balance generation and optimization capability of the model the igwo method is proposed to tune the gru model with suitable parameter combinations 4 the prediction of the proposed model compared with state of the art models has been quantitatively analyzed and the experimental results demonstrate that iceewt igwo gru can provide accurate prediction results the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows section 2 describes the methods of the proposed hydrological model section 3 presents the performance indicators for evaluating the goodness of fit section 4 introduces the improvement of the models and presents experiments section 5 is the last section which outlines the conclusions of this paper 2 methods 2 1 gru proposed by cho et al 2014 the gru method is a modern rnn which replaced the ordinary neuron in rnn with a memory neuron and solved the vanishing or exploding gradient problem owing to bptt back propagation through time method fig 1 shows the structure of the neuron in hidden layer of gru the neuron has two gates update gate and reset gate modulating the flow of information when the neural state updated at each step the update gate decides how much information from the previous step flow to the neuron and the reset gate controls whether to ignore the previous state and upset the current this allows the neuron to drop the irrelevant information which is found to be unuseful for mapping input and output in the future and further helps the neuron remember long term information by reducing burdens at the present step t the output of previous state ht 1 combined with the input of current state xt is the input of update gate zt and reset gate rt 1 z t σ w z h t 1 x t 2 r t σ w r h t 1 x t where σ presents sigmoid function wz and wr are weights of update gate and reset gate respectively then the new hidden state is calculated by the following 3 h t φ w r t h t 1 x t where φ presents tanh function w is the weight learned from the reset gate at last the output of the present neuron is formulated as 4 h t z t h t 1 z t h t 1 2 2 gwo inspired by hunting behaviors of grey wolves mirjalili et al 2014 proposed the gwo algorithm one of the newest meta heuristic optimizer algorithms generally wolves are divided into four groups the fittest solution the second best solutions the third best solutions and the rest of the candidate solutions which are named alpha α beta β delta σ and omega ω respectively the hunting behaviors including encircling and attacking prey are mathematically modeled as shown below and the hunting is repeated until the fittest solution is obtained x t 1 x p t a d d c x p t x t a 2 a r 1 a 5 c 2 r 2 where t is the current iteration a and d are coefficient vectors x p indicates the position of the prey and x is the position of a grey wolf x t 1 1 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 x a a 1 d a x 2 x β a 2 d β 6 x 3 x δ a 3 d δ where x a x β x δ is the update positions 2 3 igwo as in previous studies the parameter combination of the gru model needs a great number of experiments to be determined in the single model hence to increase the efficiency of the optimization gwo and improved gwo are employed with gru to optimize them particularly the objective function of igwo method which is shown in eq 8 presents the core improvement over traditional gwo method 7 f i t t n e s s f u n c t i o n min i 1 q calilos s i t e s t l o s s i 2 8 f i t t n e s s f u n c t i o n min i 1 q c a l

colominas et al 2014 proposed the iceemdan method alleviating the mode mixing phenomenon and decomposing components with less noise and more physical meaning the iceemdan method the algorithm of iceemdan can be summarized as follows and the illustration of iceemdan is shown in fig 2 step 1 the original streamflow plus white noise is used to compute the first residue by emd 9 r 1 1 i i 1 i m x 1 i step 2 calculate the first intrinsic mode function imf 1 10 imf 1 x r 1 step 3 as in step1 but for r 1 added white noise and estimated the second imf imf 2 with the second residue 11 imf 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 1 i i 1 i m x 2 i step4 the equation for the kth imf imfk is 12 imf m r m 1 r m r m 1 1 i i 1 i m x m i step5 go to step4 until the mth residue can not be decomposed where m x m i i 1 i presents the local mean of the decomposing series added white noise also rm 1 is defined as the mean of the upper and lower envelopes i is the number of white noise and x is the original series 2 5 ewt the ewt method presents for signal decomposition introduced by gilles 2013 and recently the ewt based series denoising is used for removing the noise of original series the original series is decomposed into several modes the most relevant modes are selected and the uncorrelated modes are removed by calculating the correlation coefficient between each of the empirical modes and the original series 2 6 proposed model the proposed hybrid model iceewt igwo gru is composed of three main stages illustrated in fig 3 the first is denoising and decomposition stage where the double processing method iceewt is firstly used to remove noise and decompose the original streamflow series into several intrinsic mode functions imfs secondly the improved gwo selected the parameter combination for the model which is the calibration stage the third stage is the prediction stage where gru is utilized to forecast each of the imfs processed by iceewt finally the prediction of each subseries is summarized to generate the final streamflow forecast the detailed steps of iceewt igwo gru model are as follows 1 the ewt method was implemented to reduce noise from the original streamflow series 2 the iceemdan method decomposed the original series to several imfs 3 the gru method modeled every relationship between inputs and outputs which are formed by every imf 4 the datasets were divided into calibration test and validation dataset 5 igwo was utilized to find the optimal combination of parameters for predictive models 6 obtain forecasting results for the model 3 evaluation indicators in this study three evaluation indicators are discussed for assessing prediction performance in streamflow forecasting the equation for nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse qualification rate qr and mean absolute error mae are shown as follows nse 1 i 1 n σ i σ i 0 2 i 1 n σ i 0 σ 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n σ i σ i 0 2 qr k l 100 13 mae 1 n i 1 n σ i σ i 0 where σi and σi 0 denote every value of the original streamflow series and the predicted series respectively σ represents the mean of the original streamflow series n is the number of streamflow series k denotes the number of the eligible prediction which defined that the relative error of forecast is less than 20 of maximum amplitude of streamflow series l is the length of streamflow series at the validation period nse 1 rmse 0 qr 100 and mae 0 are desirable for a perfect model in streamflow forecasting in practical application nse 0 5 and qr 60 are considered to the satisfactory performance of the model ministry of water resources and p r c 2008 4 case studies 4 1 study area and dataset fenhe river the native river of shanxi province is the second largest tributary of the yellow river as shown in fig 4 the fenhe river flows 716 km and has a total of about 38 728 km2 the area of this basin is the main industrial urban residential and agricultural area of shanxi province yang et al 2018 in this study hydrological stations including shangjingyou station and fenhe reservoir station are located in the upper reaches of fenhe river which is an important water source and the largest functional area of drinking water in taiyuan city therefore developing a robust streamflow forecasting model with higher accuracy is essential for water resource allocation and sustainable economic growth in the fenhe river upstream the streamflow records are split into two groups which are the calibration period and validation period enhancing the learning process of the model and preventing information leaked from the calibration dataset the calibration period is further divided into the calibration period and test period according to a two stage calibration strategy fang et al 2019 as shown in table 1 4 2 model development to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model six methods are considered for comparison in predicting monthly streamflow namely lssvm elm gru gwo gru igwo gru and iceewt igwo gru model in this section detailed information about model development is provided every model uses the same dataset structure and period division with the rolling learning prediction procedure in the lssvm model the radial basis function is selected as the kernel function and the grid search method is employed to identify the best parameter combination for use by comparing mae with the calibration period the sigmoidal function is chosen as the transfer function in the elm model and through trial and error the best number of neurons is determined which are 15 for the shangjingyou station and 20 for the fenhe reservoir station because of slight fluctuations in elm model each result is the arithmetic average after the model is performed ten times to ensure stability for the gru model root mean square prop is adopted to gradient based optimization for each neural learning from the dataset and the lookback is 60 for model generator the parameter combination learning rate and the number of hidden neurons is determined by the trial and error method the single gru model has 11 hidden neurons and 0 039 learning rate for the fenhe reservoir station the parameter combination number of hidden neurons and learning rate for the shangjingyou station is 31 and 0 0016 respectively especially if the learning rate of deep learning model is small or large the model takes a long time to converge or have difficulty in reaching the convergence state in the end yu et al 2020 moreover the number of neurons in the hidden layer controls the effort of activation functions for the memory forget work in gates therefore the learning rate and the number of hidden neurons in the gru model deserve to be carefully tuned through several experiments the detailed steps of single lssvm elm and gru model are as follows 1 the lssvm elm and gru method respectively modeled every relationship between inputs and outputs which are formed by the original streamflow series 2 the datasets were divided into calibration test and validation dataset 3 obtain forecasting results for the model the double processing approach iceewt is composed of denoising method ewt and decomposition method iceemdan the ewt method follows empirical law to decompose the original series into several modes and the most uncorrelated mode is eliminated by computing cross correlation coefficient between each of imfs and the original series it can be seen from table 2 that the last two imfs for two stations has the lowest coefficient values among all the imfs then the filtered series is decomposed into several imfs by iceemdan for the iceemdan method the maximum number of iterations is set to 5000 and the amplitude of white noise is 0 2 times the standard deviation of the studies series the initial parameters of gwo and igwo are listed in table 3 4 3 denoising and decomposition results in this study the iceewt method is employed to filter hydrological noise and extract the intrinsic characteristics of hydrological series which is helpful for deep learning model to capture change rules and further predict future trends for two hydrological stations the processed streamflow series by the ewt method and the decomposed results by iceemdan method are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the original streamflow looks noisy while the filtered series appear cleaner and lose the coarse features compared to the original the frequencies of the generated subcomponents decomposed by iceemdan are different varying from high to low with the number of imfs which implies regularity and variability in terms of reducing noise and exacting the inner formulation related to change rules of streamflow series 4 4 simulation results and discussion to evaluate the performances of different methods in mid to long term runoff prediction the statistical indicators in the validation period are shown in table 4 it can be obtained that the elm has poor performance and the gru performs to the best compared with the other models for the two stations the lssvm model exhibits good performance average reducing the rmse and mae values by 12 3 32 54 and increasing the nse 110 compared with elm the gru model is superior to the elm model shows average improvements over the elm model of an 18 13 decrease in rmse a 34 2 decrease in mae and a 210 increase in nse for this reason gru is chosen for benchmarking in the following as shown in table 4 the performance of the iceewt igwo gru model was better than igwo gru with the rmse and mae average decreased by 23 12 for two hydrological stations the proposed model is also superior to the standard gru model with an increase of nse value 43 it is thus clear that the double processing strategy iceewt is employed to filter noise and decomposes the original series into several imfs which capture information that can be easily learned by deep learning model gru implying the good effect in response to non stationary runoff prediction moreover the iceewt igwo gru model yield the qr value of 97 22 in fenhe reservoir station and 86 11 in shangjingyou station which belongs to the very good and good grade respectively ministry of water resources and p r c 2008 overall the developed model can provide better forecasting results than other models in this study considering all performance indicators additionally the line charts in fig 7 display the forecasting results of four models gru gwo gru igwo gru and iceewt igwo gru and fig 8 presents scatter plots between the measured and predicted streamflow values obtained by different models it can be seen from fig 7 in two hydrological stations the igwo gru model and the iceewt igwo gru model provide decent performance compared to the single gru model and traditional gwo gru model in terms of tracking the dynamic changes of monthly streamflow from fig 8 for two stations the plots of the iceewt igwo gru model distributes more tightly to the fitting line than other models while the single gru model shows scattered distribution of value plots on the basis of the largest r 2 value among four models 0 873 in fenhe reservoir station and 0 701 in shangjingyou station accurate forecasting is provided by the proposed model these analysises demonstrate that iceewt is an effective alternative technique in improving the forecasting accuracy of monthly streamflow series to verify the advancement of the improved gwo method fig 9 presents the loss of igwo gru in the calibration and validation period the loss is the mae of calibration and test dataset after using normalization method as mentioned above the optimization of gwo gru relies on the objective function which is essential for meta heuristics optimization to establish a tuning optimizer and in many articles the objective function is the minimum of the calibration loss or test loss liu et al 2018b lu et al 2020 however the minimum loss in the validation period is hard to correspond to the best state of the forecasting model it can be seen from fig 9 that the mae of prediction results in the calibration period decreases with every epoch whereas the test loss starts to degrade then keep remain and in the final increase to a much higher value than the calibrations loss between two curves there is an intersection corresponding a specific point k where figure separate into two regions a and b in region a before epoch k the mae of prediction results in calibration period is always bigger than that in test period which means the model performs better in the calibration period it can be obtained that the model in the state of a is still learning from calibration data and said to be underfit while in region b after epoch k the calibration loss is lower than test loss suggesting the model begins to learn misleading or irrelevant information which is in the overfitting state therefore minimizing the test loss is likely to correspond to the underfitting period as region a which means the inadequate learning of the model in contrast the intersection of mae in calibration and test period as region c corresponds to the boundary between underfitting and overfitting in modelling process moreover tables 5 and 6 show the performance of the gru model in validation period with different epochs varying from 5 to 300 for two hydrological stations it can be clearly seen from tables 5 and 6 that the prediction accuracy indicators follow great changes with different epochs generated by the gru model in tables 5 and 6 170 epochs at fenhe reservoir station and 120 epochs at shangjingyou station represent the border state c between underfit state a and overfit state b respectively overall the performance of the model in states c is seen too far exceed the performance of a and b in two hydrological stations for example the model in state c average reducing the values of rmse and mae by approximately 43 and 37 for two stations compared to state a epochs 5 76 and 60 compared to state b epochs 300 these results also accede with the improvement of nse which is average up to 23 and 17 in terms of state a and state b respectively this finding can be attributed to the fact that the overfitting and underfitting state result in a lower accuracy than the compromised state between them in streamflow prediction thus to prevent the models from overfitting and underfitting the objective function for improved gwo gru is to minimize the mean value of calibration loss and test loss when the difference of two losses is found within 0 005 as shown in eq 12 however only the method utilized in model practically can validate the effectiveness of the improved approach and the prediction accuracy of igwo gru and traditional gwo gru in the original runoff data testing period was compared in table 4 compared to the original model the improved model provides decent performance with the increasing nse by 11 which reaffirms that the proposed method can be effectively used to tune the parameter and improve the robustness of models as in previous studies the simulation results revealed that the differences exist among lssvm elm and gru models indicating the importance of selecting methods in forecasting models when it comes to the outlier robustness and the computational robustness problems the traditional elm model takes a long time or provides unreliable prediction results of streamflow series horata et al 2013 the sparseness is lost in the lssvm model and the use of sum squared error cost function can lead to less robust suykens et al 2002 the deep learning model gru has an improvement in the monthly hydrological prediction compared to the shallow neural network and overcomes the weakness of lssvm and elm model with a relatively acceptable level of accuracy additionally the forecasting models largely depend on several optimal parameters which deserve to be carefully tuned since that considering the wide application of parameter optimization technique the single gru model is calibrated using the gwo algorithm notably this paper enhances the traditional gwo with a more efficient objective function to balance generalization and optimization namely igwo as a result the performance of igwo gru developed in this study is superior to that of the single gru method however with the effect of many factors such as climate variation and human activities monthly streamflow presents strong non linear and non stationary containing complex information that is not easily captured hence the single model is limited and hard to describe hydrological behaviors contained in the series and there is progress to be made in this study the iceewt double processing method is employed to remove the low remove the modes with a low correlation coefficient and extract the intrinsic characteristics of hydrological series which are the imfs the ewt denoising method and the iceemdan decomposing method can facilitate effective identification of frequency changes in the original sequence which is very important for the mining of hidden information thus the preprocessing models display better performance than the single model which is consistent with the results of other studies wen et al 2019 the proposed model outperformed all of the other compared models and the possible reasons for this superiority are summarized below 1 the iceewt method processes streamflow series exacting hydrological characteristics for predictive method learning from dataset and further improves the ability of the forecasting model 2 the igwo method is implemented to tune the optimal parameter combination and help the model maintain consistent in sample and out of sample performance 3 the last is the gru model which has sufficient learning capability and fully reflects the information intrinsic in streamflow series providing quicker convergence and satisfying results zhang et al 2018 overall the incorporation of double processing strategy meta heuristic optimizer algorithms intelligence and deep learning technique into the streamflow forecasting model can produce a comparable performance in terms of monthly streamflow prediction 5 conclusions in this paper we proposed a double processing igwo gru model which can achieve mid to long term runoff prediction at shangjingyou station and fenhe reservoir station first the iceewt preprocessing method is used to decompose the original streamflow series into several subseries second the deep learning model gru couples with a novel parameter optimization technique igwo is adopted to model the complex input output relationships hidden in each subcomponent finally in the modified optimization algorithm the enhanced objective function is proposed to balance optimization and generalization of the forecasting model based on the analysis in section4 the results indicate that the proposed model can play positive roles in improving the accuracy of monthly streamflow prediction concerning three performance indicators which enriches hydrological forecasting theories therefore the double processing based deep learning method and novel parameter optimizer strategy can produce convincing models in streamflow forecasting such as the new decomposition method dynamic mode decomposition li et al 2017 in addition the deep learning model is a potential direction in improving hydrological forecasting accuracy for future research credit authorship contribution statement xuehua zhao project administration resources supervision funding acquisition hanfang lv data

4279,accurate and reliable mid to long term streamflow prediction is essential for water resources management however streamflow series exhibits strong non stationary and non linear thus the traditional single model may fail to capture the characteristic of hydrological series and hard to maintain the robustness of the model to overcome this problem the application of empirical wavelet transform combined with improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise iceewt is firstly to eliminate the redundant noise and decompose original series into several

accurate and robust streamflow forecasting is of great importance for many water resource systems ahmed and sarma 2007 reservoir operation optimization niu et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 anghileri et al 2016 environmental protection he et al 2018 feng et al 2020a water resource management wang et al 2011 and flood control liu et al 2018a thus streamflow prediction has attracted increasing attention from many articles reporting the research of various methods applied in literature elshorbagy et al 2010 however it is a difficult task because streamflow series exhibits strong non stationary non linear and highly complex owing to numerous external factors such as precipitation underlying surfaces and evaporation therefore accurate and robust streamflow forecasting is expected to ensure the reliable operation of practical engineering systems up to now the existing models of streamflow forecasting can be roughly divided into two main categories process driven models and data driven models yaseen et al 2016b based on the physical process the predictive accuracy of process driven models rests on a lot of hydrological data and sometimes the insufficient data make it challenging to complete modelling unlike process driven models data driven models require fewer data and have simpler model structures suitable for such areas lacking hydrological data fan et al 2016 in general the data driven models can be further grouped into three categories statistical based models machine learning models and hybrid models the structure of statistical models are simple xue et al 2020 and many articles report the application of them in hydrological prediction such as autoregressive integrated moving average arima phan and nguyen 2020 autoregressive ar zhao and chen 2015 and et al whereas statistical models based on the hypothesis that the time series follows a linear correlation structure which condition streamflow series generally find hard to satisfy streamflow forecasting needs a stronger approach dealing with non linear and complex simulation many scholars recently developed forecasting models based on machine learning ml techniques with their strong ability to learn non linear relationships liao et al 2020 toth and brath 2007 see et al 2007 hu et al 2018 which are in their nascent stages for example extreme learning machine elm and least squares support vector machine lssvm have shown the potential of hydrological prediction yaseen et al 2016a adnan et al 2020 zhao et al 2017b elm requires fewer iterations to adjust hidden neuron parameters in comparison with other single artificial neural networks yaseen et al 2019 lssvm reduces the computational time of support vector machine svm adnan et al 2020 which is popular for the globally optimal solution in regression problems feng et al 2020b however these traditional machine learning algorithms as mentioned above belong to the theory of shallow learning xue et al 2020 increasingly many studies make use of deep learning techniques in which the intrinsic nature of the time series can be learned automatically using a general purpose learning procedure lecun et al 2015 in the field of deep learning recurrent neural networks rnn is one of the most popular neural networks hu and wang 2015 being a special rnn and simplifying the structure of long short term memory gated recurrent unit gru takes a long memory for significant information from previous data which can effectively model complex long time series zhang et al 2018 gru has been successfully applied in many fields for prediction issues such as dissolved oxygen electric loads pore water pressure and remaining useful life prediction li et al 2021 das et al 2020 wei et al 2021 chen et al 2019 but the investigation of how the deep learning model gru mine hidden information in long time series is insufficient especially in streamflow forecasting to the best of the authors knowledge the application of gru method is yet to be explored in forecasting of monthly streamflow thus gru is adopted as a basic forecasting module in our proposed model and many data driven models not only are based on historical values to predict the future but also multivariate model in the context of climate variabilities such as el nino southern oscillation phenomenon and the pacifific decadal oscillation westra and sharma 2009 erkyihun et al 2016 but becasue of the difficulties in data acquisition the history values based model still attracts a lot of scholars attention and in this paper the relationship between historical and future streamflow is learned by the gru model to further enhance the forecast accuracy hybrid models are becoming a promising alternative because of its outperformance over the single models ni et al 2020 there are two methods to build hybrid models integrating with optimization algorithms and applying decomposition techniques sun et al 2018 on the one hand the parameter tuning technique is used to identify the optimal parameter combination and calibrate models to enhance their robustness because of its superior exploitation ability many algorithms including genetic algorithm ga sedki et al 2009 hong et al 2016 grey wolf optimizer gwo tikhamarine et al 2020 and particle swarm optimization pso ch et al 2013 are applied to improve single model forecasting abilities in hydrology therein gwo belongs to the meta heuristic optimization which avoids several local solutions and balances exploration and exploitation efficiency tikhamarine et al 2020 what is more the gwo method is the gradient free optimizer adaptable to more situations such as short term pm2 5 concentration forecasting landslide susceptibility model and bankruptcy prediction jaafari et al 2019 niu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the gradient free optimizers are creative and not limited by the gradient mathematical chain which is different from the gradient based algorithm such as rmsprop and adam du et al 2018 particularly the objective function of gwo controls the algorithm which way to minimize and in most of articles it is the error in the test period which does not consider the model performance in the calibration period as a result with an inappropriate structure of employed gwo the model is likely to get into under fitting or over fitting conditions and provide unreliable prediction results to the best of the author s knowledge this kind of exiting problem has not solved therefore the improved gwo igwo method is exploited in this study to improve the robustness of the hybrid model considering the objective function of optimization algorithm on the other hand the main purpose of decomposition techniques is to simplify the forecasting process di et al 2014 and analyze non stationary and non linear features in datasets before being transformed in the model wen et al 2019 many data preprocessing methods can be applied to predictive models and improve the performance of time series forecasting including singular spectrum analysis ssa mi and zhao 2020 wu et al 2009 empirical mode decomposition emd zhao et al 2017a and improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise iceemdan ali and prasad 2019 recently the model adopted by the double processing strategy which combined with denoising approach ssa and decomposition methods iceemdan obtains satisfactory prediction performance wang et al 2019 furthermore treated ewt as a denoising approach to filter noise contained in the original series the performance of the model proves the data preprocessor is an excellent choice for time series prediction wang and hu 2015 hu and wang 2015 since the double processing strategy and novel data processing tools exhibit a strong ability of pursuing more accurate and stable forecasts this study chooses ewt iceemdan iceewt as the data preprocessing method of the streamflow forecasting model in general the main contribution of our work can be summarized as follows 1 the double processing strategy iceewt is employed to filter noise and decompose the original streamflow series into several subseries as inputs of the further predictive method 2 the deep learning model gru is utilized for learning the instinct relationship between the inputs and outputs 3 to balance generation and optimization capability of the model the igwo method is proposed to tune the gru model with suitable parameter combinations 4 the prediction of the proposed model compared with state of the art models has been quantitatively analyzed and the experimental results demonstrate that iceewt igwo gru can provide accurate prediction results the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows section 2 describes the methods of the proposed hydrological model section 3 presents the performance indicators for evaluating the goodness of fit section 4 introduces the improvement of the models and presents experiments section 5 is the last section which outlines the conclusions of this paper 2 methods 2 1 gru proposed by cho et al 2014 the gru method is a modern rnn which replaced the ordinary neuron in rnn with a memory neuron and solved the vanishing or exploding gradient problem owing to bptt back propagation through time method fig 1 shows the structure of the neuron in hidden layer of gru the neuron has two gates update gate and reset gate modulating the flow of information when the neural state updated at each step the update gate decides how much information from the previous step flow to the neuron and the reset gate controls whether to ignore the previous state and upset the current this allows the neuron to drop the irrelevant information which is found to be unuseful for mapping input and output in the future and further helps the neuron remember long term information by reducing burdens at the present step t the output of previous state ht 1 combined with the input of current state xt is the input of update gate zt and reset gate rt 1 z t σ w z h t 1 x t 2 r t σ w r h t 1 x t where σ presents sigmoid function wz and wr are weights of update gate and reset gate respectively then the new hidden state is calculated by the following 3 h t φ w r t h t 1 x t where φ presents tanh function w is the weight learned from the reset gate at last the output of the present neuron is formulated as 4 h t z t h t 1 z t h t 1 2 2 gwo inspired by hunting behaviors of grey wolves mirjalili et al 2014 proposed the gwo algorithm one of the newest meta heuristic optimizer algorithms generally wolves are divided into four groups the fittest solution the second best solutions the third best solutions and the rest of the candidate solutions which are named alpha α beta β delta σ and omega ω respectively the hunting behaviors including encircling and attacking prey are mathematically modeled as shown below and the hunting is repeated until the fittest solution is obtained x t 1 x p t a d d c x p t x t

x 2 x β a 2 d β 6 x 3 x δ a 3 d δ where x a x β x δ is the update positions 2 3 igwo as in previous studies the parameter combination of the gru model needs a great number of experiments to be determined in the single model hence to increase the efficiency of the optimization gwo and improved gwo are employed with gru to optimize them particularly the objective function of igwo method which is shown in eq 8 presents the core improvement over traditional gwo method 7 f i t t n e s s f u n c t i o n min i 1 q calilos s i t e s t l o s s i 2 8 f i t t n e s s f u n c t i o n min i 1 q c a l

colominas et al 2014 proposed the iceemdan method alleviating the mode mixing phenomenon and decomposing components with less noise and more physical meaning the iceemdan method the algorithm of iceemdan can be summarized as follows and the illustration of iceemdan is shown in fig 2 step 1 the original streamflow plus white noise is used to compute the first residue by emd 9 r 1 1 i i 1 i m x 1 i step 2 calculate the first intrinsic mode function imf 1 10 imf 1 x r 1 step 3 as in step1 but for r 1 added white noise and estimated the second imf imf 2 with the second residue 11 imf 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 1 i i 1 i m x 2 i step4 the equation for the kth imf imfk is 12 imf m r m 1 r m r m 1 1 i i 1 i m x m i step5 go to step4 until the mth residue can not be decomposed where m x m i i 1 i presents the local mean of the decomposing series added white noise also rm 1 is defined as the mean of the upper and lower envelopes i is the number of white noise and x is the original series 2 5 ewt the ewt method presents for signal decomposition introduced by gilles 2013 and recently the ewt based series denoising is used for removing the noise of original series the original series is decomposed into several modes the most relevant modes are selected and the uncorrelated modes are removed by calculating the correlation coefficient between each of the empirical modes and the original series 2 6 proposed model the proposed hybrid model iceewt igwo gru is composed of three main stages illustrated in fig 3 the first is denoising and decomposition stage where the double processing method iceewt is firstly used to remove noise and decompose the original streamflow series into several intrinsic mode functions imfs secondly the improved gwo selected the parameter combination for the model which is the calibration stage the third stage is the prediction stage where gru is utilized to forecast each of the imfs processed by iceewt finally the prediction of each subseries is summarized to generate the final streamflow forecast the detailed steps of iceewt igwo gru model are as follows 1 the ewt method was implemented to reduce noise from the original streamflow series 2 the iceemdan method decomposed the original series to several imfs 3 the gru method modeled every relationship between inputs and outputs which are formed by every imf 4 the datasets were divided into calibration test and validation dataset 5 igwo was utilized to find the optimal combination of parameters for predictive models 6 obtain forecasting results for the model 3 evaluation indicators in this study three evaluation indicators are discussed for assessing prediction performance in streamflow forecasting the equation for nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse qualification rate qr and mean absolute error mae are shown as follows nse 1 i 1 n σ i σ i 0 2 i 1 n σ i 0 σ 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n σ i σ i 0 2 qr k l 100 13 mae 1 n i 1 n σ i σ i 0 where σi and σi 0 denote every value of the original streamflow series and the predicted series respectively σ represents the mean of the original streamflow series n is the number of streamflow series k denotes the number of the eligible prediction which defined that the relative error of forecast is less than 20 of maximum amplitude of streamflow series l is the length of streamflow series at the validation period nse 1 rmse 0 qr 100 and mae 0 are desirable for a perfect model in streamflow forecasting in practical application nse 0 5 and qr 60 are considered to the satisfactory performance of the model ministry of water resources and p r c 2008 4 case studies 4 1 study area and dataset fenhe river the native river of shanxi province is the second largest tributary of the yellow river as shown in fig 4 the fenhe river flows 716 km and has a total of about 38 728 km2 the area of this basin is the main industrial urban residential and agricultural area of shanxi province yang et al 2018 in this study hydrological stations including shangjingyou station and fenhe reservoir station are located in the upper reaches of fenhe river which is an important water source and the largest functional area of drinking water in taiyuan city therefore developing a robust streamflow forecasting model with higher accuracy is essential for water resource allocation and sustainable economic growth in the fenhe river upstream the streamflow records are split into two groups which are the calibration period and validation period enhancing the learning process of the model and preventing information leaked from the calibration dataset the calibration period is further divided into the calibration period and test period according to a two stage calibration strategy fang et al 2019 as shown in table 1 4 2 model development to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model six methods are considered for comparison in predicting monthly streamflow namely lssvm elm gru gwo gru igwo gru and iceewt igwo gru model in this section detailed information about model development is provided every model uses the same dataset structure and period division with the rolling learning prediction procedure in the lssvm model the radial basis function is selected as the kernel function and the grid search method is employed to identify the best parameter combination for use by comparing mae with the calibration period the sigmoidal function is chosen as the transfer function in the elm model and through trial and error the best number of neurons is determined which are 15 for the shangjingyou station and 20 for the fenhe reservoir station because of slight fluctuations in elm model each result is the arithmetic average after the model is performed ten times to ensure stability for the gru model root mean square prop is adopted to gradient based optimization for each neural learning from the dataset and the lookback is 60 for model generator the parameter combination learning rate and the number of hidden neurons is determined by the trial and error method the single gru model has 11 hidden neurons and 0 039 learning rate for the fenhe reservoir station the parameter combination number of hidden neurons and learning rate for the shangjingyou station is 31 and 0 0016 respectively especially if the learning rate of deep learning model is small or large the model takes a long time to converge or have difficulty in reaching the convergence state in the end yu et al 2020 moreover the number of neurons in the hidden layer controls the effort of activation functions for the memory forget work in gates therefore the learning rate and the number of hidden neurons in the gru model deserve to be carefully tuned through several experiments the detailed steps of single lssvm elm and gru model are as follows 1 the lssvm elm and gru method respectively modeled every relationship between inputs and outputs which are formed by the original streamflow series 2 the datasets were divided into calibration test and validation dataset 3 obtain forecasting results for the model the double processing approach iceewt is composed of denoising method ewt and decomposition method iceemdan the ewt method follows empirical law to decompose the original series into several modes and the most uncorrelated mode is eliminated by computing cross correlation coefficient between each of imfs and the original series it can be seen from table 2 that the last two imfs for two stations has the lowest coefficient values among all the imfs then the filtered series is decomposed into several imfs by iceemdan for the iceemdan method the maximum number of iterations is set to 5000 and the amplitude of white noise is 0 2 times the standard deviation of the studies series the initial parameters of gwo and igwo are listed in table 3 4 3 denoising and decomposition results in this study the iceewt method is employed to filter hydrological noise and extract the intrinsic characteristics of hydrological series which is helpful for deep learning model to capture change rules and further predict future trends for two hydrological stations the processed streamflow series by the ewt method and the decomposed results by iceemdan method are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the original streamflow looks noisy while the filtered series appear cleaner and lose the coarse features compared to the original the frequencies of the generated subcomponents decomposed by iceemdan are different varying from high to low with the number of imfs which implies regularity and variability in terms of reducing noise and exacting the inner formulation related to change rules of streamflow series 4 4 simulation results and discussion to evaluate the performances of different methods in mid to long term runoff prediction the statistical indicators in the validation period are shown in table 4 it can be obtained that the elm has poor performance and the gru performs to the best compared with the other models for the two stations the lssvm model exhibits good performance average reducing the rmse and mae values by 12 3 32 54 and increasing the nse 110 compared with elm the gru model is superior to the elm model shows average improvements over the elm model of an 18 13 decrease in rmse a 34 2 decrease in mae and a 210 increase in nse for this reason gru is chosen for benchmarking in the following as shown in table 4 the performance of the iceewt igwo gru model was better than igwo gru with the rmse and mae average decreased by 23 12 for two hydrological stations the proposed model is also superior to the standard gru model with an increase of nse value 43 it is thus clear that the double processing strategy iceewt is employed to filter noise and decomposes the original series into several imfs which capture information that can be easily learned by deep learning model gru implying the good effect in response to non stationary runoff prediction moreover the iceewt igwo gru model yield the qr value of 97 22 in fenhe reservoir station and 86 11 in shangjingyou station which belongs to the very good and good grade respectively ministry of water resources and p r c 2008 overall the developed model can provide better forecasting results than other models in this study considering all performance indicators additionally the line charts in fig 7 display the forecasting results of four models gru gwo gru igwo gru and iceewt igwo gru and fig 8 presents scatter plots between the measured and predicted streamflow values obtained by different models it can be seen from fig 7 in two hydrological stations the igwo gru model and the iceewt igwo gru model provide decent performance compared to the single gru model and traditional gwo gru model in terms of tracking the dynamic changes of monthly streamflow from fig 8 for two stations the plots of the iceewt igwo gru model distributes more tightly to the fitting line than other models while the single gru model shows scattered distribution of value plots on the basis of the largest r 2 value among four models 0 873 in fenhe reservoir station and 0 701 in shangjingyou station accurate forecasting is provided by the proposed model these analysises demonstrate that iceewt is an effective alternative technique in improving the forecasting accuracy of monthly streamflow series to verify the advancement of the improved gwo method fig 9 presents the loss of igwo gru in the calibration and validation period the loss is the mae of calibration and test dataset after using normalization method as mentioned above the optimization of gwo gru relies on the objective function which is essential for meta heuristics optimization to establish a tuning optimizer and in many articles the objective function is the minimum of the calibration loss or test loss liu et al 2018b lu et al 2020 however the minimum loss in the validation period is hard to correspond to the best state of the forecasting model it can be seen from fig 9 that the mae of prediction results in the calibration period decreases with every epoch whereas the test loss starts to degrade then keep remain and in the final increase to a much higher value than the calibrations loss between two curves there is an intersection corresponding a specific point k where figure separate into two regions a and b in region a before epoch k the mae of prediction results in calibration period is always bigger than that in test period which means the model performs better in the calibration period it can be obtained that the model in the state of a is still learning from calibration data and said to be underfit while in region b after epoch k the calibration loss is lower than test loss suggesting the model begins to learn misleading or irrelevant information which is in the overfitting state therefore minimizing the test loss is likely to correspond to the underfitting period as region a which means the inadequate learning of the model in contrast the intersection of mae in calibration and test period as region c corresponds to the boundary between underfitting and overfitting in modelling process moreover tables 5 and 6 show the performance of the gru model in validation period with different epochs varying from 5 to 300 for two hydrological stations it can be clearly seen from tables 5 and 6 that the prediction accuracy indicators follow great changes with different epochs generated by the gru model in tables 5 and 6 170 epochs at fenhe reservoir station and 120 epochs at shangjingyou station represent the border state c between underfit state a and overfit state b respectively overall the performance of the model in states c is seen too far exceed the performance of a and b in two hydrological stations for example the model in state c average reducing the values of rmse and mae by approximately 43 and 37 for two stations compared to state a epochs 5 76 and 60 compared to state b epochs 300 these results also accede with the improvement of nse which is average up to 23 and 17 in terms of state a and state b respectively this finding can be attributed to the fact that the overfitting and underfitting state result in a lower accuracy than the compromised state between them in streamflow prediction thus to prevent the models from overfitting and underfitting the objective function for improved gwo gru is to minimize the mean value of calibration loss and test loss when the difference of two losses is found within 0 005 as shown in eq 12 however only the method utilized in model practically can validate the effectiveness of the improved approach and the prediction accuracy of igwo gru and traditional gwo gru in the original runoff data testing period was compared in table 4 compared to the original model the improved model provides decent performance with the increasing nse by 11 which reaffirms that the proposed method can be effectively used to tune the parameter and improve the robustness of models as in previous studies the simulation results revealed that the differences exist among lssvm elm and gru models indicating the importance of selecting methods in forecasting models when it comes to the outlier robustness and the computational robustness problems the traditional elm model takes a long time or provides unreliable prediction results of streamflow series horata et al 2013 the sparseness is lost in the lssvm model and the use of sum squared error cost function can lead to less robust suykens et al 2002 the deep learning model gru has an improvement in the monthly hydrological prediction compared to the shallow neural network and overcomes the weakness of lssvm and elm model with a relatively acceptable level of accuracy additionally the forecasting models largely depend on several optimal parameters which deserve to be carefully tuned since that considering the wide application of parameter optimization technique the single gru model is calibrated using the gwo algorithm notably this paper enhances the traditional gwo with a more efficient objective function to balance generalization and optimization namely igwo as a result the performance of igwo gru developed in this study is superior to that of the single gru method however with the effect of many factors such as climate variation and human activities monthly streamflow presents strong non linear and non stationary containing complex information that is not easily captured hence the single model is limited and hard to describe hydrological behaviors contained in the series and there is progress to be made in this study the iceewt double processing method is employed to remove the low remove the modes with a low correlation coefficient and extract the intrinsic characteristics of hydrological series which are the imfs the ewt denoising method and the iceemdan decomposing method can facilitate effective identification of frequency changes in the original sequence which is very important for the mining of hidden information thus the preprocessing models display better performance than the single model which is consistent with the results of other studies wen et al 2019 the proposed model outperformed all of the other compared models and the possible reasons for this superiority are summarized below 1 the iceewt method processes streamflow series exacting hydrological characteristics for predictive method learning from dataset and further improves the ability of the forecasting model 2 the igwo method is implemented to tune the optimal parameter combination and help the model maintain consistent in sample and out of sample performance 3 the last is the gru model which has sufficient learning capability and fully reflects the information intrinsic in streamflow series providing quicker convergence and satisfying results zhang et al 2018 overall the incorporation of double processing strategy meta heuristic optimizer algorithms intelligence and deep learning technique into the streamflow forecasting model can produce a comparable performance in terms of monthly streamflow prediction 5 conclusions in this paper we proposed a double processing igwo gru model which can achieve mid to long term runoff prediction at shangjingyou station and fenhe reservoir station first the iceewt preprocessing method is used to decompose the original streamflow series into several subseries second the deep learning model gru couples with a novel parameter optimization technique igwo is adopted to model the complex input output relationships hidden in each subcomponent finally in the modified optimization algorithm the enhanced objective function is proposed to balance optimization and generalization of the forecasting model based on the analysis in section4 the results indicate that the proposed model can play positive roles in improving the accuracy of monthly streamflow prediction concerning three performance indicators which enriches hydrological forecasting theories therefore the double processing based deep learning method and novel parameter optimizer strategy can produce convincing models in streamflow forecasting such as the new decomposition method dynamic mode decomposition li et al 2017 in addition the deep learning model is a potential direction in improving hydrological forecasting accuracy for future research credit authorship contribution statement xuehua zhao project administration resources supervision funding acquisition hanfang lv data
