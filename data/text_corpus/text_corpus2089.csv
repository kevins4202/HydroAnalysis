10445,desertification has long seriously threatened the ecological security of northern china for which china has established the world s largest shelterbelt project after 40 years of reconstruction of vegetation the trend of desertification in northern china has been reversed the shelterbelt forest project in northern china however at the same time tells signs of degradation and therefore its effectiveness has been questioned by scientists from various countries in order to study the impact of the vegetation reconstruction process in the semi arid area on the precipitation water redistribution process in this area and how the reconstructed vegetation survives in dry season this study selected the reconstruction pinus sylvestris var mongolica psm forest on mu us sandy land as the research object and used new lysimeters stem flow meters miniature weather stations etc to monitor the deep soil water penetration stem flux the purpose of this current study is to find out how psm forest changed the process of precipitation water redistribution in this area and how psm adjusts its own water storage capacity to adapt to the annual precipitation changes in wet years such as 2017 dsr is only 0 4 mm soil water storage is reduced by 16 mm and evapotranspiration is 324 6 mm in a wet year such as 2016 the dsr is 1 4 mm the soil water storage is enlarged by 38 06 mm and the evapotranspiration is 466 94 mm the results showed that the water consumption of psm in mu us area and the precipitation water replenishment in this area reached a balance but blocked precipitation to recharge deep soil water and groundwater the rain fed psm stem can be used as a reservoir unit to supply water consumption and adjusting the evapotranspiration intensity to adapt to changes in annual precipitation this research has advanced our understanding of the scale of reconstruction vegetation utilization of precipitation and the utilization mechanism of tree stem storage water in semi arid areas keywords pinus sylvestris var mongolica deep soil recharge stem water storage dry season drought tolerance 1 introduction according to the united nations convention to combat desertification desertification refers to land degradation in arid semi arid and sub humid region caused by various factors including climate variability and anthropogenic activities kassas 1995 china is one of the countries that are most seriously affected by desertification in the world wang et al 2013 according to the china desertification bulletin published by the forestry administration of china the total land area of desertification in china was 262 37 104 km2 by the end of 2018 accounting for 27 33 of china s total land area the mu us sandy land is located in the middle of the ecotone between agriculture and husbandry in northern china due to excessive reclamation and grazing in this area ecological degradation wu and ci 2002 it is also lied in the forest steppe desert ecological stress zone an important ecological barrier of china and this unique location makes the local ecosystem vulnerable and sensitive to ecological hydrological and climatic changes yan et al 2015 in order to slow down the movement of sands or even to fix sands in the arid and semi arid sandy land including mu us sandy land a massive artificial afforestation project called the three north shelterbelt forest project 3nsp has been carried over the past several decades after 40 years of continuous reconstruction studies have shown that china currently accounts for 25 of the global increase in leaf area and approximately 42 of china s green area comes from forest reconstruction with a greater portion of contribution from 3nsp chen et al 2019 water resource is an extremely important ecological limiting factor for vegetation reconstruction bochet and garcía fayos 2004 feng et al 2016 water resource in semi arid areas mainly exists in the form of soil moisture bromley et al 1997 soil moisture is a vital bridge between atmospheric precipitation surface water and groundwater because most groundwater recharge comes from direct recharge of soil moisture which itself is recharged by atmospheric precipitation and or surface bodies therefore soil moisture plays an important role in the water resources formation transformation and consumption precipitation related infiltration below ground surface is the main source of replenishment of soil moisture in semi arid areas while deep soil recharge dsr is a key link in the conversion of atmospheric precipitation into groundwater recharge which is vital for preventing the groundwater resources from depletion hatch et al 2006 yang et al 2018 therefore study on the characteristics of soil water dynamics and deep soil infiltration in semi arid areas is of great importance for better understanding of the eco hydrological processes in semi arid areas the impact of vegetation on soil moisture is also reflected in precipitation interception and alternation of evapotranspiration domingo et al 1998 especially in semi arid areas the intensity of precipitation is generally small so it is more likely that the directly intercepted water is consumed by evapotranspiration before it has a chance to infiltrate into soils li et al 2005 meanwhile the vegetation root system absorbs soil moisture for the purpose of transpiration thus consumes a great deal of soil moisture under the canopy moreira et al 2000 in this regard the vegetation functions as a sink rather than a source for soil moisture and groundwater storage on the other hand vegetation coverage can reduce the surface evapotranspiration and the vegetation root system can hold and conserve some soil moisture doerr et al 2000 furthermore vegetation with a proper density can improve the soil permeability and enhance the infiltration capacity of soil in this regard the vegetation functions as a source rather than a sink for soil water and groundwater storage the net impact of vegetation on soil moisture replies on a delicate balance of above mentioned two competitive mechanisms sink or source if the sink mechanism dominates then the vegetation leads to depletion of soil moisture while the source mechanism dominates the vegetation leads to replenishment of soil moisture such a delicate balance is dynamic in nature and may change in a daily or seasonal basis statistics of water resources distribution in semi arid areas provide a scientific basis for vegetation reconstruction and it can guide the evaluation of the stability of sand fixing vegetation and availability of usable water resources in semi arid sandy areas a large area of afforestation in the mu us sandy land has fixed the mobile sand and slowed down the development of desertification however the precipitation amount in mu us sandy land is relatively small thus there is a grave concern that large scale vegetation reconstruction may aggravate the drought some studies have shown that low density forest land is conducive to precipitation related infiltration thus can increase the soil water storage on the other hand high density forest will cause soil moisture shortage thus is not preferred in semi arid areas bargués tobella et al 2014 at the same time the drought tolerant vegetation in semi arid areas can adjust its own water use physiology to adapt to environmental changes downing et al 1997 when external conditions have been determined including planting density and precipitation conditions how does a tree adjust its water use mode when facing arid environment this is an overarching question leading to this research understanding the adaptation of trees to drought stress is relevant to the subject of this investigation body water storage confers a very important capacity for plants to survive extreme drought in xylem tension that allows the tree to minimize hydraulic dysfunction associated with excessive embolism when precipitation and soil water supply are limiting chone et al 2001 sperry et al 2002 water storage in stems of tree contributes to their response to short term water deficit mueller et al 2005 and therefore it is an important adaptation for plants to survive during drought seasons scholz et al 2007 meanwhile stem water storage can serve as a transient water source for tree daily transpiration even in areas without water shortage hsiao 1973 utilization of released water from stored compartments near the canopy for some tall trees may play an important role in mitigating the water stress of canopy leaves buffering the increasing xylem tension induced by transpiration and maintaining the stomata opening for photosynthesis blum 2011 hsiao and acevedo 1975 how important these internal water resources are depends on tree size wood anatomy sapwood dimension rhizome size steppe et al 2015 and also on living environmental conditions goldstein et al 1998 for instance the quantity of stem stored water used daily accounts for about as great as 20 of daily total sap flow in large douglas fir trees phillips et al 2002 which account for 10 22 in four diffuse porous species in central europe köcher et al 2013 specifically the water stored in the stem of a tree can provide plant transpiration for a week time but the water stored in the canopy can only keep the tree transpiration for a few hours čermák et al 2007 the stem water stores are mostly exhausted when the soil matrix potential drops below 0 1 mpa and daily mean vapor pressure deficit vpd exceeds 3 hpa 5 hpa köcher et al 2013 however despite these evidences some researchers have concluded that most of the plant s transpiration water consumption comes from root water absorption rather than its own water storage meinzer et al 2003 or was only relevant in some plants with low transpiration rate use stem water storage hinckley et al 1978 wilkinson and davies 2002 if the tree stems have little water storage the transpiration will quickly cause the vegetation to lose water which will promote the leaf stomatal closure therefore stem stored water seems to play a biologically significant role especially when trees are under drought stress unfortunately a lack of direct field evidence makes it impossible to test the assumptions on the importance of stem stored water on the transpiration mechanism of trees particularly in semi arid regions this motives us to conduct this long term field experiment to find out whether trees use the stem water storage or not in drought seasons in semi arid regions a commonly used species in 3nsp is pinus sylvestris var mongolica psm whose growth and survival is closely affected by soil moisture condition zhu et al 2006 if the soil water content is insufficient the growth of psm will be severely limited some studies suggest that drought stress may cause early decline of psm plantation in sandy land song et al 2014 for the mu us sandy land the growth of psm depends on the precipitation amount song et al 2015 however there are still a number of important questions that have not been answered satisfactorily for example how does psm deal with dry and wet alternate years has psm considerably changed the replenishment of deep soil moisture during the vegetation reconstruction process during drought seasons how does psm adjust its own water use to adapt to the reduction in precipitation to answer these questions we need a reliable method to quantify the relationship between the precipitation of psm forest and deep soil recharge dsr among others the purpose of this research is to report a long term field study to explore the effect of psm forest on the replenishment of dsr and water use mechanism of psm in semi arid regions in drought seasons we attempt to find out how the psm forest changes the regional water resources distribution and whether the water storage in stem can be used as a backup during the transpiration process or not we want to answer the question that after planting psm in mu us sandy land how is the precipitation distributed in the shallow soil layer and is there still precipitation to replenish dsr more specifically we will quantify the evapotranspiration soil water storage dsr and estimate the contribution of water storage to the daily water budget of psm another question we are trying to answer is how does psm cope with drought conditions on a single plant scale furthermore we will use time lags of sap flow between different positions of trunk as a proxy of stem water storage these field experiments advance our understanding of the ecohydrological systems of the psm forest and stem water storage mechanism in semi arid regions during drought seasons and more specifically it helps answer the question of how psm survives in the mu us sandy land 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the study area the experimental site is selected in mu us sandy land as shown in fig 1 with a geographic coordinate of 39 20 57 n 111 12 06 e the site is 1100 m above the mean sea level with an annual average temperature of 7 5 c an annual frozen free time period of 150 160 days the multi year average temperature is 6 0 c to 8 5 c and the multi year average precipitation is 400 mm 1954 2010 the precipitation varies annually from 250 mm to 550 mm 1954 2010 and 60 70 of the precipitation is concentrated from june to august the vegetation in this region is often subjected to drought stress the surface soil layer is thin and the organic matter content is low generally around 0 34 0 99 g kg 1 the psm in the study area is planted in strips artificially for the purpose of preventing wind and fixing sand the distance between two psm in the strip is 5 m and the distance between two neighboring rows is 10 m excavation on site shows that the root system of psm grows primarily horizontally and is distributed in the shallow soil less than 200 cm deep and the roots of psm are filled in the shallow soil between the rows 2 2 research methods 2 2 1 monitoring dsr the deep soil water recharge dsr can show the redistribution results of precipitation moisture in psm forest land this study used a newly designed deep soil layer moisture infiltration measuring instrument lysimeter to directly measure the dsr value cheng et al 2018 2017 as shown in fig 2 the roots of psm absorbing precipitation induced soil moisture are fine roots and the distribution range of fine roots is concentrated in 0 120 cm depth zhu et al 2008 the capillary water holding height of the mu us sandy land is about 60 80 cm therefore we have installed the newly designed lysimeter in the soil layer below the depth of 200 cm and measured dsr from precipitation related infiltration passing through the 200 cm depth the lysimeter was installed in the middle of the lined psm forest for the precipitation under the canopy is intercepted when installing the instrument one should reduce the disturbance to each layer of soil and reduce root damage use in situ soil backfill after backfilling watering the excavated plot to promote the plot restoration of the original state of each layer of soil cheng et al 2017 the experimental design is shown in fig 2 figure 2 and explained sequentially as follows the experimental plot is a relatively uniform psm forest the soil type is sandy soil and the row spacing is 10 m because monitoring precipitation is affected by the interception of the canopy the observation site is set in the open area between the two rows of psm forest firstly in order to minimize the disturbance of the original soil structure we need to water the experimental plot in advance before installing the instrument watering the soil in the experimental area makes the relatively dry sandy soil stable and easy to excavate as the native dry sandy soil is relatively loose secondly after watering the psm plot we start to excavate a soil profile vertically downward in the middle of the psm line reaching a depth of 3 2 m after this at the depth of 3 2 m we excavate horizontally toward the location of the main branch of psm to a distance about 0 3 m eventually a body with a height of 1 2 m a length and width both of 0 3 m is excavated to install the new lysimeter under the undisturbed root zone by doing so the distance from the ground surface to the top of lysimeter is 200 cm and the root system which is less than 200 cm deep will not be disturbed meanwhile as the plot has been watered to make the soil stable no collapse of soil has occurred during the installation of the new lysimeter thirdly after putting the new lysimeter in place we use in situ soil to backfill during this process one needs to continuously water each layer of backfill to ensure that the soil is relatively compact finally one needs to wait for the watered plot to stabilize to its pre excavation status in general the pre watered sandy plot and excavated sand layer will take a year to settle down then one can start the experiments as shown in fig 2 precipitation soil water content of each layer and dsr can be measured based on the soil water content of each layer the entire 200 cm depth soil water storage can be calculated in this study we set october as the time to calculate the final soil water storage the annual soil water storage subtraction is the difference of the soil water storage capacity in two consecutive years since the study area is flat sandy land no runoff is found then the evapotranspiration is calculated according to the water balance formula according to the monitored dsr data one can analyze the data to see whether the psm forest land is under drought stress or not if the dsr value is below the detection limit it means that the forest land after vegetation restoration is in a relatively dry state this implies that groundwater will not be recharged and the regional groundwater flow system may be profoundly affected with some unforeseen consequences 2 2 2 monitoring soil moisture the ec 5 soil moisture sensors decagon devices inc usa were installed at 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm 120 cm 160 cm and 200 cm soil layer depth as shown in fig 2 and a c200 s data collector was utilized to collect data at an interval of 1 h the data of the soil volumetric moisture content were corrected with an empirical equation the relative extractable water or the relative effective soil water index rew refers to the amount of soil water available to the plant and it is calculated as granier 1987 oren et al 1999 1 r e w θ θ m i n θ f θ m i n where θf is the volumetric field water holding capacity and its value is determined by field test to be 17 5 and θ min is the minimum volumetric moisture content which is 2 3 measured in extreme drought in 2017 θ is the average volumetric moisture content of the soil within 0 200 cm depth the soil moisture sensors showed the actual precipitation related infiltration in each soil layer in this study seven soil moisture sensors were installed according to the soil stratification to monitor the infiltration rate at different depths according to the soil water content the soil water retention in each layer can be calculated as well surface evapotranspiration can be calculated according to precipitation soil water retention and dsr 2 2 3 monitoring of meteorological elements a mini weather station consisting of 7 elements was set up on an open space 50 m away from the field site to monitor air temperature air humidity wind speed sensor wind direction sensor atmospheric pressure sensor solar radiation and precipitation avalon usa the data collector is sq2020 grant company uk all sensors are mounted 2 m above the ground the sampling interval is 10 min the vpd is calculated as follows campbell and norman 1998 2 v p d 0 611 e 17 502 t t 240 97 1 r h where t is the temperature c and rh is the relative humidity 2 2 4 monitoring sap flow rate of sapwood a 10 10 m experimental area was established in the mu us forest land of psm in the experimental site two healthy strong psm trees were selected as test samples to monitor the sap flow flux js the information of the sample tree is shown in table 1 the j s was measured using granier thermal diffusion sensor tdp dynmax australia the apparatus consists of two sensors to measure stem flow as shown in fig 1 each sample tree is installed with a set of tdp at stem top and stem breast and all the sensors are connected to a 16 channel data collector sq2020 grant uk the data collection interval is 10 min the 100 v polycrystalline solar panel is connected to the 12v 100ah lead acid storage battery for power supply the sap flow rate js cm h 1 is calculated using the granier 1987 3 j s 119 10 4 δ t 0 δ t δ t 1 231 60 where δt is the actual temperature difference c between the upper and lower sensors and δt 0 is the temperature difference between the upper and lower sensors when the liquid flow is zero maximum value c δt 0 uses two regression methods in a cycle of 10 days as suggested by granier 1987 the sapwood width is determined using a growth cone to drill through tree core and the sapwood is distinguished by colour change for calculation of the liquid flow within 3 cm of the sapwood the sap flow velocity at the inner part js inner is estimated using a species specific coefficient formula poyatos et al 2005 4 j s i n n e r 1 87156 exp 1 2 03698 x d 0 13153 where xd is the xylem depth under the cambium cm eq 4 was verified on psm using measurements through the heat field deformation hfd method nadezhdina et al 2012 r 2 0 95 p lower than 0 01 in 2016 one can image that the canopy transpiration first uses the water stored in the stem part and then supplements the transpiration water consumption through the root system so that there is a time difference it is assumed that the transpiration of vegetation around dawn comes from stem water storage köcher et al 2013 the stem flow near the canopy part occurs earlier than the stem part there is also a difference of start time in stem flow therefore since the stem can store water the stem flow measured at the stem part may represent the water amount absorbed from the soil not the actual canopy transpiration goldstein et al 1998 one way to estimate the amount of water stored in the stem is to compare the integrated values of stem flux in the stem breast part and canopy part on a 24 hour basis čermák et al 2007 köcher et al 2013 radiation r vpd and soil moisture are important and interrelated environmental controls on ecosystem water fluxes at different time scales which should be monitored during the experimental period 2 3 data processing and analysis to facilitate comparison each data point of sample tree is standardized by the maximum liquid flow rate measured during the whole observation period which is called the relative liquid flow rate j s max dimensionless the sap fluxes at stem breast and stem top were recorded as j s max stem breast and j s max stem top respectively comparison of relative flow rates at different heights was performed using the one way anova method in the statistical software originpro 2018 with multiple comparisons using tukey hsd post hoc at p 0 05 or 0 01 for significant threshold levels the time lag was implemented in the ncss 12 version using the cross correlation analysis llc kaysville utah usa the mapping waswas done in originpro 2018 originlan inc northampton ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 annual dsr changes and precipitation moisture redistribution as shown in table 2 the range of annual precipitation amount in this area varies widely and the average annual precipitation is 400 mm with alternative dry and wet years we define annual precipitation higher than 400 mm as a wet year and less than 400 mm as a dry year the annual precipitation amount in 2016 was 506 4 mm which was a wet year in 2016 dsr was 1 4 mm soil water storage increased by 38 06 mm according to the formula of land surface water balance the annual evapotranspiration was calculated as 466 94 mm the multi year average evapotranspiration calculated by other researchers in the same area is 475 7 mm which is computed using the cropwat model that has been confirmed to reliably estimate et in natural and forest ecosystems during the growing season zheng et al 2012 the precipitation in 2017 was 309 mm which was a dry year dsr was 0 4 mm the soil water storage decreased by 16 mm and the evapotranspiration amount was 324 6 mm comparing the data of 2016 and 2017 it can be found that dsr soil water storage and evapotranspiration decreased significantly in the dry year 2017 as compared to the wet year 2016 in 2018 the precipitation was 472 2 mm which is another wet year in 2018 dsr was 1 2 mm the soil water storage increased by 54 75 mm and the evapotranspiration was 416 25 mm comparing the data of 2017 and 2018 it was found that with the increase of precipitation dsr increased and the soil water storage was recharged significantly evapotranspiration also increased the precipitation amount in 2019 was only 314 mm which was another dry year there was measurable dsr in 2019 the soil water storage reduced by 3 28 mm and the evapotranspiration also reduced to 317 28 mm from the four year statistical data it can be found that the evapotranspiration of psm is variable this implies that psm can adjust its water consumption to adapt to arid environment these statistical results indicate that with the alternate occurrence of dry and wet years psm is experiencing drought stresses continuously in an annual basis evapotranspiration consumed soil water storage in dry years especially during the summer growing season then psm is in a drought stress state the changes in evapotranspiration over the four years were related to the amount of precipitation years with higher annual precipitations have larger evapotranspiration and vice versa the results show that regardless of the precipitation changes the maximum ratio of dsr to annual precipitation amount is 0 3 in psm forest however in the bare sandy land at the same location the ratio of dsr to annual precipitation is significantly higher at 24 33 cheng et al 2017 this suggests that the reconstruction of psm effectively blocks the precipitation related infiltration to recharge deep soil layer or groundwater without such a vital recharge source the groundwater reservoir in the region may be depleted much faster and the entire regional groundwater flow system will be altered with unforeseen consequences soil moisture reserves increase in wet years and decrease in dry years and the psm forest has adapted to this changes by adjusting its evapotranspiration intensity result shows that the psm planted on a large area in the mu us sandy land blocks the recharge pathway of precipitation to deep soil moisture including groundwater however psm in the area has survived for 40 years indicating that psm forest has reached a balance with precipitation by regulating its own evapotranspiration and intercepting mechanisms even including itself as a water storage unit this delicate balance is relatively fragile especially under the conditions of global warming which may cause changes in precipitation strength and patterns it is unclear if psm can still survive or not in extremely dry years or droughts when the changes in precipitation strength and patterns occur therefore it is necessary to adjust the planting density and scale of psm in the ongoing vegetation reconstruction project to adapt to the possible prolonged drought seasons 3 2 sap flow rate dynamic to figure out if psm has other means rather than adjusting the evapotranspiration intensity to cope with drought stresses we have monitored the stem flow of psm the sap flow rate monitoring was carried out in the main growing season of 2019 may 1st to september 1st with a total annual precipitation of 314 mm signifying a dry year at the study site the probe at the top of the stem monitors the sap flow rate of water depletion by the psm canopy the probe at the stem breast monitors the sap flow rate of the psm root absorbing water from the soil as shown in fig 3 based on the difference of sap flow rates at these two positions one can find out when the stem water storage is depleted or replenished during the observation period the average sap fluxes collected from two sample trees are 3 53 kg tree 1 d 1 j stem top or flux from stem top and 3 46 kg tree 1 d 1 j stem breast or flux from stem breast for tree a and 4 54 kg tree 1 d 1 j stem top and 4 44 kg tree 1 d 1 j stem breast for tree b the maximum difference between j stem top and j stem breast is 1 25 kg tree 1 d 1 for tree a and 2 29 kg tree 1 d 1 for tree b the sum of the sap flow flux difference between the stem top and stem breast during observation time are 9 7 kg for tree a and 16 5 kg for tree b which account for about 2 of the total transpiration based on these data one can infer that psm in the mu us sandy land has utilized stem storage water to cope with the drought stress in dry seasons according to fig 3 one can find that the water depleting and replenishing times for these two trees in one growing season are not completely consistent with each other despite the fact that these two trees are not far from each other within distances less than 10 m the soil moisture at the site does not change noticeably in space but the depletion and replenish of stem water of these two samples appear to be unsynchronized the reason of such an unsynchronized phenomenon is unclear and needs further investigation 3 3 sap flow rate variation at different heights to calculate the difference in stem sap flow startup time measured by stem flow sensors at different heights during the growing season a cross correlation analysis of sap flow startup time between stem top and stem breast was conducted as shown in fig 4 the results show that the time lag of the upper and lower parts of the flow rate varies within the range of 0 60 min s according to the difference between the size of the sapwood tree a 101 5 cm2 tree b 160 8 cm2 and the delay time 0 10 min 20 60 min s of these two samples in table 1 one can infer that a larger sapwood area of the stem leads to a greater water storage capacity and a longer delay of the startup time of the stem sap flow at stem top and stem breast and eventually a stronger drought tolerance the relationship between the sapwood area and the stem flow startup time lag identified in this study does not appear to be reported before for psm in semi arid regions 3 4 daily depletion and replenish of tree stem water storage to study the daily stem water storage depletion and replenishment process this research selects three sunny days during the test period july 10 12 2019 with no obvious soil water deficit and monitors the sap flow rate at stem top and stem breast the results show that the rate of sap flow at stem top rises generally faster than that at stem breast during the early morning the sap flow rate at stem top starts to rise at about 5 am and the sap flow at stem breast starts to rise at a slightly later time such a time lag will lead to depletion of stem water storage the sap flow rates at stem top and stem breast reach equilibrium around 12 00 pm and rapidly decrease afterward however the sap flow rate at stem top declines more rapidly than that at stem breast leading to replenishment of stem water as shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows that two sample trees have the same depletion and replenishment phenomenon the sap flow rate of sample tree b is greater than that of tree a by comparing the sapwood area of the two trees tree a 101 5 cm2 tree b 160 8 cm2 from figs 5 one can conclude that the stem sap flow rate is related to the growth status of the tree as shown in fig 5 the stem water storage is in a state of replenishment before 6 am while it is in a state of depletion between 6 am and 12 pm after 12 pm the stem water storage is in the replenishment state again although the exact time durations of depletion and replenishment of these two samples are slightly different the general trends are somewhat the same one can concludes that in a daily basis the stem water storage is in a state of depletion at 6 am to 12 pm and in a replenishing state from 12 pm to 6 am we only have two trees as experimental samples and the stem water depletion and refilling of psm with a larger diameter at breast height are obviously higher from this observation it appears that it is a common phenomenon for psm to utilize stem water storage to cope with drought stress the larger the stem diameter the greater the stem water storage capacity 3 5 drought stress influence on the capability of utilizing stem water storage to find out tree drought endurance capacity and tree stem water storage changes on soil moisture deficit we select 60 stem flow rates under different drought stress rew during the observation period the statistics of the sap flow rates of stem top and stem breast show that both stem flow rates decrease when the soil moisture declines fig 6 the best curve fitting nonlinear equations for the stem breast and stem top are denoted as y 1 and y 2 in fig 6 respectively the coefficients of determination of y 1 and y 2 are respectively 0 56 r 1 2 and 0 60 r 2 2 it can be seen that with the increase of the drought stress rew the stem flow rate increases first and then decreases afterwards when rew is less than about 0 43 the stem water storage is primarily in a depleting phase and when rew is greater than 0 43 the stem water storage is mostly replenishing y 3 represents the change in the net value of stem water storage with drought stress it can be calculated that when the rew is 0 57 the net value of stem water storage refilling is greater than the depletion the stem top sap flow rate varies between 1 28 kg tree 1d 1 to 5 64 kg tree 1d 1 and the stem breast sap flow rate varies between 1 30 kg tree 1d 1 to 6 31 kg tree 1d 1 the maximum daily stem water depletion amount is 1 1 kg tree 1d 1 as shown in fig 6 under extreme drought conditions the root is still capable of absorbing water from soil to replenish the stem water storage when the soil is not dehydrated rew greater than 0 5 the stem flow rates at stem top and stem breast appear to be the same in summary one can conclude that a severe soil drought will increase the likelihood of utilizing the tree stems as water storage under drought stress psm constantly adjusts the rate of stem water storage and the canopy water consumption in another word one can say that tree stem water storage can improve tree drought resistance capability our research shows that the psm planted on a large area in the mu us sandy land blocks the recharge pathway of precipitation to deep soil moisture including groundwater however psm in the area has survived for 40 years indicating that psm forest has reached a balance with precipitation by regulating its own evapotranspiration and intercepting mechanisms even including itself as a water storage unit this delicate balance is relatively fragile especially under the conditions of global warming which may cause changes in precipitation strength and patterns it is unclear if psm can still survive or not in extremely dry years or droughts when the changes in precipitation strength and patterns occur therefore it is necessary to adjust the planting density and scale of psm in the ongoing vegetation reconstruction project to adapt to the possible prolonged drought seasons 3 6 drought stress on utilization of stem stored water trees can use stem part to store water and use stem water storage to cope with canopy evapotranspiration thus to improve drought resilience capability this research finds that there is a large difference in the daily or seasonally sap water flux between stem top and stem breast as shown in fig 3 this finding proves that the stem water storage can respond to drought environment stress and buffer the effects of drought in dry seasons trees can also alleviate drought using stem water storages based on measurements of the sap flow rates at stem top and breast this study shows that utilization of stem water in a growing season of psm forest can account for 19 21 of evapotranspiration over the entire growing season previous researches which showed that douglas fir trees accounted for 6 28 of evapotranspiration over the entire growing season aguadé et al 2015 nadezhdina et al 2009 in this study in dry seasons trees can also alleviate drought using stem water storages based on measurements of the sap flow rates at stem top and breast the result shows that utilization of stem water in a growing season of psm forest can account for 19 21 of evapotranspiration over the entire growing season water used to replenish the stem storage accounts for 12 9 21 7 of the total amount of water absorbed through roots from soil over the entire growing season previous studies have shown that vegetation can increase the amount of water stored in the stem portion in response to a water shortage scholz et al 2007 others have shown that even there is no shortage of water the tree stem will still store a certain amount of water mayoral et al 2016 this research confirms that stem stored water can be used to buffer the daily water deficit the great difference between j s max stem top and j s max stem breast indicate the utilization of water storage in psm suggesting that large trees or trees with thick stems can store more stem water to cope with drought stress considering the stem water storage and deeper root systems of larger trees canopy scale transpiration might be more likely to survive severe drought or sudden water deficit in this research sensors that measure stem flow rate were installed in the stem breast and stem top near canopy and the measured water storage in stem was only part of the psm water storage therefore the actual water storage capacity of psm stems should be greater than what has been estimated in this research as drought goes on the daily variation in stem circumference of psm shows a strong trend of increase of water withdrawal from tree stem which may come from embolization of xylem vessels 4 conclusions the rainfed psm on the mu us sandy land fixed the sand and promoted the ecological restoration of the area and improved the natural environment the growth of psm consumed almost all of the precipitation water resource during its growth blocked the supply of deep soil water and groundwater by precipitation in the area especially in dry season psm consumed all precipitation water and part of the soil water storage at the same time psm used the stem as a reservoir to storage water so as to regulate its own water supply source during the drought seasons the balance between psm and precipitation supply in the mu us sandy land had almost reached a critical point which means further drought may cause the death of psm therefore it is necessary to adjust the planting density and scale of psm in the ongoing vegetation reconstruction project on the forest land scale as the annual precipitation changes the evapotranspiration changes accordingly on a single plant scale psm appears to adapt to drought conditions in harsh arid and semi arid regions quantifying the sap flow at tree scale is important for assessing the interrelationship of water resource in semi arid regions under drought stress in this research the difference in the sap flow rate of psm at different heights of the stem top and breast indicates many important characteristics of tree stem water storage and canopy water depletion the reconstruction psm forest is selected as the examples of this study through monitoring of the sap flow rate at two different parts of stem top and breast in association with simultaneous monitoring of dsr and environmental factors of the study site the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 reconstruction of psm forest in mu us sandy land basically blocked the replenishment of precipitation to recharge deep soil moisture resulting in 1 4 mm of dsr in wet years and undetectable dsr in dry years almost all of the total precipitation moisture was absorbed for growth and evapotranspiration by psm 2 in dry years such as 2017 in order to cope with drought the evapotranspiration of psm forest was reduced to 324 4 mm in 2017 and the soil water storage was reduced by 16 mm in 2017 in contrast in wet years such as 2016 precipitation water replenishes soil water storage therefore the soil water storage was augmented by 38 06 mm in 2016 and the evapotranspiration of psm forest land increased to 466 94 mm in 2016 3 the capability of psm to withstand drought was enhanced by the stem water storage the maximum daily stem water depletion amount was 1 1 kg tree 1d 1 and stem water storage capacity led to a greater drought tolerance capability 4 the psm stem water storage depletion and replenishment process occurred in the growing season and did not necessarily occur synchronously with environmental factors in a daily basis the stem water storage was in a state of depletion from 6 am to 12 pm and in a state of replenishment from 12 pm to 6 am a more severe drought would lead to more obvious use of tree stem for water storage 5 under the drought conditions rew was less than 0 5 and the psm root had the capability of absorbing water from soil to replenish the stem water storage declaration of

10445,desertification has long seriously threatened the ecological security of northern china for which china has established the world s largest shelterbelt project after 40 years of reconstruction of vegetation the trend of desertification in northern china has been reversed the shelterbelt forest project in northern china however at the same time tells signs of degradation and therefore its effectiveness has been questioned by scientists from various countries in order to study the impact of the vegetation reconstruction process in the semi arid area on the precipitation water redistribution process in this area and how the reconstructed vegetation survives in dry season this study selected the reconstruction pinus sylvestris var mongolica psm forest on mu us sandy land as the research object and used new lysimeters stem flow meters miniature weather stations etc to monitor the deep soil water penetration stem flux the purpose of this current study is to find out how psm forest changed the process of precipitation water redistribution in this area and how psm adjusts its own water storage capacity to adapt to the annual precipitation changes in wet years such as 2017 dsr is only 0 4 mm soil water storage is reduced by 16 mm and evapotranspiration is 324 6 mm in a wet year such as 2016 the dsr is 1 4 mm the soil water storage is enlarged by 38 06 mm and the evapotranspiration is 466 94 mm the results showed that the water consumption of psm in mu us area and the precipitation water replenishment in this area reached a balance but blocked precipitation to recharge deep soil water and groundwater the rain fed psm stem can be used as a reservoir unit to supply water consumption and adjusting the evapotranspiration intensity to adapt to changes in annual precipitation this research has advanced our understanding of the scale of reconstruction vegetation utilization of precipitation and the utilization mechanism of tree stem storage water in semi arid areas keywords pinus sylvestris var mongolica deep soil recharge stem water storage dry season drought tolerance 1 introduction according to the united nations convention to combat desertification desertification refers to land degradation in arid semi arid and sub humid region caused by various factors including climate variability and anthropogenic activities kassas 1995 china is one of the countries that are most seriously affected by desertification in the world wang et al 2013 according to the china desertification bulletin published by the forestry administration of china the total land area of desertification in china was 262 37 104 km2 by the end of 2018 accounting for 27 33 of china s total land area the mu us sandy land is located in the middle of the ecotone between agriculture and husbandry in northern china due to excessive reclamation and grazing in this area ecological degradation wu and ci 2002 it is also lied in the forest steppe desert ecological stress zone an important ecological barrier of china and this unique location makes the local ecosystem vulnerable and sensitive to ecological hydrological and climatic changes yan et al 2015 in order to slow down the movement of sands or even to fix sands in the arid and semi arid sandy land including mu us sandy land a massive artificial afforestation project called the three north shelterbelt forest project 3nsp has been carried over the past several decades after 40 years of continuous reconstruction studies have shown that china currently accounts for 25 of the global increase in leaf area and approximately 42 of china s green area comes from forest reconstruction with a greater portion of contribution from 3nsp chen et al 2019 water resource is an extremely important ecological limiting factor for vegetation reconstruction bochet and garcía fayos 2004 feng et al 2016 water resource in semi arid areas mainly exists in the form of soil moisture bromley et al 1997 soil moisture is a vital bridge between atmospheric precipitation surface water and groundwater because most groundwater recharge comes from direct recharge of soil moisture which itself is recharged by atmospheric precipitation and or surface bodies therefore soil moisture plays an important role in the water resources formation transformation and consumption precipitation related infiltration below ground surface is the main source of replenishment of soil moisture in semi arid areas while deep soil recharge dsr is a key link in the conversion of atmospheric precipitation into groundwater recharge which is vital for preventing the groundwater resources from depletion hatch et al 2006 yang et al 2018 therefore study on the characteristics of soil water dynamics and deep soil infiltration in semi arid areas is of great importance for better understanding of the eco hydrological processes in semi arid areas the impact of vegetation on soil moisture is also reflected in precipitation interception and alternation of evapotranspiration domingo et al 1998 especially in semi arid areas the intensity of precipitation is generally small so it is more likely that the directly intercepted water is consumed by evapotranspiration before it has a chance to infiltrate into soils li et al 2005 meanwhile the vegetation root system absorbs soil moisture for the purpose of transpiration thus consumes a great deal of soil moisture under the canopy moreira et al 2000 in this regard the vegetation functions as a sink rather than a source for soil moisture and groundwater storage on the other hand vegetation coverage can reduce the surface evapotranspiration and the vegetation root system can hold and conserve some soil moisture doerr et al 2000 furthermore vegetation with a proper density can improve the soil permeability and enhance the infiltration capacity of soil in this regard the vegetation functions as a source rather than a sink for soil water and groundwater storage the net impact of vegetation on soil moisture replies on a delicate balance of above mentioned two competitive mechanisms sink or source if the sink mechanism dominates then the vegetation leads to depletion of soil moisture while the source mechanism dominates the vegetation leads to replenishment of soil moisture such a delicate balance is dynamic in nature and may change in a daily or seasonal basis statistics of water resources distribution in semi arid areas provide a scientific basis for vegetation reconstruction and it can guide the evaluation of the stability of sand fixing vegetation and availability of usable water resources in semi arid sandy areas a large area of afforestation in the mu us sandy land has fixed the mobile sand and slowed down the development of desertification however the precipitation amount in mu us sandy land is relatively small thus there is a grave concern that large scale vegetation reconstruction may aggravate the drought some studies have shown that low density forest land is conducive to precipitation related infiltration thus can increase the soil water storage on the other hand high density forest will cause soil moisture shortage thus is not preferred in semi arid areas bargués tobella et al 2014 at the same time the drought tolerant vegetation in semi arid areas can adjust its own water use physiology to adapt to environmental changes downing et al 1997 when external conditions have been determined including planting density and precipitation conditions how does a tree adjust its water use mode when facing arid environment this is an overarching question leading to this research understanding the adaptation of trees to drought stress is relevant to the subject of this investigation body water storage confers a very important capacity for plants to survive extreme drought in xylem tension that allows the tree to minimize hydraulic dysfunction associated with excessive embolism when precipitation and soil water supply are limiting chone et al 2001 sperry et al 2002 water storage in stems of tree contributes to their response to short term water deficit mueller et al 2005 and therefore it is an important adaptation for plants to survive during drought seasons scholz et al 2007 meanwhile stem water storage can serve as a transient water source for tree daily transpiration even in areas without water shortage hsiao 1973 utilization of released water from stored compartments near the canopy for some tall trees may play an important role in mitigating the water stress of canopy leaves buffering the increasing xylem tension induced by transpiration and maintaining the stomata opening for photosynthesis blum 2011 hsiao and acevedo 1975 how important these internal water resources are depends on tree size wood anatomy sapwood dimension rhizome size steppe et al 2015 and also on living environmental conditions goldstein et al 1998 for instance the quantity of stem stored water used daily accounts for about as great as 20 of daily total sap flow in large douglas fir trees phillips et al 2002 which account for 10 22 in four diffuse porous species in central europe köcher et al 2013 specifically the water stored in the stem of a tree can provide plant transpiration for a week time but the water stored in the canopy can only keep the tree transpiration for a few hours čermák et al 2007 the stem water stores are mostly exhausted when the soil matrix potential drops below 0 1 mpa and daily mean vapor pressure deficit vpd exceeds 3 hpa 5 hpa köcher et al 2013 however despite these evidences some researchers have concluded that most of the plant s transpiration water consumption comes from root water absorption rather than its own water storage meinzer et al 2003 or was only relevant in some plants with low transpiration rate use stem water storage hinckley et al 1978 wilkinson and davies 2002 if the tree stems have little water storage the transpiration will quickly cause the vegetation to lose water which will promote the leaf stomatal closure therefore stem stored water seems to play a biologically significant role especially when trees are under drought stress unfortunately a lack of direct field evidence makes it impossible to test the assumptions on the importance of stem stored water on the transpiration mechanism of trees particularly in semi arid regions this motives us to conduct this long term field experiment to find out whether trees use the stem water storage or not in drought seasons in semi arid regions a commonly used species in 3nsp is pinus sylvestris var mongolica psm whose growth and survival is closely affected by soil moisture condition zhu et al 2006 if the soil water content is insufficient the growth of psm will be severely limited some studies suggest that drought stress may cause early decline of psm plantation in sandy land song et al 2014 for the mu us sandy land the growth of psm depends on the precipitation amount song et al 2015 however there are still a number of important questions that have not been answered satisfactorily for example how does psm deal with dry and wet alternate years has psm considerably changed the replenishment of deep soil moisture during the vegetation reconstruction process during drought seasons how does psm adjust its own water use to adapt to the reduction in precipitation to answer these questions we need a reliable method to quantify the relationship between the precipitation of psm forest and deep soil recharge dsr among others the purpose of this research is to report a long term field study to explore the effect of psm forest on the replenishment of dsr and water use mechanism of psm in semi arid regions in drought seasons we attempt to find out how the psm forest changes the regional water resources distribution and whether the water storage in stem can be used as a backup during the transpiration process or not we want to answer the question that after planting psm in mu us sandy land how is the precipitation distributed in the shallow soil layer and is there still precipitation to replenish dsr more specifically we will quantify the evapotranspiration soil water storage dsr and estimate the contribution of water storage to the daily water budget of psm another question we are trying to answer is how does psm cope with drought conditions on a single plant scale furthermore we will use time lags of sap flow between different positions of trunk as a proxy of stem water storage these field experiments advance our understanding of the ecohydrological systems of the psm forest and stem water storage mechanism in semi arid regions during drought seasons and more specifically it helps answer the question of how psm survives in the mu us sandy land 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the study area the experimental site is selected in mu us sandy land as shown in fig 1 with a geographic coordinate of 39 20 57 n 111 12 06 e the site is 1100 m above the mean sea level with an annual average temperature of 7 5 c an annual frozen free time period of 150 160 days the multi year average temperature is 6 0 c to 8 5 c and the multi year average precipitation is 400 mm 1954 2010 the precipitation varies annually from 250 mm to 550 mm 1954 2010 and 60 70 of the precipitation is concentrated from june to august the vegetation in this region is often subjected to drought stress the surface soil layer is thin and the organic matter content is low generally around 0 34 0 99 g kg 1 the psm in the study area is planted in strips artificially for the purpose of preventing wind and fixing sand the distance between two psm in the strip is 5 m and the distance between two neighboring rows is 10 m excavation on site shows that the root system of psm grows primarily horizontally and is distributed in the shallow soil less than 200 cm deep and the roots of psm are filled in the shallow soil between the rows 2 2 research methods 2 2 1 monitoring dsr the deep soil water recharge dsr can show the redistribution results of precipitation moisture in psm forest land this study used a newly designed deep soil layer moisture infiltration measuring instrument lysimeter to directly measure the dsr value cheng et al 2018 2017 as shown in fig 2 the roots of psm absorbing precipitation induced soil moisture are fine roots and the distribution range of fine roots is concentrated in 0 120 cm depth zhu et al 2008 the capillary water holding height of the mu us sandy land is about 60 80 cm therefore we have installed the newly designed lysimeter in the soil layer below the depth of 200 cm and measured dsr from precipitation related infiltration passing through the 200 cm depth the lysimeter was installed in the middle of the lined psm forest for the precipitation under the canopy is intercepted when installing the instrument one should reduce the disturbance to each layer of soil and reduce root damage use in situ soil backfill after backfilling watering the excavated plot to promote the plot restoration of the original state of each layer of soil cheng et al 2017 the experimental design is shown in fig 2 figure 2 and explained sequentially as follows the experimental plot is a relatively uniform psm forest the soil type is sandy soil and the row spacing is 10 m because monitoring precipitation is affected by the interception of the canopy the observation site is set in the open area between the two rows of psm forest firstly in order to minimize the disturbance of the original soil structure we need to water the experimental plot in advance before installing the instrument watering the soil in the experimental area makes the relatively dry sandy soil stable and easy to excavate as the native dry sandy soil is relatively loose secondly after watering the psm plot we start to excavate a soil profile vertically downward in the middle of the psm line reaching a depth of 3 2 m after this at the depth of 3 2 m we excavate horizontally toward the location of the main branch of psm to a distance about 0 3 m eventually a body with a height of 1 2 m a length and width both of 0 3 m is excavated to install the new lysimeter under the undisturbed root zone by doing so the distance from the ground surface to the top of lysimeter is 200 cm and the root system which is less than 200 cm deep will not be disturbed meanwhile as the plot has been watered to make the soil stable no collapse of soil has occurred during the installation of the new lysimeter thirdly after putting the new lysimeter in place we use in situ soil to backfill during this process one needs to continuously water each layer of backfill to ensure that the soil is relatively compact finally one needs to wait for the watered plot to stabilize to its pre excavation status in general the pre watered sandy plot and excavated sand layer will take a year to settle down then one can start the experiments as shown in fig 2 precipitation soil water content of each layer and dsr can be measured based on the soil water content of each layer the entire 200 cm depth soil water storage can be calculated in this study we set october as the time to calculate the final soil water storage the annual soil water storage subtraction is the difference of the soil water storage capacity in two consecutive years since the study area is flat sandy land no runoff is found then the evapotranspiration is calculated according to the water balance formula according to the monitored dsr data one can analyze the data to see whether the psm forest land is under drought stress or not if the dsr value is below the detection limit it means that the forest land after vegetation restoration is in a relatively dry state this implies that groundwater will not be recharged and the regional groundwater flow system may be profoundly affected with some unforeseen consequences 2 2 2 monitoring soil moisture the ec 5 soil moisture sensors decagon devices inc usa were installed at 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm 120 cm 160 cm and 200 cm soil layer depth as shown in fig 2 and a c200 s data collector was utilized to collect data at an interval of 1 h the data of the soil volumetric moisture content were corrected with an empirical equation the relative extractable water or the relative effective soil water index rew refers to the amount of soil water available to the plant and it is calculated as granier 1987 oren et al 1999 1 r e w θ θ m i n θ f θ m i n where θf is the volumetric field water holding capacity and its value is determined by field test to be 17 5 and θ min is the minimum volumetric moisture content which is 2 3 measured in extreme drought in 2017 θ is the average volumetric moisture content of the soil within 0 200 cm depth the soil moisture sensors showed the actual precipitation related infiltration in each soil layer in this study seven soil moisture sensors were installed according to the soil stratification to monitor the infiltration rate at different depths according to the soil water content the soil water retention in each layer can be calculated as well surface evapotranspiration can be calculated according to precipitation soil water retention and dsr 2 2 3 monitoring of meteorological elements a mini weather station consisting of 7 elements was set up on an open space 50 m away from the field site to monitor air temperature air humidity wind speed sensor wind direction sensor atmospheric pressure sensor solar radiation and precipitation avalon usa the data collector is sq2020 grant company uk all sensors are mounted 2 m above the ground the sampling interval is 10 min the vpd is calculated as follows campbell and norman 1998 2 v p d 0 611 e 17 502 t t 240 97 1 r h where t is the temperature c and rh is the relative humidity 2 2 4 monitoring sap flow rate of sapwood a 10 10 m experimental area was established in the mu us forest land of psm in the experimental site two healthy strong psm trees were selected as test samples to monitor the sap flow flux js the information of the sample tree is shown in table 1 the j s was measured using granier thermal diffusion sensor tdp dynmax australia the apparatus consists of two sensors to measure stem flow as shown in fig 1 each sample tree is installed with a set of tdp at stem top and stem breast and all the sensors are connected to a 16 channel data collector sq2020 grant uk the data collection interval is 10 min the 100 v polycrystalline solar panel is connected to the 12v 100ah lead acid storage battery for power supply the sap flow rate js cm h 1 is calculated using the granier 1987 3 j s 119 10 4 δ t 0 δ t δ t 1 231 60 where δt is the actual temperature difference c between the upper and lower sensors and δt 0 is the temperature difference between the upper and lower sensors when the liquid flow is zero maximum value c δt 0 uses two regression methods in a cycle of 10 days as suggested by granier 1987 the sapwood width is determined using a growth cone to drill through tree core and the sapwood is distinguished by colour change for calculation of the liquid flow within 3 cm of the sapwood the sap flow velocity at the inner part js inner is estimated using a species specific coefficient formula poyatos et al 2005 4 j s i n n e r 1 87156 exp 1 2 03698 x d 0 13153 where xd is the xylem depth under the cambium cm eq 4 was verified on psm using measurements through the heat field deformation hfd method nadezhdina et al 2012 r 2 0 95 p lower than 0 01 in 2016 one can image that the canopy transpiration first uses the water stored in the stem part and then supplements the transpiration water consumption through the root system so that there is a time difference it is assumed that the transpiration of vegetation around dawn comes from stem water storage köcher et al 2013 the stem flow near the canopy part occurs earlier than the stem part there is also a difference of start time in stem flow therefore since the stem can store water the stem flow measured at the stem part may represent the water amount absorbed from the soil not the actual canopy transpiration goldstein et al 1998 one way to estimate the amount of water stored in the stem is to compare the integrated values of stem flux in the stem breast part and canopy part on a 24 hour basis čermák et al 2007 köcher et al 2013 radiation r vpd and soil moisture are important and interrelated environmental controls on ecosystem water fluxes at different time scales which should be monitored during the experimental period 2 3 data processing and analysis to facilitate comparison each data point of sample tree is standardized by the maximum liquid flow rate measured during the whole observation period which is called the relative liquid flow rate j s max dimensionless the sap fluxes at stem breast and stem top were recorded as j s max stem breast and j s max stem top respectively comparison of relative flow rates at different heights was performed using the one way anova method in the statistical software originpro 2018 with multiple comparisons using tukey hsd post hoc at p 0 05 or 0 01 for significant threshold levels the time lag was implemented in the ncss 12 version using the cross correlation analysis llc kaysville utah usa the mapping waswas done in originpro 2018 originlan inc northampton ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 annual dsr changes and precipitation moisture redistribution as shown in table 2 the range of annual precipitation amount in this area varies widely and the average annual precipitation is 400 mm with alternative dry and wet years we define annual precipitation higher than 400 mm as a wet year and less than 400 mm as a dry year the annual precipitation amount in 2016 was 506 4 mm which was a wet year in 2016 dsr was 1 4 mm soil water storage increased by 38 06 mm according to the formula of land surface water balance the annual evapotranspiration was calculated as 466 94 mm the multi year average evapotranspiration calculated by other researchers in the same area is 475 7 mm which is computed using the cropwat model that has been confirmed to reliably estimate et in natural and forest ecosystems during the growing season zheng et al 2012 the precipitation in 2017 was 309 mm which was a dry year dsr was 0 4 mm the soil water storage decreased by 16 mm and the evapotranspiration amount was 324 6 mm comparing the data of 2016 and 2017 it can be found that dsr soil water storage and evapotranspiration decreased significantly in the dry year 2017 as compared to the wet year 2016 in 2018 the precipitation was 472 2 mm which is another wet year in 2018 dsr was 1 2 mm the soil water storage increased by 54 75 mm and the evapotranspiration was 416 25 mm comparing the data of 2017 and 2018 it was found that with the increase of precipitation dsr increased and the soil water storage was recharged significantly evapotranspiration also increased the precipitation amount in 2019 was only 314 mm which was another dry year there was measurable dsr in 2019 the soil water storage reduced by 3 28 mm and the evapotranspiration also reduced to 317 28 mm from the four year statistical data it can be found that the evapotranspiration of psm is variable this implies that psm can adjust its water consumption to adapt to arid environment these statistical results indicate that with the alternate occurrence of dry and wet years psm is experiencing drought stresses continuously in an annual basis evapotranspiration consumed soil water storage in dry years especially during the summer growing season then psm is in a drought stress state the changes in evapotranspiration over the four years were related to the amount of precipitation years with higher annual precipitations have larger evapotranspiration and vice versa the results show that regardless of the precipitation changes the maximum ratio of dsr to annual precipitation amount is 0 3 in psm forest however in the bare sandy land at the same location the ratio of dsr to annual precipitation is significantly higher at 24 33 cheng et al 2017 this suggests that the reconstruction of psm effectively blocks the precipitation related infiltration to recharge deep soil layer or groundwater without such a vital recharge source the groundwater reservoir in the region may be depleted much faster and the entire regional groundwater flow system will be altered with unforeseen consequences soil moisture reserves increase in wet years and decrease in dry years and the psm forest has adapted to this changes by adjusting its evapotranspiration intensity result shows that the psm planted on a large area in the mu us sandy land blocks the recharge pathway of precipitation to deep soil moisture including groundwater however psm in the area has survived for 40 years indicating that psm forest has reached a balance with precipitation by regulating its own evapotranspiration and intercepting mechanisms even including itself as a water storage unit this delicate balance is relatively fragile especially under the conditions of global warming which may cause changes in precipitation strength and patterns it is unclear if psm can still survive or not in extremely dry years or droughts when the changes in precipitation strength and patterns occur therefore it is necessary to adjust the planting density and scale of psm in the ongoing vegetation reconstruction project to adapt to the possible prolonged drought seasons 3 2 sap flow rate dynamic to figure out if psm has other means rather than adjusting the evapotranspiration intensity to cope with drought stresses we have monitored the stem flow of psm the sap flow rate monitoring was carried out in the main growing season of 2019 may 1st to september 1st with a total annual precipitation of 314 mm signifying a dry year at the study site the probe at the top of the stem monitors the sap flow rate of water depletion by the psm canopy the probe at the stem breast monitors the sap flow rate of the psm root absorbing water from the soil as shown in fig 3 based on the difference of sap flow rates at these two positions one can find out when the stem water storage is depleted or replenished during the observation period the average sap fluxes collected from two sample trees are 3 53 kg tree 1 d 1 j stem top or flux from stem top and 3 46 kg tree 1 d 1 j stem breast or flux from stem breast for tree a and 4 54 kg tree 1 d 1 j stem top and 4 44 kg tree 1 d 1 j stem breast for tree b the maximum difference between j stem top and j stem breast is 1 25 kg tree 1 d 1 for tree a and 2 29 kg tree 1 d 1 for tree b the sum of the sap flow flux difference between the stem top and stem breast during observation time are 9 7 kg for tree a and 16 5 kg for tree b which account for about 2 of the total transpiration based on these data one can infer that psm in the mu us sandy land has utilized stem storage water to cope with the drought stress in dry seasons according to fig 3 one can find that the water depleting and replenishing times for these two trees in one growing season are not completely consistent with each other despite the fact that these two trees are not far from each other within distances less than 10 m the soil moisture at the site does not change noticeably in space but the depletion and replenish of stem water of these two samples appear to be unsynchronized the reason of such an unsynchronized phenomenon is unclear and needs further investigation 3 3 sap flow rate variation at different heights to calculate the difference in stem sap flow startup time measured by stem flow sensors at different heights during the growing season a cross correlation analysis of sap flow startup time between stem top and stem breast was conducted as shown in fig 4 the results show that the time lag of the upper and lower parts of the flow rate varies within the range of 0 60 min s according to the difference between the size of the sapwood tree a 101 5 cm2 tree b 160 8 cm2 and the delay time 0 10 min 20 60 min s of these two samples in table 1 one can infer that a larger sapwood area of the stem leads to a greater water storage capacity and a longer delay of the startup time of the stem sap flow at stem top and stem breast and eventually a stronger drought tolerance the relationship between the sapwood area and the stem flow startup time lag identified in this study does not appear to be reported before for psm in semi arid regions 3 4 daily depletion and replenish of tree stem water storage to study the daily stem water storage depletion and replenishment process this research selects three sunny days during the test period july 10 12 2019 with no obvious soil water deficit and monitors the sap flow rate at stem top and stem breast the results show that the rate of sap flow at stem top rises generally faster than that at stem breast during the early morning the sap flow rate at stem top starts to rise at about 5 am and the sap flow at stem breast starts to rise at a slightly later time such a time lag will lead to depletion of stem water storage the sap flow rates at stem top and stem breast reach equilibrium around 12 00 pm and rapidly decrease afterward however the sap flow rate at stem top declines more rapidly than that at stem breast leading to replenishment of stem water as shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows that two sample trees have the same depletion and replenishment phenomenon the sap flow rate of sample tree b is greater than that of tree a by comparing the sapwood area of the two trees tree a 101 5 cm2 tree b 160 8 cm2 from figs 5 one can conclude that the stem sap flow rate is related to the growth status of the tree as shown in fig 5 the stem water storage is in a state of replenishment before 6 am while it is in a state of depletion between 6 am and 12 pm after 12 pm the stem water storage is in the replenishment state again although the exact time durations of depletion and replenishment of these two samples are slightly different the general trends are somewhat the same one can concludes that in a daily basis the stem water storage is in a state of depletion at 6 am to 12 pm and in a replenishing state from 12 pm to 6 am we only have two trees as experimental samples and the stem water depletion and refilling of psm with a larger diameter at breast height are obviously higher from this observation it appears that it is a common phenomenon for psm to utilize stem water storage to cope with drought stress the larger the stem diameter the greater the stem water storage capacity 3 5 drought stress influence on the capability of utilizing stem water storage to find out tree drought endurance capacity and tree stem water storage changes on soil moisture deficit we select 60 stem flow rates under different drought stress rew during the observation period the statistics of the sap flow rates of stem top and stem breast show that both stem flow rates decrease when the soil moisture declines fig 6 the best curve fitting nonlinear equations for the stem breast and stem top are denoted as y 1 and y 2 in fig 6 respectively the coefficients of determination of y 1 and y 2 are respectively 0 56 r 1 2 and 0 60 r 2 2 it can be seen that with the increase of the drought stress rew the stem flow rate increases first and then decreases afterwards when rew is less than about 0 43 the stem water storage is primarily in a depleting phase and when rew is greater than 0 43 the stem water storage is mostly replenishing y 3 represents the change in the net value of stem water storage with drought stress it can be calculated that when the rew is 0 57 the net value of stem water storage refilling is greater than the depletion the stem top sap flow rate varies between 1 28 kg tree 1d 1 to 5 64 kg tree 1d 1 and the stem breast sap flow rate varies between 1 30 kg tree 1d 1 to 6 31 kg tree 1d 1 the maximum daily stem water depletion amount is 1 1 kg tree 1d 1 as shown in fig 6 under extreme drought conditions the root is still capable of absorbing water from soil to replenish the stem water storage when the soil is not dehydrated rew greater than 0 5 the stem flow rates at stem top and stem breast appear to be the same in summary one can conclude that a severe soil drought will increase the likelihood of utilizing the tree stems as water storage under drought stress psm constantly adjusts the rate of stem water storage and the canopy water consumption in another word one can say that tree stem water storage can improve tree drought resistance capability our research shows that the psm planted on a large area in the mu us sandy land blocks the recharge pathway of precipitation to deep soil moisture including groundwater however psm in the area has survived for 40 years indicating that psm forest has reached a balance with precipitation by regulating its own evapotranspiration and intercepting mechanisms even including itself as a water storage unit this delicate balance is relatively fragile especially under the conditions of global warming which may cause changes in precipitation strength and patterns it is unclear if psm can still survive or not in extremely dry years or droughts when the changes in precipitation strength and patterns occur therefore it is necessary to adjust the planting density and scale of psm in the ongoing vegetation reconstruction project to adapt to the possible prolonged drought seasons 3 6 drought stress on utilization of stem stored water trees can use stem part to store water and use stem water storage to cope with canopy evapotranspiration thus to improve drought resilience capability this research finds that there is a large difference in the daily or seasonally sap water flux between stem top and stem breast as shown in fig 3 this finding proves that the stem water storage can respond to drought environment stress and buffer the effects of drought in dry seasons trees can also alleviate drought using stem water storages based on measurements of the sap flow rates at stem top and breast this study shows that utilization of stem water in a growing season of psm forest can account for 19 21 of evapotranspiration over the entire growing season previous researches which showed that douglas fir trees accounted for 6 28 of evapotranspiration over the entire growing season aguadé et al 2015 nadezhdina et al 2009 in this study in dry seasons trees can also alleviate drought using stem water storages based on measurements of the sap flow rates at stem top and breast the result shows that utilization of stem water in a growing season of psm forest can account for 19 21 of evapotranspiration over the entire growing season water used to replenish the stem storage accounts for 12 9 21 7 of the total amount of water absorbed through roots from soil over the entire growing season previous studies have shown that vegetation can increase the amount of water stored in the stem portion in response to a water shortage scholz et al 2007 others have shown that even there is no shortage of water the tree stem will still store a certain amount of water mayoral et al 2016 this research confirms that stem stored water can be used to buffer the daily water deficit the great difference between j s max stem top and j s max stem breast indicate the utilization of water storage in psm suggesting that large trees or trees with thick stems can store more stem water to cope with drought stress considering the stem water storage and deeper root systems of larger trees canopy scale transpiration might be more likely to survive severe drought or sudden water deficit in this research sensors that measure stem flow rate were installed in the stem breast and stem top near canopy and the measured water storage in stem was only part of the psm water storage therefore the actual water storage capacity of psm stems should be greater than what has been estimated in this research as drought goes on the daily variation in stem circumference of psm shows a strong trend of increase of water withdrawal from tree stem which may come from embolization of xylem vessels 4 conclusions the rainfed psm on the mu us sandy land fixed the sand and promoted the ecological restoration of the area and improved the natural environment the growth of psm consumed almost all of the precipitation water resource during its growth blocked the supply of deep soil water and groundwater by precipitation in the area especially in dry season psm consumed all precipitation water and part of the soil water storage at the same time psm used the stem as a reservoir to storage water so as to regulate its own water supply source during the drought seasons the balance between psm and precipitation supply in the mu us sandy land had almost reached a critical point which means further drought may cause the death of psm therefore it is necessary to adjust the planting density and scale of psm in the ongoing vegetation reconstruction project on the forest land scale as the annual precipitation changes the evapotranspiration changes accordingly on a single plant scale psm appears to adapt to drought conditions in harsh arid and semi arid regions quantifying the sap flow at tree scale is important for assessing the interrelationship of water resource in semi arid regions under drought stress in this research the difference in the sap flow rate of psm at different heights of the stem top and breast indicates many important characteristics of tree stem water storage and canopy water depletion the reconstruction psm forest is selected as the examples of this study through monitoring of the sap flow rate at two different parts of stem top and breast in association with simultaneous monitoring of dsr and environmental factors of the study site the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 reconstruction of psm forest in mu us sandy land basically blocked the replenishment of precipitation to recharge deep soil moisture resulting in 1 4 mm of dsr in wet years and undetectable dsr in dry years almost all of the total precipitation moisture was absorbed for growth and evapotranspiration by psm 2 in dry years such as 2017 in order to cope with drought the evapotranspiration of psm forest was reduced to 324 4 mm in 2017 and the soil water storage was reduced by 16 mm in 2017 in contrast in wet years such as 2016 precipitation water replenishes soil water storage therefore the soil water storage was augmented by 38 06 mm in 2016 and the evapotranspiration of psm forest land increased to 466 94 mm in 2016 3 the capability of psm to withstand drought was enhanced by the stem water storage the maximum daily stem water depletion amount was 1 1 kg tree 1d 1 and stem water storage capacity led to a greater drought tolerance capability 4 the psm stem water storage depletion and replenishment process occurred in the growing season and did not necessarily occur synchronously with environmental factors in a daily basis the stem water storage was in a state of depletion from 6 am to 12 pm and in a state of replenishment from 12 pm to 6 am a more severe drought would lead to more obvious use of tree stem for water storage 5 under the drought conditions rew was less than 0 5 and the psm root had the capability of absorbing water from soil to replenish the stem water storage declaration of

10446,in europe most greenhouse vegetable crops are grown in soil where soilless systems are used apart from in the netherlands belgium and france they are mostly free draining systems in which nutrient solutions are not recirculated both soil grown and free draining soilless systems commonly have large nitrate no3 leaching loss irrigation is a major contributing factor to no3 leaching loss irrigation management of greenhouse vegetable crops needs to be improved to reduce the appreciable n loss to subterranean water and surface water bodies this article reviews the state of the art of methods and tools that are available or are being developed to optimise irrigation management of both soil and soilless grown vegetable crops in greenhouses adaptions for greenhouse conditions and cropping cycles of the fao56 approach to calculate crop water requirements are reviewed attention is paid to i the developments and suitability of various adaptations of the penman monteith fao56 equation and simpler equations to calculate reference crop evapotranspiration eto and ii equations to calculate crop coefficient kc values under greenhouse conditions in which cropping cycles may differ appreciably from those of outdoor crops the various classes of soil substrate moisture sensors that have been used in greenhouse crops are reviewed regarding their general suitability and practical use their use in both soil and substrate is considered as are the effects of salinity and the use of some sensors to measure the salinity of the growing media the use of various plant sensors with vegetable crops under greenhouse conditions is reviewed the results of a survey that assessed for greenhouse vegetable crops in europe the use of different a types of irrigation systems and b irrigation management methods for both soil and soilless production are presented following the revision of this information recommendations are made regarding the scientific and practical value of the available tools and technologies to aid growers to optimise irrigation management of vegetable crops grown in greenhouses keywords bio stimulants crop evapotranspiration grafting irrigation scheduling mulching soilless soil sensors water use efficiency 1 introduction vegetable production in greenhouses is commonly associated with appreciable nitrate no3 leaching and no3 contamination of aquifers thompson et al 2020 vegetable growers are under increasing legislative and social pressure to reduce no3 leaching loss and other nutrient losses to water bodies thompson et al 2020 excessive irrigation is a major contributing factor to no3 leaching quemada et al 2013 optimal irrigation management is a pre requisite to considerably reduce no3 contamination of aquifers from greenhouse vegetable production optimal irrigation management is required to appreciably enhance water productivity or water use efficiency of greenhouse vegetable production this is particularly important considering the increasing scarcity of fresh water resources in many of the zones where european greenhouse vegetable production is concentrated such as in southern europe thompson et al 2020 in the last thirty years the adoption of technical developments has contributed to reduce nutrient leaching loss from european greenhouse vegetable production drip and sprinkler irrigation are now standard techniques their widespread adoption in recent decades has notably reduced the excess irrigation commonly associated with surface irrigation systems similarly the adoption of soilless systems with nutrient solution recirculation in northwest nw europe particularly in the netherlands and belgium has greatly reduced nutrient losses from protected vegetable production sonneveld and voogt 2009 while these technical developments provide a sound infrastructure irrigation of greenhouse vegetable crops at least in southern europe is generally in excess of crop requirements fernández et al 2007 pardossi and incrocci 2011 peña fleitas et al 2013 and is based on the accumulated experience of growers and advisors thompson et al 2007a pardossi and incrocci 2011 effective farmer friendly management methods and tools are required to ensure that irrigation is optimal for the crop specific and site specific requirements of greenhouse grown vegetable crops these methods and tools should inform greenhouse vegetable growers of when to irrigate and of how much irrigation to apply a variety of methods and tools to assist greenhouse vegetable growers have been developed and evaluated in recent years these can be considered as being a indirect methods and b direct methods indirect methods are those based on climate which anticipate irrigation requirements or replenish soil substrate reserves using equations to estimate the atmospheric demand experienced by the crop practical applications are the incorporation of these equations into automatic irrigation controllers simulation models decision support system dsss apps and into publicly available information provided by extension services direct methods involve the measurement of a parameter to assist growers to make decisions or to automate irrigation the most commonly used and researched direct methods are soil and plant sensors and drainage and weighing trays additionally practices such as mulching grafting and the use of biostimulants and beneficial microorganisms de pascale et al 2018 rouphael and colla 2018 may assist in optimising irrigation and reducing drainage volumes despite the considerable scientific activity in recent years in the development of methods and tools to optimise irrigation of greenhouse vegetable crops there has been limited adoption at farm level particularly in southern europe unfortunately there is little detailed statistical information to identify irrigation management practices in commercial greenhouse production throughout europe the exceptions are local regional surveys conducted in almeria in spain fernández et al 2007 garcía garcía et al 2016 thompson et al 2007a greece myriounis et al 2015 and the netherlands voogt et al 2013 the main objective of this review is to provide an overview of scientific studies of the methods and tools available to optimise irrigation in european greenhouse vegetable crops in order to reduce drainage losses which contribute to the contamination of natural water bodies additionally this review reports the results of a survey conducted among technical stakeholders and researchers to understand the degree of implementation of these methods and tools in the most important regions of greenhouse vegetable production in europe while the review is focussed on greenhouse grown vegetable crops it is also relevant to greenhouse grown ornamental crops 2 irrigation systems and irrigation scheduling methods used with vegetable production in european greenhouses to aid this review a survey was conducted of the types of irrigation systems and the irrigation scheduling methods used in european greenhouses the survey was carried out by sending a questionnaire to recognised experts and leading grower organisations of the 13 european countries which in 2013 eurostat 2019 each had more than 1000 ha of greenhouses devoted to the vegetable crop cultivation the objective was to obtain at least two responses for each country responses were obtained from 2 to 4 people in each of 10 countries tables 1 and 2 the results for each country are a synthesis of the answers no data were obtained from romania 2950 ha of vegetable greenhouses germany 1190 ha and bulgaria 1050 ha it is recognised that the answers to the questionnaire are based on a mixture of data and subjective assessment nevertheless they enable a characterisation of the types of irrigation systems and irrigation scheduling methods used and of the clear differences between countries and regions very little quantitative data based on scientifically conducted surveys were available in the few exceptions where data were available they were only for regions such as almeria in spain fernández et al 2007 garcía garcía et al 2016 thompson et al 2007a epirus and western greece in greece myriounis et al 2015 and for the netherlands voogt et al 2013 the total vegetable greenhouse surface area for each country in 2013 table 1 is from eurostat 2019 some suggested corrections from the local experts are indicated in the footnotes eighty three percent of the vegetable greenhouse surface area was located in five countries spain italy france poland and the netherlands and 65 in spain and italy table 1 in the ten european countries surveyed nearly all irrigation to soil grown crops was applied using drip irrigation micro sprinkler or overhead sprinkler table 1 generally with soil grown crops drip irrigation was predominant in fruit vegetable crops and over head and micro sprinkler irrigation systems were used with high density plants per unit area crops such as lettuce and other leafy vegetables in eight of the ten countries surveyed which represented 94 of the surface area surveyed 70 90 of irrigation scheduling was based on the experience of individual growers and or advisors table 1 in all ten countries surveyed only 0 20 of irrigation scheduling was based on the use of tensiometers and other soil moisture sensors in nine of ten countries only 0 10 of irrigation scheduling was based on the estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc the exception was portugal with 30 radiation based methods were used in 0 10 of crops in nine of the ten countries surveyed the exception was the netherlands with 60 this survey demonstrated that for most soil grown crops in european greenhouses irrigation scheduling is based on the experience of growers and or technical advisors and that there is considerable opportunity for the adoption of more science based irrigation scheduling practices such as those reviewed in this paper in almeria three studies fernández et al 2007 thompson et al 2007a peña fleitas et al 2013 compared crop water supply to crop water requirements which was estimated using the prho program gallardo et al 2020 this ratio is known as relative irrigation supply ris these studies suggested that irrigation generally was in excess of crop water requirements i e that ris was 1 per species ris values ranged from 1 0 in melon to 1 6 in cucumber fernández et al 2007 averaged for the whole system the excessive irrigation to soil grown crops was estimated to be 22 peña fleitas et al 2013 there was appreciable variation in ris values for a given species between individual farms fernández et al 2007 thompson et al 2007a there were some general tendencies within crops generally ris values were 2 5 during crop establishment and then progressively declined fernández et al 2007 the variations between individual crops of the same species general excess and tendency to over irrigate early in the crop demonstrated the potential for the use of science based irrigation scheduling methods gallardo et al 2013 of course a minor percentage of leachate was always necessary to control the salinity build up in the soil substrate yasuor et al 2020 soilless culture with nutrient solution recirculation reduces substantially the nutrient loss from vegetable production to adjoining water bodies sonneveld and voogt 2009 in france hungary united kingdom and portugal 30 50 of the greenhouse cropped surface area uses soilless systems and in poland the netherlands and belgium it is 80 95 table 2 however only in france 70 the netherlands 100 and belgium 95 is recirculation widely used in the netherlands recirculation is compulsory van der salm et al 2020 in the other countries surveyed it is 10 or less soilless systems without recirculation can have very large nutrient leaching loss peña fleitas et al 2013 thompson et al 2013a b particularly in areas of southern europe where appreciable drainage fractions are required because of the salinity of irrigation water magán et al 2008 which is commonly groundwater for irrigation scheduling of soilless crops 60 80 of crops in italy france poland greece and hungary are irrigated basing on the experience of the grower and or advisor table 2 methods that either calculate etc or are based on incoming solar radiation are used in 60 95 of crops in the netherlands united kingdom portugal and belgium table 2 demand trays are the predominant method in spain table 2 gallardo et al 2013 see section 7 1 weighing balances are used in 25 of dutch soilless crops see section 4 3 soil substrate moisture sensors including tensiometers are used in 10 15 of soilless crops in spain italy the netherlands and portugal these data demonstrate that there is considerable opportunity to improve irrigation management of soilless grown vegetable crops 3 irrigation scheduling the crop water requirement is the volume of water needed by a crop to maintain maximum rates of crop evapotranspiration etc thereby ensuring that the crop does not suffer water stress technically the water required to maintain etc is the net crop water requirement the gross water requirement includes additional irrigation applied to manage soil substrate salinity if required and to deal with the application uniformity water additional to etc may also be required to deal with plant variation to ensure that no plants are water limited this section will focus on net crop water requirements consideration of water salinity and application uniformity are well described by daliakopoulos et al 2016 and christen et al 2006 commonly in greenhouses with well designed and well maintained drip or sprinkler irrigation systems the high application uniformity effectively avoids the need for extra irrigation to compensate for reduced application uniformity salinity of the cropping media in intensive greenhouse vegetable production can be managed by adjusting irrigation following estimation of pore water electrical conductivity ecp using suction samplers de paz and thompson 2018a or sensors de paz and thompson 2018b see section 5 net crop water requirements for open field crops is generally calculated using the water balance approach allen et al 1998 as the difference between etc and water obtained from rainfall and soil water in greenhouses no rainfall enters and water extraction from the growing media is generally very small because the soil substrate is continuously close to field container capacity because of high frequency drip or sprinkler irrigation consequently it can generally be assumed that crop water requirements of greenhouse grown crops are equivalent to etc irrigation scheduling involves both the volume of each irrigation and the timing or frequency of irrigation as indicated by the survey in section 2 for most greenhouse vegetable crops both irrigation volume and frequency have been based largely on the experience of growers and or technical advisors timer based programmers are commonly used to implement experience based irrigation scheduling conventionally for outdoor crops grown in soil the concept of allowable depletion of soil water guides the determination of when to irrigate allen et al 1998 for greenhouse grown vegetable crops irrigation frequency has traditionally been based on experience of what avoids crop water stress and saturation of the cropping media with the on going increase in pressure on greenhouse vegetable growers to reduce contamination of underlying aquifers and to improve water productivity thompson et al 2020 growers will have to adopt science based approach or approaches to irrigation scheduling the available science based approaches include i the estimation of crop water requirements ii the use of soil substrate sensors and iii use of plant sensors for soilless crops additional systems being used are i balances that measure etc from substrate with growing plants and ii demand tray systems that empirically control substrate water content these methods are reviewed in the subsequent sections 4 estimation of crop evapotranspiration crop evapotranspiration etc can be estimated with indirect climate based methods or direct methods using weighing or drainage lysimeters balances etc de pascale et al 2019 the indirect methods of etc calculation require knowledge of climatic parameters such as solar radiation used to calculate net radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed and of crop parameters such as leaf area index lai and stomatal conductance rs the indirect methods for greenhouses were recently reviewed by katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 these methods can be classified as one step or two step approaches the two step approach involves firstly the estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto and secondly the calculation of etc by multiplying eto by crop coefficient kc values this is known as the fao56 methodology and is fully described by allen et al 1998 in the two step approach eto is the atmospheric demand for water from the crop soil system and the kc values reflect how the crop modulates that demand the one step approach directly calculates etc using a single equation that incorporates both the atmospheric demand and crop modulation components of the two step approach examples of two and one step approaches used to calculate etc of vegetable crops in greenhouses are presented in tables 3a and 3b for the two step approach a dual crop coefficient can alternatively be used in which kc is the sum of two sub coefficients being the basal crop coefficient kcb and the evaporation coefficient ke allen et al 1998 the basal crop coefficient is defined as the ratio of the crop evapotranspiration over the reference evapotranspiration i e etc eto when the soil surface is dry and transpiration is not limited by soil moisture the evaporation coefficient ke represents the amount of evaporation from the soil which depends on the wetted soil fraction for practical irrigation advice of greenhouse grown vegetable crops the single crop coefficient is most commonly used the fao56 penman monteith equation pm eto tables 3a and 3b has been generally recommended as the standard method for estimating eto allen et al 1998 for most crops and cropping systems the kc values to calculate etc are generally obtained from a kc curve based on three kc values one each for initial development midseason and end season periods allen et al 1998 crop coefficient values for each of these periods have been reported for a wide range of agricultural crops allen et al 1998 the suitability of this approach for estimating kc values for greenhouse grown vegetable crops is discussed in section 4 1 the general fao56 approach has been widely used because most users appreciate its simplicity and consider that it has acceptable accuracy pereira et al 2015 the fao56 approach has been incorporated into a variety of computer programs and software used in irrigation scheduling irrigation system design water resources planning and hydrologic modelling pereira et al 2015 gallardo et al 2020 4 1 determination of crop evapotranspiration of soil grown mediterranean greenhouse vegetables crops in this section the focus is on unheated mediterranean plastic greenhouses in south eastern se spain a considerable amount of scientific and technical information has been produced in this region during the last 20 years regarding various aspects of water use and irrigation management of greenhouse grown vegetable crops for these crops the two step approach to estimation of etc has been used inside greenhouses very few studies have measured climatic variables and eto under reference conditions i e within a grass sward evaluation of various equations to estimate eto in plastic greenhouses was conducted by fernández et al 2010 2011 in an unheated plastic greenhouse sown with a perennial grass and equipped with drainage lysimeters a review of the different equations to calculate eto calibrated for plastic mediterranean greenhouses with equation details and relevant calibration factors was conducted by gallardo et al 2013 in the conditions of mediterranean plastic greenhouses the original pm eto equation allen et al 1998 clearly underestimated measured eto fernández et al 2010 this was mostly due to the calculation of aerodynamic resistance ra as a function of air speed in the original pm eto equation air movement inside greenhouses is very low in conditions of natural ventilation much lower than in open field crops in these conditions the aerodynamic resistance function in the original pm eto equation calculates very high resistance values when air speed u2 is close to zero to overcome this fernández et al 2011 proposed the use of a constant ra value of 295 s m 1 during a crop rather than the term ra 208 u2 the proposed constant ra value is equivalent to a greenhouse air speed of 0 7 m s 1 however the use of the pm eto equation with the revised ra value of 295 s m 1 overestimated eto in mediterranean greenhouses during periods of low radiation in winter gallardo et al 2016 and in northwest china qiu et al 2013a a recent comprehensive analysis of the adaptation of the pm eto equation to mediterranean plastic greenhouses identified improvements in the estimation of net longwave radiation inside the greenhouses m d fernández research station of cajamar almeria spain unpublished data calculation of net radiation was appreciably improved by including a multiplicative factor in the net longwave radiation formula that considered daily greenhouse transmission to far infrared radiation with that adaptation and the assumption of an air speed value of 0 5 m s 1 the adapted pm eto equation for mediterranean plastic greenhouses provided good estimates of eto in an unheated greenhouse under a wide range of environmental and crop management conditions m d fernández research station of cajamar almeria spain unpublished data practical application of the pm eto equation requires measured data of solar radiation air temperature and humidity and of wind speed simpler equations with fewer inputs of climatic data are preferable for on farm applications the almeria radiation method fernández et al 2010 tables 3a and 3b calculates daily eto within a greenhouse from external solar radiation and a transmissivity coefficient τ which is the ratio between inside and outside solar radiation of the greenhouse cladding tables 3a and 3b the value of transmissivity in general 55 80 depends on greenhouse construction cladding material structure and management practices used to reduce greenhouse temperature such as shading screens and the application of calcium carbonate suspension also known as whitening or whitewash to the greenhouse roof and walls bonachela et al 2006 fernández et al 2009 2010 gallardo et al 2013 a major advantage of the almeria radiation method is that the calculation of eto and consequently of irrigation requirements considers characteristics of individual greenhouses such as a construction e g cladding material age of plastic structure and b management such as whitewashing and shading due to the consideration of these factors and its simplicity and accuracy the almeria radiation method has been used extensively in almeria for both extension and scientific purposes gallardo et al 2013 the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 tables 3a and 3b requires only measured temperature data another input is a value of extra terrestrial radiation ra which is a function of latitude date and time of day allen et al 1998 when extra terrestrial radiation ra was multiplied by a greenhouse transmissivity coefficient τ this equation accurately estimated eto in mediterranean greenhouses fernández et al 2010 given the limited climatic data required by the almeria radiation method and the hargreaves samani equation and their relative simplicity compared to the pm eto equation tables 3a and 3b these two methods are recommended for practical estimation of eto in plastic greenhouses in mediterranean climatic conditions fernández et al 2010 gallardo et al 2013 there are few measured kc data of greenhouse grown vegetable crops there is appreciable variation in the available kc values for a given species much of this variability can be attributed to differences between individual crops used in these studies because of plant density qiu et al 2013b crop training system orgaz et al 2005 soil mulches peres et al 2013 and cultivar differences peres et al 2013 crop training has a notable influence orgaz et al 2005 vertically supported greenhouse crops generally have higher maximum kc values than for equivalent crops in open fields orgaz et al 2005 in contrast maximum kc values for non supported greenhouse crops are generally similar to values for open field crops the higher maximum kc value of vertically supported greenhouse vegetable crops which usually reach 1 5 2 0 m in height is attributed to their more open canopies resulting from being taller and being regularly pruned the combination of more open canopies with relatively more diffuse radiation inside greenhouses enhances radiation absorption and transpiration orgaz et al 2005 when mulches plastic gravel cover the soil surface and or when the fraction of soil wetted by drip irrigation is relatively small the kc value at the beginning of the crop cycle is approximately 0 2 orgaz et al 2005 peres et al 2013 during the crop development period kc values increase as lai and crop ground cover increase and there are relative increases and decreases in the transpiration and evaporation components respectively of kc once maximum shoot development is reached the kc value remains relatively constant and coincides with kcb during the final period of some vegetable crops in greenhouses a slight decline in kc occurs late season kc which is mostly attributable to a reduction in lai caused by leaf senescence and or by pruning orgaz et al 2005 for greenhouse grown vegetable crops planting dates and the length of the cropping cycle can vary appreciably orgaz et al 2005 gallardo et al 2013 because of this variability the standard fao method of calculating etc using three constant kc values each for a fixed length crop stage allen et al 1998 is not suitable to overcome this in mediterranean greenhouses mathematical models have been developed that estimate daily kc values orgaz et al 2005 gallardo et al 2013 these models calculate kc values as a function of thermal time inside the greenhouse orgaz et al 2005 gallardo et al 2013 one of these models developed for the most commonly grown vegetable species in greenhouses in south eastern se spain was described by orgaz et al 2005 and fernández et al 2009 gallardo et al 2014 2016 developed a kc model based on the fraction of solar radiation intercepted by the canopy which is estimated as a function of thermal time for several greenhouse vegetable crops for se spain gallardo et al 2013 reviewed kc values for mediterranean greenhouses together with a detailed description of kc evolution during crops and of the factors influencing these kc values table 4 4 2 determination of crop evapotranspiration of soilless greenhouse vegetable crops in soilless cropping the amount of available water in the root zone of the substrate is much smaller than that of soil consequently numerous small irrigations are required each day rather than calculations on a daily scale as required for soil grown crops calculations of crop water requirements must be made on a scale of hours or even minutes affordable weather stations that provide accurate climate data on this time scale are commercially available however there are two issues that affect the reliability of the two step fao56 method in soilless cropping firstly the availability of appropriate crop coefficient kc values secondly the fao56 method tends to overestimate the etc of soilless crops presumably because evaporation is negligible in soilless conditions to deal with first issue the cimis 2009 developed a modification of the pm equation for hourly eto etoh calculation tables 3a and 3b a commonly used approach to deal with the overestimation of etc of soilless crop using the fao56 method is the use of modified pm eto equations that directly calculate etc shuttleworth 2007 that is they use a one step rather than two step calculation process to calculate etc to do so the modified pm eto equation incorporated crop terms such as lai and crop stomatal resistance rc in the resulting single step equation rouphael and colla 2004 carmassi et al 2013 as with the standard pm eto equation the modified pm eto equations for direct etc estimation in soilless greenhouse vegetable crops have numerous inputs which can limit their practical application several authors have proposed simplified versions of pm eto equations assuming constant stomatal resistance e g baille et al 1994 carmassi et al 2007a 2013 one of the most used for soilless vegetable crops in the mediterranean environment is baille s equation baille et al 1994 tables 3a and 3b 1 e t c a r n 1 exp k lai λ b lai vpd where a dimensionless and b kg m 2 h 1 kpa 1 are regression coefficients obtained using multiple regression analysis relating the variables r n 1 exp k lai and lai vpd to measured etc the coefficient k is the light extinction coefficient baille s equation has been tested in numerous soilless vegetable and ornamental crops grown in greenhouses in different countries and in different substrates baille et al 1994 rouphael and colla 2004 medrano et al 2005 some of the most relevant studies with the estimated a and b coefficients are reported in table 5 in the greenhouses of the mediterranean area etc is driven by incident solar radiation radiative component therefore the aerodynamic term lai vpd of baille s equation can be excluded without substantial errors in calculated etc thereby providing a considerable simplification of the equation and of the amount of required data carmassi et al 2007a massa et al 2011 the baille s equation and its simplified forms such as equation 2 from carmassi et al 2007a require lai values tables 3a and 3b 2 e t c a r n 1 exp k lai λ b the simplified baille equation of carmassi et al 2007a eq 2 tables 3a and 3b was calibrated in a semi closed soilless system with a tomato crop the values of the a b and k coefficients were 0 946 dimensionless 0 188 l m 2 and 0 69 dimensionless respectively semi closed refers to there being a periodic partial total discharge of the recirculating nutrient solution for tomato carmassi et al 2007a proposed the calculation of lai values as a sigmoidal function of thermal time expressed as growing degree days gdd 3 l a i a 1 a 2 a 1 1 e a 3 g d d a 4 where a1 0 335 a2 4 803 a3 755 3 and a4 134 7 are regression coefficients and where gdd were computed from sowing using a basal temperature of 8 c alternatively tomato leaf area can be estimated as the sum of the area of each leaf using an empirical model based on maximum leaf length and width carmassi et al 2007b in many fruit vegetable crops grown in unheated greenhouses the ratio between etc and r λ λ is the latent heat of vaporisation of water 2 45 mj kg 1 for air temperature of 20 c is almost constant once a stable lai has been reached allen et al 1998 de pascale et al 2019 under these conditions etc can be empirically estimated from exterior solar radiation ro using the following equation 4 e t c a r o τ λ where λ is the latent heat of vaporisation of water τ is the fraction of solar radiation transmitted by the greenhouse cover and α is an a dimensional empirical crop coefficient obtained from a regression of measured etc against the term r τ λ table 6 eq 4 is easy to implement in an irrigation controller since it only requires measurement or knowledge of interior solar radiation in order to calculate the latter the transmissivity coefficient τ of the greenhouse cover must be determined by the grower or an advisor using a portable radiometer the presence or absence of whitewash can have a very large effect on τ which should be measured whenever whitewash is added or partially removed values of τ are an approximate calculation since dust and the age of of plastic affect τ nevertheless any inaccuracy of the estimation of τ will be absorbed into the empirical coefficient α in soilless culture the irrigation and the drainage can be easily measured manually or automatically and these values can be used to adjust daily the global coefficient α τ λ in heated greenhouses of north western nw europe equations that are based only on solar radiation do not accurately simulate etc because the radiative component of heating influences plant transpiration de graaf and van den ende 1981 proposed a simple model for the calculation of hourly etc of row crops in heated greenhouses 5 et c h m a r o τ b 1 1440 min i t t t a where h and m are the actual and maximum heights of the crop a simplified system for estimation of crop lai ro τ is interior solar radiation calculated by external solar radiation and the transmissivity of the greenhouse cover a and b are crop specific coefficients the former related to drainage and the latter to heating and mini is a time interval during the day in which the temperature of the heating pipeline tt is different from air temperature ta the value of b is 0 22 10 4 for tomato and cucumber in dutch growing conditions 4 3 direct measurement of crop evapotranspiration by weighing in these methods etc is continuously measured using load cells of the weight of substrate bags with plants it is assumed that in short periods that changes in measured weight due to plant growth are negligible compared to those due to etc the recent rapid decline in the costs of load cells used for weighing has made this an affordable method for soilless vegetable growers the method is commonly used in the nw european greenhouse industry table 2 for the daily or weekly calibration of the solar radiation based system described above eqs 4 and 5 after each irrigation event the weighing systems record the weight of the combined substrate container plant the user sets a value for maximum allowable weight loss once this occurs a new irrigation event is initiated the net irrigation volume is the weight loss different weighing systems have been used for tomato takaichi et al 1996 cucumber and tomato cropassist helmer et al 2005 and lettuce chen et al 2019 some problems have been encountered with species that are tall or have large canopies where movement of the plant canopy can result in unstable and inaccurate measurement takaichi et al 1996 in recent years improvements in software have appreciably enhanced data processing to estimate instantaneous etc jiménez carvajal et al 2017 weighing systems have been integrated with climate control systems such that they provide warnings when measured transpiration obtained by the weighing system differs notably from the expected etc value calculated from climate data 5 irrigation scheduling based on soil substrate moisture content soil moisture sensors measure either i the soil matric potential smp ψm or ii the volumetric water content vwc θ of soil or substrate for irrigation scheduling in commercial vegetable production the sensors mainly used to measure soil matric potential are tensiometers and granular matrix sensors the vwc sensors most commonly used to assist with irrigation management in vegetable production are the group of dielectric sensors in which measurements are based on the measurement of a soil s dielectric properties detailed reviews on soil moisture sensors in terms of types practical use installation maintenance configuration in cropping media and location within a crop are available in thompson and gallardo 2003 pardossi et al 2009 and gallardo et al 2013 irrigation management with soil water sensors is based on the maintenance of soil substrate moisture between two thresholds being a a lower limit drier value which represents when to start irrigation and b an upper limit wetter value which represents when to stop watering thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 the difference between the two limits gives an indication of the irrigation volume in practice generally only the lower limit is used to initiate irrigation for a predefined time the lower limit that is most commonly used permits depletion of soil water without stressing the plant the upper limit most normally used prevents excessive drainage from the root zone matric potential is a measure of the availability of water to crops and vwc measures the proportion of the soil volume occupied by water matric potential data directly indicate the availability of soil water to the crop the data from matric potential sensors can be easily related to recommended limits to make decisions about irrigation thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 recommended soil matric potential values can generally be applied across various soil types thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 in contrast vwc content data require interpretation to make decisions of irrigation scheduling for a specific site thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 this can be accomplished in various ways the different methods used are interpretation of the dynamics of vwc data thompson et al 2007b by using allowable depletion thompson et al 2007c or by using a soil moisture retention curve to relate established matric potential limits to vwc unlike soil matric potential pre defined limits of vwc can only be applied to identical soil types thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 tensiometers are relatively simple and cheap they have an effective range of 0 to 80 kpa this limited range is a constraint in some cropping systems however this range is generally adequate for greenhouse vegetable crops where soils are maintained at relatively constant moisture levels thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 limits of approximately 40 to 50 kpa have been recommended to avoid the initial onset of plant water stress of greenhouse vegetable species thompson et al 2007c gallardo et al 2013 the use of tensiometers to control irrigation of greenhouse vegetable crops resulted in appreciable reductions in the volumes of applied irrigation and of drainage compared to conventional management granados et al 2013 magán et al 2019 tensiometers are recommended for greenhouse vegetable crops thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 there has been moderate adoption in commercial farming in almeria spain where approximately 15 of growers in soil use them table 1 the requirements for preparation and maintenance have been barriers to more widespread adoption thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 possibly more effective information programs and training of growers will offset these issues granular matrix sensors have a wider measurement range than tensiometers by far the most commonly used is the watermark sensor made by the irrometer company riverside ca usa the watermark sensor overcomes many of the limitations of tensiometers having a wider measurements range of 10 kpa to 200 kpa it requires little preparation and no maintenance once installed thompson et al 2006 gallardo et al 2013 however compared to tensiometers it does not work well in very moist soils e g 10 kpa responds more slowly in rapidly drying soil and is generally somewhat less accurate thompson et al 2006 the watermark sensor is more suited to open field crops than to greenhouse crops where the soil is generally maintained relatively moist thompson et al 2006 gallardo et al 2013 recently adapted dielectric sensors similar to those used for vwc measurement have been developed to measure smp whalley et al 2007 gallardo et al 2013 examples are the smp family of sensors meter pullman wa usa which provide measurement of smp over a very wide working range from 9 to 100 000 kpa and have no maintenance requirements currently there are limited data evaluating these sensors nearly all of the sensors suitable for measurement of vwc in commercial vegetable production determine vwc by previously measuring the dielectric permittivity of the soil substrate surrounding the sensor by subjecting it to an electromagnetic field consequently these sensors are known collectively as dielectric sensors there are four major broad classes of dielectric sensors which use different approaches to estimate dielectric permittivity they are time domain reflectometry tdr frequency domain reflectometry fdr also known as capacitance time domain transmissiometry tdt and amplitude domain reflectometry adr within each broad class of dielectric sensors there can be different formats the various dielectric sensors differ in terms of format general performance accuracy calibration requirements installation requirements and price thompson and gallardo 2003 pardossi et al 2009 gallardo et al 2013 tdr sensors although widely used in research are little used for practical irrigation management because of limitations of cable length from sensors to associated electronic equipment and the difficulties of measuring at depths of 30 cm thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 fdr or capacitance sensors are widely used for irrigation management thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 fdr sensors are the most common class of dielectric sensors for on farm applications thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 they generally have a very wide measurement range they are available in several different configurations e g probes of various centimetres length or rings mounted at various depths on a vertical probe thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 tdt sensors are a simplified and appreciably cheaper adaptation of tdr technology a number of commercially available sensors are suitable for use in greenhouse vegetable crops gallardo et al 2013 many of the available vwc sensors can be used in stand alone mode connected to data loggers or connected directly to irrigation controllers gallardo et al 2013 thompson and gallardo 2003 vwc sensors with frequent measurement and fast response times can be used to automatically initiate and stop irrigation sensitivity to changes in soil salinity has been reported for fdr sensors thompson et al 2007d which can affect their use with vegetable crops where soil salinity may change it has been suggested that fdr sensors with higher operating frequencies are less sensitive to salinity gallardo et al 2013 with time dielectric sensors particularly fdr and tdt sensors are becoming cheaper given that they have no maintenance requirements and that installation is increasingly being simplified they are becoming an increasingly attractive option to vegetable growers pardossi et al 2009 they have been used to reduce the volumes of irrigation and drainage compared to conventional management r b thompson university of almeria unpublished data a number of dielectric sensors have been used effectively with substrate gallardo et al 2013 with some substrates e g perlite the high porosity can affect sensor measurement gallardo et al 2013 the stonewool manufacturer grodan roermond the netherlands produces the grodan grosens multisensor system that measures the water content in their substrates in general matric potential sensors have limited use in substrate table 1 tensiometers are little used in substrate because of their fragility cost and maintenance requirement their use in substrate may increase as more suitably adapted tensiometers become available granular matrix sensor cannot be used in substrate because of the very limited range of matric potential of substrate whalley et al 2007 pardossi et al 2009 some dielectric sensors also provide measurements of the electrical conductivity ec of the surrounding growing medium gallardo et al 2013 incrocci et al 2019 some examples are the wet sensor delta t devices ltd burwell cambridge united kingdom and gs3 ec sensor meter pulman wa usa these ec measurements are of the bulk electrical conductivity ecb of the soil substrate the ecb of the soil substrate is a combined measure of the ec of the water air and soil substrate surrounding the sensor it is not pore water ec ecp which is of most interest for practical salinity management bulk electro conductivity is strongly influenced by the water content of the growing medium gallardo et al 2013 incrocci et al 2009 the hilhorst equation hilhorst 2000 estimates ecp from ecb however it s use is time consuming because it requires measurement at different substrate water contents and there are inconsistent reports of its accuracy a simplified procedure uses a fixed relation between ecp and ecb using ecb values measured at full total available water capacity incrocci et al 2019 despite the limited accuracy of ecp values derived from ecb measurements these measurements enable the monitoring of trends in salinity in soil substrate incrocci et al 2019 possible applications may be automatic adjustment of fertiliser addition to the recirculating nutrient solution and mixing of different water quality sources of different quality to avoid excess salinity affecting crop performance incrocci et al 2019 in general there are two main configurations of installation of soil moisture sensors for irrigation scheduling 1 one sensor located within the maximum concentration of roots 2 two sensors one installed as described above and a second sensor installed at the bottom of the root zone thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 in the latter configuration the deeper sensor serves to ensure that the whole root zone receives water and informs of excessive irrigation the definition of limits for when to initiate and stop irrigation are described in detail by thompson and gallardo 2003 and gallardo et al 2013 an important consideration with soil moisture sensors is the small volume of soil that is measured therefore the depth and location of sensors in relation to emitters is particularly important in localised irrigation these issues are discussed by thompson and gallardo 2003 and gallardo et al 2013 6 irrigation scheduling based on measurement of plant water status plant water status directly influences numerous plant physiological processes affecting crop growth and production theoretically sensitive continuously measured plant water status is an ideal method for decision making in irrigation management of vegetable crops several reviews have described in detail the various plant parameters that directly or indirectly inform of crop water status and can be used to assist with irrigation scheduling jones 2004 fernández 2014 however despite considerable research activity these measurements are rarely used in commercial farming fernández 2014 most of the research work and commercial application to date related to plant water status indicators for irrigation scheduling have been focused on woody species fernández 2014 there has been comparatively little research work and commercial application of these plant water status indicators with herbaceous species the drawbacks of using plant parameters for irrigation scheduling of greenhouse grown vegetable crops are i they only provide information on when to irrigate and not on how much ii they are best suited to low frequency irrigation systems iii the complexity of installation maintenance and calibration of these measurements iv they are demanding in terms of data processing v spatial variability between individual measurements and vi values are strongly affected by climate and growth stage which increases the difficulty of data interpretation and the establishment of threshold values gallardo et al 2006a b 2013 manual direct measurements of stem or leaf water potential have been and are currently used in commercial fruit trees and vines where irrigation is relatively infrequent fereres et al 2003 there are some isolated reports of the use of manual stem leaf water potential measurement with outdoor tomato crop e g campillo et al 2017 however for frequently irrigated vegetable crops in greenhouses the most viable option is the use of continuous and automatically measured indicators of plant water status the plant water status measurements that have been evaluated for irrigation applications with greenhouse grown vegetable crops are i stem diameter variations ii leaf turgor pressure iii transpiration measured with sap flow sensors iv leaf crop canopy temperature and v reflectance indices stem diameter variations sdv measured with linear variable displacement transducer lvdt sensors have been the most researched plant indicator for irrigation scheduling applications during the last 20 years stem diameter sensors measure i the contractions of stem diameter that occur during the day in response to transpiration as maximum daily shrinkage mds and ii daily stem growth rate sgr which is the overall increase in stem diameter between successive days both parameters are very sensitive to water stress fernández and cuevas 2010 there has been extensive research with these sensors in woody crops and some adoption with these crops in commercial farms fernández and cuevas 2010 their sensitivity to detect water stress for irrigation scheduling in tomato sweet pepper and melon grown in plastic mediterranean greenhouses was evaluated by gallardo et al 2006a b these studies demonstrated that relative to established direct measurement of plant water status leaf and stem water potential these sdv parameters were more sensitive indicators of plant water stress in the high evaporative conditions of spring summer and early autumn however they were less sensitive indicators of plant water stress in the low evaporative demand conditions of the cool late autumn to winter period the most suitable sdv parameters to detect water stress in greenhouse vegetable crops were sgr in young plants and the mds in mature tomato plants gallardo et al 2006a b meng et al 2017 confirmed these results working with tomato plants in pots in chinese solar greenhouses the low sensitivity of the sdv under low evaporative conditions in greenhouses late autumn to winter or cloudy days the large variability associated with sdv measurements and the changing relationship of mds stem water potential with the rapid growth of vegetable plants are major issues for irrigation scheduling applications of sdv with greenhouse grown vegetable crops gallardo et al 2006a b a promising tool for determining plant water stress is the zim probe yara international oslo norway a sensor that provides continuous measurements of leaf turgor pressure the sensor consists of two magnets that exert an external pressure to a patch of a leaf covering an area of 87 mm2 one of the two magnets contains a pressure sensor able to measure the difference in pressure between the magnets informing of relative changes in leaf turgor in real time zimmermann et al 2013 martínez gimeno et al 2017 it is necessary to study the turgidity curves for each crop to identify when leaves are stressed also leaf selection is important as for example young leaves can be damaged by the sensor and provide erroneous values sap flow sensors that directly measure plant transpiration have been mostly studied in woody crops because of their high cost and technical complexity they have been mostly used in research with very limited use for irrigation management of vegetable crops the temperature difference between the leaf or crop canopy and the surrounding air is a sensitive indicator of plant water stress jones 2004 temperature measurements are made with infra red thermometers or thermal cameras indicators based on simple mathematical formulae have been proposed for application to irrigation management e g the crop water stress index cwsi for greenhouse crops nikolaou et al 2017 reported a good correlation between leaf temperature and transpiration of soilless cucumber and established a relationship between both using a simplified penman monteith equation crop vegetation indices measured with optical sensors e g canopy reflectance multi and hyper spectral cameras have been used successfully in open field crop for use with irrigation scheduling applications there have been a small number of studies examining the use of vegetation indices for irrigation scheduling of greenhouse vegetable crops ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 identified several vegetation indices to detect water stress in greenhouse bell pepper the photochemical reflectance index pri was the most sensitive the uses and limitations of crop reflectance measurements and of vegetation indices for the assessment of water stress in greenhouse crops was reviewed by katsoulas et al 2016 some companies sell systems to commercial farmers that include plant measurements for irrigation scheduling for example phytech https www phytech com and phytosense http www phytosense net generally these systems use sdv measurements for fruit trees e g the phytec system there is a version of the phytosense system for greenhouse grown vegetable crops in this adaptation of the phytosense system sap flow and sdv data assist farmers to make decisions on the volume and frequency of irrigation however automatic irrigation is not yet possible d de pauw phytosense personal communication currently the phytosense system has about 100 units installed in commercial greenhouses in belgium the netherlands france mexico canada and new zealand in tomato pepper and cucumber crops d de pauw phytosense personal communication as a general observation until now because of the various factors discussed here there has been considerably less adoption of plant sensors than of soil water sensors to assist with irrigation management of all crops and particularly so for greenhouse grown vegetable crops 7 other management practices to reduce contamination of water bodies from greenhouse vegetable crop cultivation 7 1 management of irrigation volumes and drainage in soilless cropping outside of the netherlands belgium and france a large majority of soilless crops are free draining table 2 commonly large drainage and very large no3 leaching losses are associated with free draining soilless crops peña fleitas et al 2013 thompson et al 2013a this is particularly so in southern europe where the moderate salinity of the groundwater commonly used for irrigation requires an appreciable drainage fraction in the mediterranean region commonly drainage fractions of 20 40 are used recirculation of nutrient solutions can dramatically reduce the drainage and no3 leaching loss associated with free draining soilless cultivation this issue is reviewed in detail by massa et al 2020 in soilless greenhouse vegetable production in almeria spain the demand tray system is commonly used to control irrigation frequency in crops with both free drainage and recirculation gallardo et al 2013 this an empirical method that automates frequent irrigation and serves to limit drainage a water level sensor installed in a small water reservoir commonly a tray in which the volume of water and therefore the surface level is in equilibrium with the water content of the substrate when the water level in the reservoir decreases through crop uptake to the physical level of the sensor irrigation is activated the physical height of the sensor is adjusted by the grower on the basis of measured drainage volumes and experience gallardo et al 2013 generally growers using recirculation complement or even replace this method with more scientifically based methods such as radiation based equations weighing balances or substrate sensors j j magán research station of the cajamar almeria spain personal communication 7 2 use of mulching grafting and plant biostimulants practices to reduce water loss in greenhouse vegetable cultivation in addition to use of efficient irrigation system and scientifically based irrigation scheduling practices water losses from the root zone may be achieved by using management practices that permit i a reduction of irrigation frequency by decreasing soil evaporation through soil mulching or ii an increase of the soil volume exploited by the root system through grafting or use of plant biostimulants pbs plastic mulch films are widely adopted in the production of vegetable crops under both open field and greenhouse conditions in vegetable cropping systems the use of mulching is associated with several benefits including i suppression of weeds and consequently of transpiration from the soil ii increasing soil temperature and moisture iii decreasing soil evaporation iv reducing nutrient leaching which in turn may boost crop productivity and wue de pascale et al 2011 bhardwaj 2013 there are three main colours of plastic mulch used in commercial vegetable production black transparent or white with the black mulch commanding most of the market share for vegetables alenazi et al 2015 most of the plastic mulch films are not biodegradable however in the last decade the use of biodegradable films based on natural polymers i e alginate cellulose chitosan glucomannan starch has been on the rise compelled by the growing interest of the vegetable farmers scientists and private industries in the development of eco friendly and efficient biodegradable films based on natural renewable sources adhikari et al 2016 and references cited therein several authors reported that mulching is one of the management practices that can be adopted to increase the wue of fruit and leafy vegetables grown under protected cultivation liang et al 2011 alenazi et al 2015 chen et al 2019 mulching increase the wue both for a reduction of evapotranspiration and for a greater development of the root system in terms of biomass and length leading to an improvement in uptake of water and mineral elements as reported in a recent paper on greenhouse lettuce chen et al 2019 previous authors cumbus and nye 1985 phene et al 1991 reported that crop root characteristics length density and fresh weight were significantly higher under plastic film mulching than under non mulch conditions due to an increase in soil temperature and soil surface water content after mulching vegetable grafting is a propagation method that involves the union of two pieces of living plant tissues scion and rootstock to grow as a single plant in the last three decades grafting has emerged as an efficient and eco friendly approach to quickly improve the efficiency of solanaceous and cucurbits cultivars varieties for tolerance resistance to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses when these are grafted onto specific rootstocks lee et al 2010 kumar et al 2017 kyriacou et al 2017 rouphael et al 2016 2018 different authors reported that grafting application on cucurbits and solanaceous crops might increase wue either because of an increase in net co2 assimilation rate or and a reduction in stomatal conductance and transpiration rate as reported in grafted eggplant khah et al 2011 al harbi et al 2018 another important reason of the best performances of grafted plants with respect to non grafted plants were attributed to the deeper and well developed root system able to increase the soil volume explored by the grafted plants root system ibrahim et al 2014 lopez marin et al 2017 plant biostimulants pbs are products able to stimulate growth and development of crops by an increase of plant nutrition processes independently of the product s nutrient content that include several substances with bioactive properties seaweed and plant extracts humic and fulvic acids protein hydrolysates and silicon as well as some plant growth promoting microorganisms mycorrhizal fungi amf and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr calvo et al 2014 battacharyya et al 2015 canellas et al 2015 rouphael et al 2017 chiaiese et al 2018 rouphael and colla 2018 in general some pbs i e brown macroalgae

physiological increase of the activity of the membrane transporters involved in the absorption of nitrates biosynthesis of chlorophyllous pigments photosynthesis relative water content and leaf water potential traits that were effective to increase the nutrient uptake activity as well as to increase the soil volume exploiting by the root apparatus abd el mageed et al 2017 in zucchini casadesus et al 2019 in tomato in addition to the beneficial role of non microbial pbs wue might also increase with the microbial based biostimulants such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf several authors omirou et al 2013 boyer et al 2015 investigated the inoculation of soil with beneficial microorganisms on increasing wue of greenhouse vegetables when amf plant symbioses are established there are fungal structures growing inside plant roots as well as in the surrounding soil the mycelium grows outside the plant roots and acts as an extension of the root system by increasing the absorption surface area exploring greater soil volumes and increasing the lifespan of absorbing roots smith and read 2008 this permits to increase the available water in the soil thus to reduce the frequency of watering events future research should focus on the selection of a more efficient mycorrhizal fungi and or pgpr species and strains able to increase yield and wue in a sustainable manner 8 conclusion and future perspectives various methods tools and technologies are available to greenhouse vegetable growers to optimise irrigation management by improving irrigation management drainage will be reduced which is fundamental to appreciably reducing no3 leaching loss and subsequent no3 contamination of underlying aquifers from non recirculating greenhouse cultivation in the netherlands and belgium the vast majority of greenhouse vegetable crops are grown in soilless systems using recirculation from which no3 leaching loss is minimal generally these systems use scientifically based irrigation scheduling to prevent hypoxia or water stress total nutrient losses to water bodies are likely to be relatively low from these greenhouses however the survey reported in the current article showed that apart from these countries there was considerable scope for the adoption of scientifically based irrigation management practices that will reduce nutrient losses to water bodies considerable recent advances have been made in the development of equations to estimate eto and kc values in mediterranean greenhouses the development of eto equations enables more accurate calculation and the use of simplified equations enables their application in commercial practice in general these developments in eto and kc calculation when combined with developments in information and communication ict technology will permit the development of user friendly decision support systems dsss to aid vegetable growers and advisors to estimate crop water requirements a range of soil substrate moisture sensors are available with a demonstrated capacity to improve irrigation management and to reduce drainage soil matric potential sensors in particular tensiometers are well suited for greenhouse vegetable production as with the calculation of crop water requirements on going developments in ict will facilitate their application to commercial farming and their adoption by growers plant water status sensors despite their theoretical attractiveness have had very little adoption in their current formats they appear not to be well suited for greenhouse vegetable crops the most promising methods and tools to clearly and rapidly improve irrigation management of vegetable crops in greenhouses are the estimation of crop water requirement with crop models and dsss and the use of soil substrate sensors it is anticipated that developments in ict will facilitate the adoption of both in commercial farming in the coming years declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

10446,in europe most greenhouse vegetable crops are grown in soil where soilless systems are used apart from in the netherlands belgium and france they are mostly free draining systems in which nutrient solutions are not recirculated both soil grown and free draining soilless systems commonly have large nitrate no3 leaching loss irrigation is a major contributing factor to no3 leaching loss irrigation management of greenhouse vegetable crops needs to be improved to reduce the appreciable n loss to subterranean water and surface water bodies this article reviews the state of the art of methods and tools that are available or are being developed to optimise irrigation management of both soil and soilless grown vegetable crops in greenhouses adaptions for greenhouse conditions and cropping cycles of the fao56 approach to calculate crop water requirements are reviewed attention is paid to i the developments and suitability of various adaptations of the penman monteith fao56 equation and simpler equations to calculate reference crop evapotranspiration eto and ii equations to calculate crop coefficient kc values under greenhouse conditions in which cropping cycles may differ appreciably from those of outdoor crops the various classes of soil substrate moisture sensors that have been used in greenhouse crops are reviewed regarding their general suitability and practical use their use in both soil and substrate is considered as are the effects of salinity and the use of some sensors to measure the salinity of the growing media the use of various plant sensors with vegetable crops under greenhouse conditions is reviewed the results of a survey that assessed for greenhouse vegetable crops in europe the use of different a types of irrigation systems and b irrigation management methods for both soil and soilless production are presented following the revision of this information recommendations are made regarding the scientific and practical value of the available tools and technologies to aid growers to optimise irrigation management of vegetable crops grown in greenhouses keywords bio stimulants crop evapotranspiration grafting irrigation scheduling mulching soilless soil sensors water use efficiency 1 introduction vegetable production in greenhouses is commonly associated with appreciable nitrate no3 leaching and no3 contamination of aquifers thompson et al 2020 vegetable growers are under increasing legislative and social pressure to reduce no3 leaching loss and other nutrient losses to water bodies thompson et al 2020 excessive irrigation is a major contributing factor to no3 leaching quemada et al 2013 optimal irrigation management is a pre requisite to considerably reduce no3 contamination of aquifers from greenhouse vegetable production optimal irrigation management is required to appreciably enhance water productivity or water use efficiency of greenhouse vegetable production this is particularly important considering the increasing scarcity of fresh water resources in many of the zones where european greenhouse vegetable production is concentrated such as in southern europe thompson et al 2020 in the last thirty years the adoption of technical developments has contributed to reduce nutrient leaching loss from european greenhouse vegetable production drip and sprinkler irrigation are now standard techniques their widespread adoption in recent decades has notably reduced the excess irrigation commonly associated with surface irrigation systems similarly the adoption of soilless systems with nutrient solution recirculation in northwest nw europe particularly in the netherlands and belgium has greatly reduced nutrient losses from protected vegetable production sonneveld and voogt 2009 while these technical developments provide a sound infrastructure irrigation of greenhouse vegetable crops at least in southern europe is generally in excess of crop requirements fernández et al 2007 pardossi and incrocci 2011 peña fleitas et al 2013 and is based on the accumulated experience of growers and advisors thompson et al 2007a pardossi and incrocci 2011 effective farmer friendly management methods and tools are required to ensure that irrigation is optimal for the crop specific and site specific requirements of greenhouse grown vegetable crops these methods and tools should inform greenhouse vegetable growers of when to irrigate and of how much irrigation to apply a variety of methods and tools to assist greenhouse vegetable growers have been developed and evaluated in recent years these can be considered as being a indirect methods and b direct methods indirect methods are those based on climate which anticipate irrigation requirements or replenish soil substrate reserves using equations to estimate the atmospheric demand experienced by the crop practical applications are the incorporation of these equations into automatic irrigation controllers simulation models decision support system dsss apps and into publicly available information provided by extension services direct methods involve the measurement of a parameter to assist growers to make decisions or to automate irrigation the most commonly used and researched direct methods are soil and plant sensors and drainage and weighing trays additionally practices such as mulching grafting and the use of biostimulants and beneficial microorganisms de pascale et al 2018 rouphael and colla 2018 may assist in optimising irrigation and reducing drainage volumes despite the considerable scientific activity in recent years in the development of methods and tools to optimise irrigation of greenhouse vegetable crops there has been limited adoption at farm level particularly in southern europe unfortunately there is little detailed statistical information to identify irrigation management practices in commercial greenhouse production throughout europe the exceptions are local regional surveys conducted in almeria in spain fernández et al 2007 garcía garcía et al 2016 thompson et al 2007a greece myriounis et al 2015 and the netherlands voogt et al 2013 the main objective of this review is to provide an overview of scientific studies of the methods and tools available to optimise irrigation in european greenhouse vegetable crops in order to reduce drainage losses which contribute to the contamination of natural water bodies additionally this review reports the results of a survey conducted among technical stakeholders and researchers to understand the degree of implementation of these methods and tools in the most important regions of greenhouse vegetable production in europe while the review is focussed on greenhouse grown vegetable crops it is also relevant to greenhouse grown ornamental crops 2 irrigation systems and irrigation scheduling methods used with vegetable production in european greenhouses to aid this review a survey was conducted of the types of irrigation systems and the irrigation scheduling methods used in european greenhouses the survey was carried out by sending a questionnaire to recognised experts and leading grower organisations of the 13 european countries which in 2013 eurostat 2019 each had more than 1000 ha of greenhouses devoted to the vegetable crop cultivation the objective was to obtain at least two responses for each country responses were obtained from 2 to 4 people in each of 10 countries tables 1 and 2 the results for each country are a synthesis of the answers no data were obtained from romania 2950 ha of vegetable greenhouses germany 1190 ha and bulgaria 1050 ha it is recognised that the answers to the questionnaire are based on a mixture of data and subjective assessment nevertheless they enable a characterisation of the types of irrigation systems and irrigation scheduling methods used and of the clear differences between countries and regions very little quantitative data based on scientifically conducted surveys were available in the few exceptions where data were available they were only for regions such as almeria in spain fernández et al 2007 garcía garcía et al 2016 thompson et al 2007a epirus and western greece in greece myriounis et al 2015 and for the netherlands voogt et al 2013 the total vegetable greenhouse surface area for each country in 2013 table 1 is from eurostat 2019 some suggested corrections from the local experts are indicated in the footnotes eighty three percent of the vegetable greenhouse surface area was located in five countries spain italy france poland and the netherlands and 65 in spain and italy table 1 in the ten european countries surveyed nearly all irrigation to soil grown crops was applied using drip irrigation micro sprinkler or overhead sprinkler table 1 generally with soil grown crops drip irrigation was predominant in fruit vegetable crops and over head and micro sprinkler irrigation systems were used with high density plants per unit area crops such as lettuce and other leafy vegetables in eight of the ten countries surveyed which represented 94 of the surface area surveyed 70 90 of irrigation scheduling was based on the experience of individual growers and or advisors table 1 in all ten countries surveyed only 0 20 of irrigation scheduling was based on the use of tensiometers and other soil moisture sensors in nine of ten countries only 0 10 of irrigation scheduling was based on the estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc the exception was portugal with 30 radiation based methods were used in 0 10 of crops in nine of the ten countries surveyed the exception was the netherlands with 60 this survey demonstrated that for most soil grown crops in european greenhouses irrigation scheduling is based on the experience of growers and or technical advisors and that there is considerable opportunity for the adoption of more science based irrigation scheduling practices such as those reviewed in this paper in almeria three studies fernández et al 2007 thompson et al 2007a peña fleitas et al 2013 compared crop water supply to crop water requirements which was estimated using the prho program gallardo et al 2020 this ratio is known as relative irrigation supply ris these studies suggested that irrigation generally was in excess of crop water requirements i e that ris was 1 per species ris values ranged from 1 0 in melon to 1 6 in cucumber fernández et al 2007 averaged for the whole system the excessive irrigation to soil grown crops was estimated to be 22 peña fleitas et al 2013 there was appreciable variation in ris values for a given species between individual farms fernández et al 2007 thompson et al 2007a there were some general tendencies within crops generally ris values were 2 5 during crop establishment and then progressively declined fernández et al 2007 the variations between individual crops of the same species general excess and tendency to over irrigate early in the crop demonstrated the potential for the use of science based irrigation scheduling methods gallardo et al 2013 of course a minor percentage of leachate was always necessary to control the salinity build up in the soil substrate yasuor et al 2020 soilless culture with nutrient solution recirculation reduces substantially the nutrient loss from vegetable production to adjoining water bodies sonneveld and voogt 2009 in france hungary united kingdom and portugal 30 50 of the greenhouse cropped surface area uses soilless systems and in poland the netherlands and belgium it is 80 95 table 2 however only in france 70 the netherlands 100 and belgium 95 is recirculation widely used in the netherlands recirculation is compulsory van der salm et al 2020 in the other countries surveyed it is 10 or less soilless systems without recirculation can have very large nutrient leaching loss peña fleitas et al 2013 thompson et al 2013a b particularly in areas of southern europe where appreciable drainage fractions are required because of the salinity of irrigation water magán et al 2008 which is commonly groundwater for irrigation scheduling of soilless crops 60 80 of crops in italy france poland greece and hungary are irrigated basing on the experience of the grower and or advisor table 2 methods that either calculate etc or are based on incoming solar radiation are used in 60 95 of crops in the netherlands united kingdom portugal and belgium table 2 demand trays are the predominant method in spain table 2 gallardo et al 2013 see section 7 1 weighing balances are used in 25 of dutch soilless crops see section 4 3 soil substrate moisture sensors including tensiometers are used in 10 15 of soilless crops in spain italy the netherlands and portugal these data demonstrate that there is considerable opportunity to improve irrigation management of soilless grown vegetable crops 3 irrigation scheduling the crop water requirement is the volume of water needed by a crop to maintain maximum rates of crop evapotranspiration etc thereby ensuring that the crop does not suffer water stress technically the water required to maintain etc is the net crop water requirement the gross water requirement includes additional irrigation applied to manage soil substrate salinity if required and to deal with the application uniformity water additional to etc may also be required to deal with plant variation to ensure that no plants are water limited this section will focus on net crop water requirements consideration of water salinity and application uniformity are well described by daliakopoulos et al 2016 and christen et al 2006 commonly in greenhouses with well designed and well maintained drip or sprinkler irrigation systems the high application uniformity effectively avoids the need for extra irrigation to compensate for reduced application uniformity salinity of the cropping media in intensive greenhouse vegetable production can be managed by adjusting irrigation following estimation of pore water electrical conductivity ecp using suction samplers de paz and thompson 2018a or sensors de paz and thompson 2018b see section 5 net crop water requirements for open field crops is generally calculated using the water balance approach allen et al 1998 as the difference between etc and water obtained from rainfall and soil water in greenhouses no rainfall enters and water extraction from the growing media is generally very small because the soil substrate is continuously close to field container capacity because of high frequency drip or sprinkler irrigation consequently it can generally be assumed that crop water requirements of greenhouse grown crops are equivalent to etc irrigation scheduling involves both the volume of each irrigation and the timing or frequency of irrigation as indicated by the survey in section 2 for most greenhouse vegetable crops both irrigation volume and frequency have been based largely on the experience of growers and or technical advisors timer based programmers are commonly used to implement experience based irrigation scheduling conventionally for outdoor crops grown in soil the concept of allowable depletion of soil water guides the determination of when to irrigate allen et al 1998 for greenhouse grown vegetable crops irrigation frequency has traditionally been based on experience of what avoids crop water stress and saturation of the cropping media with the on going increase in pressure on greenhouse vegetable growers to reduce contamination of underlying aquifers and to improve water productivity thompson et al 2020 growers will have to adopt science based approach or approaches to irrigation scheduling the available science based approaches include i the estimation of crop water requirements ii the use of soil substrate sensors and iii use of plant sensors for soilless crops additional systems being used are i balances that measure etc from substrate with growing plants and ii demand tray systems that empirically control substrate water content these methods are reviewed in the subsequent sections 4 estimation of crop evapotranspiration crop evapotranspiration etc can be estimated with indirect climate based methods or direct methods using weighing or drainage lysimeters balances etc de pascale et al 2019 the indirect methods of etc calculation require knowledge of climatic parameters such as solar radiation used to calculate net radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed and of crop parameters such as leaf area index lai and stomatal conductance rs the indirect methods for greenhouses were recently reviewed by katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 these methods can be classified as one step or two step approaches the two step approach involves firstly the estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto and secondly the calculation of etc by multiplying eto by crop coefficient kc values this is known as the fao56 methodology and is fully described by allen et al 1998 in the two step approach eto is the atmospheric demand for water from the crop soil system and the kc values reflect how the crop modulates that demand the one step approach directly calculates etc using a single equation that incorporates both the atmospheric demand and crop modulation components of the two step approach examples of two and one step approaches used to calculate etc of vegetable crops in greenhouses are presented in tables 3a and 3b for the two step approach a dual crop coefficient can alternatively be used in which kc is the sum of two sub coefficients being the basal crop coefficient kcb and the evaporation coefficient ke allen et al 1998 the basal crop coefficient is defined as the ratio of the crop evapotranspiration over the reference evapotranspiration i e etc eto when the soil surface is dry and transpiration is not limited by soil moisture the evaporation coefficient ke represents the amount of evaporation from the soil which depends on the wetted soil fraction for practical irrigation advice of greenhouse grown vegetable crops the single crop coefficient is most commonly used the fao56 penman monteith equation pm eto tables 3a and 3b has been generally recommended as the standard method for estimating eto allen et al 1998 for most crops and cropping systems the kc values to calculate etc are generally obtained from a kc curve based on three kc values one each for initial development midseason and end season periods allen et al 1998 crop coefficient values for each of these periods have been reported for a wide range of agricultural crops allen et al 1998 the suitability of this approach for estimating kc values for greenhouse grown vegetable crops is discussed in section 4 1 the general fao56 approach has been widely used because most users appreciate its simplicity and consider that it has acceptable accuracy pereira et al 2015 the fao56 approach has been incorporated into a variety of computer programs and software used in irrigation scheduling irrigation system design water resources planning and hydrologic modelling pereira et al 2015 gallardo et al 2020 4 1 determination of crop evapotranspiration of soil grown mediterranean greenhouse vegetables crops in this section the focus is on unheated mediterranean plastic greenhouses in south eastern se spain a considerable amount of scientific and technical information has been produced in this region during the last 20 years regarding various aspects of water use and irrigation management of greenhouse grown vegetable crops for these crops the two step approach to estimation of etc has been used inside greenhouses very few studies have measured climatic variables and eto under reference conditions i e within a grass sward evaluation of various equations to estimate eto in plastic greenhouses was conducted by fernández et al 2010 2011 in an unheated plastic greenhouse sown with a perennial grass and equipped with drainage lysimeters a review of the different equations to calculate eto calibrated for plastic mediterranean greenhouses with equation details and relevant calibration factors was conducted by gallardo et al 2013 in the conditions of mediterranean plastic greenhouses the original pm eto equation allen et al 1998 clearly underestimated measured eto fernández et al 2010 this was mostly due to the calculation of aerodynamic resistance ra as a function of air speed in the original pm eto equation air movement inside greenhouses is very low in conditions of natural ventilation much lower than in open field crops in these conditions the aerodynamic resistance function in the original pm eto equation calculates very high resistance values when air speed u2 is close to zero to overcome this fernández et al 2011 proposed the use of a constant ra value of 295 s m 1 during a crop rather than the term ra 208 u2 the proposed constant ra value is equivalent to a greenhouse air speed of 0 7 m s 1 however the use of the pm eto equation with the revised ra value of 295 s m 1 overestimated eto in mediterranean greenhouses during periods of low radiation in winter gallardo et al 2016 and in northwest china qiu et al 2013a a recent comprehensive analysis of the adaptation of the pm eto equation to mediterranean plastic greenhouses identified improvements in the estimation of net longwave radiation inside the greenhouses m d fernández research station of cajamar almeria spain unpublished data calculation of net radiation was appreciably improved by including a multiplicative factor in the net longwave radiation formula that considered daily greenhouse transmission to far infrared radiation with that adaptation and the assumption of an air speed value of 0 5 m s 1 the adapted pm eto equation for mediterranean plastic greenhouses provided good estimates of eto in an unheated greenhouse under a wide range of environmental and crop management conditions m d fernández research station of cajamar almeria spain unpublished data practical application of the pm eto equation requires measured data of solar radiation air temperature and humidity and of wind speed simpler equations with fewer inputs of climatic data are preferable for on farm applications the almeria radiation method fernández et al 2010 tables 3a and 3b calculates daily eto within a greenhouse from external solar radiation and a transmissivity coefficient τ which is the ratio between inside and outside solar radiation of the greenhouse cladding tables 3a and 3b the value of transmissivity in general 55 80 depends on greenhouse construction cladding material structure and management practices used to reduce greenhouse temperature such as shading screens and the application of calcium carbonate suspension also known as whitening or whitewash to the greenhouse roof and walls bonachela et al 2006 fernández et al 2009 2010 gallardo et al 2013 a major advantage of the almeria radiation method is that the calculation of eto and consequently of irrigation requirements considers characteristics of individual greenhouses such as a construction e g cladding material age of plastic structure and b management such as whitewashing and shading due to the consideration of these factors and its simplicity and accuracy the almeria radiation method has been used extensively in almeria for both extension and scientific purposes gallardo et al 2013 the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 tables 3a and 3b requires only measured temperature data another input is a value of extra terrestrial radiation ra which is a function of latitude date and time of day allen et al 1998 when extra terrestrial radiation ra was multiplied by a greenhouse transmissivity coefficient τ this equation accurately estimated eto in mediterranean greenhouses fernández et al 2010 given the limited climatic data required by the almeria radiation method and the hargreaves samani equation and their relative simplicity compared to the pm eto equation tables 3a and 3b these two methods are recommended for practical estimation of eto in plastic greenhouses in mediterranean climatic conditions fernández et al 2010 gallardo et al 2013 there are few measured kc data of greenhouse grown vegetable crops there is appreciable variation in the available kc values for a given species much of this variability can be attributed to differences between individual crops used in these studies because of plant density qiu et al 2013b crop training system orgaz et al 2005 soil mulches peres et al 2013 and cultivar differences peres et al 2013 crop training has a notable influence orgaz et al 2005 vertically supported greenhouse crops generally have higher maximum kc values than for equivalent crops in open fields orgaz et al 2005 in contrast maximum kc values for non supported greenhouse crops are generally similar to values for open field crops the higher maximum kc value of vertically supported greenhouse vegetable crops which usually reach 1 5 2 0 m in height is attributed to their more open canopies resulting from being taller and being regularly pruned the combination of more open canopies with relatively more diffuse radiation inside greenhouses enhances radiation absorption and transpiration orgaz et al 2005 when mulches plastic gravel cover the soil surface and or when the fraction of soil wetted by drip irrigation is relatively small the kc value at the beginning of the crop cycle is approximately 0 2 orgaz et al 2005 peres et al 2013 during the crop development period kc values increase as lai and crop ground cover increase and there are relative increases and decreases in the transpiration and evaporation components respectively of kc once maximum shoot development is reached the kc value remains relatively constant and coincides with kcb during the final period of some vegetable crops in greenhouses a slight decline in kc occurs late season kc which is mostly attributable to a reduction in lai caused by leaf senescence and or by pruning orgaz et al 2005 for greenhouse grown vegetable crops planting dates and the length of the cropping cycle can vary appreciably orgaz et al 2005 gallardo et al 2013 because of this variability the standard fao method of calculating etc using three constant kc values each for a fixed length crop stage allen et al 1998 is not suitable to overcome this in mediterranean greenhouses mathematical models have been developed that estimate daily kc values orgaz et al 2005 gallardo et al 2013 these models calculate kc values as a function of thermal time inside the greenhouse orgaz et al 2005 gallardo et al 2013 one of these models developed for the most commonly grown vegetable species in greenhouses in south eastern se spain was described by orgaz et al 2005 and fernández et al 2009 gallardo et al 2014 2016 developed a kc model based on the fraction of solar radiation intercepted by the canopy which is estimated as a function of thermal time for several greenhouse vegetable crops for se spain gallardo et al 2013 reviewed kc values for mediterranean greenhouses together with a detailed description of kc evolution during crops and of the factors influencing these kc values table 4 4 2 determination of crop evapotranspiration of soilless greenhouse vegetable crops in soilless cropping the amount of available water in the root zone of the substrate is much smaller than that of soil consequently numerous small irrigations are required each day rather than calculations on a daily scale as required for soil grown crops calculations of crop water requirements must be made on a scale of hours or even minutes affordable weather stations that provide accurate climate data on this time scale are commercially available however there are two issues that affect the reliability of the two step fao56 method in soilless cropping firstly the availability of appropriate crop coefficient kc values secondly the fao56 method tends to overestimate the etc of soilless crops presumably because evaporation is negligible in soilless conditions to deal with first issue the cimis 2009 developed a modification of the pm equation for hourly eto etoh calculation tables 3a and 3b a commonly used approach to deal with the overestimation of etc of soilless crop using the fao56 method is the use of modified pm eto equations that directly calculate etc shuttleworth 2007 that is they use a one step rather than two step calculation process to calculate etc to do so the modified pm eto equation incorporated crop terms such as lai and crop stomatal resistance rc in the resulting single step equation rouphael and colla 2004 carmassi et al 2013 as with the standard pm eto equation the modified pm eto equations for direct etc estimation in soilless greenhouse vegetable crops have numerous inputs which can limit their practical application several authors have proposed simplified versions of pm eto equations assuming constant stomatal resistance e g baille et al 1994 carmassi et al 2007a 2013 one of the most used for soilless vegetable crops in the mediterranean environment is baille s equation baille et al 1994 tables 3a and 3b 1 e t c a r n 1 exp k lai λ b lai vpd where a dimensionless and b kg m 2 h 1 kpa 1 are regression coefficients obtained using multiple regression analysis relating the variables r n 1 exp k lai and lai vpd to measured etc the coefficient k is the light extinction coefficient baille s equation has been tested in numerous soilless vegetable and ornamental crops grown in greenhouses in different countries and in different substrates baille et al 1994 rouphael and colla 2004 medrano et al 2005 some of the most relevant studies with the estimated a and b coefficients are reported in table 5 in the greenhouses of the mediterranean area etc is driven by incident solar radiation radiative component therefore the aerodynamic term lai vpd of baille s equation can be excluded without substantial errors in calculated etc thereby providing a considerable simplification of the equation and of the amount of required data carmassi et al 2007a massa et al 2011 the baille s equation and its simplified forms such as equation 2 from carmassi et al 2007a require lai values tables 3a and 3b 2 e t c a r n 1 exp k lai λ b the simplified baille equation of carmassi et al 2007a eq 2 tables 3a and 3b was calibrated in a semi closed soilless system with a tomato crop the values of the a b and k coefficients were 0 946 dimensionless 0 188 l m 2 and 0 69 dimensionless respectively semi closed refers to there being a periodic partial total discharge of the recirculating nutrient solution for tomato carmassi et al 2007a proposed the calculation of lai values as a sigmoidal function of thermal time expressed as growing degree days gdd 3 l a i a 1 a 2 a 1 1 e a 3 g d d a 4 where a1 0 335 a2 4 803 a3 755 3 and a4 134 7 are regression coefficients and where gdd were computed from sowing using a basal temperature of 8 c alternatively tomato leaf area can be estimated as the sum of the area of each leaf using an empirical model based on maximum leaf length and width carmassi et al 2007b in many fruit vegetable crops grown in unheated greenhouses the ratio between etc and r λ λ is the latent heat of vaporisation of water 2 45 mj kg 1 for air temperature of 20 c is almost constant once a stable lai has been reached allen et al 1998 de pascale et al 2019 under these conditions etc can be empirically estimated from exterior solar radiation ro using the following equation 4 e t c a r o τ λ where λ is the latent heat of vaporisation of water τ is the fraction of solar radiation transmitted by the greenhouse cover and α is an a dimensional empirical crop coefficient obtained from a regression of measured etc against the term r τ λ table 6 eq 4 is easy to implement in an irrigation controller since it only requires measurement or knowledge of interior solar radiation in order to calculate the latter the transmissivity coefficient τ of the greenhouse cover must be determined by the grower or an advisor using a portable radiometer the presence or absence of whitewash can have a very large effect on τ which should be measured whenever whitewash is added or partially removed values of τ are an approximate calculation since dust and the age of of plastic affect τ nevertheless any inaccuracy of the estimation of τ will be absorbed into the empirical coefficient α in soilless culture the irrigation and the drainage can be easily measured manually or automatically and these values can be used to adjust daily the global coefficient α τ λ in heated greenhouses of north western nw europe equations that are based only on solar radiation do not accurately simulate etc because the radiative component of heating influences plant transpiration de graaf and van den ende 1981 proposed a simple model for the calculation of hourly etc of row crops in heated greenhouses 5 et c h m a r o τ b 1 1440 min i t t t a where h and m are the actual and maximum heights of the crop a simplified system for estimation of crop lai ro τ is interior solar radiation calculated by external solar radiation and the transmissivity of the greenhouse cover a and b are crop specific coefficients the former related to drainage and the latter to heating and mini is a time interval during the day in which the temperature of the heating pipeline tt is different from air temperature ta the value of b is 0 22 10 4 for tomato and cucumber in dutch growing conditions 4 3 direct measurement of crop evapotranspiration by weighing in these methods etc is continuously measured using load cells of the weight of substrate bags with plants it is assumed that in short periods that changes in measured weight due to plant growth are negligible compared to those due to etc the recent rapid decline in the costs of load cells used for weighing has made this an affordable method for soilless vegetable growers the method is commonly used in the nw european greenhouse industry table 2 for the daily or weekly calibration of the solar radiation based system described above eqs 4 and 5 after each irrigation event the weighing systems record the weight of the combined substrate container plant the user sets a value for maximum allowable weight loss once this occurs a new irrigation event is initiated the net irrigation volume is the weight loss different weighing systems have been used for tomato takaichi et al 1996 cucumber and tomato cropassist helmer et al 2005 and lettuce chen et al 2019 some problems have been encountered with species that are tall or have large canopies where movement of the plant canopy can result in unstable and inaccurate measurement takaichi et al 1996 in recent years improvements in software have appreciably enhanced data processing to estimate instantaneous etc jiménez carvajal et al 2017 weighing systems have been integrated with climate control systems such that they provide warnings when measured transpiration obtained by the weighing system differs notably from the expected etc value calculated from climate data 5 irrigation scheduling based on soil substrate moisture content soil moisture sensors measure either i the soil matric potential smp ψm or ii the volumetric water content vwc θ of soil or substrate for irrigation scheduling in commercial vegetable production the sensors mainly used to measure soil matric potential are tensiometers and granular matrix sensors the vwc sensors most commonly used to assist with irrigation management in vegetable production are the group of dielectric sensors in which measurements are based on the measurement of a soil s dielectric properties detailed reviews on soil moisture sensors in terms of types practical use installation maintenance configuration in cropping media and location within a crop are available in thompson and gallardo 2003 pardossi et al 2009 and gallardo et al 2013 irrigation management with soil water sensors is based on the maintenance of soil substrate moisture between two thresholds being a a lower limit drier value which represents when to start irrigation and b an upper limit wetter value which represents when to stop watering thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 the difference between the two limits gives an indication of the irrigation volume in practice generally only the lower limit is used to initiate irrigation for a predefined time the lower limit that is most commonly used permits depletion of soil water without stressing the plant the upper limit most normally used prevents excessive drainage from the root zone matric potential is a measure of the availability of water to crops and vwc measures the proportion of the soil volume occupied by water matric potential data directly indicate the availability of soil water to the crop the data from matric potential sensors can be easily related to recommended limits to make decisions about irrigation thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 recommended soil matric potential values can generally be applied across various soil types thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 in contrast vwc content data require interpretation to make decisions of irrigation scheduling for a specific site thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 this can be accomplished in various ways the different methods used are interpretation of the dynamics of vwc data thompson et al 2007b by using allowable depletion thompson et al 2007c or by using a soil moisture retention curve to relate established matric potential limits to vwc unlike soil matric potential pre defined limits of vwc can only be applied to identical soil types thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 tensiometers are relatively simple and cheap they have an effective range of 0 to 80 kpa this limited range is a constraint in some cropping systems however this range is generally adequate for greenhouse vegetable crops where soils are maintained at relatively constant moisture levels thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 limits of approximately 40 to 50 kpa have been recommended to avoid the initial onset of plant water stress of greenhouse vegetable species thompson et al 2007c gallardo et al 2013 the use of tensiometers to control irrigation of greenhouse vegetable crops resulted in appreciable reductions in the volumes of applied irrigation and of drainage compared to conventional management granados et al 2013 magán et al 2019 tensiometers are recommended for greenhouse vegetable crops thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 there has been moderate adoption in commercial farming in almeria spain where approximately 15 of growers in soil use them table 1 the requirements for preparation and maintenance have been barriers to more widespread adoption thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 possibly more effective information programs and training of growers will offset these issues granular matrix sensors have a wider measurement range than tensiometers by far the most commonly used is the watermark sensor made by the irrometer company riverside ca usa the watermark sensor overcomes many of the limitations of tensiometers having a wider measurements range of 10 kpa to 200 kpa it requires little preparation and no maintenance once installed thompson et al 2006 gallardo et al 2013 however compared to tensiometers it does not work well in very moist soils e g 10 kpa responds more slowly in rapidly drying soil and is generally somewhat less accurate thompson et al 2006 the watermark sensor is more suited to open field crops than to greenhouse crops where the soil is generally maintained relatively moist thompson et al 2006 gallardo et al 2013 recently adapted dielectric sensors similar to those used for vwc measurement have been developed to measure smp whalley et al 2007 gallardo et al 2013 examples are the smp family of sensors meter pullman wa usa which provide measurement of smp over a very wide working range from 9 to 100 000 kpa and have no maintenance requirements currently there are limited data evaluating these sensors nearly all of the sensors suitable for measurement of vwc in commercial vegetable production determine vwc by previously measuring the dielectric permittivity of the soil substrate surrounding the sensor by subjecting it to an electromagnetic field consequently these sensors are known collectively as dielectric sensors there are four major broad classes of dielectric sensors which use different approaches to estimate dielectric permittivity they are time domain reflectometry tdr frequency domain reflectometry fdr also known as capacitance time domain transmissiometry tdt and amplitude domain reflectometry adr within each broad class of dielectric sensors there can be different formats the various dielectric sensors differ in terms of format general performance accuracy calibration requirements installation requirements and price thompson and gallardo 2003 pardossi et al 2009 gallardo et al 2013 tdr sensors although widely used in research are little used for practical irrigation management because of limitations of cable length from sensors to associated electronic equipment and the difficulties of measuring at depths of 30 cm thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 fdr or capacitance sensors are widely used for irrigation management thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 fdr sensors are the most common class of dielectric sensors for on farm applications thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 they generally have a very wide measurement range they are available in several different configurations e g probes of various centimetres length or rings mounted at various depths on a vertical probe thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 tdt sensors are a simplified and appreciably cheaper adaptation of tdr technology a number of commercially available sensors are suitable for use in greenhouse vegetable crops gallardo et al 2013 many of the available vwc sensors can be used in stand alone mode connected to data loggers or connected directly to irrigation controllers gallardo et al 2013 thompson and gallardo 2003 vwc sensors with frequent measurement and fast response times can be used to automatically initiate and stop irrigation sensitivity to changes in soil salinity has been reported for fdr sensors thompson et al 2007d which can affect their use with vegetable crops where soil salinity may change it has been suggested that fdr sensors with higher operating frequencies are less sensitive to salinity gallardo et al 2013 with time dielectric sensors particularly fdr and tdt sensors are becoming cheaper given that they have no maintenance requirements and that installation is increasingly being simplified they are becoming an increasingly attractive option to vegetable growers pardossi et al 2009 they have been used to reduce the volumes of irrigation and drainage compared to conventional management r b thompson university of almeria unpublished data a number of dielectric sensors have been used effectively with substrate gallardo et al 2013 with some substrates e g perlite the high porosity can affect sensor measurement gallardo et al 2013 the stonewool manufacturer grodan roermond the netherlands produces the grodan grosens multisensor system that measures the water content in their substrates in general matric potential sensors have limited use in substrate table 1 tensiometers are little used in substrate because of their fragility cost and maintenance requirement their use in substrate may increase as more suitably adapted tensiometers become available granular matrix sensor cannot be used in substrate because of the very limited range of matric potential of substrate whalley et al 2007 pardossi et al 2009 some dielectric sensors also provide measurements of the electrical conductivity ec of the surrounding growing medium gallardo et al 2013 incrocci et al 2019 some examples are the wet sensor delta t devices ltd burwell cambridge united kingdom and gs3 ec sensor meter pulman wa usa these ec measurements are of the bulk electrical conductivity ecb of the soil substrate the ecb of the soil substrate is a combined measure of the ec of the water air and soil substrate surrounding the sensor it is not pore water ec ecp which is of most interest for practical salinity management bulk electro conductivity is strongly influenced by the water content of the growing medium gallardo et al 2013 incrocci et al 2009 the hilhorst equation hilhorst 2000 estimates ecp from ecb however it s use is time consuming because it requires measurement at different substrate water contents and there are inconsistent reports of its accuracy a simplified procedure uses a fixed relation between ecp and ecb using ecb values measured at full total available water capacity incrocci et al 2019 despite the limited accuracy of ecp values derived from ecb measurements these measurements enable the monitoring of trends in salinity in soil substrate incrocci et al 2019 possible applications may be automatic adjustment of fertiliser addition to the recirculating nutrient solution and mixing of different water quality sources of different quality to avoid excess salinity affecting crop performance incrocci et al 2019 in general there are two main configurations of installation of soil moisture sensors for irrigation scheduling 1 one sensor located within the maximum concentration of roots 2 two sensors one installed as described above and a second sensor installed at the bottom of the root zone thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 in the latter configuration the deeper sensor serves to ensure that the whole root zone receives water and informs of excessive irrigation the definition of limits for when to initiate and stop irrigation are described in detail by thompson and gallardo 2003 and gallardo et al 2013 an important consideration with soil moisture sensors is the small volume of soil that is measured therefore the depth and location of sensors in relation to emitters is particularly important in localised irrigation these issues are discussed by thompson and gallardo 2003 and gallardo et al 2013 6 irrigation scheduling based on measurement of plant water status plant water status directly influences numerous plant physiological processes affecting crop growth and production theoretically sensitive continuously measured plant water status is an ideal method for decision making in irrigation management of vegetable crops several reviews have described in detail the various plant parameters that directly or indirectly inform of crop water status and can be used to assist with irrigation scheduling jones 2004 fernández 2014 however despite considerable research activity these measurements are rarely used in commercial farming fernández 2014 most of the research work and commercial application to date related to plant water status indicators for irrigation scheduling have been focused on woody species fernández 2014 there has been comparatively little research work and commercial application of these plant water status indicators with herbaceous species the drawbacks of using plant parameters for irrigation scheduling of greenhouse grown vegetable crops are i they only provide information on when to irrigate and not on how much ii they are best suited to low frequency irrigation systems iii the complexity of installation maintenance and calibration of these measurements iv they are demanding in terms of data processing v spatial variability between individual measurements and vi values are strongly affected by climate and growth stage which increases the difficulty of data interpretation and the establishment of threshold values gallardo et al 2006a b 2013 manual direct measurements of stem or leaf water potential have been and are currently used in commercial fruit trees and vines where irrigation is relatively infrequent fereres et al 2003 there are some isolated reports of the use of manual stem leaf water potential measurement with outdoor tomato crop e g campillo et al 2017 however for frequently irrigated vegetable crops in greenhouses the most viable option is the use of continuous and automatically measured indicators of plant water status the plant water status measurements that have been evaluated for irrigation applications with greenhouse grown vegetable crops are i stem diameter variations ii leaf turgor pressure iii transpiration measured with sap flow sensors iv leaf crop canopy temperature and v reflectance indices stem diameter variations sdv measured with linear variable displacement transducer lvdt sensors have been the most researched plant indicator for irrigation scheduling applications during the last 20 years stem diameter sensors measure i the contractions of stem diameter that occur during the day in response to transpiration as maximum daily shrinkage mds and ii daily stem growth rate sgr which is the overall increase in stem diameter between successive days both parameters are very sensitive to water stress fernández and cuevas 2010 there has been extensive research with these sensors in woody crops and some adoption with these crops in commercial farms fernández and cuevas 2010 their sensitivity to detect water stress for irrigation scheduling in tomato sweet pepper and melon grown in plastic mediterranean greenhouses was evaluated by gallardo et al 2006a b these studies demonstrated that relative to established direct measurement of plant water status leaf and stem water potential these sdv parameters were more sensitive indicators of plant water stress in the high evaporative conditions of spring summer and early autumn however they were less sensitive indicators of plant water stress in the low evaporative demand conditions of the cool late autumn to winter period the most suitable sdv parameters to detect water stress in greenhouse vegetable crops were sgr in young plants and the mds in mature tomato plants gallardo et al 2006a b meng et al 2017 confirmed these results working with tomato plants in pots in chinese solar greenhouses the low sensitivity of the sdv under low evaporative conditions in greenhouses late autumn to winter or cloudy days the large variability associated with sdv measurements and the changing relationship of mds stem water potential with the rapid growth of vegetable plants are major issues for irrigation scheduling applications of sdv with greenhouse grown vegetable crops gallardo et al 2006a b a promising tool for determining plant water stress is the zim probe yara international oslo norway a sensor that provides continuous measurements of leaf turgor pressure the sensor consists of two magnets that exert an external pressure to a patch of a leaf covering an area of 87 mm2 one of the two magnets contains a pressure sensor able to measure the difference in pressure between the magnets informing of relative changes in leaf turgor in real time zimmermann et al 2013 martínez gimeno et al 2017 it is necessary to study the turgidity curves for each crop to identify when leaves are stressed also leaf selection is important as for example young leaves can be damaged by the sensor and provide erroneous values sap flow sensors that directly measure plant transpiration have been mostly studied in woody crops because of their high cost and technical complexity they have been mostly used in research with very limited use for irrigation management of vegetable crops the temperature difference between the leaf or crop canopy and the surrounding air is a sensitive indicator of plant water stress jones 2004 temperature measurements are made with infra red thermometers or thermal cameras indicators based on simple mathematical formulae have been proposed for application to irrigation management e g the crop water stress index cwsi for greenhouse crops nikolaou et al 2017 reported a good correlation between leaf temperature and transpiration of soilless cucumber and established a relationship between both using a simplified penman monteith equation crop vegetation indices measured with optical sensors e g canopy reflectance multi and hyper spectral cameras have been used successfully in open field crop for use with irrigation scheduling applications there have been a small number of studies examining the use of vegetation indices for irrigation scheduling of greenhouse vegetable crops ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 identified several vegetation indices to detect water stress in greenhouse bell pepper the photochemical reflectance index pri was the most sensitive the uses and limitations of crop reflectance measurements and of vegetation indices for the assessment of water stress in greenhouse crops was reviewed by katsoulas et al 2016 some companies sell systems to commercial farmers that include plant measurements for irrigation scheduling for example phytech https www phytech com and phytosense http www phytosense net generally these systems use sdv measurements for fruit trees e g the phytec system there is a version of the phytosense system for greenhouse grown vegetable crops in this adaptation of the phytosense system sap flow and sdv data assist farmers to make decisions on the volume and frequency of irrigation however automatic irrigation is not yet possible d de pauw phytosense personal communication currently the phytosense system has about 100 units installed in commercial greenhouses in belgium the netherlands france mexico canada and new zealand in tomato pepper and cucumber crops d de pauw phytosense personal communication as a general observation until now because of the various factors discussed here there has been considerably less adoption of plant sensors than of soil water sensors to assist with irrigation management of all crops and particularly so for greenhouse grown vegetable crops 7 other management practices to reduce contamination of water bodies from greenhouse vegetable crop cultivation 7 1 management of irrigation volumes and drainage in soilless cropping outside of the netherlands belgium and france a large majority of soilless crops are free draining table 2 commonly large drainage and very large no3 leaching losses are associated with free draining soilless crops peña fleitas et al 2013 thompson et al 2013a this is particularly so in southern europe where the moderate salinity of the groundwater commonly used for irrigation requires an appreciable drainage fraction in the mediterranean region commonly drainage fractions of 20 40 are used recirculation of nutrient solutions can dramatically reduce the drainage and no3 leaching loss associated with free draining soilless cultivation this issue is reviewed in detail by massa et al 2020 in soilless greenhouse vegetable production in almeria spain the demand tray system is commonly used to control irrigation frequency in crops with both free drainage and recirculation gallardo et al 2013 this an empirical method that automates frequent irrigation and serves to limit drainage a water level sensor installed in a small water reservoir commonly a tray in which the volume of water and therefore the surface level is in equilibrium with the water content of the substrate when the water level in the reservoir decreases through crop uptake to the physical level of the sensor irrigation is activated the physical height of the sensor is adjusted by the grower on the basis of measured drainage volumes and experience gallardo et al 2013 generally growers using recirculation complement or even replace this method with more scientifically based methods such as radiation based equations weighing balances or substrate sensors j j magán research station of the cajamar almeria spain personal communication 7 2 use of mulching grafting and plant biostimulants practices to reduce water loss in greenhouse vegetable cultivation in addition to use of efficient irrigation system and scientifically based irrigation scheduling practices water losses from the root zone may be achieved by using management practices that permit i a reduction of irrigation frequency by decreasing soil evaporation through soil mulching or ii an increase of the soil volume exploited by the root system through grafting or use of plant biostimulants pbs plastic mulch films are widely adopted in the production of vegetable crops under both open field and greenhouse conditions in vegetable cropping systems the use of mulching is associated with several benefits including i suppression of weeds and consequently of transpiration from the soil ii increasing soil temperature and moisture iii decreasing soil evaporation iv reducing nutrient leaching which in turn may boost crop productivity and wue de pascale et al 2011 bhardwaj 2013 there are three main colours of plastic mulch used in commercial vegetable production black transparent or white with the black mulch commanding most of the market share for vegetables alenazi et al 2015 most of the plastic mulch films are not biodegradable however in the last decade the use of biodegradable films based on natural polymers i e alginate cellulose chitosan glucomannan starch has been on the rise compelled by the growing interest of the vegetable farmers scientists and private industries in the development of eco friendly and efficient biodegradable films based on natural renewable sources adhikari et al 2016 and references cited therein several authors reported that mulching is one of the management practices that can be adopted to increase the wue of fruit and leafy vegetables grown under protected cultivation liang et al 2011 alenazi et al 2015 chen et al 2019 mulching increase the wue both for a reduction of evapotranspiration and for a greater development of the root system in terms of biomass and length leading to an improvement in uptake of water and mineral elements as reported in a recent paper on greenhouse lettuce chen et al 2019 previous authors cumbus and nye 1985 phene et al 1991 reported that crop root characteristics length density and fresh weight were significantly higher under plastic film mulching than under non mulch conditions due to an increase in soil temperature and soil surface water content after mulching vegetable grafting is a propagation method that involves the union of two pieces of living plant tissues scion and rootstock to grow as a single plant in the last three decades grafting has emerged as an efficient and eco friendly approach to quickly improve the efficiency of solanaceous and cucurbits cultivars varieties for tolerance resistance to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses when these are grafted onto specific rootstocks lee et al 2010 kumar et al 2017 kyriacou et al 2017 rouphael et al 2016 2018 different authors reported that grafting application on cucurbits and solanaceous crops might increase wue either because of an increase in net co2 assimilation rate or and a reduction in stomatal conductance and transpiration rate as reported in grafted eggplant khah et al 2011 al harbi et al 2018 another important reason of the best performances of grafted plants with respect to non grafted plants were attributed to the deeper and well developed root system able to increase the soil volume explored by the grafted plants root system ibrahim et al 2014 lopez marin et al 2017 plant biostimulants pbs are products able to stimulate growth and development of crops by an increase of plant nutrition processes independently of the product s nutrient content that include several substances with bioactive properties seaweed and plant extracts humic and fulvic acids protein hydrolysates and silicon as well as some plant growth promoting microorganisms mycorrhizal fungi amf and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr calvo et al 2014 battacharyya et al 2015 canellas et al 2015 rouphael et al 2017 chiaiese et al 2018 rouphael and colla 2018 in general some pbs i e brown macroalgae extracts animal based protein hydrolysate extract as foliar spray or as soil substrate drench increased several morphological higher root grown branching leaf area fresh and dry biomass production and physiological increase of the activity of the membrane transporters involved in the absorption of nitrates biosynthesis of chlorophyllous pigments photosynthesis relative water content and leaf water potential traits that were effective to increase the nutrient uptake activity as well as to increase the soil volume exploiting by the root apparatus abd el mageed et al 2017 in zucchini casadesus et al 2019 in tomato in addition to the beneficial role of non microbial pbs wue might also increase with the microbial based biostimulants such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf several authors omirou et al 2013 boyer et al 2015 investigated the inoculation of soil with beneficial microorganisms on increasing wue of greenhouse vegetables when amf plant symbioses are established there are fungal structures growing inside plant roots as well as in the surrounding soil the mycelium grows outside the plant roots and acts as an extension of the root system by increasing the absorption surface area exploring greater soil volumes and increasing the lifespan of absorbing roots smith and read 2008 this permits to increase the available water in the soil thus to reduce the frequency of watering events future research should focus on the selection of a more efficient mycorrhizal fungi and or pgpr species and strains able to increase yield and wue in a sustainable manner 8 conclusion and future perspectives various methods tools and technologies are available to greenhouse vegetable growers to optimise irrigation management by improving irrigation management drainage will be reduced which is fundamental to appreciably reducing no3 leaching loss and subsequent no3 contamination of underlying aquifers from non recirculating greenhouse cultivation in the netherlands and belgium the vast majority of greenhouse vegetable crops are grown in soilless systems using recirculation from which no3 leaching loss is minimal generally these systems use scientifically based irrigation scheduling to prevent hypoxia or water stress total nutrient losses to water bodies are likely to be relatively low from these greenhouses however the survey reported in the current article showed that apart from these countries there was considerable scope for the adoption of scientifically based irrigation management practices that will reduce nutrient losses to water bodies considerable recent advances have been made in the development of equations to estimate eto and kc values in mediterranean greenhouses the development of eto equations enables more accurate calculation and the use of simplified equations enables their application in commercial practice in general these developments in eto and kc calculation when combined with developments in information and communication ict technology will permit the development of user friendly decision support systems dsss to aid vegetable growers and advisors to estimate crop water requirements a range of soil substrate moisture sensors are available with a demonstrated capacity to improve irrigation management and to reduce drainage soil matric potential sensors in particular tensiometers are well suited for greenhouse vegetable production as with the calculation of crop water requirements on going developments in ict will facilitate their application to commercial farming and their adoption by growers plant water status sensors despite their theoretical attractiveness have had very little adoption in their current formats they appear not to be well suited for greenhouse vegetable crops the most promising methods and tools to clearly and rapidly improve irrigation management of vegetable crops in greenhouses are the estimation of crop water requirement with crop models and dsss and the use of soil substrate sensors it is anticipated that developments in ict will facilitate the adoption of both in commercial farming in the coming years declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we would like to thank very much the

10447,a major challenge in wheat triticum aestivum l production is the optimization of yields and resource use efficiency using a data assimilation approach based on 126 studies performed in china between 1980 and 2018 this study quantified how water and nitrogen n inputs affect wheat yields 1332 observations water productivity wpc 648 and fertiliser n use efficiency nuef 299 the interactive effects of soil nutrients e g initial concentrations of n phosphorus and potassium climate conditions temperature and precipitation and management practices water and n input and irrigation method were also examined the mean wheat yield wpc and nuef were 6 5 1 9 t ha 1 1 8 0 5 kg m 3 and 30 5 12 6 kg kg 1 respectively the input of water increased wheat yield wpc and nuef only when the input amounts were less than 295 104 and 378 mm respectively input of n increased wheat yields and wpc until n inputs were greater than 226 and 342 kg ha 1 respectively additionally variable partitioning analysis suggested that management practices climate parameters and soil properties alone explained 24 26 and 26 of the variation of the response ratio effect size between the treatment and control for yield rr y wpc rr wpc and nuef rr nuef respectively specifically the initial soil n and potassium concentrations critically affected rr y rr wpc and rr nuef rr y and rr nuef were negatively correlated with mean annual temperature therefore this study will be helpful for large scale modelling or design of water and or n management practices to improve wheat yield wpc and nuef keywords efficiency evapotranspiration irrigation nitrogen 1 introduction water and nitrogen n are two key limiting factors in crop production raun and johnson 1999 cossani and sadras 2018 2019 concerns are increasing as a consequence of rising fertilizer costs and the negative ecological and environmental impacts caused by its overuse raun and johnson 1999 ladha et al 2005 despite ongoing breeding efforts to develop cultivars latshaw et al 2016 with high water productivity wpc yield per unit water evapotranspiration kijne et al 2003 fernández et al 2020 and fertiliser n use efficiency nuef yield per unit fertiliser n applied dobermann 2007 developing and adopting optimal management practices to increase the yield wpc and nuef of wheat triticum aestivum l could have large impacts on improving global agronomic environmental sustainability as well as securing the future food supply of the increasing global population tilman et al 2011 li et al 2019 breeding high wpc varieties and adoption of optimal water management practices are two of the most important factors for achieving high wheat production particularly in water limiting environments amir et al 1991 qiu et al 2008 fan et al 2018 studies have been performed to optimize the wpc of wheat through soil mulching or irrigation scheduling qin et al 2015 fan et al 2018 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 reported that the global mean value of water productivity for wheat was 1 09 kg m 3 with a large range of 0 6 to 1 7 kg m 3 this variability indicates that wheat yield is greatly affected by environmental managerial heterogeneity and that the underlying interactive mechanisms among factors affecting wpc of wheat are complex zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 qin et al 2015 for example wang et al 2016 reported that wpc of wheat is greatly affected by seasonal weather conditions such as precipitation variation likewise planting pattern and irrigation methods quantity could significantly impact wpc of wheat wang et al 2014a therefore there is clear value in the synthesis of findings using systematic data analysis approaches across large spatial or temporal scales to address this area well known for the high n concentrations of its grain wheat depends heavily on n fertilization for successful yields raun and johnson 1999 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 however over fertilization in conjunction with unfavourable environmental conditions e g prolonged drought flooding and poor drainage have resulted in low nuef leaching volatilization denitrification and subsequent negative environmental issues tilman et al 2011 lollato et al 2019 sidhu et al 2019 ladha et al 2016 reported that on average 18 of global n fertilizer is used in wheat production with 50 year averages of 52 kg ha 1 yr 1 however the overall nuef of major cereal crops is lower than 33 raun and johnson 1999 which was recognized as one of the most informative factors impacting grain yield for example based on 55 published studies over the world a synthesis study indicated that changes in wheat grain yield in response to n uptake could be accurately explained by an exponential model de oliveira silva et al 2020a also a synthesis of long term experiments in oklahoma usa found that wheat yield was positively associated with n removal and nuef lollato et al 2019 interacting and confounding factors can result in extreme complexity in optimizing the availability of both water and n for wheat cultivation zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 ladha et al 2005 sidhu et al 2019 the majority of previous research has either focused on a single factor analysis i e n or water based on blocked field trials rathore et al 2017 sandhu et al 2019 sidhu et al 2019 or synthesized results from a limited number of locations across broad spatial and temporal scales lollato et al 2019 however to gain a holistic understanding of wheat yield and resource use efficiency in responses to water and n management practices across a broad array of environmental and ecological conditions requires carefully designed systematic quantitative analysis e g savin et al 2019 de oliveira silva et al 2020a therefore the current study aimed to i identify the effects of water and or n input on wheat yield wpc and nuef and ii assess the role of soil nutrients and management practices in affecting wheat yield wpc and nuef we hypothesize that wheat yield wpc and nuef can be greatly affected by interactions between n and water input and different environmental conditions can dramatically affect the intensity and consequences of these inputs we assume a series of important ecophysiological thresholds and indices that can be identified which could be used by producers as references or guidelines for managing wheat production in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region china one of the most populated counties in the world faces enormous challenges to ensure food security amidst limited resources while coping with negative ecological and economic impacts raun and johnson 1999 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 china is also a leading wheat producing country globally according to faostat 2017 china s wheat cultivation area 24 million hectares ha ranked the third right behind india 31 million ha and the european union 27 million ha in 2014 therefore there is a pressing need for improving wheat yield and production input use efficiency to better sustain the fast growing population nationally 2 2 literature search and data collection peer reviewed published journal articles from 1980 to 2018 were searched for using the isi web of science and china s knowledge resource integrated database with the following keywords wheat water and or nitrogen evapotranspiration irrigation or fertilization to exclude sources not relevant to our study two criteria were used 1 wheat yield water and n input were explicitly reported based on more than two replicate of field plots located in china 2 water and n management practices irrigation and or n fertilizer application were included as treatments if a study used more than one level of water and or n input at the same site the study separately paired different levels of treatments with a control treatment i e without irrigation and or n fertilizer application subsequently measured yield wpc and nuef were extracted from figures using get data graph digitizer version 2 24 as well as from tables and texts afterwards standard deviations sd were used for data quality control 99 of values were observed to be less than three standard deviations 3 sd away from their respective means table s1 ultimately 1322 yield 646 wpc and 299 nuef observations were collected from each study conducted in china see details in the supplementary material including the list of studies used for the meta analysis and relevant basic information in addition we extracted supporting information from 126 studies on soil properties soil texture and initial soil nutrient concentrations climatic conditions mean annual temperature mat and mean annual precipitation map and irrigation methods in particular mat values were used to generate an aridity index ai which was calculated with the equation ai map mat 10 de martonne 1926 croitoru et al 2013 the ai values of 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 correspond to arid or semi arid semi humid and humid environments respectively de martonne 1926 croitoru et al 2013 the data were also grouped by soil texture i e sandy silty loamy or clayey li et al 2019 total evapotranspiration et was calculated based on eq 1 section 2 3 1 using grain yield data divided by water productivity according to the reported values from each study 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 definitions water productivity wpc kg m 3 was calculated as grain yield y kg ha 1 divided by the total evapotranspiration et mm kijne et al 2003 fernández et al 2020 1 wpc y e t fertiliser nitrogen use efficiency nuef kg kg 1 was similarly defined as the grain yield y divided by the total amount of fertilizer n applied n kg ha 1 hereafter total n input dobermann 2007 2 nuef y n other n inputs including those from atmospheric deposition e g reactive n bio fixation and other n sources were not considered as their quantity was likely relatively small and unreported in most studies 2 3 2 overview of wheat yields water and n input et wpc and nuef the ggplot2 package wickham 2016 for the r programming environment r development core team 2018 was used to visualize the frequency distributions of wheat yields water and n inputs et wpc and nuef with a gaussian function luo et al 2006 afterwards data were grouped according to the ai soil texture and irrigation method see section 2 1 box plots were constructed and comparisons were conducted with t tests using the ggplot2 package to illustrate the distributions of wheat yields water and n inputs et wpc and nuef for the above groups statistical clustering which is a process by which objects are partitioned into clusters such that units within the same cluster have similar characteristics konopka 2020 was used to identify threshold values of water and n input instead of drawing statistical inferences from these clusters clustering assigns data points i e yield wpc or nuef corresponding to groups as responding positively negatively or neutrally to inputs of water or n such that each group is internally coherent and different from the others the ksharp package can adjust existing clustering using a general interface for this purpose along with several distinct algorithms thus enabling increased contrasts between cluster groups by sharpening existing clustering konopka 2020 in our study threshold values of water or n inputs indicate thresholds below which yield wpc and nuef increase or decline and above which yield wpc and nuef conversely decline or increase additionally yield wpc and nuef were plotted as functions of water and n inputs a piecewise linear regression model with a critical limiting value which can be described with two straight lines that intersect at a threshold value sadras and milroy 1996 was fitted using the segmented package muggeo 2008 in the r statistical programming environment r development core team 2018 piecewise linear regression models vary with the boundary line approach that assumed independent variables i e water and n input are the only factors limiting the dependent variable i e yield wpc and nuef lewandowski and schmidt 2006 andrade and satorre 2015 cossani and sadras 2018 however the poor model fit did occur as a consequence of variability in the data fig s1 additionally we also used a classic saturation curve fitting on the water or n inputs and yield wpc and nuef but involved subjectivity and uncertainty also we performed non parametric curve fitting techniques such as support vector machines svm and artificial neural networks ann which yielded significant data overfitting 2 3 3 estimating the mean effects from multiple independent variables the effect size of water and n inputs on yield rr y wpc rr wpc and rr nuef which did differ in numbers of data pairs were estimated using the natural logarithm of the response ratio rr hedges et al 1999 for each study according to the formula 3 r r y ln y t y c ln y t ln y c where y t is the observed yield under irrigation and or n fertilizer application in a specific year of a study and y c is the yield without irrigation and or n fertilizer application similarly rr wpc and rr nuef were estimated for each study as 4 r r wpc ln wp t wp co ln w p t ln w p co 5 r r nuef ln n u e t n u e c ln n u e t ln n u e c where wp t and nue t are the observed wpc and nuef values under irrigation and or n fertilizer application in a specific year of a study and wp co and nue c are the wpc and nuef values without irrigation and or n fertilizer application in the current study observations with and without n and or water inputs indicate actual and attainable yields wpc and nue respectively using the vegan package oksanen et al 2007 in the r statistical programming environment r development core team 2018 variable partitioning analysis vpa was used to analyze the effects of

wpc and rr nuef to identify the importance of variables affecting rr y rr wpc and rr nuef a nonparametric method using the randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 in the r programming environment r

with wpc or nuef 3 results 3 1 overview of wheat yields water and n inputs et wpc and nuef studies included in the current study spanned various climatic regions and used different wheat cultivars and

climate conditions irrigation methods and soil textures indicated that increased water input did not consistently affect yield wpc or nuef of wheat fig 3 a c threshold intervals of total water input for yield wpc and nuef were 300 320 300 310 and 310 325 mm respectively similarly increased n input did not consistently affect yield wpc or nuef of wheat fig 3d f threshold intervals of total n input for yield wpc and nuef were 180 200 180 185 and 180 200 kg ha 1 respectively 3 3 estimating the mean effects from multiple independent variables results of vpa suggested that management practices climate parameters and soil properties explained 96 91 and 97 of the variation in rr y rr wpc and rr nuef respectively table 1 overall soil properties explained most of the variation whereas climate parameters contributed the least specifically soil properties explained 50 of the variation in rr y table 1 followed by management practices 26 and interactions between managerial practices and soil properties 26 whereas the climate parameters only explained 2 soil properties contributed the most to the variance in rr wpc 42 table 1 in contrast management practices explained 26 while climate parameters only explained 1 variation of rr wpc soil properties explained the most variation in rr nuef 48 table 1 climate parameters explained little variation with management practices and climate explaining 26 and 23 of the variation respectively fig 4 depicts the importance of variables in affecting rr y rr wpc and rr nuef initial nutrient concentrations including an ap ak and total water input were the four most important variables associated with changes in rr y followed by mat soil texture and irrigation method fig 4a initial nutrient concentrations including an ak total water input and mat were the four most important variables associated with changes in rr wpc followed by ap and soc fig 4b initial nutrients concentrations including an ak tn ap and soc were the five most important variables associated with changes in rr nuef with mat following closely behind the other five factors fig 4c the mixed effects model identified negative correlations between an or soc and rr y and between an and rr wpc while there was a positive correlation between an and rr nuef p 0 05 table 2 a negative correlation was observed between ap and rr y and between soc and rr y or rr nuef p 0 001 both rr wpc and rr nuef were positively correlated with ak p 0 001 among climate conditions mat was negatively correlated with rr wpc and rr nuef p 0 001 however no significant individual or interaction effects i e w n or w n for rr y rr wpc and rr nuef were observed 4 discussion in this study we summarized china s wheat yield wpc and nuef revealing that average wheat yield wpc and nuef between 1980 and 2018 were higher than the global average but varied widely faostat 2017 reported that wheat yield was 3 5 t ha 1 wpc was 0 8 kg m 3 in the main wheat production areas sadras and angus 2004 while nuef was 18 1 kg kg 1 ladha et al 2005 in 2017 indeed wheat yield and resource use efficiency have stably increased in china from the late 1990s onward reaching well above the global average in the present day huang et al 2015 it is well known that the inputs of water or n do not consistently increase yields wpc or nuef and that additional inputs beyond threshold values can result in reduced efficiency and productivity musick et al 1994 lollato and edwards 2015 savin et al 2019 de oliveira silva et al 2020a fernández et al 2020 thresholds quantified in the current study might be useful baselines for large scale modelling or design of water and or n management strategies to improve wpc nuef and wheat yield the thresholds of water might be slightly different by sites or regions for example based on the meteorological datasets in the north china plain from 1980 to 2012 using the simplified water balance model a study reported that the multi year average of irrigation was 341 mm for the wheat wu et al 2019 therefore areas dominated by rain fed agriculture with less than 300 320 mm of annual precipitation should be aware of annual variation of precipitation and use water supplementation measures to reduce risk of yield loss caused by drought on the other hand irrigated wheat systems should avoid over irrigation to conserve water and enhance overall wpc thresholds of n input in the current study are in line with other studies a synthesis of field experiments in the north china plain reported that 98 of maximum yield occurred when the n application rate was 185 kg ha 1 which could be considered as the n threshold wang et al 2017 likewise the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china recommended n application rate for wheat production was 179 228 kg ha 1 in 2013 huang et al 2015 thus based on the thresholds of n input models e g denitrification decomposition dndc agricultural production systems simulator apsim can estimate the environmental risks of n application and further determine optimal water or n inputs at critical wheat growth stages wang et al 2017 bai et al 2020 the negative effect of n on nuef might be attributed to greater losses e g leaching volatilization etc of n at higher levels rathore et al 2017 on the other hand wheat nuef can be greatly affected by soil water content which itself significantly affects n availability and n uptake by plants ashraf et al 2016 in turn n supply can increase wpc by enhancing wheat biomass musick et al 1994 lollato and edwards 2015 thapa et al 2019 which is usually positively correlated to grain yield in dry environments de oliveira silva et al 2020b previous studies have shown that the addition of n in n limited soils can increase wpc amir et al 1991 qiu et al 2008 cossani and sadras 2018 regressions between the inputs of resources i e water and n and production indexes i e yield wpc and nuef revealed significant linear relationships however some of the r 2 values in such previous studies have been quite low 0 02 0 09 fig s1 this suggests that there are threshold values for the effects of water and or n inputs on wheat production however the fundamental mechanisms affecting wheat yield wpc and nuef are considerably integrated into more environmental and management factors beyond water and n inputs alone additionally we did not compare the identified thresholds for specific sites or individual studies as the main purpose of this study was to identify n water response patterns generalize broader conclusions across broad spatial and temporal scales and suggest potential mechanisms and interactive pathways among various exogenous factors that could guide future research as indicated in our results continuous increases in water or n inputs did not consistently increase yield wpc and nuef because of the effects of other environmental and or managerial practices or interactions impacting productivity and resource use efficiency lu et al 2017 cossani and sadras 2018 2019 lollato et al 2019 in particular we found that soil properties such as soil texture soil nutrient content e g n p k and soil organic carbon content were more important than climate including temperature and precipitation or water n management practices in determining the actual yield wpc and nuef table 1 the highlighted importance of soil related indices agreed well with prior findings for example soil texture can largely affect soil water characteristics such as water holding and transmission characteristics and the availability of water to plants saxton and rawls 2006 daryanto et al 2016 while soil texture also affects soil thermal conductivity lu et al 2014 thus altering the soil microclimate for supporting microorganisms which could greatly affect growth and nutrient water uptake of wheat coleman et al 2017 and other plant physical traits wang et al 2014b as our results showed yield and wpc in clayey soils were higher than other soil textures the potential explanation is that relative to loamy and sandy soils clayey soils often have greater water holding capacity low potential for leaching and smaller permeability usda nrcs 1996 jalota et al 2010 resulting in greater water availability for crop production these effects can be very pronounced in many wheat production areas in china because the climate in these areas are usually water limiting limited irrigation sources and or precipitation moreover initial soil nutrients such as available n and k concentrations were vital for narrowing the actual and attainable yields wpc and nuef fig 4 and table 2 and clayey soils often have higher nutrient concentrations usda nrcs 1996 in turn improving crop growth and increasing wpc the importance of initial k and p can be explained by the low apparent recovery of applied k and p fertilizer for cereal crops which are about 16 and 19 respectively while co application of k and p improves n recovery and use efficiency duncan et al 2018 lollato et al 2019 for example a study analysed 33 long term rice wheat experiments in asia and suggested that k depletion in the soil as one of the significant reasons for cereal yield stagnation and low nutrient use efficiency and the fertilizer k rates used were generally not sufficient to sustain a neutral k input output balance ladha et al 2003 likewise a study of synthesis of long term experiments reported that the co application of p and k increased wheat yield and nuef lollato et al 2019 following soil properties climate conditions played the next most critical role in increasing attainable wheat production and use efficiency of water and n the response of yield wpc and nuef varied among climate regions fig 2 mainly corresponding to differences in average temperatures as have previously been shown van ittersum and rabbinge 1997 li et al 2019 the current study also found negative correlations between mat and rr y or rr nuef table 2 this is critical in interpreting the effects of climate change chiefly global warming on wheat production using boundary function analysis andrade and satorre 2015 reported that the maximum yields for wheat were typically found at moderate mat values high mat values caused physiological stresses that led to leaf curling stomatal closure reduced growing cycle length and reduction of photosynthetic rate wang et al 2014b eventually reducing yield and wpc additionally high night time temperatures had significant impacts on increasing respiration cost and shortening grain filling duration in wheat peng et al 2004 the negative effects of high temperatures on wheat yield have been largely explored for other semi arid and sub humid regions of the globe lollato et al 2017 dreccer et al 2018 lollato et al 2020 therefore breeding for mid early maturation as well as adjusting sowing dates are likely necessary the correlation between climate regions and yield however should be interpreted with caution because of the use of mat instead of mean growing season temperature in the calculation growing season temperature variation or heat unit accumulation might be a better predictor for crop production mubeen et al 2016 but these data were unavailable in most studies included in the current study interestingly water and n management practices were less important factors affecting wheat yield wpc and nuef in the present study however rather than being affected by total water and n applied wheat production was more affected by methods of irrigation fig 4 our findings agree with many previous studies which have shown that surface irrigation resulted in inefficient use of both irrigation water and applied n sandhu et al 2019 and that drip or sprinkler irrigation not only saves water but increases nuef and yield decreased water usage and increases in wheat yield and water productivity have been reported for drip irrigation previously chen et al 2015 crop yields have been reported to be higher under drip irrigation than surface irrigation sandhu et al 2019 higher wpc with drip irrigation compared to furrow irrigation mainly results from the reduction in water losses to percolation and evaporation chen et al 2015 our research was restricted by data availability and the selected spatial distribution of the selected studies specifically all observations considered in the current study were limited to china thus broader interpretations should be made with caution certainly the results of the current study still offer a wide scope of potential interpretation as china spans a broad array of soil types and climate conditions in other words the results of this nation level meta analysis could provide regional and even global interpretations and these results thus still have broad application additionally our selection criteria mainly focused on n and water inputs and disregarded interactions with other management practices including mulching tillage practices and crop rotation at the meantime inputs of n and or water and mat during important phases of wheat growth should be accurately quantified to properly model productivity and agro ecological services on a systemic basis mubeen et al 2016 a portion of the studies in our dataset provided et but insufficient data size impeded the calculation of aridity indexes which are better indicators for interpreting the effect of rainfall distribution on post flowering water stress we are aware of the importance of the various phases in wheat growth however our study is badly limited owing to a paucity of such data thus a regional or global study using high resolution exogenous data to investigate the effects of inputs of n and or water as well as mat during important phases of wheat growth on wheat yields wpc and nuef is warranted 5 conclusions based on a national dataset collected across a broad temporal and spatial scale the current study quantified threshold values of water and n inputs affecting wheat yield wpc and nuef moreover we found that soil properties such as soil texture soil nutrients e g n p k and soil organic carbon concentrations were more important than climatic factors including temperature and precipitation or water n management practices in narrowing the gaps between the actual and attainable yields wpc and nuef in wheat initial soil n and k concentrations were more important than other soil properties those identified threshold values i e levels of water and n and key drivers i e soil properties controlling wheat yields and resource use efficiency will potentially be helpful for large scale modelling or developing water and or n management strategies that improve production and sustainability of wheat cultivation declaration of competing interest

10447,a major challenge in wheat triticum aestivum l production is the optimization of yields and resource use efficiency using a data assimilation approach based on 126 studies performed in china between 1980 and 2018 this study quantified how water and nitrogen n inputs affect wheat yields 1332 observations water productivity wpc 648 and fertiliser n use efficiency nuef 299 the interactive effects of soil nutrients e g initial concentrations of n phosphorus and potassium climate conditions temperature and precipitation and management practices water and n input and irrigation method were also examined the mean wheat yield wpc and nuef were 6 5 1 9 t ha 1 1 8 0 5 kg m 3 and 30 5 12 6 kg kg 1 respectively the input of water increased wheat yield wpc and nuef only when the input amounts were less than 295 104 and 378 mm respectively input of n increased wheat yields and wpc until n inputs were greater than 226 and 342 kg ha 1 respectively additionally variable partitioning analysis suggested that management practices climate parameters and soil properties alone explained 24 26 and 26 of the variation of the response ratio effect size between the treatment and control for yield rr y wpc rr wpc and nuef rr nuef respectively specifically the initial soil n and potassium concentrations critically affected rr y rr wpc and rr nuef rr y and rr nuef were negatively correlated with mean annual temperature therefore this study will be helpful for large scale modelling or design of water and or n management practices to improve wheat yield wpc and nuef keywords efficiency evapotranspiration irrigation nitrogen 1 introduction water and nitrogen n are two key limiting factors in crop production raun and johnson 1999 cossani and sadras 2018 2019 concerns are increasing as a consequence of rising fertilizer costs and the negative ecological and environmental impacts caused by its overuse raun and johnson 1999 ladha et al 2005 despite ongoing breeding

yield per unit fertiliser n applied dobermann 2007 developing and adopting optimal management practices to increase the yield wpc and nuef of wheat triticum aestivum l could have large impacts on improving global agronomic environmental sustainability as well as securing the future food supply of the increasing global population tilman et al 2011 li et al 2019 breeding high wpc varieties and adoption of optimal water management practices are two of the most important factors for achieving high wheat production particularly in water limiting environments amir et al 1991 qiu et al 2008 fan et al 2018 studies have been performed to optimize the wpc of wheat through soil mulching or irrigation scheduling qin et al 2015 fan et al 2018 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 reported that the global mean value of water productivity for wheat was 1 09 kg m 3 with a large range of 0 6 to 1 7 kg m 3 this variability indicates that wheat yield is greatly affected by environmental managerial heterogeneity and that the underlying interactive mechanisms among factors affecting wpc of wheat are complex zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 qin et al 2015 for example wang et al 2016 reported that wpc of wheat is greatly affected by seasonal weather conditions such as precipitation variation likewise planting pattern and irrigation methods quantity could significantly impact wpc of wheat wang et al 2014a therefore there is clear value in the synthesis of findings using systematic data analysis approaches across large spatial or temporal scales to address this area well known for the high n concentrations of its grain wheat depends heavily on n fertilization for successful yields raun and johnson 1999 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 however over fertilization in conjunction with unfavourable environmental conditions e g prolonged drought flooding and poor drainage have resulted in low nuef leaching volatilization denitrification and subsequent negative environmental issues tilman et al 2011 lollato et al 2019 sidhu et al 2019 ladha et al 2016 reported that on average 18 of global n fertilizer is used in wheat production with 50 year averages of 52 kg ha 1 yr 1 however the overall nuef of major cereal crops is lower than 33 raun and johnson 1999 which was recognized as one of the most informative factors impacting grain yield for example based on 55 published studies over the world a synthesis study indicated that changes in wheat grain yield in response to n uptake could be accurately explained by an exponential model de oliveira silva et al 2020a also a synthesis of long term experiments in oklahoma usa found that wheat yield was positively associated with n removal and nuef lollato et al 2019 interacting and confounding factors can result in extreme complexity in optimizing the availability of both water and n for wheat cultivation zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 ladha et al 2005 sidhu et al 2019 the majority of previous research has either focused on a single factor analysis i e n or water based on blocked field trials rathore et al 2017 sandhu et al 2019 sidhu et al 2019 or synthesized results from a limited number of locations across broad spatial and temporal scales lollato et al 2019 however to gain a holistic understanding of wheat yield and resource use efficiency in responses to water and n management practices across a broad array of environmental and ecological conditions requires carefully designed systematic quantitative analysis e g savin et al 2019 de oliveira silva et al 2020a therefore the current study aimed to i identify the effects of water and or n input on wheat yield wpc and nuef and ii assess the role of soil nutrients and management practices in affecting wheat yield wpc and nuef we hypothesize that wheat yield wpc and nuef can be greatly affected by interactions between n and water input and different environmental conditions can dramatically affect the intensity and consequences of these inputs we assume a series of important ecophysiological thresholds and indices that can be identified which could be used by producers as references or guidelines for managing wheat production in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region china one of the most populated counties in the world faces enormous challenges to ensure food security amidst limited resources while coping with negative ecological and economic impacts raun and johnson 1999 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 china is also a leading wheat producing country globally according to faostat 2017 china s wheat cultivation area 24 million hectares ha ranked the third right behind india 31 million ha and the european union 27 million ha in 2014 therefore there is a pressing need for improving wheat yield and production input use efficiency to better sustain the fast growing population nationally 2 2 literature search and data collection peer reviewed published journal articles from 1980 to 2018 were searched for using the isi web of science and china s knowledge resource integrated database with the following keywords wheat water and or nitrogen evapotranspiration irrigation or fertilization to exclude sources not relevant to our study two criteria were used 1 wheat yield water and n input were explicitly reported based on more than two replicate of field plots located in china 2 water and n management practices irrigation and or n fertilizer application were included as treatments if a study used more than one level of water and or n input at the same site the study separately paired different levels of treatments with a control treatment i e without irrigation and or n fertilizer application subsequently measured yield wpc and nuef were extracted from figures using get data graph digitizer version 2 24 as well as from tables and texts afterwards standard deviations sd were used for data quality control 99 of values were observed to be less than three standard deviations 3 sd away from their respective means table s1 ultimately 1322 yield 646 wpc and 299 nuef observations were collected from each study conducted in china see details in the supplementary material including the list of studies used for the meta analysis and relevant basic information in addition we extracted supporting information from 126 studies on soil properties soil texture and initial soil nutrient concentrations climatic conditions mean annual temperature mat and mean annual precipitation map and irrigation methods in particular mat values were used to generate an aridity index ai which was calculated with the equation ai map mat 10 de martonne 1926 croitoru et al 2013 the ai values of 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 correspond to arid or semi arid semi humid and humid environments respectively de martonne 1926 croitoru et al 2013 the data were also grouped by soil texture i e sandy silty loamy or clayey li et al 2019 total evapotranspiration et was calculated based on eq 1 section 2 3 1 using grain yield data divided by water productivity according to the reported values from each study 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 definitions water productivity wpc kg m 3 was calculated as grain yield y kg ha 1 divided by the total evapotranspiration et mm kijne et al 2003 fernández et al 2020 1 wpc y e t fertiliser nitrogen use efficiency nuef kg kg 1 was similarly defined as the grain yield y divided by the total amount of fertilizer n applied n kg ha 1 hereafter total n input dobermann 2007 2 nuef y n other n inputs including those from atmospheric deposition e g reactive n bio fixation and other n sources were not considered as their quantity was likely relatively small and unreported in most studies 2 3 2 overview of wheat yields water and n input et wpc and nuef the ggplot2 package wickham 2016 for the r programming environment r development core team 2018 was used to visualize the frequency distributions of wheat yields water and n inputs et wpc and nuef with a gaussian function luo et al 2006 afterwards data were grouped according to the ai soil texture and irrigation method see section 2 1 box plots were constructed and comparisons were conducted with t tests using the ggplot2 package to illustrate the distributions of wheat yields water and n inputs et wpc and nuef for the above groups statistical clustering which is a process by which objects are partitioned into clusters such that units within the same cluster have similar characteristics konopka 2020 was used to identify threshold values of water and n input instead of drawing statistical inferences from these clusters clustering assigns data points i e yield wpc or nuef corresponding to groups as responding positively negatively or neutrally to inputs of water or n such that each group is internally coherent and different from the others the ksharp package can adjust existing clustering using a general interface for this purpose along with several distinct algorithms thus enabling increased contrasts between cluster groups by sharpening existing clustering konopka 2020 in our study threshold values of water or n inputs indicate thresholds below which yield wpc and nuef increase or decline and above which yield wpc and nuef conversely decline or increase additionally yield wpc and nuef were plotted as functions of water and n inputs a piecewise linear regression model with a critical limiting value which can be described with two straight lines that intersect at a threshold value sadras and milroy 1996 was fitted using the segmented package muggeo 2008 in the r statistical programming environment r development core team 2018 piecewise linear regression models vary with the boundary line approach that assumed independent variables i e water and n input are the only factors limiting the dependent variable i e yield wpc and nuef lewandowski and schmidt 2006 andrade and satorre 2015 cossani and sadras 2018 however the poor model fit did occur as a consequence of variability in the data fig s1 additionally we also used a classic saturation curve fitting on the water or n inputs and yield wpc and nuef but involved subjectivity and uncertainty also we performed non parametric curve fitting techniques such as support vector machines svm and artificial neural networks ann which yielded significant data overfitting 2 3 3 estimating the mean effects from multiple independent variables the effect size of water and n inputs on yield rr y wpc rr wpc and rr nuef which did differ in numbers of data pairs were estimated using the natural logarithm of the response ratio rr hedges et al 1999 for each study according to the formula 3 r r y ln y t y c ln y t ln y c where y t is the observed yield under irrigation and or n fertilizer application in a specific year of a study and y c is the yield without irrigation and or n fertilizer application similarly rr wpc and rr nuef were estimated for each study as 4 r r wpc ln wp t wp co ln w p t ln w p co 5 r r nuef ln n u e t n u e c ln n u e t ln n u e c where wp t and nue t are the observed wpc and nuef values under irrigation and or n fertilizer application in a specific year of a study and wp co and nue c are the wpc and nuef values without irrigation and or n fertilizer application in the current study observations with and without n and or water inputs indicate actual and attainable yields wpc and nue respectively using the vegan package oksanen et al 2007 in the r statistical programming environment r development core team 2018 variable partitioning analysis vpa was used to analyze the effects of

wpc and rr nuef to identify the importance of variables affecting rr y rr wpc and rr nuef a nonparametric method using the randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 in the r programming environment r

with wpc or nuef 3 results 3 1 overview of wheat yields water and n inputs et wpc and nuef studies included in the current study spanned various climatic regions and used different wheat cultivars and planting densities thus total water input total n input et wheat yield wpc and nuef all varied greatly fig 1 total water input rain irrigation ranged between 89 and 685 mm across all observations with

climate conditions irrigation methods and soil textures indicated that increased water input did not consistently affect yield wpc or nuef of wheat fig 3 a c threshold intervals of total water input for yield wpc and nuef were 300 320 300 310 and 310 325 mm respectively similarly increased n input did not consistently affect yield wpc or nuef of wheat fig 3d f threshold intervals of total n input for yield wpc and nuef were 180 200 180 185 and 180 200 kg ha 1 respectively 3 3 estimating the mean effects from multiple independent variables results of vpa suggested that management practices climate parameters and soil properties explained 96 91 and 97 of the variation in rr y rr wpc and rr nuef respectively table 1 overall soil properties explained most of the variation whereas climate parameters contributed the least specifically soil properties explained 50 of the variation in rr y table 1 followed by management practices 26 and interactions between managerial practices and soil properties 26 whereas the climate parameters only explained 2 soil properties contributed the most to the variance in rr wpc 42 table 1 in contrast management practices explained 26 while climate parameters only explained 1 variation of rr wpc soil properties explained the most variation in rr nuef 48 table 1 climate parameters explained little variation with management practices and climate explaining 26 and 23 of the variation respectively fig 4 depicts the importance of variables in affecting rr y rr wpc and rr nuef initial nutrient concentrations including an ap ak and total water input were the four most important variables associated with changes in rr y followed by mat soil texture and irrigation method fig 4a initial nutrient concentrations including an ak total water input and mat were the four most important variables associated with changes in rr wpc followed by ap and soc fig 4b initial nutrients concentrations including an ak tn ap and soc were the five most important variables associated with changes in rr nuef with mat following closely behind the other five factors fig 4c the mixed effects model identified negative correlations between an or soc and rr

001 both rr wpc and rr nuef were positively correlated with ak p 0 001 among climate conditions mat was negatively correlated with rr wpc and rr nuef p 0 001 however no significant individual or interaction effects i e w n or w n for rr y rr wpc and rr nuef were observed 4 discussion in this study we summarized china s wheat yield wpc and nuef revealing that average wheat yield wpc and nuef between 1980 and 2018 were higher than the global average but varied widely faostat 2017 reported that wheat yield was 3 5 t ha 1 wpc was 0 8 kg m 3 in the main wheat production areas sadras and angus 2004 while nuef was 18 1 kg kg 1 ladha et al 2005 in 2017 indeed wheat yield and resource use efficiency have stably increased in china from the late 1990s onward reaching well above the global average in the present day huang et al 2015 it is well known that the inputs of water or n do not consistently increase yields wpc or nuef and that additional inputs beyond threshold values can result in reduced efficiency and productivity musick et al 1994 lollato and edwards 2015 savin et al 2019 de oliveira silva et al 2020a fernández et al 2020 thresholds quantified in the current study might be useful baselines for large scale modelling or design of water and or n management strategies to improve wpc nuef and wheat yield the thresholds of water might be slightly different by sites or regions for example based on the meteorological datasets in the north china plain from 1980 to 2012 using the simplified water balance model a study reported that the multi year average of irrigation was 341 mm for the wheat wu et al 2019 therefore areas dominated by rain fed agriculture with less than 300 320 mm of annual precipitation should be aware of annual variation of precipitation and use water supplementation measures to reduce risk of yield loss caused by drought on the other hand irrigated wheat systems should avoid over irrigation to conserve water and enhance overall wpc thresholds of n input in the current study are in line with other studies a synthesis of field experiments in the north china plain reported that 98 of maximum yield occurred when the n application rate was 185 kg ha 1 which could be considered as the n threshold wang et al 2017 likewise the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china recommended n application rate for wheat production was 179 228 kg ha 1 in 2013 huang et al 2015 thus based on the thresholds of n input models e g denitrification decomposition dndc agricultural production systems simulator apsim can estimate the environmental risks of n application and further determine optimal water or n inputs at critical wheat growth stages wang et al 2017 bai et al 2020 the negative effect of n on nuef might be attributed to greater losses e g leaching volatilization etc of n at higher levels rathore et al 2017 on the other hand wheat nuef can be greatly affected by soil water content which itself significantly affects n availability and n uptake by plants ashraf et al 2016 in turn n supply can increase wpc by enhancing wheat biomass musick et al 1994 lollato and edwards 2015 thapa et al 2019 which is usually positively correlated to grain yield in dry environments de oliveira silva et al 2020b previous studies have shown that the addition of n in n limited soils can increase wpc amir et al 1991 qiu et al 2008 cossani and sadras 2018 regressions between the inputs of resources i e water and n and production indexes i e yield wpc and nuef revealed significant linear relationships however some of the r 2 values in such previous studies have been quite low 0 02 0 09 fig s1 this suggests that there are threshold values for the effects of water and or n inputs on wheat production however the fundamental mechanisms affecting wheat yield wpc and nuef are considerably integrated into more environmental and management factors beyond water and n inputs alone additionally we did not compare the identified thresholds for specific sites or individual studies as the main purpose of this study was to identify n water response patterns generalize broader conclusions across broad spatial and temporal scales and suggest potential mechanisms and interactive pathways among various exogenous factors that could guide future research as indicated in our results continuous increases in water or n inputs did not consistently increase yield wpc and nuef because of the effects of other environmental and or managerial practices or interactions impacting productivity and resource use efficiency lu et al 2017 cossani and sadras 2018 2019 lollato et al 2019 in particular we found that soil properties such as soil texture soil nutrient content e g n p k and soil organic carbon content were more important than climate including temperature and precipitation or water n management practices in determining the actual yield wpc and nuef table 1 the highlighted importance of soil related indices agreed well with prior findings for example soil texture can largely affect soil water characteristics such as water holding and transmission characteristics and the availability of water to plants saxton and rawls 2006 daryanto et al 2016 while soil texture also affects soil thermal conductivity lu et al 2014 thus altering the soil microclimate for supporting microorganisms which could greatly affect growth and nutrient water uptake of wheat coleman et al 2017 and other plant physical traits wang et al 2014b as our results showed yield and wpc in clayey soils were higher than other soil textures the potential explanation is that relative to loamy and sandy soils clayey soils often have greater water holding capacity low potential for leaching and smaller permeability usda nrcs 1996 jalota et al 2010 resulting in greater water availability for crop production these effects can be very pronounced in many wheat production areas in china because the climate in these areas are usually water limiting limited irrigation sources and or precipitation moreover initial soil nutrients such as available n and k concentrations were vital for narrowing the actual and attainable yields wpc and nuef fig 4 and table 2 and clayey soils often have higher nutrient concentrations usda nrcs 1996 in turn improving crop growth and increasing wpc the importance of initial k and p can be explained by the low apparent recovery of applied k and p fertilizer for cereal crops which are about 16 and 19 respectively while co application of k and p improves n recovery and use efficiency duncan et al 2018 lollato et al 2019 for example a study analysed 33 long term rice wheat experiments in asia and suggested that k depletion in the soil as one of the significant reasons for cereal yield stagnation and low nutrient use efficiency and the fertilizer k rates used were generally not sufficient to sustain a neutral k input output balance ladha et al 2003 likewise a study of synthesis of long term experiments reported that the co application of p and k increased wheat yield and nuef lollato et al 2019 following soil properties climate conditions played the next most critical role in increasing attainable wheat production and use efficiency of water and n the response of yield wpc and nuef varied among climate regions fig 2 mainly corresponding to differences in average temperatures as have previously been shown van ittersum and rabbinge 1997 li et al 2019 the current study also found negative correlations between mat and rr y or rr nuef table 2 this is critical in interpreting the effects of climate change chiefly global warming on wheat production using boundary function analysis andrade and satorre 2015 reported that the maximum yields for wheat were typically found at moderate mat values high mat values caused physiological stresses that led to leaf curling stomatal closure reduced growing cycle length and reduction of photosynthetic rate wang et al 2014b eventually reducing yield and wpc additionally high night time temperatures had significant impacts on increasing respiration cost and shortening grain filling duration in wheat peng et al 2004 the negative effects of high temperatures on wheat yield have been largely explored for other semi arid and sub humid regions of the globe lollato et al 2017 dreccer et al 2018 lollato et al 2020 therefore breeding for mid early maturation as well as adjusting sowing dates are likely necessary the correlation between climate regions and yield however should be interpreted with caution because of the use of mat instead of mean growing season temperature in the calculation growing season temperature variation or heat unit accumulation might be a better predictor for crop production mubeen et al 2016 but these data were unavailable in most studies included in the current study interestingly water and n management practices were less important factors affecting wheat yield wpc and nuef in the present study however rather than being affected by total water and n applied wheat production was more affected by methods of irrigation fig 4 our findings agree with many previous studies which have shown that surface irrigation resulted in inefficient use of both irrigation water and applied n sandhu et al 2019 and that drip or sprinkler irrigation not only saves water but increases nuef and yield decreased water usage and increases in wheat yield and water productivity have been reported for drip irrigation previously chen et al 2015 crop yields have been reported to be higher under drip irrigation than surface irrigation sandhu et al 2019 higher wpc with drip irrigation compared to furrow irrigation mainly results from the reduction in water losses to percolation and evaporation chen et al 2015 our research was restricted by data availability and the selected spatial distribution of the selected studies specifically all observations considered in the current study were limited to china thus broader interpretations should be made with caution certainly the results of the current study still offer a wide scope of potential interpretation as china spans a broad array of soil types and climate conditions in other words the results of this nation level meta analysis could provide regional and even global interpretations and these results thus still have broad application additionally our selection criteria mainly focused on n and water inputs and disregarded interactions with other management practices including mulching tillage practices and crop rotation at the meantime inputs of n and or water and mat during important phases of wheat growth should be accurately quantified to properly model productivity and agro ecological services on a systemic basis mubeen et al 2016 a portion of the studies in our dataset provided et but insufficient data size impeded the calculation of aridity indexes which are better indicators for interpreting the effect of rainfall distribution on post flowering water stress we are aware of the importance of the various phases in wheat growth however our study is badly limited owing to a paucity of such data thus a regional or global study using high resolution exogenous data to investigate the effects of inputs of n and or water as well as mat during important phases of wheat growth on wheat yields wpc and nuef is warranted 5 conclusions based on a national dataset collected across a broad temporal and spatial scale the current study quantified threshold values of water and n inputs affecting wheat yield wpc and nuef moreover we found that soil properties such as soil texture soil nutrients e g n p k and soil organic carbon concentrations were more important than climatic factors including temperature and precipitation or water n management practices in narrowing the gaps between the actual and attainable yields wpc and nuef in wheat initial soil n and k concentrations were more important than other soil properties those identified threshold values i e levels of water and n and key drivers i e soil properties controlling wheat yields and resource use efficiency will potentially be helpful for large scale modelling or developing water and or n management strategies that improve production and sustainability of wheat cultivation declaration of competing interest

10448,this study assessed the quality of gridded weather data for calculating reference evapotranspiration etref which by definition represents a near maximum et occurring in a well watered agricultural environment six gridded weather data sets gldas 1 nldas 2 the cfsv2 operational analysis gridmet rtma and ndfd were compared to weather data collected from 103 weather stations located in well watered settings across the conterminous united states etref along with the weather variables used to compute it near surface air temperature vapor pressure wind speed and shortwave solar radiation were compared the gridded weather data sets generally overestimated the standardized penman monteith etref produced from weather station data with median biases ranging from 12 to 31 the overestimation was mainly due to chronic overstatement of air temperature shortwave radiation and wind speed and understatement of humidity these results indicate that gridded data should be carefully evaluated before being substituted for agricultural weather station data bias correction procedures may make these gridded data more suitable for generating etref rtma was generally the best performing gridded data set for all variables and nldas was the worst for all variables except vapor pressure ndfd one day forecasts outperformed most of the analysis products likely due to its initialization with rtma gridmet temperature agreed relatively well with the station data due to its dependence on the prism station interpolated data set however its performance was similar to its other parent product nldas for the remaining variables which reduced its etref performance the low resolution products gldas and cfsv2 performed better than the finer resolution nldas product suggesting that spatial resolution is not a primary factor determining correspondence to station data the excellent performance of gridmet temperature and rtma indicates that the degree to which gridded data depend on station data is a primary factor determining correspondence keywords reference evapotranspiration gridded weather data irrigation nldas gldas gridmet ndfd rtma 1 introduction gridded weather data sets are increasingly used in a variety of hydrologic ecologic and agricultural modeling applications weather data for modeling have historically been gathered from meteorological weather stations weather stations as a data source offer several challenges they may not be close enough to the particular area being modeled to sufficiently represent the local weather in models applied over large areas their density may not capture the spatial variability of weather within the area stations often have missing data or limited periods of record creating challenges for models representing long timespans lastly poor station citing and sensor calibration can insidiously degrade the quality of the data for these reasons gridded weather data can provide a potential substitute for or complement to ground based weather measurements gridded weather data have begun to be used for modeling evapotranspiration et because they provide the necessary information to estimate reference et etref using the physical penman monteith equation monteith 1965 including solar radiation or sky cover near surface air temperature humidity and wind speed etref is a vital parameter in agricultural water management and for most remote sensing rs approaches to et estimation and is generally defined as the et from a particular hypothetical reference crop etref can be computed in a number of ways but in this paper etref will refer to the standardized penman monteith formulation interest in computing etref from gridded weather data has led to the creation of two recent products from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa one estimating etref using north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas data hobbins 2016 and another product forecasting etref using the national digital forecast database ndfd called forecasted reference evapotranspiration fret palmer et al 2016 gridded etref is also actively being utilized in remote sensing et models such as the landsat based metric and eeflux models allen et al 2007 2015 kilic et al 2016 despite the increasing use of gridded weather data to estimate etref there is little information regarding the accuracy of etref estimates that are based on the gridded data and whether they can successfully replace estimates produced using ground based weather station data that represent weather in well watered agricultural settings an additional concern with using gridded data is that the standardized penman monteith method for computing etref assumes that the near surface profiles for air temperature humidity and wind speed are in equilibrium with the actively transpiring well watered surface represented by etref shuttleworth 2006 2007 shuttleworth et al 2009 lhomme et al 2015 asce 2005 2016 therefore if gridded data fail to capture the near surface air properties of agricultural areas etref will be estimated inaccurately two previous studies that computed etref using the fao56 asce standardized penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2015 asce 2005 with data from the nldas gridded weather data set have found that etref was often overestimated by the gridded data when compared to etref computed using agricultural weather stations in the western conterminous united states conus lewis et al 2014 moorhead et al 2015 the etref overestimation was the result of overestimation of near surface temperature solar radiation and wind speed and underestimation of vapor pressure in europe two reanalysis data sets the national center for environmental predictions national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar blended reanalysis and the era interim reanalysis were found to overestimate fao56 standardized reference et in the iberian peninsula martins et al 2017 and in portugal paredes et al 2018 respectively abatzoglou 2013 compared gridmet gridded data to data from 1618 weather stations and found that grass reference evapotranspiration computed with the fao56 asce penman monteith method and gridmet data showed a median bias of positive 0 5 mm d 1 these studies indicate a tendency for gridded data to overestimate etref there have been a variety of studies that have compared the gridded weather data variables involved in computing etref to weather station data myrick and horel 2006 abatzoglou 2013 decker et al 2012 mcevoy et al 2014 behnke et al 2016 slater 2016 walton and hall 2018 walton and hall 2018 noted that reanalysis based data sets like nldas tend to differ more strongly from station observations than gridded data sets derived from interpolated station data like prism and to some extent gridmet behnke et al 2016 evaluated eight gridded temperature products across the conus and discovered a negative bias in nldas maximum temperature but a stronger positive bias in minimum temperature agreeing with walton and hall s findings they found minimal bias in gridmet within typical summer temperature ranges we note that the behnke study included some weather stations that are not considered to represent well watered conditions as was mandated in the present study mcevoy et al 2014 showed that biases in air temperature for gridmet were dependent on terrain complexity decker et al 2012 found that at the six hour timestep the global land data assimilation system gldas overestimated temperature more often than it underestimated it at 33 sites in north america nldas gldas and the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr all overestimated incoming shortwave radiation at many locations in the conus according to slater 2016 the first objective of this study was to compare the near surface air temperature vapor pressure shortwave solar radiation and wind speed data from gridded data sets the data required for computing etref to weather station data obtained from agriculturally sited weather stations across the conus these comparisons helped to diagnose the causes of etref biases relative to etref calculated from weather station data special emphasis was placed on bias systematic error because random error tends to diminish when data are time averaged the second objective of this study was to compare estimates of etref made from several gridded data sets to etref made from agriculturally sited weather stations across the conus results of this conus wide analysis should be useful to applications utilizing gridded weather data to estimate etref since they represent a wide range of climatic characteristics comparisons for both objectives focused on the summer period june july and august because that is when plants are actively growing and etref values are at their highest and have the greatest impact on irrigation systems design hydrologic water balances and water scarcity the period of study was from 2013 through 2015 the gridded data sets analyzed in this research were gldas version 1 nldas phase 2 the climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 operational analysis the real time mesoscale analysis rtma the gridded surface meteorological data set from the university of idaho gridmet and the national digital forecast database ndfd all of these data sets are tied to reanalyses or operational analyses gridmet and ndfd are less tied to analyses than the other data sets gridmet is a hybrid data set depending on both analysis data nldas and the weather station interpolation based data set prism ndfd is unique because it is a forecast data set it is tied to rtma which provides the initial conditions for the forecasts 1 1 causes of differences between gridded and weather station data the causes of differences between gridded data and agricultural weather station measurements are either due to differences in what the data sets represent or due to error in one or both data sets even if gridded data perfectly represent each weather parameter in time and space there can still be apparent biases that occur because the gridded data may represent a larger area and different time period than the weather station data with which they are being compared for example large grid cell sizes may smooth out the smaller variations observed at weather station locations the problem of spatial representativity can arise in heterogeneous complex terrain the gridded weather data sets generally represent the weather conditions at the average elevation of a grid cell however air properties can change rapidly with elevation especially air temperature therefore if the elevation within the grid cell where the weather station is located is substantially different from the average grid cell elevation the gridded data may not represent what is desired in addition to the problem of spatial representativity there can be problems associated with temporal representativity some gridded data such as cfsv2 have a temporal resolution timestep as large as six hours given that many gridded weather data sets estimate instantaneous values occurring at each timestep a six hour timestep is analogous to using a six hour sampling rate all four parameters used to estimate etref air temperature humidity wind speed and solar radiation tend to vary substantially during a day and a six hour sampling rate may not adequately capture the variability coarse temporal resolutions could substantially reduce the accuracy of etref calculations another suspected source of differences between the data sets comes from biases in the data assimilated into the gridded data many of the ground based weather stations assimilated by analyses are located at airports in the conus air temperature can be increased and humidity decreased at airports because of the prevalence of paved and other non watered surfaces in the vicinities on pavement there is little to no moisture to vaporize so more solar energy is available to warm the air instead this is commonly known as the urban heat island effect bias is also expected because irrigation inputs have traditionally not been accounted for in the water balances of land surface models lsms used within data assimilation systems in arid areas where irrigation is prevalent the microclimate near the irrigated area is affected by the additional water input evapotranspiration made possible by the additional water inputs absorbs solar energy that in the nearby unirrigated areas warms the air instead the microclimate near the irrigated crops is therefore cooler and more humid than surrounding unirrigated land we refer to this effect as conditioning allen et al 2020 because the lsms often do not account for water inputs besides precipitation they tend to overestimate the air temperature and underestimate the humidity in irrigated regions lastly there are also likely to be biases within assimilation system models due to incorrect parameterizations unrepresented physics or inaccurate boundary forcings ménard 2010 1 2 gridded weather data sets the spatial and temporal attributes of gridded data evaluated in this study are shown in table 1 along with some of their other features 1 2 1 gldas both nldas and the gldas fall under the land data assimilation systems ldas project of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the ncep rodell 2020b the goal of the ldas is to produce lsm s uncoupled from atmospheric models to avoid biases due to coupling inadequate coupling can cause feedbacks that create systematic hydrologic error houser et al 2010 instead the lsm s are forced with high quality data sets derived from observations these meteorological forcing data sets were utilized in this study rather than the output of the lsms gldas is developed jointly by the nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and the ncep rodell et al 2004 the goal of gldas is to generate global high quality fields of land surface states and fluxes using lsms gldas version 1 derives its forcing fields primarily from the global data assimilation system gdas precipitation data are taken from disaggregated merged analysis of precipitation cmap and incoming radiation is derived from the air force weather agency afwa rodell 2020a 1 2 2 nldas nldas is produced by noaa ncep s environmental modeling center climate prediction center noaa nws office of hydrological development nasa s gfsc princeton university and the university of washington nldas like gldas seeks to produce high quality lsm data sets similar to gldas nldas produces forcing data by assimilating high quality observation based data nldas version 2 derives most of its forcing fields from the north american retrospective reanalysis gridded data set narr mesinger et al 2006 to create nldas narr is spatially and temporally disaggregated employing the methods presented in cosgrove et al 2003 nldas is kept up to date using the continuation of the narr called the r cdas precipitation is derived from a gauge only climate prediction center cpc analysis of daily precipitation orographically adjusted using the prism climatology nldas version 2 produces two different sets of forcing data in this study we focused on the traditional forcing fields in forcing file a 1 2 3 gridmet gridmet is produced at the university of idaho by combining the spatial attributes of prism data with temporal attributes of nldas version 2 abatzoglou 2013 in gridmet nldas weather data are spatially downscaled from their native 14 km grid to a 4 5 km grid and are upscaled from an hourly to a daily timestep monthly humidity air temperature and precipitation data in prism are used to bias correct the nldas data the climate data used to debias nldas are the prism 30 year monthly normals from 1981 2010 in essence the debiasing procedure aggregates nldas data to monthly values and compares the results with prism monthly values to create scaling factors that are then applied to the raw daily nldas data during our study period prism was ingesting data from several of the weather station networks used in this study this may have led to spuriously good performance in the comparisons because the data being verified were determined in part by the data they were being verified against however it should be noted that in gridmet only monthly prism climate normals were used to bias correct nldas in fact gridmet was validated against some of the prism input data in abatzoglou 2013 which was gridmet s founding paper 1 2 4 cfsv2 cfsv2 climate forecast system version 2 was developed by ncep to replace the cfsv1 saha et al 2014 the purpose of cfsv2 is to produce seasonal and subseasonal climate forecasts for the globe the development of cfsv2 began with the creation of the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 cfsr was produced using state of the art forecast and data assimilation techniques cfsv2 used the cfsr analysis as initial conditions for retrospective forecasts forecasts made from points of time in the past where the forecasted time period has since passed the retrospective forecasts were used to calibrate the model for real time forecasts the cfsr was continued as the real time operational climate data assimilation system cdasv2 to provide initial conditions for the cfsv2 forecasts the assimilation system of cfsv2 is frozen much like the r cdas behind nldas this might seem odd because assimilation systems serving forecasts are usually updated on occasion to improve their accuracy however because cfsv2 is a climate model temporal consistency is paramount and updating the system would likely create inconsistency saha et al 2014 the cfsr completed production in 2009 so the models and assimilation techniques of that time are still being used in this study the examined data were taken from the climate data assimilation system version 2 cdasv2 which is often referred to as the cfsv2 operational analysis we use the term cfsv2 to refer to the cdasv2 data set 1 2 5 ndfd the national digital forecast database ndfd glahn and ruth 2003 is a product of the national weather service nws that began distribution in 2003 as a means to provide public access to weather forecasts from a central digital source weather forecast offices wfos produce regional forecasted grids of sensible weather elements that are mosaicked together on a central server forecasters have the ability to manually adjust the forecast grids produced by the numerical forecast myrick and horel 2006 the nominal spatial resolution of the gridded elements is five km and the temporal resolution is three hours for short range forecasts with lead times less than three days and six hours for longer range forecasts with lead times of three to seven days glahn and ruth 2003 in late august of 2015 the ndfd increased its spatial resolution to two and a half km and its short range forecast temporal resolution to one hour the forecast is produced for the conus puerto rico hawaii guam and alaska rtma described in the next section and is often used to initialize and verify ndfd forecasts de pondeca et al 2011 1 2 6 rtma the real time mesoscale analysis rtma is produced by ncep the earth system research laboratory esrl and the national environmental satellite and data information service nesdis de pondeca et al 2011 the most prominent application of rtma is to help initialize and verify ndfd forecasts rtma has a spatial resolution of roughly two and a half km and a temporal resolution of one hour matching ndfd as its name suggests rtma is published in real time making it useful for computing etref in near real time for example for use in irrigation scheduling kilic 2017 rtma does not directly estimate shortwave solar radiation it began publishing total cloud cover the variable used in this study to derive solar radiation in april 2015 before that time rtma published cloud cover estimates that were based on the geostationary operation environmental satellite system goes deriving solar radiation from those earlier values was not tested in this study as a result only 2015 data are used in this study rtma assimilates data from a vast number of ground based weather stations including many of the networks providing ground based data used in this study is under continual improvement and periodically assimilates new data sources as indicated for gridmet using weather stations to verify a gridded product created using those same weather stations can cause an overstatement of accuracy due to a lack of complete independence despite this stations in networks that are assimilated into rtma were used due to the difficulty of finding unassimilated networks the lack of independence of data sets may not be as problematic as it appears during assimilation the modeled weather values are not simply replaced with observed values but rather a statistical algorithm decides how the two information sources should be blended the result is that a comparison of assimilated stations to the gridded product assimilating them can still help to identify biases that exist between the two data sets secondly rtma ingests many stations for example a single temperature analysis for 1500 utc 20 november 2009 used 14 299 stations de pondeca et al 2011 this means that the analysis would probably change little if the rtma assimilated weather stations used as ground truth in this study had not been assimilated into rtma 2 methods 2 1 weather station selection weather stations across the conus were selected from mostly agriculturally oriented automated weather station networks the networks evaluated were primarily state or regional networks such as the cimis agrimet and hprcc networks and did not include the noaa asos network since a majority of its stations are located at or near airports that have dry nonreference conditions the final selection of 103 ground based weather stations representing a geographical coverage of the conus was guided by several considerations efforts were made to select weather stations representing what we refer to as reference conditions because those are the conditions under which etref estimates are the most valid allen et al 1998 asce 2005 2016 and where differences between gridded and station data may be more pronounced some exceptions were made to produce more complete geographical coverage of the conus reference conditions presume that the underlying land surface is evapotranspiring at or near reference et rates and therefore the near surface air properties are conditioned by the et rates they tend to occur in arid and semiarid climates only where there is irrigated agriculture which is also where etref estimates are commonly applied for irrigation water management selected weather stations were required to measure all variables evaluated air temperature humidity shortwave solar radiation and wind speed at a maximum timestep of one hour for the evaluation period of 2013 through 2015 furthermore station networks with free open data access were preferred to networks requiring payment reference conditions can be difficult to find or verify to help identify the likelihood of reference conditions the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was computed for the area surrounding each station ndvi is calculated as 1 n d v i ρ n i r ρ v i s ρ n i r ρ v i s where ρ is reflectance nir refers to the near infrared band and vis refers to the visible red band although ndvi can be high for vegetation suffering acute temporary water stress low ndvi generally indicates a lack of green actively transpiring vegetation a high ndvi is a necessary but not completely sufficient indication of reference conditions despite that limitation ndvi was used as the primary tool for identifying stations that were likely to be near reference conditions the approach to selecting weather stations was iterative first average ndvi for the warm season months of april through september was calculated for each study year from modis mcd43a4 16 day surface reflectance composites using the google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 modis stands for moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and is an instrument aboard the nasa terra and aqua satellites schaaf and wang 2015 monthly values were extracted from the 500 m pixels over the station locations these single pixel values at the station locations are referred to as local ndvi an average of all 500 m pixels within 2 km of the stations termed areal ndvi was also computed the means and standard deviations of all monthly ndvi s point and areal were calculated and stations having a mean point and areal ndvi less than 0 4 were discarded only the areal ndvi was used as a criterion for stations having reported coordinates rounded to the hundredths of a degree because of the uncertainty of the actual station location after removing stations having low ndvi the best stations in terms of ndvi in the geographic regions desired were selected this procedure involved some judgment weighting between ndvi the location and the variability in the ndvi once candidate stations were selected satellite images from google earth and ground based images from google maps https www google com maps or taken by the station network were consulted if available to further judge the suitability of station surroundings to represent reference or near reference conditions each station was evaluated to eliminate those having major obstructions and to include those having relatively uniform low vegetation extending in nearly all directions for approximately 100 times the height of the temperature and humidity sensors if the removal of a station due to insufficient surroundings caused a large region of conus to go unrepresented another station was selected from among the available stations even if the alternative did not fully exhibit reference conditions doubling back to replace stations constituted the iterative portion of the process poor quality data from a station were also grounds for choosing an alternative station the final set of weather stations contained some stations that are surrounded by trees for example in the northeast us and others that had low ndvi because there were no alternative weather stations found in those regions that had better characteristics weather station data were downloaded from fifteen sources that represented thirteen different weather station networks table 2 most networks provided an online data access service a total of 103 stations were selected for comparisons with gridded data based on filtering procedures previously described these stations were located in 41 us states and all us climate regions fig 1 basic metadata were retrieved for each station including the heights of the anemometer the heights of the air temperature and humidity instruments and the station latitude longitude and elevation table 2 shows the networks and data sources accessed 2 2 data processing the processing for the weather data comparison was aimed at assessing how well the gridded data represent what they intend to represent the processing for the etref data comparison was aimed at evaluating how well the gridded data could match station based etref estimates processing efforts attempted to minimize elaborate measures to augment the gridded data the objectives necessitated two different processing schemes as illustrated in fig 2 to evaluate how well the gridded weather data represent what they intend to hourly average station data were linearly interpolated to simulate the gridded instantaneous measurements and were downsampled to match the gridded data temporal resolutions the intent was to minimize differences between the data sets caused by mismatch in temporal representativity in order to evaluate how well etref computed from gridded data could compare to station based etref the weather station data were treated as they would normally be treated to compute daily etref that is no downsampling was performed some gridded data sets needed to be modified to produce average shortwave solar radiation a required variable for computing etref theoretical clear sky radiation was used to convert instantaneous gridded observations of shortwave radiation to average daily estimates one issue with the processing scheme is that it makes the results of the weather comparison less comparable with the results of the etref comparison by matching the temporal representativity of the gridded data the weather comparison could understate the differences remaining between the weather variables in the etref comparison however performance statistics were also computed for the weather variables using the etref processing scheme and there was almost no difference between the results therefore we present the results computed as outlined in fig 2 and assert that the performance statistics for the weather variables are diagnostic of the etref performance statistics unlike the other variables weather station air temperature was not downsampled to match the gridded data temporal resolutions for the weather comparison for both comparisons daily mean temperature was computed as the average of the daily minimum and maximum temperatures minimum and maximum daily temperatures were available for all weather stations and for some gridded weather data sets for gldas nldas and rtma minimum and maximum temperatures were selected from their instantaneous temperature values rtma and nldas have one hour timesteps but gldas has a three hour timestep the large gldas timestep means that it will likely understate the daily temperature extremes the weather station data were subjected to quality assurance and quality control qaqc by plotting them for visual inspection the visual inspection of the data followed the guidelines suggested in allen 1996 and asce 2005 data that were suspected of being in error were set to a null value solar radiation was corrected using the algorithm in the ref et qaqc software according to theoretical radiation occurring under clear sky conditions allen and li 2016 an effort was made to reduce some of the differences in spatial representativity between gridded and weather station data by reconciling the vertical spatial representativity gridded air temperature was lapsed to the weather station elevations using the international standard atmosphere lapse rate of 6 5 c per 1000 m cosgrove et al 2003 vapor pressure was converted to relative humidity and then converted back to vapor pressure using the lapsed temperature following cosgrove et al 2003 wind speed data were standardized to a 2 meter height using a logarithmic wind profile equation that assumes neutral boundary layer conditions asce 2005 data for the weather data comparisons and etref comparisons were aggregated to a daily timestep for all variables a day is a typical time period over which etref is computed and it is often the shortest period in which water management decisions are made in addition 24 hs was the smallest common timestep among all data sets aggregation and analysis were performed on local standard time for all gridded data except ndfd and gridmet the smallest gridmet timestep available for download is one day with data coordinated with central standard time cst therefore weather station data were aggregated using cst to align with gridmet ndfd is based on coordinated universal time utc and the weather station data with which ndfd were paired were aggregated on utc the last step in data processing was to compute alfalfa etref etr using the standardized penman monteith equation asce 2005 2016 in our case we selected the alfalfa reference crop type of asce to approximate maximum expected et rates under reference conditions however comparison results would be similar for the grass reference method of fao56 allen et al 1998 the daily etref equation was coded in python and verified by comparing calculations with the ref et software of the university of idaho allen and li 2016 additional processing details specific to each gridded data set are provided in appendix b 2 3 performance statistics the mean squared error mse and its variations e g nash sutcliffe efficiency are commonly used to evaluate the performance of hydrologic models by comparison to observed data gupta et al 2009 presented a decomposition of mse into a function of variance bias and correlation a combination of those components is presented as the kling gupta efficiency kge model estimates perfectly match observations when kge is equal to 1 kge is defined as 2 k g e 1 e d 3 e d r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 4 α σ m σ o 5 β μ m μ o 6 r y o y m y o y m n y o 2 y o 2 n y m 2 y m 2 n the subscript m refers to modeled gridded data and the subscript o refers to the observed weather station data ed stands for the euclidean distance from the ideal point in the scaled space gupta et al 2009 α is the ratio of the modeled data standard deviation to the observed data standard deviation we call this variability error β is the ratio of the modeled data mean to the observed data mean a measure of bias and r is the pearson correlation coefficient kge suffers from two weaknesses the first is that r is bounded from 1 to 1 while α and β can take on any real value this means that kge can become dominated by the values of α or β if model results have substantially different behavior than observations the other weakness is that the kge is larger if the model underestimates α or β than if it overestimates them it should be noted that all performance metrics have weaknesses and no metric is best for all purposes kge and its components were selected as the primary metrics for comparison because each component highlights a unique type of difference between the data sets furthermore each component is transparently present in the overall kge while remaining obscured in the mse and nse gupta et al 2009 the kge and its components were computed for the summer season defined as june july and august for each study year and for the pooled study years summer was selected because it is the primary growing season in the conus and is also the period when et is greatest groups for computing statistics were required to have at least 50 non missing data for example if more than half of the data for a particular weather station were missing for the 2013 2015 summer seasons the kge value for that station was set to a null value results are primarily presented as boxplots of kge and its components plots either show statistics computed for the summer season pooled across all study years or statistics computed for summer 2015 only so that rtma which does not have summer data for 2013 or 2014 could be compared to the other data sets boxplots are in the style of tukey which shows the median as the centerline the first quartile as the bottom of the box the third quartile as the top of the box and the whiskers as extending to the last observation within 1 5 times the interquartile range data points beyond the whiskers are shown as solid round symbols ideally values for α β and r should be close to 1 0 maps showing the gridded data set with the highest kge at each station location are also presented rtma was omitted from the maps because it was the best performing data set at most stations for all variables so the maps would have become less informative if rtma had been included ndfd was omitted from the maps because it is a forecast data set and therefore serves a different purpose than the other data sets maps of conus showing spatial bias and standard deviation of error are presented in the supplemental materials 3 results discussion 3 1 weather parameter comparisons 3 1 1 near surface air temperature the air temperature biases tended to be positive for all gridded data sets for the bulk of the weather stations confirming what was found in previous studies as shown in fig 3 the median of the station biases ranged from positive 0 54 c for gridmet to positive 2 3 c for nldas the median of the station correlations ranged from 0 87 for gridmet or 0 65 for ndfd day 7 if considering forecasts to 0 97 for rtma gridmet median bias was smallest among the gridded data sets excluding rtma gridmet also had the smallest variability error the improved performance over nldas one of gridmet s parent products is clear for each kge component except correlation the median of the station correlations for gridmet temperature was slightly below the correlation for nldas the lower correlation may be related to the debiasing procedure applied to nldas during production of gridmet fig 5 shows the stability of the kge performance across the study years the relative performance of each data set seems constant except for gridmet which performed relatively poorly for 2013 this anomaly caused gldas to be the best performer for that year when we restricted our view to only 2015 data so that rtma could be included in the comparisons rtma became the top performer the gridmet correlation was better than the nldas correlation for 2015 fig 4 suggesting that the low gridmet kge for 2013 might have been primarily due to a low correlation during that year the success of rtma was not surprising given that the assimilation system is being continually improved and assimilates a large quantity of weather station data ndfd one day lead time forecasts performed well relative to the analysis data sets they had generally better performance than nldas in all three kge components one of the main differences in the pattern of error for ndfd relative to the analysis data sets was that the forecasts tended to underestimate variability while the analysis data sets typically overestimated it there was a modest increase in bias from the one day to seven day lead times but the increase in error was mostly correlation and variability error reflecting greater uncertainty about the more distant future fig 6 shows top performing near surface air temperature data sets other than rtma and ndfd ranked by kge computed using summertime daily data pooled across all study years for the 103 stations gldas and gridmet dominated most of the us in terms of kge performance gridmet would likely be the top performing data set at more locations if its 2013 kge were improved note that rtma and ndfd are not included in fig 6 even though they were often the best performing this was done so that regional trends in performances by the other data sets can be viewed 3 1 2 vapor pressure vapor pressure bias was negative for more stations than it was positive for all gridded data sets maps of bias provided in the supplemental materials show that bias was more negative in western states this was expected because the lower boundary layer of the atmosphere tends to gain humidity when it is in contact with wetter surfaces which in this study existed for many of the western us weather station locations due to their irrigated surroundings the gridded data sets do not typically account for irrigation and its effect on humidity and therefore underestimate the median of the station biases ranged from negative 6 2 for gridmet to 0 0 for rtma the median of the station correlations ranged from 0 82 for gridmet or 0 61 for ndfd day 7 if considering forecasts to 0 98 for rtma vapor pressure data did not show clear winners across conus among the analysis data sets for periods that excluded rtma fig 7 gldas performed best for 2013 and 2014 with its median above or near the top of the other data sets third quartile fig 9 in 2015 the distributions overlapped more significantly it is interesting to observe that the procedure used to debias nldas humidity in gridmet does not seem to have improved gridmet s performance over nldas in representing the humidity of conditioned environments rtma generally had the best performance among all gridded data sets for all kge components during the summer of 2015 fig 8 ndfd likely benefiting from its relationship to rtma performed better than the analysis data sets for the one day lead time fig 10 3 1 3 wind speed the median of the station biases for wind speed was generally positive for all gridded data sets and ranged from a median bias of positive 13 for cfsv2 to positive 41 for gridmet fig 11 the boxplots for nldas and gridmet were similar because gridmet only modified nldas by resampling it to a smaller spatial scale the median of the station correlations ranged from 0 68 for gridmet or 0 31 for ndfd day 7 if considering forecast data to 0 83 for rtma perhaps not surprisingly wind speed had the lowest correlations of all the weather variables which demonstrates that gridded data have some difficulty in representing actual local wind speed on a daily timescale other studies have also noted that gridded data sets have difficulty in matching station wind speed measurements decker et al 2012 lewis et al 2014 martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018 wind speed is also the weather parameter that suffers most from biases induced by local conditions including blockage by buildings trees and tall crops and failing anemometers asce 2016 the outliers in the boxplot show some stations with very low correlations even some negative correlations indicating that the gridded data had poor ability to represent day to day wind speeds at some locations fig 13 showing the changes in kge by year shows very little variation in kge over the study years the boxplot for summer 2015 fig 12 shows that rtma had smaller distributions for β and α than for the other data sets ndfd bias and variability error improved from the one day lead time to the seven day lead time but were balanced out by a lower correlation the reduction in bias for the seven day lead time is an unexpected finding for which we have no explanation fig 14 maps top performing wind speed data sets other than rtma and ndfd ranked by kge computed using summertime daily data pooled across all study years for the 103 stations cfsv2 gldas and nldas were relatively evenly distributed across the conus as the top performers for estimating wind speed maps of bias included in the supplemental materials showed that cfsv2 tended to underestimate wind speed at many locations in the western half of the country and overestimate it in the eastern half gridmet and nldas tended to overestimate wind speed more strongly in the eastern half of the country than in the western half these spatial patterns could be due to the more forested landscape present in the eastern half of the country forested land cover may make wind speed more difficult to accurately model and it may also affect the wind being measured at the weather stations 3 1 4 solar radiation solar radiation estimates were positively biased for all analysis data sets at most stations the median of the station biases ranged from positive 10 in rtma or positive 0 3 including ndfd to positive 12 in gldas the slater 2016 study described earlier corrected daily solar radiation data for the point weather stations whereas we corrected the hourly observed data based on theoretical clear sky solar radiation curves while correction of solar radiation data for measurement bias can be more accurately done on an hourly basis asce 2005 2016 correcting hourly data did allow any reductions in radiation near dawn and dusk due to topography or vegetation shading to persist letting those reductions remain may have reduced our average daily solar radiation estimates by a small amount relative to slater s estimates hence the larger biases found in our study slater s study may therefore be a better account of the gridded data s true error that is differences from what the data attempt to represent nevertheless our study likely better represents the radiation actually impacting each site and therefore the true relative error the boxplot for all study years fig 15 shows that gridmet and nldas underestimated the variability in solar radiation at nearly every station like wind speed gridmet merely resamples nldas to a finer grid thus the results for the two data sets are similar gldas underestimated variability at more stations than it overestimated it cfsv2 was more evenly split between overestimation and underestimation of variability but overestimated at more stations the results from decker et al 2012 suggest that both cfsv2 and gldas may overestimate variability more often than they underestimate it this conflicts with our findings for gldas but it could be explained by station selection that differed between our studies examining the boxplot for the summer of 2015 fig 16 rtma had a positive bias that was close to the other gridded data sets but it had a better correlation the main difference between the solar radiation in the ndfd derived from sky cover using perez et al 2007 and using doorenbos and pruitt 1977 as described in appendix b was in the variability error the perez et al 2007 method exhibited a substantial improvement in the variability error when estimating solar radiation for rtma and ndfd gridded data sets this is visible in both box plots figs 15 and 16 the kge stability plot fig 17 shows that gldas generally performed best for all three study years excluding rtma solar radiation correlation in nldas was lower than found by lewis et al 2014 because they conducted their analysis on an hourly timestep hourly data produce a better correlation because of the regularity of the solar diurnal cycle whereas averaging solar radiation to daily values removes the diurnal cycle and makes correlations more dependent on accurately representing cloudiness the median of the station correlations for solar radiation ranged from 0 76 for gridmet or 0 37 for ndfd day 7 if including forecasts to 0 91 for rtma ndfd generally had less bias than the other gridded data sets including rtma if the use of the sky cover to solar radiation conversion equations were the cause of the small bias one would expect rtma to mirror the bias in ndfd however this was not the case in addition one would expect solar radiation estimates made from sky cover to worsen biases however in this case ndfd had the smallest bias fig 18 shows maps of solar radiation data sets other than rtma and ndfd ranked by kge computed using summertime daily data pooled across all study years for the 103 stations gldas dominated the center of the conus with cfsv2 dominating the ne and rocky mountains and sharing the pacific states with gldas maps of bias included in the supplemental materials showed that gridmet nldas gldas and rtma all have a more strongly positive bias in the eastern half of the country one possible explanation is that the eastern us tends to have more cloud cover than the western half in addition eastern weather stations tend to be located in forested areas and that the trees could shelter station pyranometers towards dawn and dusk 3 2 reference evapotranspiration computed etref using a 24 h timestep had a positive bias for all gridded data at most weather stations fig 19 the median of the station biases ranged from positive 13 for rtma computed with doorenbos and pruitt or 12 for ndfd day 1 if considering forecasts to positive 31 for nldas the median of the station correlations ranged from 0 70 for nldas or 0 37 for ndfd day 7 if considering forecasts to 0 92 for rtma computed with the perez et al method for calculating solar radiation the relatively large overestimation of etref is a concern for use of these estimates for irrigation water resources and water rights management essentially all four weather components had biases that tend to cause etref to be overestimated these include positive biases in solar radiation air temperature and wind speed and a negative bias in vapor pressure all of which increase the computed etref as illustrated in fig 19 etref variability was overestimated at a majority of stations for all gridded data except ndfd with a seven day lead time and ndfd where solar radiation was estimated from the doorenbos and pruitt relationship with a one day lead time fig 20 shows that ndfd and rtma computed with doorenbos and pruitt equally overestimated and underestimated variability in etref and that rtma computed with perez et al overestimated the variability this is an interesting result because it shows that using solar radiation computed using perez et al resulted in higher variability error in etref the underestimation of variability by the doorenbos and pruitt equation might balance out an overestimation of variability in another variable e g wind speed this highlights the complex interplay between the input error when computing etref a more accurate estimation of any particular weather variable does not necessarily result in a better estimate of etref the boxplot spanning all study years fig 19 shows that gldas generally had the highest correlation and lowest variability error among the analysis data sets but all the distributions substantially overlap the boxplot of summer 2015 fig 20 shows that rtma had the best performance in each kge component for most stations fig 21 shows that gldas etr performed better for 2013 and 2014 than it did for 2015 that temporal pattern aligns with the pattern in figs 5 and 9 where air temperature and vapor pressure kge for gldas were worse for 2015 gridmet s etref performance for 2013 was much worse than for 2014 and 2015 which aligns with its poor air temperature performance for 2013 fig 22 maps top performing etref data sets other than rtma and ndfd ranked by kge computed using summertime daily data pooled across all study years gldas corresponded best to station estimated etref in the eastern half of conus and a mixture of gldas cfsv2 and gridmet were best performers in the western half of conus gldas s success in the east is because of its excellent relative performance in that region when estimating solar radiation and air temperature rtma had the highest kge at the majority of stations in the 2015 ranking map fig 23 3 3 summary every gridded data set tended to overestimate etref at most weather station locations this is the result of a tendency to overestimate wind speed solar radiation and air temperature and to underestimate vapor pressure as compared to the agricultural weather stations rtma generally had the best kge for all weather variables and etref we attribute this good performance to the large amount of surface weather data assimilated into rtma and the fact that rtma is an operational analysis and therefore subject to continual improvement ndfd is often initialized and verified using rtma ndfd based etref bias was similar to the rtma bias possibly as a result of their relationship the bias of ndfd remained steady between the one and seven day lead times for etref but the correlations dipped from a median of 0 77 using the perez et al 2007 method to convert cloud cover to solar radiation at the one day lead time to 0 37 at the seven day lead time the variability error shifted from both underestimating and overestimating variability to predominantly underestimating variability for the seven day lead time in short there was large etref uncertainty at the seven day lead time among the analysis data sets the accuracy of etref estimated by gldas was second best to rtma this is attributed to gldas ingesting data from the gdas system which like rtma is an operational analysis third place was essentially a tie between cfsv2 and gridmet gridmet weather variables performed similarly to nldas weather variables except for air temperature which was more accurately estimated by gridmet due its bias correction based on the station interpolated prism data set except for the summer of 2013 gridmet had more accurate and reference like air temperature estimates than nldas cfsv2 and gldas the good performance of estimated air temperature is what allowed gridmet to be equivalent to cfsv2 in the overall etref performance the cfsv2 is similar to nldas because it uses a frozen assimilation system but the assimilation system used in cfsv2 is more modern than the one used in nldas which helps explain why it performed better than nldas despite having coarser spatial and temporal resolutions nldas produced the most biased estimates of etref likely because it derives its data from the continuation of a 2003 reanalysis narr r cdas it is important to note that the gridded weather data sets may exhibit better accuracy less bias when compared to weather data sets that better represent the overall ambient region and climate our study focused on weather data collected from locations that were likely to exhibit the cooling and humidifying conditioning characteristics associated with well watered vegetation this focus was intentional because standardized etref equations such as the fao56 and asce penman monteith method have been developed to expect weather data that reflect conditions above a reference or near reference surface application of etref equations to weather data collected over dry surfaces causes overstatement of the actual etref allen et al 1998 asce 2005 2016 4 conclusions this study evaluated the abilities of several gridded weather data products to estimate etref for conditioned reference environments by comparing etref computed with those data sets to etref computed with weather measurements from ground based weather stations located in predominately near reference actively evapotranspiring conditions daily vapor pressure near surface air temperature shortwave solar radiation and wind speed the variables used to compute etref were also compared between the gridded and station data sets the results focused on the summer season defined as june july and august because this is the primary season during which etref is most used in irrigation and water rights management computed etref from all gridded weather data sets had a positive bias at most weather stations the median of the station biases ranged from a low of positive 13 for rtma computed with doorenbos and pruitt or 12 for ndfd day 1 if considering forecasts to high of positive 31 for nldas the relatively large overestimation of etref is a concern for use of these estimates for irrigation and water resources management all four weather components had biases that tend to cause etref to be overestimated these include positive biases in solar radiation air temperature and wind speed and a negative bias in vapor pressure gridded data that leaned most heavily on station based data gridmet temperature and all rtma variables performed best in the comparisons notably gldas and cfsv2 the coarsest spatial resolution data sets performed better than nldas and in some cases gridmet indicating that spatial resolution was not a deciding factor in the degree of correspondence with station data this study makes it clear that gridded data should be carefully examined before being used in applications techniques for conditioning and adjusting gridded weather data sets to remove biases will be useful in producing estimates for etref that can be used in irrigation and water rights management and remote sensing et models an example of a theoretical approach for adjusting gridded weather data to reflect a reference et environment that uses boundary layer profile theory is described in this special issue by allen et al 2020 declaration of competing interest the authors

which is a standardized file format devised by the world meteorological organization wmo for storing weather data grib files were downloaded for the noah model with 0 25 spatial resolution and a three hour time step only the noah model files contain parameters at the spatial resolution of 0 25 degrees each file contains raster grids for all the forcing fields and lsm fields valid for one timestep table b1 average three hour solar radiation data were produced for gldas by first calculating three hour average clear sky radiation then instantaneous clear sky radiation was computed for the time series finally the hourly average clear sky radiation was multiplied by the ratio of gldas instantaneous radiation to the instantaneous clear sky radiation this ratio represents the impact of clouds during the three hour period the morning and evening hours can produce ratios of gldas radiation to clear sky radiation much larger than 1 therefore these ratios were set to 1 before computing the hourly averaged solar radiation for the etref comparisons we picked the minimum and maximum air temperatures within a given day from gldas this could cause a bias that varies with the time zone however one purpose of the etref comparisons was to evaluate how well the gridded data can estimate etref without using any elaborate methods to augment the gridded data nldas the nldas data were gathered from the goddard earth sciences data and information services center grib files of forcing data set were programmatically downloaded with 0 125 spatial resolution and a one hour timestep like gldas each file contains data for all fields for each timestep table b2 daily minimum and maximum air temperatures were selected from among the hourly instantaneous temperature estimates for the calculation of etref the hourly average solar radiation was estimated using the same procedure described for gldas nldas data were then aggregated to daily values on local time gridmet gridmet data were downloaded from the google earth engine platform which serves as a repository for gridmet data the imagecollection id was idaho epscor gridmet data were accessed on february 7th 2017 gridmet processing was relatively simple compared to the other gridded data sets since it is a daily data set and no aggregations were necessary due to the nature of the data only one time series was produced for etref evaluation and weather data comparison table b3 cfsv2 cfsv2 data were also extracted from the google earth engine platform earth engine ingests several surface meteorological parameters from the noaa cfsv2 operational analysis six hourly surface and radiative flux grib files the imagecollection id was noaa cfsv2 for6h data were accessed february 7th 2017 table b4 the cfsv2 files ingested by earth engine are not analysis files but rather are forecast files the analysis files contain only eight variables and are missing several of the variables investigated in this study the forecast files ingested into earth engine show what has been estimated by the model before being updated with observational data each forecast file was produced by forecasting 6 h ahead of the previous analysis cfsv2 data already contain average solar radiation values so they did not need to be computed cfsv2 contains minimum and maximum air temperatures within each six hour window that are timestamped at the start of the six hour period at 0000utc 0600utc 1200utc and 1800utc daily minimum and maximum air temperatures were selected from the six hour minimum and six hour maximum temperatures for the day after converting times to local times ndfd the historical ndfd data were gathered from the noaa national operational model archive and distribution system nomads https www ncdc noaa gov data access model data nomads provides an ftp server to download archived ndfd forecasts stored in grib files ndfd data spanned the full study period but had significant gaps especially during 2015 for ndfd each grib file represents a forecast from either one to three or four to seven days for each weather parameter the files contain bands of data each band is a raster representing the weather parameter for a single forecast valid time ndfd forecasts are published roughly every hour the last forecast and second to last forecast of each upcoming day were downloaded programmatically from the ftp server in order to obtain the most accurate forecast for the following days these forecasts were the most accurate because they were initialized as near as possible to the beginning of the forecasted days of interest the second to last forecast of the day was only downloaded for parameters whose three day lead time forecasts use 3 hr timesteps because the last forecast of the day did not forecast the first hour of the following day table b5 forecast accuracy generally decreases with the lead time of the forecast a homogenous forecast data set therefore requires not only that forecasts represent the same time in the future but that the forecasts are made for the same lead time the data were filtered to meet these requirements the files were filtered according to metadata stored within the grib files for files forecasting one to three day lead times the criteria for filtering were that the first forecast should be for 0000 utc on day 1 and the first forecast duration should be one hour that is the forecasted values were predicted from one hour prior for files forecasting the four to seven day lead times the criteria for filtering were that the first forecast should be for 0600 utc on day four and the first forecast duration should be three days and six hours only files meeting these criteria were used to preserve temporal consistency the ndfd data were aggregated to daily values on utc time since aggregating the data on different conus time zones would have mixed data from different ndfd forecasts together with the effect of having some time zones with longer lead time forecasts than others time zones having more values from longer forecasts would produce larger apparent error ndfd despite having timestamps on utc determines the daily minimum and maximum temperature based on local time as previously discussed daily minimum and maximum temperature should usually be the same whether found on local time or utc time so the ndfd minimum and maximum temperatures were used for each day of ndfd data the values at the start of the day timestamped 0000 and at the very end of the day timestamped 0000 on the next day were included in the aggregated daily averages but those values were given half weight because they were on the edges of the averaging bin ndfd timestamps evenly subdivide a utc day ndfd does not contain shortwave solar radiation values but instead reports sky cover two equations were taken from the literature that map sky cover to solar radiation those equations were used to estimate average radiation the quality of the derived solar radiation data was evaluated the ndfd fret uses an equation developed from the fao24 publication by doorenbos and pruitt 1977 to compute solar radiation from sky cover c palmer personal communication november 9 2016 the equation is r s 0 25 0 50 0 0083 s k y c o v e r 0 9659 r a where rs is the estimated solar radiation and ra is the computed extra terrestrial solar radiation we compared the results using the doorenbos and pruitt equation to the results using an empirical equation developed in perez et al 2007 specifically for ndfd r s r a 1 0 87 s k y c o v e r 100 1 9 sky cover was linearly interpolated temporally to simulate the average sky cover for each timestep before being used in the equations the perez et al equation is expected to be worse for the seven day forecast than for the three day forecast because the equation was fit to one to three day forecasts only perez et al 2010 one detail discovered late in our research was that ndfd changed to a finer spatial scale from five km to the rtma grid of two and half km on august 19 2014 at that same time for forecasts out to the three day lead time wind speed dew point and sky cover become available at a one hour timestep ideally the finer ndfd should be analyzed separately from the coarser resolution ndfd but to simplify the study the one hour data were sampled at a three hour increment to match the older data rtma rtma data did not cover the entire study period of 2013 through 2015 the data including a sky cover variable equivalent to what is present in ndfd began to be produced in mid april of 2015 so that date was used as the start of the rtma data analyzed in this study rtma data came from two sources one source was an ncep ftp server that provides recently produced rtma data ftp ftp ncep noaa gov pub data nccf com rtma prod rtma grib files were downloaded from this server in near real time because the server only provides the mostly recently produced rtma data older data are deleted from the server the other data source was google earth engine which has collected historical rtma data at our request since june 18 of 2015 the imagecollection id was noaa nws rtma the download date was february 7 2017 the values for pixels overlying the weather station locations in both data sets were extracted afterward the two time series were joined rtma data were processed in a manner similar to nldas the other hourly instantaneous data set except that rtma contains a total cloud cover sky cover variable and no solar radiation table b6 rtma solar radiation like ndfd radiation was estimated using doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and perez et al 2007 relationships 
10448,this study assessed the quality of gridded weather data for calculating reference evapotranspiration etref which by definition represents a near maximum et occurring in a well watered agricultural environment six gridded weather data sets gldas 1 nldas 2 the cfsv2 operational analysis gridmet rtma and ndfd were compared to weather data collected from 103 weather stations located in well watered settings across the conterminous united states etref along with the weather variables used to compute it near surface air temperature vapor pressure wind speed and shortwave solar radiation were compared the gridded weather data sets generally overestimated the standardized penman monteith etref produced from weather station data with median biases ranging from 12 to 31 the overestimation was mainly due to chronic overstatement of air temperature shortwave radiation and wind speed and understatement of humidity these results indicate that gridded data should be carefully evaluated before being substituted for agricultural weather station data bias correction procedures may make these gridded data more suitable for generating etref rtma was generally the best performing gridded data set for all variables and nldas was the worst for all variables except vapor pressure ndfd one day forecasts outperformed most of the analysis products likely due to its initialization with rtma gridmet temperature agreed relatively well with the station data due to its dependence on the prism station interpolated data set however its performance was similar to its other parent product nldas for the remaining variables which reduced its etref performance the low resolution products gldas and cfsv2 performed better than the finer resolution nldas product suggesting that spatial resolution is not a primary factor determining correspondence to station data the excellent performance of gridmet temperature and rtma indicates that the degree to which gridded data depend on station data is a primary factor determining correspondence keywords reference evapotranspiration gridded weather data irrigation nldas gldas gridmet ndfd rtma 1 introduction gridded weather data sets are increasingly used in a variety of hydrologic ecologic and agricultural modeling applications weather data for modeling have historically been gathered from meteorological weather stations weather stations as a data source offer several challenges they may not be close enough to the particular area being modeled to sufficiently represent the local weather in models applied over large areas their density may not capture the spatial variability of weather within the area stations often have missing data or limited periods of record creating challenges for models representing long timespans lastly poor station citing and sensor calibration can insidiously degrade the quality of the data for these reasons gridded weather data can provide a potential substitute for or complement to ground based weather measurements gridded weather data have begun to be used for modeling evapotranspiration et because they provide the necessary information to estimate reference et etref using the physical penman monteith equation monteith 1965 including solar radiation or sky cover near surface air temperature humidity and wind speed etref is a vital parameter in agricultural water management and for most remote sensing rs approaches to et estimation and is generally defined as the et from a particular hypothetical reference crop etref can be computed in a number of ways but in this paper etref will refer to the standardized penman monteith formulation interest in computing etref from gridded weather data has led to the creation of two recent products from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa one estimating etref using north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas data hobbins 2016 and another product forecasting etref using the national digital forecast database ndfd called forecasted reference evapotranspiration fret palmer et al 2016 gridded etref is also actively being utilized in remote sensing et models such as the landsat based metric and eeflux models allen et al 2007 2015 kilic et al 2016 despite the increasing use of gridded weather data to estimate etref there is little information regarding the accuracy of etref estimates that are based on the gridded data and whether they can successfully replace estimates produced using ground based weather station data that represent weather in well watered agricultural settings an additional concern with using gridded data is that the standardized penman monteith method for computing etref assumes that the near surface profiles for air temperature humidity and wind speed are in equilibrium with the actively transpiring well watered surface represented by etref shuttleworth 2006 2007 shuttleworth et al 2009 lhomme et al 2015 asce 2005 2016 therefore if gridded data fail to capture the near surface air properties of agricultural areas etref will be estimated inaccurately two previous studies that computed etref using the fao56 asce standardized penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2015 asce 2005 with data from the nldas gridded weather data set have found that etref was often overestimated by the gridded data when compared to etref computed using agricultural weather stations in the western conterminous united states conus lewis et al 2014 moorhead et al 2015 the etref overestimation was the result of overestimation of near surface temperature solar radiation and wind speed and underestimation of vapor pressure in europe two reanalysis data sets the national center for environmental predictions national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar blended reanalysis and the era interim reanalysis were found to overestimate fao56 standardized reference et in the iberian peninsula martins et al 2017 and in portugal paredes et al 2018 respectively abatzoglou 2013 compared gridmet gridded data to data from 1618 weather stations and found that grass reference evapotranspiration computed with the fao56 asce penman monteith method and gridmet data showed a median bias of positive 0 5 mm d 1 these studies indicate a tendency for gridded data to overestimate etref there have been a variety of studies that have compared the gridded weather data variables involved in computing etref to weather station data myrick and horel 2006 abatzoglou 2013 decker et al 2012 mcevoy et al 2014 behnke et al 2016 slater 2016 walton and hall 2018 walton and hall 2018 noted that reanalysis based data sets like nldas tend to differ more strongly from station observations than gridded data sets derived from interpolated station data like prism and to some extent gridmet behnke et al 2016 evaluated eight gridded temperature products across the conus and discovered a negative bias in nldas maximum temperature but a stronger positive bias in minimum temperature agreeing with walton and hall s findings they found minimal bias in gridmet within typical summer temperature ranges we note that the behnke study included some weather stations that are not considered to represent well watered conditions as was mandated in the present study mcevoy et al 2014 showed that biases in air temperature for gridmet were dependent on terrain complexity decker et al 2012 found that at the six hour timestep the global land data assimilation system gldas overestimated temperature more often than it underestimated it at 33 sites in north america nldas gldas and the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr all overestimated incoming shortwave radiation at many locations in the conus according to slater 2016 the first objective of this study was to compare the near surface air temperature vapor pressure shortwave solar radiation and wind speed data from gridded data sets the data required for computing etref to weather station data obtained from agriculturally sited weather stations across the conus these comparisons helped to diagnose the causes of etref biases relative to etref calculated from weather station data special emphasis was placed on bias systematic error because random error tends to diminish when data are time averaged the second objective of this study was to compare estimates of etref made from several gridded data sets to etref made from agriculturally sited weather stations across the conus results of this conus wide analysis should be useful to applications utilizing gridded weather data to estimate etref since they represent a wide range of climatic characteristics comparisons for both objectives focused on the summer period june july and august because that is when plants are actively growing and etref values are at their highest and have the greatest impact on irrigation systems design hydrologic water balances and water scarcity the period of study was from 2013 through 2015 the gridded data sets analyzed in this research were gldas version 1 nldas phase 2 the climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 operational analysis the real time mesoscale analysis rtma the gridded surface meteorological data set from the university of idaho gridmet and the national digital forecast database ndfd all of these data sets are tied to reanalyses or operational analyses gridmet and ndfd are less tied to analyses than the other data sets gridmet is a hybrid data set depending on both analysis data nldas and the weather station interpolation based data set prism ndfd is unique because it is a forecast data set it is tied to rtma which provides the initial conditions for the forecasts 1 1 causes of differences between gridded and weather station data the causes of differences between gridded data and agricultural weather station measurements are either due to differences in what the data sets represent or due to error in one or both data sets even if gridded data perfectly represent each weather parameter in time and space there can still be apparent biases that occur because the gridded data may represent a larger area and different time period than the weather station data with which they are being compared for example large grid cell sizes may smooth out the smaller variations observed at weather station locations the problem of spatial representativity can arise in heterogeneous complex terrain the gridded weather data sets generally represent the weather conditions at the average elevation of a grid cell however air properties can change rapidly with elevation especially air temperature therefore if the elevation within the grid cell where the weather station is located is substantially different from the average grid cell elevation the gridded data may not represent what is desired in addition to the problem of spatial representativity there can be problems associated with temporal representativity some gridded data such as cfsv2 have a temporal resolution timestep as large as six hours given that many gridded weather data sets estimate instantaneous values occurring at each timestep a six hour timestep is analogous to using a six hour sampling rate all four parameters used to estimate etref air temperature humidity wind speed and solar radiation tend to vary substantially during a day and a six hour sampling rate may not adequately capture the variability coarse temporal resolutions could substantially reduce the accuracy of etref calculations another suspected source of differences between the data sets comes from biases in the data assimilated into the gridded data many of the ground based weather stations assimilated by analyses are located at airports in the conus air temperature can be increased and humidity decreased at airports because of the prevalence of paved and other non watered surfaces in the vicinities on pavement there is little to no moisture to vaporize so more solar energy is available to warm the air instead this is commonly known as the urban heat island effect bias is also expected because irrigation inputs have traditionally not been accounted for in the water balances of land surface models lsms used within data assimilation systems in arid areas where irrigation is prevalent the microclimate near the irrigated area is affected by the additional water input evapotranspiration made possible by the additional water inputs absorbs solar energy that in the nearby unirrigated areas warms the air instead the microclimate near the irrigated crops is therefore cooler and more humid than surrounding unirrigated land we refer to this effect as conditioning allen et al 2020 because the lsms often do not account for water inputs besides precipitation they tend to overestimate the air temperature and underestimate the humidity in irrigated regions lastly there are also likely to be biases within assimilation system models due to incorrect parameterizations unrepresented physics or inaccurate boundary forcings ménard 2010 1 2 gridded weather data sets the spatial and temporal attributes of gridded data evaluated in this study are shown in table 1 along with some of their other features 1 2 1 gldas both nldas and the gldas fall under the land data assimilation systems ldas project of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the ncep rodell 2020b the goal of the ldas is to produce lsm s uncoupled from atmospheric models to avoid biases due to coupling inadequate coupling can cause feedbacks that create systematic hydrologic error houser et al 2010 instead the lsm s are forced with high quality data sets derived from observations these meteorological forcing data sets were utilized in this study rather than the output of the lsms gldas is developed jointly by the nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and the ncep rodell et al 2004 the goal of gldas is to generate global high quality fields of land surface states and fluxes using lsms gldas version 1 derives its forcing fields primarily from the global data assimilation system gdas precipitation data are taken from disaggregated merged analysis of precipitation cmap and incoming radiation is derived from the air force weather agency afwa rodell 2020a 1 2 2 nldas nldas is produced by noaa ncep s environmental modeling center climate prediction center noaa nws office of hydrological development nasa s gfsc princeton university and the university of washington nldas like gldas seeks to produce high quality lsm data sets similar to gldas nldas produces forcing data by assimilating high quality observation based data nldas version 2 derives most of its forcing fields from the north american retrospective reanalysis gridded data set narr mesinger et al 2006 to create nldas narr is spatially and temporally disaggregated employing the methods presented in cosgrove et al 2003 nldas is kept up to date using the continuation of the narr called the r cdas precipitation is derived from a gauge only climate prediction center cpc analysis of daily precipitation orographically adjusted using the prism climatology nldas version 2 produces two different sets of forcing data in this study we focused on the traditional forcing fields in forcing file a 1 2 3 gridmet gridmet is produced at the university of idaho by combining the spatial attributes of prism data with temporal attributes of nldas version 2 abatzoglou 2013 in gridmet nldas weather data are spatially downscaled from their native 14 km grid to a 4 5 km grid and are upscaled from an hourly to a daily timestep monthly humidity air temperature and precipitation data in prism are used to bias correct the nldas data the climate data used to debias nldas are the prism 30 year monthly normals from 1981 2010 in essence the debiasing procedure aggregates nldas data to monthly values and compares the results with prism monthly values to create scaling factors that are then applied to the raw daily nldas data during our study period prism was ingesting data from several of the weather station networks used in this study this may have led to spuriously good performance in the comparisons because the data being verified were determined in part by the data they were being verified against however it should be noted that in gridmet only monthly prism climate normals were used to bias correct nldas in fact gridmet was validated against some of the prism input data in abatzoglou 2013 which was gridmet s founding paper 1 2 4 cfsv2 cfsv2 climate forecast system version 2 was developed by ncep to replace the cfsv1 saha et al 2014 the purpose of cfsv2 is to produce seasonal and subseasonal climate forecasts for the globe the development of cfsv2 began with the creation of the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 cfsr was produced using state of the art forecast and data assimilation techniques cfsv2 used the cfsr analysis as initial conditions for retrospective forecasts forecasts made from points of time in the past where the forecasted time period has since passed the retrospective forecasts were used to calibrate the model for real time forecasts the cfsr was continued as the real time operational climate data assimilation system cdasv2 to provide initial conditions for the cfsv2 forecasts the assimilation system of cfsv2 is frozen much like the r cdas behind nldas this might seem odd because assimilation systems serving forecasts are usually updated on occasion to improve their accuracy however because cfsv2 is a climate model temporal consistency is paramount and updating the system would likely create inconsistency saha et al 2014 the cfsr completed production in 2009 so the models and assimilation techniques of that time are still being used in this study the examined data were taken from the climate data assimilation system version 2 cdasv2 which is often referred to as the cfsv2 operational analysis we use the term cfsv2 to refer to the cdasv2 data set 1 2 5 ndfd the national digital forecast database ndfd glahn and ruth 2003 is a product of the national weather service nws that began distribution in 2003 as a means to provide public access to weather forecasts from a central digital source weather forecast offices wfos produce regional forecasted grids of sensible weather elements that are mosaicked together on a central server forecasters have the ability to manually adjust the forecast grids produced by the numerical forecast myrick and horel 2006 the nominal spatial resolution of the gridded elements is five km and the temporal resolution is three hours for short range forecasts with lead times less than three days and six hours for longer range forecasts with lead times of three to seven days glahn and ruth 2003 in late august of 2015 the ndfd increased its spatial resolution to two and a half km and its short range forecast temporal resolution to one hour the forecast is produced for the conus puerto rico hawaii guam and alaska rtma described in the next section and is often used to initialize and verify ndfd forecasts de pondeca et al 2011 1 2 6 rtma the real time mesoscale analysis rtma is produced by ncep the earth system research laboratory esrl and the national environmental satellite and data information service nesdis de pondeca et al 2011 the most prominent application of rtma is to help initialize and verify ndfd forecasts rtma has a spatial resolution of roughly two and a half km and a temporal resolution of one hour matching ndfd as its name suggests rtma is published in real time making it useful for computing etref in near real time for example for use in irrigation scheduling kilic 2017 rtma does not directly estimate shortwave solar radiation it began publishing total cloud cover the variable used in this study to derive solar radiation in april 2015 before that time rtma published cloud cover estimates that were based on the geostationary operation environmental satellite system goes deriving solar radiation from those earlier values was not tested in this study as a result only 2015 data are used in this study rtma assimilates data from a vast number of ground based weather stations including many of the networks providing ground based data used in this study is under continual improvement and periodically assimilates new data sources as indicated for gridmet using weather stations to verify a gridded product created using those same weather stations can cause an overstatement of accuracy due to a lack of complete independence despite this stations in networks that are assimilated into rtma were used due to the difficulty of finding unassimilated networks the lack of independence of data sets may not be as problematic as it appears during assimilation the modeled weather values are not simply replaced with observed values but rather a statistical algorithm decides how the two information sources should be blended the result is that a comparison of assimilated stations to the gridded product assimilating them can still help to identify biases that exist between the two data sets secondly rtma ingests many stations for example a single temperature analysis for 1500 utc 20 november 2009 used 14 299 stations de pondeca et al 2011 this means that the analysis would probably change little if the rtma assimilated weather stations used as ground truth in this study had not been assimilated into rtma 2 methods 2 1 weather station selection weather stations across the conus were selected from mostly agriculturally oriented automated weather station networks the networks evaluated were primarily state or regional networks such as the cimis agrimet and hprcc networks and did not include the noaa asos network since a majority of its stations are located at or near airports that have dry nonreference conditions the final selection of 103 ground based weather stations representing a geographical coverage of the conus was guided by several considerations efforts were made to select weather stations representing what we refer to as reference conditions because those are the conditions under which etref estimates are the most valid allen et al 1998 asce 2005 2016 and where differences between gridded and station data may be more pronounced some exceptions were made to produce more complete geographical coverage of the conus reference conditions presume that the underlying land surface is evapotranspiring at or near reference et rates and therefore the near surface air properties are conditioned by the et rates they tend to occur in arid and semiarid climates only where there is irrigated agriculture which is also where etref estimates are commonly applied for irrigation water management selected weather stations were required to measure all variables evaluated air temperature humidity shortwave solar radiation and wind speed at a maximum timestep of one hour for the evaluation period of 2013 through 2015 furthermore station networks with free open data access were preferred to networks requiring payment reference conditions can be difficult to find or verify to help identify the likelihood of reference conditions the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was computed for the area surrounding each station ndvi is calculated as 1 n d v i ρ n i r ρ v i s ρ n i r ρ v i s where ρ is reflectance nir refers to the near infrared band and vis refers to the visible red band although ndvi can be high for vegetation suffering acute temporary water stress low ndvi generally indicates a lack of green actively transpiring vegetation a high ndvi is a necessary but not completely sufficient indication of reference conditions despite that limitation ndvi was used as the primary tool for identifying stations that were likely to be near reference conditions the approach to selecting weather stations was iterative first average ndvi for the warm season months of april through september was calculated for each study year from modis mcd43a4 16 day surface reflectance composites using the google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 modis stands for moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and is an instrument aboard the nasa terra and aqua satellites schaaf and wang 2015 monthly values were extracted from the 500 m pixels over the station locations these single pixel values at the station locations are referred to as local ndvi an average of all 500 m pixels within 2 km of the stations termed areal ndvi was also computed the means and standard deviations of all monthly ndvi s point and areal were calculated and stations having a mean point and areal ndvi less than 0 4 were discarded only the areal ndvi was used as a criterion for stations having reported coordinates rounded to the hundredths of a degree because of the uncertainty of the actual station location after removing stations having low ndvi the best stations in terms of ndvi in the geographic regions desired were selected this procedure involved some judgment weighting between ndvi the location and the variability in the ndvi once candidate stations were selected satellite images from google earth and ground based images from google maps https www google com maps or taken by the station network were consulted if available to further judge the suitability of station surroundings to represent reference or near reference conditions each station was evaluated to eliminate those having major obstructions and to include those having relatively uniform low vegetation extending in nearly all directions for approximately 100 times the height of the temperature and humidity sensors if the removal of a station due to insufficient surroundings caused a large region of conus to go unrepresented another station was selected from among the available stations even if the alternative did not fully exhibit reference conditions doubling back to replace stations constituted the iterative portion of the process poor quality data from a station were also grounds for choosing an alternative station the final set of weather stations contained some stations that are surrounded by trees for example in the northeast us and others that had low ndvi because there were no alternative weather stations found in those regions that had better characteristics weather station data were downloaded from fifteen sources that represented thirteen different weather station networks table 2 most networks provided an online data access service a total of 103 stations were selected for comparisons with gridded data based on filtering procedures previously described these stations were located in 41 us states and all us climate regions fig 1 basic metadata were retrieved for each station including the heights of the anemometer the heights of the air temperature and humidity instruments and the station latitude longitude and elevation table 2 shows the networks and data sources accessed 2 2 data processing the processing for the weather data comparison was aimed at assessing how well the gridded data represent what they intend to represent the processing for the etref data comparison was aimed at evaluating how well the gridded data could match station based etref estimates processing efforts attempted to minimize elaborate measures to augment the gridded data the objectives necessitated two different processing schemes as illustrated in fig 2 to evaluate how well the gridded weather data represent what they intend to hourly average station data were linearly interpolated to simulate the gridded instantaneous measurements and were downsampled to match the gridded data temporal resolutions the intent was to minimize differences between the data sets caused by mismatch in temporal representativity in order to evaluate how well etref computed from gridded data could compare to station based etref the weather station data were treated as they would normally be treated to compute daily etref that is no downsampling was performed some gridded data sets needed to be modified to produce average shortwave solar radiation a required variable for computing etref theoretical clear sky radiation was used to convert instantaneous gridded observations of shortwave radiation to average daily estimates one issue with the processing scheme is that it makes the results of the weather comparison less comparable with the results of the etref comparison by matching the temporal representativity of the gridded data the weather comparison could understate the differences remaining between the weather variables in the etref comparison however performance statistics were also computed for the weather variables using the etref processing scheme and there was almost no difference between the results therefore we present the results computed as outlined in fig 2 and assert that the performance statistics for the weather variables are diagnostic of the etref performance statistics unlike the other variables weather station air temperature was not downsampled to match the gridded data temporal resolutions for the weather comparison for both comparisons daily mean temperature was computed as the average of the daily minimum and maximum temperatures minimum and maximum daily temperatures were available for all weather stations and for some gridded weather data sets for gldas nldas and rtma minimum and maximum temperatures were selected from their instantaneous temperature values rtma and nldas have one hour timesteps but gldas has a three hour timestep the large gldas timestep means that it will likely understate the daily temperature extremes the weather station data were subjected to quality assurance and quality control qaqc by plotting them for visual inspection the visual inspection of the data followed the guidelines suggested in allen 1996 and asce 2005 data that were suspected of being in error were set to a null value solar radiation was corrected using the algorithm in the ref et qaqc software according to theoretical radiation occurring under clear sky conditions allen and li 2016 an effort was made to reduce some of the differences in spatial representativity between gridded and weather station data by reconciling the vertical spatial representativity gridded air temperature was lapsed to the weather station elevations using the international standard atmosphere lapse rate of 6 5 c per 1000 m cosgrove et al 2003 vapor pressure was converted to relative humidity and then converted back to vapor pressure using the lapsed temperature following cosgrove et al 2003 wind speed data were standardized to a 2 meter height using a logarithmic wind profile equation that assumes neutral boundary layer conditions asce 2005 data for the weather data comparisons and etref comparisons were aggregated to a daily timestep for all variables a day is a typical time period over which etref is computed and it is often the shortest period in which water management decisions are made in addition 24 hs was the smallest common timestep among all data sets aggregation and analysis were performed on local standard time for all gridded data except ndfd and gridmet the smallest gridmet timestep available for download is one day with data coordinated with central standard time cst therefore weather station data were aggregated using cst to align with gridmet ndfd is based on coordinated universal time utc and the weather station data with which ndfd were paired were aggregated on utc the last step in data processing was to compute alfalfa etref etr using the standardized penman monteith equation asce 2005 2016 in our case we selected the alfalfa reference crop type of asce to approximate maximum expected et rates under reference conditions however comparison results would be similar for the grass reference method of fao56 allen et al 1998 the daily etref equation was coded in python and verified by comparing calculations with the ref et software of the university of idaho allen and li 2016 additional processing details specific to each gridded data set are provided in appendix b 2 3 performance statistics the mean squared error mse and its variations e g nash sutcliffe efficiency are commonly used to evaluate the performance of hydrologic models by comparison to observed data gupta et al 2009 presented a decomposition of mse into a function of variance bias and correlation a combination of those components is presented as the kling gupta efficiency kge model estimates perfectly match observations when kge is equal to 1 kge is defined as 2 k g e 1 e d 3 e d r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 4 α σ m σ o 5 β μ m μ o 6 r y o y m y o y m n y o 2 y o 2 n y m 2 y m 2 n the subscript m refers to modeled gridded data and the subscript o refers to the observed weather station data ed stands for the euclidean distance from the ideal point in the scaled space gupta et al 2009 α is the ratio of the modeled data standard deviation to the observed data standard deviation we call this variability error β is the ratio of the modeled data mean to the observed data mean a measure of bias and r is the pearson correlation coefficient kge suffers from two weaknesses the first is that r is bounded from 1 to 1 while α and β can take on any real value this means that kge can become dominated by the values of α or β if model results have substantially different behavior than observations the other weakness is that the kge is larger if the model underestimates α or β than if it overestimates them it should be noted that all performance metrics have weaknesses and no metric is best for all purposes kge and its components were selected as the primary metrics for comparison because each component highlights a unique type of difference between the data sets furthermore each component is transparently present in the overall kge while remaining obscured in the mse and nse gupta et al 2009 the kge and its components were computed for the summer season defined as june july and august for each study year and for the pooled study years summer was selected because it is the primary growing season in the conus and is also the period when et is greatest groups for computing statistics were required to have at least 50 non missing data for example if more than half of the data for a particular weather station were missing for the 2013 2015 summer seasons the kge value for that station was set to a null value results are primarily presented as boxplots of kge and its components plots either show statistics computed for the summer season pooled across all study years or statistics computed for summer 2015 only so that rtma which does not have summer data for 2013 or 2014 could be compared to the other data sets boxplots are in the style of tukey which shows the median as the centerline the first quartile as the bottom of the box the third quartile as the top of the box and the whiskers as extending to the last observation within 1 5 times the interquartile range data points beyond the whiskers are shown as solid round symbols ideally values for α β and r should be close to 1 0 maps showing the gridded data set with the highest kge at each station location are also presented rtma was omitted from the maps because it was the best performing data set at most stations for all variables so the maps would have become less informative if rtma had been included ndfd was omitted from the maps because it is a forecast data set and therefore serves a different purpose than the other data sets maps of conus showing spatial bias and standard deviation of error are presented in the supplemental materials 3 results discussion 3 1 weather parameter comparisons 3 1 1 near surface air temperature the air temperature biases tended to be positive for all gridded data sets for the bulk of the weather stations confirming what was found in previous studies as shown in fig 3 the median of the station biases ranged from positive 0 54 c for gridmet to positive 2 3 c for nldas the median of the station correlations ranged from 0 87 for gridmet or 0 65 for ndfd day 7 if considering forecasts to 0 97 for rtma gridmet median bias was smallest among the gridded data sets excluding rtma gridmet also had the smallest variability error the improved performance over nldas one of gridmet s parent products is clear for each kge component except correlation the median of the station correlations for gridmet temperature was slightly below the correlation for nldas the lower correlation may be related to the debiasing procedure applied to nldas during production of gridmet fig 5 shows the stability of the kge performance across the study years the relative performance of each data set seems constant except for gridmet which performed relatively poorly for 2013 this anomaly caused gldas to be the best performer for that year when we restricted our view to only 2015 data so that rtma could be included in the comparisons rtma became the top performer the gridmet correlation was better than the nldas correlation for 2015 fig 4 suggesting that the low gridmet kge for 2013 might have been primarily due to a low correlation during that year the success of rtma was not surprising given that the assimilation system is being continually improved and assimilates a large quantity of weather station data ndfd one day lead time forecasts performed well relative to the analysis data sets they had generally better performance than nldas in all three kge components one of the main differences in the pattern of error for ndfd relative to the analysis data sets was that the forecasts tended to underestimate variability while the analysis data sets typically overestimated it there was a modest increase in bias from the one day to seven day lead times but the increase in error was mostly correlation and variability error reflecting greater uncertainty about the more distant future fig 6 shows top performing near surface air temperature data sets other than rtma and ndfd ranked by kge computed using summertime daily data pooled across all study years for the 103 stations gldas and gridmet dominated most of the us in terms of kge performance gridmet would likely be the top performing data set at more locations if its 2013 kge were improved note that rtma and ndfd are not included in fig 6 even though they were often the best performing this was done so that regional trends in performances by the other data sets can be viewed 3 1 2 vapor pressure vapor pressure bias was negative for more stations than it was positive for all gridded data sets maps of bias provided in the supplemental materials show that bias was more negative in western states this was expected because the lower boundary layer of the atmosphere tends to gain humidity when it is in contact with wetter surfaces which in this study existed for many of the western us weather station locations due to their irrigated surroundings the gridded data sets do not typically account for irrigation and its effect on humidity and therefore underestimate the median of the station biases ranged from negative 6 2 for gridmet to 0 0 for rtma the median of the station correlations ranged from 0 82 for gridmet or 0 61 for ndfd day 7 if considering forecasts to 0 98 for rtma vapor pressure data did not show clear winners across conus among the analysis data sets for periods that excluded rtma fig 7 gldas performed best for 2013 and 2014 with its median above or near the top of the other data sets third quartile fig 9 in 2015 the distributions overlapped more significantly it is interesting to observe that the procedure used to debias nldas humidity in gridmet does not seem to have improved gridmet s performance over nldas in representing the humidity of conditioned environments rtma generally had the best performance among all gridded data sets for all kge components during the summer of 2015 fig 8 ndfd likely benefiting from its relationship to rtma performed better than the analysis data sets for the one day lead time fig 10 3 1 3 wind speed the median of the station biases for wind speed was generally positive for all gridded data sets and ranged from a median bias of positive 13 for cfsv2 to positive 41 for gridmet fig 11 the boxplots for nldas and gridmet were similar because gridmet only modified nldas by resampling it to a smaller spatial scale the median of the station correlations ranged from 0 68 for gridmet or 0 31 for ndfd day 7 if considering forecast data to 0 83 for rtma perhaps not surprisingly wind speed had the lowest correlations of all the weather variables which demonstrates that gridded data have some difficulty in representing actual local wind speed on a daily timescale other studies have also noted that gridded data sets have difficulty in matching station wind speed measurements decker et al 2012 lewis et al 2014 martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018 wind speed is also the weather parameter that suffers most from biases induced by local conditions including blockage by buildings trees and tall crops and failing anemometers asce 2016 the outliers in the boxplot show some stations with very low correlations even some negative correlations indicating that the gridded data had poor ability to represent day to day wind speeds at some locations fig 13 showing the changes in kge by year shows very little variation in kge over the study years the boxplot for summer 2015 fig 12 shows that rtma had smaller distributions for β and α than for the other data sets ndfd bias and variability error improved from the one day lead time to the seven day lead time but were balanced out by a lower correlation the reduction in bias for the seven day lead time is an unexpected finding for which we have no explanation fig 14 maps top performing wind speed data sets other than rtma and ndfd ranked by kge computed using summertime daily data pooled across all study years for the 103 stations cfsv2 gldas and nldas were relatively evenly distributed across the conus as the top performers for estimating wind speed maps of bias included in the supplemental materials showed that cfsv2 tended to underestimate wind speed at many locations in the western half of the country and overestimate it in the eastern half gridmet and nldas tended to overestimate wind speed more strongly in the eastern half of the country than in the western half these spatial patterns could be due to the more forested landscape present in the eastern half of the country forested land cover may make wind speed more difficult to accurately model and it may also affect the wind being measured at the weather stations 3 1 4 solar radiation solar radiation estimates were positively biased for all analysis data sets at most stations the median of the station biases ranged from positive 10 in rtma or positive 0 3 including ndfd to positive 12 in gldas the slater 2016 study described earlier corrected daily solar radiation data for the point weather stations whereas we corrected the hourly observed data based on theoretical clear sky solar radiation curves while correction of solar radiation data for measurement bias can be more accurately done on an hourly basis asce 2005 2016 correcting hourly data did allow any reductions in radiation near dawn and dusk due to topography or vegetation shading to persist letting those reductions remain may have reduced our average daily solar radiation estimates by a small amount relative to slater s estimates hence the larger biases found in our study slater s study may therefore be a better account of the gridded data s true error that is differences from what the data attempt to represent nevertheless our study likely better represents the radiation actually impacting each site and therefore the true relative error the boxplot for all study years fig 15 shows that gridmet and nldas underestimated the variability in solar radiation at nearly every station like wind speed gridmet merely resamples nldas to a finer grid thus the results for the two data sets are similar gldas underestimated variability at more stations than it overestimated it cfsv2 was more evenly split between overestimation and underestimation of variability but overestimated at more stations the results from decker et al 2012 suggest that both cfsv2 and gldas may overestimate variability more often than they underestimate it this conflicts with our findings for gldas but it could be explained by station selection that differed between our studies examining the boxplot for the summer of 2015 fig 16 rtma had a positive bias that was close to the other gridded data sets but it had a better correlation the main difference between the solar radiation in the ndfd derived from sky cover using perez et al 2007 and using doorenbos and pruitt 1977 as described in appendix b was in the variability error the perez et al 2007 method exhibited a substantial improvement in the variability error when estimating solar radiation for rtma and ndfd gridded data sets this is visible in both box plots figs 15 and 16 the kge stability plot fig 17 shows that gldas generally performed best for all three study years excluding rtma solar radiation correlation in nldas was lower than found by lewis et al 2014 because they conducted their analysis on an hourly timestep hourly data produce a better correlation because of the regularity of the solar diurnal cycle whereas averaging solar radiation to daily values removes the diurnal cycle and makes correlations more dependent on accurately representing cloudiness the median of the station correlations for solar radiation ranged from 0 76 for gridmet or 0 37 for ndfd day 7 if including forecasts to 0 91 for rtma ndfd generally had less bias than the other gridded data sets including rtma if the use of the sky cover to solar radiation conversion equations were the cause of the small bias one would expect rtma to mirror the bias in ndfd however this was not the case in addition one would expect solar radiation estimates made from sky cover to worsen biases however in this case ndfd had the smallest bias fig 18 shows maps of solar radiation data sets other than rtma and ndfd ranked by kge computed using summertime daily data pooled across all study years for the 103 stations gldas dominated the center of the conus with cfsv2 dominating the ne and rocky mountains and sharing the pacific states with gldas maps of bias included in the supplemental materials showed that gridmet nldas gldas and rtma all have a more strongly positive bias in the eastern half of the country one possible explanation is that the eastern us tends to have more cloud cover than the western half in addition eastern weather stations tend to be located in forested areas and that the trees could shelter station pyranometers towards dawn and dusk 3 2 reference evapotranspiration computed etref using a 24 h timestep had a positive bias for all gridded data at most weather stations fig 19 the median of the station biases ranged from positive 13 for rtma computed with doorenbos and pruitt or 12 for ndfd day 1 if considering forecasts to positive 31 for nldas the median of the station correlations ranged from 0 70 for nldas or 0 37 for ndfd day 7 if considering forecasts to 0 92 for rtma computed with the perez et al method for calculating solar radiation the relatively large overestimation of etref is a concern for use of these estimates for irrigation water resources and water rights management essentially all four weather components had biases that tend to cause etref to be overestimated these include positive biases in solar radiation air temperature and wind speed and a negative bias in vapor pressure all of which increase the computed etref as illustrated in fig 19 etref variability was overestimated at a majority of stations for all gridded data except ndfd with a seven day lead time and ndfd where solar radiation was estimated from the doorenbos and pruitt relationship with a one day lead time fig 20 shows that ndfd and rtma computed with doorenbos and pruitt equally overestimated and underestimated variability in etref and that rtma computed with perez et al overestimated the variability this is an interesting result because it shows that using solar radiation computed using perez et al resulted in higher variability error in etref the underestimation of variability by the doorenbos and pruitt equation might balance out an overestimation of variability in another variable e g wind speed this highlights the complex interplay between the input error when computing etref a more accurate estimation of any particular weather variable does not necessarily result in a better estimate of etref the boxplot spanning all study years fig 19 shows that gldas generally had the highest correlation and lowest variability error among the analysis data sets but all the distributions substantially overlap the boxplot of summer 2015 fig 20 shows that rtma had the best performance in each kge component for most stations fig 21 shows that gldas etr performed better for 2013 and 2014 than it did for 2015 that temporal pattern aligns with the pattern in figs 5 and 9 where air temperature and vapor pressure kge for gldas were worse for 2015 gridmet s etref performance for 2013 was much worse than for 2014 and 2015 which aligns with its poor air temperature performance for 2013 fig 22 maps top performing etref data sets other than rtma and ndfd ranked by kge computed using summertime daily data pooled across all study years gldas corresponded best to station estimated etref in the eastern half of conus and a mixture of gldas cfsv2 and gridmet were best performers in the western half of conus gldas s success in the east is because of its excellent relative performance in that region when estimating solar radiation and air temperature rtma had the highest kge at the majority of stations in the 2015 ranking map fig 23 3 3 summary every gridded data set tended to overestimate etref at most weather station locations this is the result of a tendency to overestimate wind speed solar radiation and air temperature and to underestimate vapor pressure as compared to the agricultural weather stations rtma generally had the best kge for all weather variables and etref we attribute this good performance to the large amount of surface weather data assimilated into rtma and the fact that rtma is an operational analysis and therefore subject to continual improvement ndfd is often initialized and verified using rtma ndfd based etref bias was similar to the rtma bias possibly as a result of their relationship the bias of ndfd remained steady between the one and seven day lead times for etref but the correlations dipped from a median of 0 77 using the perez et al 2007 method to convert cloud cover to solar radiation at the one day lead time to 0 37 at the seven day lead time the variability error shifted from both underestimating and overestimating variability to predominantly underestimating variability for the seven day lead time in short there was large etref uncertainty at the seven day lead time among the analysis data sets the accuracy of etref estimated by gldas was second best to rtma this is attributed to gldas ingesting data from the gdas system which like rtma is an operational analysis third place was essentially a tie between cfsv2 and gridmet gridmet weather variables performed similarly to nldas weather variables except for air temperature which was more accurately estimated by gridmet due its bias correction based on the station interpolated prism data set except for the summer of 2013 gridmet had more accurate and reference like air temperature estimates than nldas cfsv2 and gldas the good performance of estimated air temperature is what allowed gridmet to be equivalent to cfsv2 in the overall etref performance the cfsv2 is similar to nldas because it uses a frozen assimilation system but the assimilation system used in cfsv2 is more modern than the one used in nldas which helps explain why it performed better than nldas despite having coarser spatial and temporal resolutions nldas produced the most biased estimates of etref likely because it derives its data from the continuation of a 2003 reanalysis narr r cdas it is important to note that the gridded weather data sets may exhibit better accuracy less bias when compared to weather data sets that better represent the overall ambient region and climate our study focused on weather data collected from locations that were likely to exhibit the cooling and humidifying conditioning characteristics associated with well watered vegetation this focus was intentional because standardized etref equations such as the fao56 and asce penman monteith method have been developed to expect weather data that reflect conditions above a reference or near reference surface application of etref equations to weather data collected over dry surfaces causes overstatement of the actual etref allen et al 1998 asce 2005 2016 4 conclusions this study evaluated the abilities of several gridded weather data products to estimate etref for conditioned reference environments by comparing etref computed with those data sets to etref computed with weather measurements from ground based weather stations located in predominately near reference actively evapotranspiring conditions daily vapor pressure near surface air temperature shortwave solar radiation and wind speed the variables used to compute etref were also compared between the gridded and station data sets the results focused on the summer season defined as june july and august because this is the primary season during which etref is most used in irrigation and water rights management computed etref from all gridded weather data sets had a positive bias at most weather stations the median of the station biases ranged from a low of positive 13 for rtma computed with doorenbos and pruitt or 12 for ndfd day 1 if considering forecasts to high of positive 31 for nldas the relatively large overestimation of etref is a concern for use of these estimates for irrigation and water resources management all four weather components had biases that tend to cause etref to be overestimated these include positive biases in solar radiation air temperature and wind speed and a negative bias in vapor pressure gridded data that leaned most heavily on station based data gridmet temperature and all rtma variables performed best in the comparisons notably gldas and cfsv2 the coarsest spatial resolution data sets performed better than nldas and in some cases gridmet indicating that spatial resolution was not a deciding factor in the degree of correspondence with station data this study makes it clear that gridded data should be carefully examined before being used in applications techniques for conditioning and adjusting gridded weather data sets to remove biases will be useful in producing estimates for etref that can be used in irrigation and water rights management and remote sensing et models an example of a theoretical approach for adjusting gridded weather data to reflect a reference et environment that uses boundary layer profile theory is described in this special issue by allen et al 2020 declaration of competing interest the authors

sets gldas gldas data were downloaded from the goddard earth sciences data and information services center https disc gsfc nasa gov the data are stored in grib files grib stands for grided binary which is a standardized file format devised by the world meteorological organization wmo for storing weather data grib files were downloaded for the noah model with 0 25 spatial resolution and a three hour time step only the noah model files contain parameters at the spatial resolution of 0 25 degrees each file contains raster grids for all the forcing fields and lsm fields valid for one timestep table b1 average three hour solar radiation data were produced for gldas by first calculating three hour average clear sky radiation then instantaneous clear sky radiation was computed for the time series finally the hourly average clear sky radiation was multiplied by the ratio of gldas instantaneous radiation to the instantaneous clear sky radiation this ratio represents the impact of clouds during the three hour period the morning and evening hours can produce ratios of gldas radiation to clear sky radiation much larger than 1 therefore these ratios were set to 1 before computing the hourly averaged solar radiation for the etref comparisons we picked the minimum and maximum air temperatures within a given day from gldas this could cause a bias that varies with the time zone however one purpose of the etref comparisons was to evaluate how well the gridded data can estimate etref without using any elaborate methods to augment the gridded data nldas the nldas data were gathered from the goddard earth sciences data and information services center grib files of forcing data set were programmatically downloaded with 0 125 spatial resolution and a one hour timestep like gldas each file contains data for all fields for each timestep table b2 daily minimum and maximum air temperatures were selected from among the hourly instantaneous temperature estimates for the calculation of etref the hourly average solar radiation was estimated using the same procedure described for gldas nldas data were then aggregated to daily values on local time gridmet gridmet data were downloaded from the google earth engine platform which serves as a repository for gridmet data the imagecollection id was idaho epscor gridmet data were accessed on february 7th 2017 gridmet processing was relatively simple compared to the other gridded data sets since it is a daily data set and no aggregations were necessary due to the nature of the data only one time series was produced for etref evaluation and weather data comparison table b3 cfsv2 cfsv2 data were also extracted from the google earth engine platform earth engine ingests several surface meteorological parameters from the noaa cfsv2 operational analysis six hourly surface and radiative flux grib files the imagecollection id was noaa cfsv2 for6h data were accessed february 7th 2017 table b4 the cfsv2 files ingested by earth engine are not analysis files but rather are forecast files the analysis files contain only eight variables and are missing several of the variables investigated in this study the forecast files ingested into earth engine show what has been estimated by the model before being updated with observational data each forecast file was produced by forecasting 6 h ahead of the previous analysis cfsv2 data already contain average solar radiation values so they did not need to be computed cfsv2 contains minimum and maximum air temperatures within each six hour window that are timestamped at the start of the six hour period at 0000utc 0600utc 1200utc and 1800utc daily minimum and maximum air temperatures were selected from the six hour minimum and six hour maximum temperatures for the day after converting times to local times ndfd the historical ndfd data were gathered from the noaa national operational model archive and distribution system nomads https www ncdc noaa gov data access model data nomads provides an ftp server to download archived ndfd forecasts stored in grib files ndfd data spanned the full study period but had significant gaps especially during 2015 for ndfd each grib file represents a forecast from either one to three or four to seven days for each weather parameter the files contain bands of data each band is a raster representing the weather parameter for a single forecast valid time ndfd forecasts are published roughly every hour the last forecast and second to last forecast of each upcoming day were downloaded programmatically from the ftp server in order to obtain the most accurate forecast for the following days these forecasts were the most accurate because they were initialized as near as possible to the beginning of the forecasted days of interest the second to last forecast of the day was only downloaded for parameters whose three day lead time forecasts use 3 hr timesteps because the last forecast of the day did not forecast the first hour of the following day table b5 forecast accuracy generally decreases with the lead time of the forecast a homogenous forecast data set therefore requires not only that forecasts represent the same time in the future but that the forecasts are made for the same lead time the data were filtered to meet these requirements the files were filtered according to metadata stored within the grib files for files forecasting one to three day lead times the criteria for filtering were that the first forecast should be for 0000 utc on day 1 and the first forecast duration should be one hour that is the forecasted values were predicted from one hour prior for files forecasting the four to seven day lead times the criteria for filtering were that the first forecast should be for 0600 utc on day four and the first forecast duration should be three days and six hours only files meeting these criteria were used to preserve temporal consistency the ndfd data were aggregated to daily values on utc time since aggregating the data on different conus time zones would have mixed data from different ndfd forecasts together with the effect of having some time zones with longer lead time forecasts than others time zones having more values from longer forecasts would produce larger apparent error ndfd despite having timestamps on utc determines the daily minimum and maximum temperature based on local time as previously discussed daily minimum and maximum temperature should usually be the same whether found on local time or utc time so the ndfd minimum and maximum temperatures were used for each day of ndfd data the values at the start of the day timestamped 0000 and at the very end of the day timestamped 0000 on the next day were included in the aggregated daily averages but those values were given half weight because they were on the edges of the averaging bin ndfd timestamps evenly subdivide a utc day ndfd does not contain shortwave solar radiation values but instead reports sky cover two equations were taken from the literature that map sky cover to solar radiation those equations were used to estimate average radiation the quality of the derived solar radiation data was evaluated the ndfd fret uses an equation developed from the fao24 publication by doorenbos and pruitt 1977 to compute solar radiation from sky cover c palmer personal communication november 9 2016 the equation is r s 0 25 0 50 0 0083 s k y c o v e r 0 9659 r a where rs is the estimated solar radiation and ra is the computed extra terrestrial solar radiation we compared the results using the doorenbos and pruitt equation to the results using an empirical equation developed in perez et al 2007 specifically for ndfd r s r a 1 0 87 s k y c o v e r 100 1 9 sky cover was linearly interpolated temporally to simulate the average sky cover for each timestep before being used in the equations the perez et al equation is expected to be worse for the seven day forecast than for the three day forecast because the equation was fit to one to three day forecasts only perez et al 2010 one detail discovered late in our research was that ndfd changed to a finer spatial scale from five km to the rtma grid of two and half km on august 19 2014 at that same time for forecasts out to the three day lead time wind speed dew point and sky cover become available at a one hour timestep ideally the finer ndfd should be analyzed separately from the coarser resolution ndfd but to simplify the study the one hour data were sampled at a three hour increment to match the older data rtma rtma data did not cover the entire study period of 2013 through 2015 the data including a sky cover variable equivalent to what is present in ndfd began to be produced in mid april of 2015 so that date was used as the start of the rtma data analyzed in this study rtma data came from two sources one source was an ncep ftp server that provides recently produced rtma data ftp ftp ncep noaa gov pub data nccf com rtma prod rtma grib files were downloaded from this server in near real time because the server only provides the mostly recently produced rtma data older data are deleted from the server the other data source was google earth engine which has collected historical rtma data at our request since june 18 of 2015 the imagecollection id was noaa nws rtma the download date was february 7 2017 the values for pixels overlying the weather station locations in both data sets were extracted afterward the two time series were joined rtma data were processed in a manner similar to nldas the other hourly instantaneous data set except that rtma contains a total cloud cover sky cover variable and no solar radiation table b6 rtma solar radiation like ndfd radiation was estimated using doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and perez et al 2007 relationships

contamination mainly due to increase in the available p proportion in addition p concentrations in the leachate indicate that high and frequent ps doses should be avoided in sandy soils keywords leaching loss soluble p available p particulate p environmental contamination 1 introduction the use of pig slurry ps as organic source of plant nutrients is a widespread practice adopted by farmers living in southern brazil lourenzi et al 2016 couto et al 2017 tiecher et al 2017 as well as in several agricultural areas worldwide pig slurry constitution often presents significant phosphorus p amounts thus ps may be an alternative to minimize the use of industrialized phosphate fertilizers since natural p reserves tend to significantly decrease in the coming decades cordell et al 2009 according to estimates brazil produces approximately 123 103 mg of p per year in ps tiecher et al 2014 however pig farms are often small in size a fact that restricts the area suitable for ps applications this factor leads to successive ps applications in the same area and it causes p accumulation in these soils ceretta et al 2010a lourenzi et al 2015 tiecher et al 2017 couto et al 2018 boitt et al 2018 phosphorus in the soil can be adsorbed by surface functional groups of reactive particles such as iron and aluminum oxides and form highly stable inner sphere complexes however with respect to crop systems where p addition is higher than its adsorption and export functional groups of higher p affinity to soil are gradually saturated a fact that decreases p binding energy and increases its availability this phenomenon is intensified in the top soil layer mainly when crops are managed under no tillage system ceretta et al 2010b lourenzi et al 2015 tiecher et al 2017 since soil disturbance only happens in the sowing furrows and fertilization is based on soil volume smaller than that of conventional tillage system rheinheimer and anghinoni 2001 generally ps presents over 90 of p in its inorganic forms readily available to plant uptake tiecher et al 2014 thus the most reactive sites on soil surface may form saturation regions that retain low binding energy phosphate parfitt 1989 the saturation of surface layer adsorption sites and the continuous application of large bioavailable p amounts in these layers can downward these elements migration into the soil and increase their concentration in deeper layers ceretta et al 2010b pig slurry application in no tillage systems also increases the level of other nutrients in the soil adeli et al 2008 lourenzi et al 2016 resulting in higher crop dry matter production lourenzi et al 2014a and greater amount of root biopores this increases organic matter content in the soil improving soil physical features and increases water infiltration in soil profile lourenzi et al 2015 which combined with soil p saturation may increase the movement of p to deeper soil layers maximizing the risk of p transfer to groundwater since p content increase in the soil is associated with ps application dose and frequency just as the amount of leachate is associated with rainfall volume and frequency different p forms are lost in the leachate throughout succession plantings depending on their reactivity to soil particles therefore it is necessary carrying out studies focused on investigating the total amount of lost p due to surface runoff or leaching as well as different p forms found in the solution in order to enable inferring about its reactivity and water contamination potential lourenzi et al 2015 however field studies focused on evaluating p forms in leachate remain scarce especially on sandy soils that cover approximately 900 million hectares worldwide yost and hartemink 2019 and nowadays are suffering a huge pressure of use due to the great demand for food in face of the growth of the global population simon et al 2020 these sandy soils are naturally more fragile and due to the low p sorption capacity they increase the risk of transferring p to water table but as not all of the lost p is in bioavailable forms it is necessary to know in which form this p is transferred in order to estimate the potential for contamination of subsurface waters therefore we use an unique long term experiment evaluating the application of different ps rates totaling 19 applications in seven years in a sandy typic hapludalf soil managed under no tillage system in southern brazil aiming to assess the transfer of p forms due to leachate 2 material and methods 2 1 history and description of the experimental site the experiment was carried out in southern of brazil latitude s 29º43 longitude w 53º42 in a typic hapludalf soil soil survey staff 2014 the treatments were the application of the rates of 0 20 40 and 80 m3 ha 1 of pig slurry ps on the soil surface and carried out under no tillage system climate is humid subtropical with average temperature and precipitation of 19 c and 1770 mm the history and description of conduction of experiment was described by lourenzi et al 2015 a summary of the main soil properties of the experimental area before the establishment of the experiment is presented in table 1 details on the chemical properties of the soil after 19 applications of ps rates for seven years up to 0 60 m deep are presented and discussed in lourenzi et al 2013 n p and k and in lourenzi et al 2011 cation exchange capacity exchangeable ca mg and al and organic matter moreover the summary of amount of p applied via ps rates and sequence of crops grown in the experimental area are presented in fig 1 2 2 leach sampling for this study the evaluations were performed from 2005 to 2007 and during this period six applications of ps were performed fig 1 during the cultivation of black oat avena sativa 2005 black beans phaseolus vulgaris l 2005 2006 sunn hemp crotalaria juncea 2006 black oat 2006 maize zea mays 2006 2007 and black oat 2007 the leachate volume and the levels of available p soluble p particulate p and total p in the leachate were evaluated in march 2000 two lysimeters were installed in each plot at a depth of 0 60 m with 0 40 m width and 0 60 m length built with a 4 mm thick polyvinyl chloride pvc plate fig 2 each leachate collector was connected to a 5 0 l capacity storage container fig 2 washed gravel with an hcl 0 1 mol l 1 solution was placed inside each lysimeter and over the gravel a sheet of filter material bidim removal of leachate water from the collector was performed by suction using a vacuum pump after each event rainfall leaching from april 2005 to august 2007 fig 2 after each rainfall the stored leachate volume was removed from the collectors its volume was measured and a sample 300 ml was taken to the laboratory for analysis 2 3 phosphorus analysis a schematic representation of p forms analyzed in water samples leached is presented in fig 3 a first aliquot of the sample was filtered 0 45 μm and the soluble p content was measured using the ammonia molybdate blue method murphy and riley 1962 in a second aliquot of the unfiltered sample the available and total p was estimated the available p was obtained after adding 1 0 ml of 0 1 mol l 1 hcl in 50 ml of unfiltered sample followed by stirring for 10 min and resting for 16 hours subsequently the p content in the extract was also determined using the murphy and riley 1962 method in a third aliquot of the unfiltered sample the total p content was estimated after hot digestion with concentrated sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide brookes and polwson 1982 subsequently the p content in the extract was also determined using the murphy and riley 1962 method finally we estimate the particulate p content by calculating the difference between the concentration of total and soluble p of each sample 2 4 statistical treatment of the data the effects of the applied doses of ps on the amount of water leached and on the levels of soluble p available p particulate p and total losses of p in leaching were evaluated through analysis of variance anova when significant at p 0 05 by the f test the treatment means were compared using the scott knott test α 0 05 in addition pearson s correlation analysis was performed between the total amount of p applied via ps and the accumulated dry matter production of the crops accumulated leaching volume and accumulated losses of available p soluble p particulate p and total p during the agricultural years 2005 2006 and 2006 2007 all statistical analyzes were performed at sisvar ferreira 2008 3 results 3 1 solution transfer due to leaching the control presented leachate volumes smaller than or equal to the other treatments based on ps addition in all rainfall events that led to soil leaching fig 5 the highest leachate transfer rates were observed in the 2005 black oat crop which recorded transfers of 5 8 3 9 6 0 and 3 2 at total rainfall of 5332 m3 ha 1 and ps doses 0 20 40 and 80 m3 ha 1 respectively fig 5 and supplementary material moreover the total leachate volume throughout the study was higher in the treatment 40 m3 ha 1 of ps fig 5 and supplementary material 3 2 available p the lowest available p levels in leachate were often observed in the control while the treatment 80 m3 ha 1 of ps recorded the highest available p concentrations in the leachate fig 6 on the other hand the highest amounts of transferred available p were observed after the application of 40 m3 ha 1 of ps supplementary material the highest transfer of available p based on the applied ps amount was observed in the 2006 2007 maize crop wherein 0 25 of the applied p was transferred in available p form supplementary material 3 3 soluble p the lowest soluble p levels in leachate were often observed in the control fig 7 similarly the treatment 20 m3 ha 1 of ps recorded soluble p concentrations lower than 0 5 mg l 1 of leachate in all rainfall events that resulted in leaching in the soil fig 7 however the treatment 80 m3 ha 1 of ps recorded the highest soluble p concentrations in the leachate and the highest concentrations of soluble p were observed at 88 daa in the 2006 2007 maize crop which exceeded the 3 0 mg p l 1 concentration in the leachate fig 7d the amount of soluble p transferred via leaching in 40 m3 ha 1 of ps treatment were 2 8 2 2 and 3 1 times higher than in the control and after the application of 20 and 80 m3 ha 1 of ps respectively supplementary material the highest soluble p transfer based on the applied ps amount was observed in the 2006 2007 maize crop wherein 0 05 of the applied p was transferred in soluble p form supplementary material 3 4 particulate p the highest particulate p concentration peaks were observed after the application of 80 m3 ha 1 of ps fig 8 however the highest concentrations of this p form were observed in the control and in the treatment 20 m3 ha 1 of ps fig 8 in rainfall events that have resulted in leaching in the soil where particulate p concentrations did not exceed 1 0 mg p l 1 however the highest amounts of transferred particulate p were observed after the application of 40 m3 ha 1 of ps supplementary material the highest particulate p transfer based on the applied ps amount was observed in the 2006 2007 maize crop wherein 0 17 of the applied p was transferred in particulate p form supplementary material 3 5 total p the highest total p concentration peaks were observed after the application of 80 m3 ha 1 of ps fig 9 however the highest concentrations of this p form were observed in the control and in the treatment 20 m3 ha 1 of ps fig 9 in most rainfall events that have resulted in leaching in the soil where total p concentrations did not exceed 1 0 mg p l 1 the highest amounts of transferred total p were observed after the application of 40 m3 ha 1 of ps supplementary material the highest total p transfer based on the applied ps amount was observed in the 2006 2007 maize crop wherein 0 22 of the applied p was transferred in total p form supplementary material 3 6 phosphorus transfer loads in leaching phosphorus transfers due to leaching throughout the evaluated period have shown some interesting trends first the control which was not subjected to ps application and treatments up to 40 m3 ha 1 of ps recorded increased available p transfer rate from 21 to 43 fig 10 a each 10 m3 ha 1 of ps application increase has increased the loss of available p by approximately 5 6 r2 0 99 on the other hand the 80 m3 ha 1 dose recorded a proportion of p transfer in the available form very similar to that observed at the 40 m3 ha 1 dose in relative terms p transfers due to leaching were very small in all evaluated forms in comparison to the p amount added via pig slurry fig 10b if one takes into consideration the total mean of the evaluated period and the three treatments based on ps application only 0 02 0 07 of the added p was leached fig 10b of which 0 005 0 024 in its soluble form and 0 014 0 054 in its particulate form the highest crop dry matter yields were observed in the treatment 80 m3 ha 1 of ps in all crops whereas the lowest yields were observed in the control treatment fig 4 only dry matter yield in the 2006 sun hemp crop did not show difference between treatments crop dry matter yield throughout two agricultural years has shown strong positive correlation to the p amount applied on the soil via ps table 2 of course several other nutrients such as n k ca and mg were added together with p by ps and may also contribute to the higher above ground dry matter yield however crop dry matter and amount of p applied variables did not correlate to the amount of leachate as well as to the amount of p transferred due to leaching table 2 on the other hand the leachate volume throughout the cultivation period was positively correlated to all leaching transferred p forms mainly to total p table 2 4 discussion crops subjected to low rainfall rates also recorded low leachate volumes being that leaching in the soil was not observed in any treatment during sunn hemp crop when the lowest rainfall rates were recorded on the other hand the largest leachate transfer i e the one collected 0 60 m down in the ground was observed when successive rainfalls happened in a short time as in rainfall events observed at the 127th and 7th days after ps application in the 2005 and 2007 black oat crops respectively however the higher rainfall rates observed in the evaluated period did not necessarily result in larger leachate volumes the higher leachate volumes observed in treatments based on ps addition mainly derive from the supply of higher amounts of p and of other nutrients that are essential to plant development in these treatments lourenzi et al 2016 this factor enables the formation of a large number of root biopores that help water infiltration and leaching in the soil in addition it enables better plant nutrition and consequently higher grain yields and dry matter yield in crops daudén and quílez 2004 lourenzi et al 2014a ciancio et al 2014 such dry matter is deposited on soil surface in areas under no tillage system this plant material deposited on soil surface also helps protecting the topsoil layer by reducing the kinetic energy of rainwater a fact that prevents soil surface sealing and reduces surface solution runoff ceretta et al 2010a lourenzi et al 2015 the addition of the organic material found in ps increases the organic matter content in the soil lourenzi et al 2013 and improves soil physical features such as aggregation density and porosity comin et al 2013 a fact that increases water infiltration capacity in soil under no tillage system lourenzi et al 2015 therefore organic matter content in the soil becomes an important attribute to improve soil structure since it decreases soil resistance to root penetration increases aggregate stability porosity and water retention as well as presents chemical and biological attributes that enable plant growth riley et al 2008 campos et al 2011 despite all the benefits ps could provide to soil and plants leaching in soil profile did not correlate to the applied ps rates and to rainfall volumes girotto et al 2013 since water infiltration in the soil depends on rainfall intensity significantly intense rainfall rates increase solution transfer by surface runoff lourenzi et al 2015 although the highest leachate volumes in some crops were observed in the first rainfall events after ps application and crop sowing these events did not necessarily result in the highest p concentrations in its different evaluated forms in the leachate this outcome was mainly observed in rainfall events that happened at 41 days after application daa in the 2005 2006 black bean crop figs 6b and 7b at 96 and 148 daa in the 2006 2007 maize crop figs 6d and 7d and at 124 daa in the 2007 black oat crop figs 6e and 7e it happens because p concentration in the solution depends on p amount and on leachate volume i e the same amount of leached p can lead to different p concentrations at different solution volumes due to the p dilution effect however it is essential highlighting that the accumulated amount of p forms transferred due to leaching are closely correlated to leachate volumes as observed in other studies focused on evaluating p transfers girotto et al 2013 lourenzi et al 2014b the low amounts of p forms lost by leaching result from the behavior of this element in the soil phosphorus found on soil surface can be transferred via runoff right after ps application since much of this nutrient is retained in plant waste or even on the soil surface which is the main form of p transfer in agricultural systems subjected to ps application on soil surface ceretta et al 2010a lourenzi et al 2014b 2015 after p meets soil mass through rainwater it can be adsorbed to soil solid mineral phase and form bonds mainly through internal sphere complexes with colloid functional groups and accumulate on the ground in its different forms ceretta et al 2010b in addition it can be absorbed by cultivated plants ciancio et al 2014 lourenzi et al 2014a immobilized by microbial biomass or as investigated in the present study it can be transferred via leachate girotto et al 2013 successive ps applications over the years tend to cause p saturation in part of soil solid phase adsorption sites mainly in the most avid functional groups of reactive soil particles found in the topsoil layer ceretta et al 2010b it means that repeated ps applications over time are likely to increase p migration in soil profile mainly in sandy soils and in places subjected to high rainfall rates such as the site investigated in the current study ceretta et al 2010b lourenzi et al 2013 this response is directly associated with the p amount added to the soil via ps a fact that justifies the higher concentrations of p forms in the leachate after the addition of 80 m3 ha 1 of ps this treatment comprised the application of 1 856 4 kg p ha 1 over the experimental period which corresponded to seven agricultural crops mean application of 265 2 kg p ha 1 per crop this value is quite significant in comparison to the official recommendation for maintenance fertilizer application in maize crops in the assessed region cqfs rs sc 2016 the official recommendation indicates the application of 65 kg p ha 1 for crop yield expectation of 10 mg ha 1 grain thus the aforementioned treatment exceeded the recommended dose by 308 this systematically repeated cultural practice leads to excessive p accumulation in the soil adeli et al 2008 ceretta et al 2010b lourenzi et al 2013 and consequently it increases p transfers due to leaching kang et al 2011 girotto et al 2013 lourenzi et al 2014b in absolute values the p amount leached 0 60 m down in the ground throughout the evaluated crop periods after ps application recorded relatively low values however it is noteworthy that soluble p and available p concentrations higher than 0 15 mg l 1 were observed in several events that have led to leaching in the soil mainly after the addition of 80 m3 ha 1 of ps but also after the addition of 40 m3 ha 1 of ps brazilian legislation states that this is the maximum p concentration in the available form allowed in class 3 water water that can be used for human consumption after treatment based on conama 2005 it indicates that successive ps applications increase p transfer due to leaching and lead to groundwater contamination ajmone marsan et al 2006 girotto et al 2013 gatiboni et al 2015 the low p concentrations observed in the leachate in the control and in the treatment of the lowest ps dose 20 m3 ha 1 resulted from the non application or addition of low p amounts in the soil respectively this process allowed plants to absorb most of the available p and reduced their mobility in the soil in addition particulate p was the main form of leaching p transfer in these treatments it happened due to low p addition in the soil and to strong interaction between p and soil solid mineral particles mainly between p and fe al oxides although these minerals are present in very low concentrations in sandy soils like our study 9 76 and 2 41 g kg 1 from fe and al oxides respectively in the topsoil of our study pedron et al 2018 such interaction formed stable and little reversible complexes such as inner sphere complexes however ps dose increase the saturation in the most p avid sites in the soil which resulted in higher soluble p transfers due to the low number of sites for p adsorption as observed in the current study 5 conclusions based on the monitoring of p transfers due to leaching in the cultivated area and in the place where nineteen ps applications were performed throughout seven years p loss during the six cover crops evaluated 2 5 years in this study was economically or agronomically negligible since the amount of transferred p corresponded to only 0 2 kg ha 1 year 1 however it was evident that these transfers can have significant environmental impact due to the likelihood of groundwater contamination with p in addition the preferential form of transferred p has changed based on the adopted ps dose the proportion of p lost in available form increased as the ps dose increased up to 40 m3 ha 1 in addition p

10449,successive pig slurry ps applications can substantially increase phosphorus p movement due to leaching mainly in sandy soils found in areas presenting high rainfall rates the aim of the current

the control and after the application of 20 and 80 m3 ha 1 of ps respectively supplementary material the highest soluble p transfer based on the applied ps amount was observed in the 2006 2007 maize crop wherein 0 05 of the applied p was transferred in soluble p form supplementary material 3 4 particulate p the highest particulate p concentration peaks were observed after the application of 80 m3 ha 1 of ps fig 8 however the highest concentrations of this p form were observed in the control and in the treatment 20 m3 ha 1 of ps fig 8 in rainfall events that have resulted in leaching in the soil where particulate p concentrations did not exceed 1 0 mg p l 1 however the highest amounts of transferred particulate p were observed after the application of 40 m3 ha 1 of ps supplementary material the highest particulate p transfer based on the applied ps amount was observed in the 2006 2007 maize crop wherein 0 17 of the applied p was transferred in particulate p form supplementary material 3 5 total p the highest total p concentration peaks were observed after the application of 80 m3 ha 1 of ps fig 9 however the highest concentrations of this p form were observed in the control and in the treatment 20 m3 ha 1 of ps fig 9 in most rainfall events that have resulted in leaching in the soil where total p concentrations did not exceed 1 0 mg p l 1 the highest amounts of transferred total p were observed after the application of 40 m3 ha 1 of ps supplementary material the highest total p transfer based on the applied ps amount was observed in the 2006 2007 maize crop wherein 0 22 of the applied p was transferred in total p form supplementary material 3 6 phosphorus transfer loads in leaching phosphorus transfers due to leaching throughout the evaluated period have shown some interesting trends first the control which was not subjected to ps application and treatments up to 40 m3 ha 1 of ps recorded increased available p transfer rate from 21 to 43 fig 10 a each 10 m3 ha 1 of ps application increase has increased the loss of available p by approximately 5 6 r2 0 99 on the other hand the 80 m3 ha 1 dose recorded a proportion of p transfer in the available form very similar to that observed at the 40 m3 ha 1 dose in relative terms p transfers due to leaching were very small in all evaluated forms in comparison to the p amount added via pig slurry fig 10b if one takes into consideration the total mean of the evaluated period and the three treatments based on ps application only 0 02 0 07 of the added p was leached fig 10b of which 0 005 0 024 in its soluble form and 0 014 0 054 in its particulate form the highest crop dry matter yields were observed in the treatment 80 m3 ha 1 of ps in all crops whereas the lowest yields were observed in the control treatment fig 4 only dry matter yield in the 2006 sun hemp crop did not show difference between treatments crop dry matter yield throughout two agricultural years has shown strong positive correlation to the p amount applied on the soil via ps table 2 of course several other nutrients such as n k ca and mg were added together with p by ps and may also contribute to the higher above ground dry matter yield however crop dry matter and amount of p applied variables did not correlate to the amount of leachate as well as to the amount of p transferred due to leaching table 2 on the other hand the leachate volume throughout the cultivation period was positively correlated to all leaching transferred p forms mainly to total p table 2 4 discussion crops subjected to low rainfall rates also recorded low leachate volumes being that leaching in the soil was not observed in any treatment during sunn hemp crop when the lowest rainfall rates were recorded on the other hand the largest leachate transfer i e the one collected 0 60 m down in the ground was observed when successive rainfalls happened in a short time as in rainfall events observed at the 127th and 7th days after ps application in the 2005 and 2007 black oat crops respectively however the higher rainfall rates observed in the evaluated period did not necessarily result in larger leachate volumes the higher leachate volumes observed in treatments based on ps addition mainly derive from the supply of higher amounts of p and of other nutrients that are essential to plant development in these treatments lourenzi et al 2016 this factor enables the formation of a large number of root biopores that help water infiltration and leaching in the soil in addition it enables better plant nutrition and consequently higher grain yields and dry matter yield in crops daudén and quílez 2004 lourenzi et al 2014a ciancio et al 2014 such dry matter is deposited on soil surface in areas under no tillage system this plant material deposited on soil surface also helps protecting the topsoil layer by reducing the kinetic energy of rainwater a fact that prevents soil surface sealing and reduces surface solution runoff ceretta et al 2010a lourenzi et al 2015 the addition of the organic material found in ps increases the organic matter content in the soil lourenzi et al 2013 and improves soil physical features such as aggregation density and porosity comin et al 2013 a fact that increases water infiltration capacity in soil under no tillage system lourenzi et al 2015 therefore organic matter content in the soil becomes an important attribute to improve soil structure since it decreases soil resistance to root penetration increases aggregate stability porosity and water retention as well as presents chemical and biological attributes that enable plant growth riley et al 2008 campos et al 2011 despite all the benefits ps could provide to soil and plants leaching in soil profile did not correlate to the applied ps rates and to rainfall volumes girotto et al 2013 since water infiltration in the soil depends on rainfall intensity significantly intense rainfall rates increase solution transfer by surface runoff lourenzi et al 2015 although the highest leachate volumes in some crops were observed in the first rainfall events after ps application and crop sowing these events did not necessarily result in the highest p concentrations in its different evaluated forms in the leachate this outcome was mainly observed in rainfall events that happened at 41 days after application daa in the 2005 2006 black bean crop figs 6b and 7b at 96 and 148 daa in the 2006 2007 maize crop figs 6d and 7d and at 124 daa in the 2007 black oat crop figs 6e and 7e it happens because p concentration in the solution depends on p amount and on leachate volume i e the same amount of leached p can lead to different p concentrations at different solution volumes due to the p dilution effect however it is essential highlighting that the accumulated amount of p forms transferred due to leaching are closely correlated to leachate volumes as observed in other studies focused on evaluating p transfers girotto et al 2013 lourenzi et al 2014b the low amounts of p forms lost by leaching result from the behavior of this element in the soil phosphorus found on soil surface can be transferred via runoff right after ps application since much of this nutrient is retained in plant waste or even on the soil surface which is the main form of p transfer in agricultural systems subjected to ps application on soil surface ceretta et al 2010a lourenzi et al 2014b 2015 after p meets soil mass through rainwater it can be adsorbed to soil solid mineral phase and form bonds mainly through internal sphere complexes with colloid functional groups and accumulate on the ground in its different forms ceretta et al 2010b in addition it can be absorbed by cultivated plants ciancio et al 2014 lourenzi et al 2014a immobilized by microbial biomass or as investigated in the present study it can be transferred via leachate girotto et al 2013 successive ps applications over the years tend to cause p saturation in part of soil solid phase adsorption sites mainly in the most avid functional groups of reactive soil particles found in the topsoil layer ceretta et al 2010b it means that repeated ps applications over time are likely to increase p migration in soil profile mainly in sandy soils and in places subjected to high rainfall rates such as the site investigated in the current study ceretta et al 2010b lourenzi et al 2013 this response is directly associated with the p amount added to the soil via ps a fact that justifies the higher concentrations of p forms in the leachate after the addition of 80 m3 ha 1 of ps this treatment comprised the application of 1 856 4 kg p ha 1 over the experimental period which corresponded to seven agricultural crops mean application of 265 2 kg p ha 1 per crop this value is quite significant in comparison to the official recommendation for maintenance fertilizer application in maize crops in the assessed region cqfs rs sc 2016 the official recommendation indicates the application of 65 kg p ha 1 for crop yield expectation of 10 mg ha 1 grain thus the aforementioned treatment exceeded the recommended dose by 308 this systematically repeated cultural practice leads to excessive p accumulation in the soil adeli et al 2008 ceretta et al 2010b lourenzi et al 2013 and consequently it increases p transfers due to leaching kang et al 2011 girotto et al 2013 lourenzi et al 2014b in absolute values the p amount leached 0 60 m down in the ground throughout the evaluated crop periods after ps application recorded relatively low values however it is noteworthy that soluble p and available p concentrations higher than 0 15 mg l 1 were observed in several events that have led to leaching in the soil mainly after the addition of 80 m3 ha 1 of ps but also after the addition of 40 m3 ha 1 of ps brazilian legislation states that this is the maximum p concentration in the available form allowed in class 3 water water that can be used for human consumption after treatment based on conama 2005 it indicates that successive ps applications increase p transfer due to leaching and lead to groundwater contamination ajmone marsan et al 2006 girotto et al 2013 gatiboni et al 2015 the low p concentrations observed in the leachate in the control and in the treatment of the lowest ps dose 20 m3 ha 1 resulted from the non application or addition of low p amounts in the soil respectively this process allowed plants to absorb most of the available p and reduced their mobility in the soil in addition particulate p was the main form of leaching p transfer in these treatments it happened due to low p addition in the soil and to strong interaction between p and soil solid mineral particles mainly between p and fe al oxides although these minerals are present in very low concentrations in sandy soils like our study 9 76 and 2 41 g kg 1 from fe and al oxides respectively in the topsoil of our study pedron et al 2018 such interaction formed stable and little reversible complexes such as inner sphere complexes however ps dose increase the saturation in the most p avid sites in the soil which resulted in higher soluble p transfers due to the low number of sites for p adsorption as observed in the current study 5 conclusions based on the monitoring of p transfers due to leaching in the cultivated area and in the place where nineteen ps applications were performed throughout seven years p loss during the six cover crops evaluated 2 5 years in this study was economically or agronomically negligible since the amount of transferred p corresponded to only 0 2 kg ha 1 year 1 however it was evident that these transfers can have significant environmental impact due to the likelihood of groundwater contamination with p in addition the preferential form of transferred p has changed based on the adopted ps dose the proportion of p lost in available form increased as the ps dose increased up to 40 m3 ha 1 in addition p concentrations in the leachate resulting from several rainfall events have exceeded the limit values recommended by the environmental legislation declaration of competing interest the authors declare
