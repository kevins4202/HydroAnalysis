7500,among the urban aquatic pollutants the most common is sediment which also acts as a transport medium for many contaminants hence there is an increasing interest in being able to better predict the sediment wash off from urban surfaces the exponential wash off model is the most widely used method to predict the sediment wash off although a number of studies proposed various modifications to the original exponential wash off equation these studies mostly looked into one parameter in isolation thereby ignoring the interactions between the parameters corresponding to rainfall catchment and sediment characteristics hence in this study we aim a to investigate the effect of rainfall intensity surface slope and initial load on wash off load in an integrated and systematic way and b to subsequently improve the exponential wash off equation focusing on the effect of the aforementioned three parameters a series of laboratory experiments were carried out in a full scale setup

three initial loads ranging from 50 to 200 g m2 were selected based on values obtained from the literature fine sediment with a size range of 300 600 Âµm was used for all of the tests each test was carried out for one hour with at least 9 wash off samples per test collected mass balance checks were carried out for all the tests as a quality control measure to make sure that there is no significant loss of sand during the tests results show that the washed off sediment load at any given time is proportional to initial load for a given combination of rainfall intensity and surface slope this indicates the importance of dedicated modelling of build up so as to subsequently predict wash off load it was also observed that the maximum fraction that is washed off from the surface increases with both rainfall intensity and the surface slope this observation leads to the second part of the study where the existing wash off model is modified by introducing a capacity factor which defines this maximum fraction this capacity factor is derived as a function of wash off coefficient making use of the correlation between the maximum fraction and the wash off rate values of the

effect of dominant parameters associated with rainfall characteristics surface characteristics and sediment characteristics another interesting observation is the lack of attention given to the surface slope in the above studies two processes that drive sediment mobilisation are impact energy from rainfall drops coleman 1993 and shear stress from overland flow akan 1987 deletic et al 1997 both of which are sensitive to surface slope especially the latter with the exception of nakamura 1984 none of the above studies paid attention to the effect of slope nakamura 1984 results show that k increases with surface slope but this study was based only on two randomly selected slopes and was not extensive enough to be used in subsequent studies or in practical applications in addition to the

these studies shaw et al 2010 provided an overview of a number of studies which indicated that the mass of washed off particulate matter during a storm event is relatively insensitive to the time between storm events this was confirmed by he et al 2010 who studied the quality of storm water runoff from a semi arid urban residential catchment in calgary alberta they could not find any relationship between the event mean values of total suspended solids and the antecedent dry weather period despite these criticisms the effect of build up on wash off has not been explored in depth in any of the above studies hence the question of whether there is a need to model build up remains unanswered considering the above gaps and room for improvements in sediment wash off modelling we designed and carried out a series of laboratory experiments to study the effect of three dominant parameters corresponding to rainfall surface and sediment characteristics in an integrated and systematic way these parameters are rainfall intensity i surface slope and initial load w o respectively and improve eq 1 using the experimental results focusing on the effect of the above three parameters 2 methodology 2 1 experimental setup experiments were conducted in a full scale laboratory setup described in fig 1 comprising of a rainfall simulator carvalho et al 2014 de lima et al 2013 isidoro and lima 2013 montenegro et al 2013 a 1 m2 bituminous road surface and a continuous wash off measuring system steady artificially simulated rainfall was employed in order to eliminate the dependency on naturally occurring rainfall this approach provides better control over influential variables such as rainfall intensity and duration consequently the use of simulated rainfall enables the generation of a large volume of data in a relatively short period of time herngren et al 2005 a typical urban road surface of 1 m2 was prepared for the experiments by using bituminous asphalt concrete fig 2 the surface was tested for texture and impermeability before the experiments surface texture was measured using sand patch tests highway department 1989 on 16 equally divided grids the mean texture depth index is 0 4 mm with a standard deviation of 0 03 mm this surface texture is an average representation of wide ranges of impervious urban surfaces where the mean texture depth index varies from 0 tiled pavements to 1 0 mm road surfaces mass balance of surface runoff was carried out to check the impermeability and the results show that the surface is completely impermeable this surface was fixed on a metal support structure with adjustable slope as shown in fig 1 the rainfall simulator fig 1 has a pressurised hydraulic system comprised of i a steady downward oriented full cone nozzle 1 4 hh 14 w fulljet from spraying systems co usa with 3 58 mm orifice diameter positioned 2 2 m above the geometric centre of the surface ii a hydraulic system attached just in front of the nozzle to eliminate pressure fluctuations more details in isidoro and lima 2013 and iii a submerged pump 76 2 mm sq from grundfos holding a s denmark installed in a constant head reservoir supplied with tap water this system allows a steady operating pressure at the nozzle to produce rainfall with consistent intensity with a spray angle of 120 wide angle the pressure at the nozzle is adjusted to change the rainfall intensity d10 and d90 of the sand used in the experiment are 300 Î¼m and 600 Î¼m respectively it is a washed dried and accurately graded sand free from organics clay silt or metallic inclusions and has a sub angular to semi rounded shape the effect of three parameters rainfall intensity surface slope and initial sediment load on sediment wash off were tested five intensities ranging from 33 to 155 mm h four slopes ranging from 2 to 16 and three initial loads ranging from 50 to 200 g m2 were selected these upper limits cover the extreme values derived from literature for example the highest ever recorded one hour note that all simulations were carried out for one hour table 1 rainfall intensity in uk is 92 mm h metoffice uk 2017 further the uk department of transport suggests a maximum gradient of 10 for most types of the road other than in exceptional circumstances manual for streets 2009 finally the average of ultimate sediment loads found in 8 selected urban sites located in lambeth uk is 172 g m2 butler and clark 1995 the lower limits were selected using trial simulations to be able to produce a measurable amount of wash off sampling times are adjusted based on the corresponding intensities and at least nine samples were collected for each simulation see table 1 note that for the 2 slope the wash off load was found to be less than 2 of the initial load even for the highest intensity of 155 mm h hence only simulations with an initial load of 200 g m2 were carried out for this slope all wash off samples were collected using numbered foil containers and then these foil containers were dried using standard laboratory moisture extraction ovens until they are completely dry all dried samples were then weighed using a high precision accuracy of 0 1 g laboratory measuring scale 2 2 quality control the bituminous road surface was subdivided into 16 equal grid squares fig 2b to aid distribution of the sediment uniformly over the surface initially trial tests were repeated with the same conditions rainfall intensity surface slope and initial load to confirm that the experimental setup gave consistent results comparing results from these repeated tests showed that the difference was within 2 at the end of both the trial and the actual tests the remaining sand from the surface was collected by washing off the surface to carry out a mass balance check in all cases the mass loss was found to be less than 2 of the original sediment load ensuring that there is no significant loss of sand during the tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results to compare the results from different initial loads on a common scale we used a normalised measure the wash off fraction f w which is a ratio between transported sediment load after time t w t and initial load of the sediment w o eq 2 fig 3 shows the wash off fraction plotted against the duration for all of the tests summarised in table 1 2 f w w t w o the most interesting observation is the effect of initial load on f w initial load does not affect f w until the slope gets steeper 8 and 16 even in the case of 8 slope initial load has an effect only when the rainfall intensity is higher than 110 mm h in these cases there is an increasing pattern of values of f w with increasing initial load these combinations of high rainfall intensity and steep slope where the initial load has an impact on f w are very rare in reality metoffice uk 2017 manual for streets 2009 it implies that the effect of initial load on f w is negligible for most general combinations of rainfall intensity and surface slope this essentially means the actual mass of sediment washed off at any given time w t is proportional to initial load for a given rainfall intensity and surface slope hence the prediction of build up is perhaps the most preferred way to subsequently predict wash off compared to the methods presented in recent studies e g shaw et al 2010 but on the other hand as shaw et al 2010 correctly pointed out it is a challenging task to model the build up process due to unpredicted occurrences of activities like construction work or the input of vegetative debris from wind storms despite these challenges the strong correlation observed between build up load and wash off load indicates the importance of modelling the build up process this observation does not necessarily invalidate the criticisms on the build up model of sartor and boyd 1972 by charbeneau and barrett 1998 shaw et al 2010 and he et al 2010 as their criticism is mainly on the use of antecedent dry days as the main parameter controlling the build up process rather this finding calls for more attention to be paid on modelling of build up process taking more parameters wijesiri et al 2015 morgan et al 2017 into consideration in addition to antecedent dry days looking at the effect of intensity and slope for a given intensity f w increases with increasing slope regardless of initial load similarly for a given slope f w increases with increasing intensity regardless of the initial load at 2 slope the wash off load is negligible for all the rainfall intensities with a maximum f w of 0 018 at the highest rainfall intensity of 155 mm h the highest f w after one hour is 0 9 for the extreme case where intensity slope and initial load are 155 mm h 16 and 200 g m2 respectively another important observation from fig 3 especially at steeper slopes 8 and 16 is that only a certain fraction of the available sediment is mobilised during a simulated rain event before the curve becomes almost flat and this maximum fraction increases with rainfall intensity and surface slope this behaviour suggests a rainfall event for a given surface slope has the capacity to mobilise only a fraction of sediment from the road surface and once it reaches that capacity as observed during the experiments wash off becomes almost zero even though a significant fraction of the original sediment is still available on the surface although at milder slopes 2 and 4 the wash off fraction has not reached its maximum value within the duration of the test it would have reached this value if the tests were long enough this trend was also observed in a similar study by egodawatta et al 2007 in which they analysed this maximum fraction against rainfall intensity hence there are two parameters which characterise these curves wash off rate and maximum fraction both of which increase with increasing slope and increasing intensity the negative inverse exponential pattern nie of these curves can mainly be attributed to the first flush effect the concept of first flush is that the initial period of storm flow carries most of the pollutant including sediments from the urban surface helsel et al 1979 sansalone and steven 1997 bertrand krajewski et al 1998 the most common value of k 4 6 in 1 0 18 mm 1 in eq 1 is basically derived from the concept that the first one half inch of total run off in one hour would wash off 0 9 fraction of the initial load huber and robert 1992 but such generalisation is not valid for all the conditions as can be seen in fig 3 where the strength of first flush changes with rainfall intensity and surface slope we believe in addition to rainfall intensity and surface slope surface texture and sediment size also play a major role in deciding the strength of the first flush fig 3 shows the effect of first flush is negligible during smaller intensities and milder slopes this can mainly be attributed to the surface texture depth and or sediment size used in the experiments if it is a smoother surface typically associated with roofs the effect of the first flush will possibly be magnified farreny et al 2011 also with a smaller sediment size one would expect a more pronounced first flush and a higher wash off fraction for instance egodawatta and goonetilleke 2008 in their study found that the most of the sediment that is washed off initially is the finer sand 200 Âµm but it can be noted that the range of sediment sizes used in egodawatta and goonetilleke 2008 is much wider 0 1000 Âµm compared to the sediment size used in this study which also explains the higher wash off fractions they observed in a similar experimental setup although we would expect an increase in wash off fraction with smaller sediment size there is also a possibility for smaller sediment to get trapped in the pores of the surface due to the surface roughness and so significantly reduce their mobility but on the other hand if the sediment size is bigger than the surface texture depth it might be too large for the rainfall impact to mobilise the particles and for the runoff process to transport it especially on mild surface slopes when the surface is rougher similar to the one used in this study the interaction between sediment size and texture depth becomes complicated and it needs to be explored in depth 3 2 model improvement we attempt to modify eq 1 based on the experimental data discussed in section 3 1 from fig 3 and the corresponding discussion it is clear that the effect of the initial load on the wash off fraction is negligible for most cases hence the effect of initial load has not been considered in this section and a modification in eq 1 is proposed based only on experimental results from a constant initial load of 200 g m2 as discussed in the previous section only a certain fraction of the available sediment is mobilised during a simulated rain event before the curve becomes almost flat and this fraction increases with rainfall intensity and surface slope to replicate this behaviour in the modelling of wash off egodawatta et al 2007 introduced a new parameter called the capacity factor cf ranging from 0 to 1 into eq 1 as shown in eq 3 3 w t w o c f 1 e kit but due to the limitations of their study they concluded that cf primarily varies with rainfall intensity disregarding the effect of other parameters such as slope but from fig 3 it is clear that this fraction of sediment which a rainfall event has the capacity to wash off also strongly depends on the surface slope in addition to rainfall intensity this implies cf needs to be adjusted according to the surface slope too hence cf which is the maximum fraction available and k which defines the wash off rate both need to be calibrated for all combinations of rainfall intensities and surface slopes from fig 3 it can also be noted that the higher the maximum fraction the faster the f w reaches the maximum fraction meaning these two parameters are dependent fig 4 is a simplified version of the experimental results to illustrate this concept where the maximum wash off fractions are indicated by f w 1 f w 2 and f w 3 and the time taken to reach these fractions are indicated by t1 t2 and t3 respectively this figure shows that f w 1 f w 2 f w 3 and consequently t1 t2 t3 applying this concept into eq 3 suggests that cf and k are dependent therefore it was decided to make cf a function of k as shown in eq 4 instead of introducing a new cf altogether as in egodawatta et al 2007 this way it does not only give some physical meaning to this empirical equation but also avoids the compensation of two independent parameters in order to over fit the experimental results such compensation between two independent parameters could lead to identifiability problems sorooshian and gupta 1983 4 w t w o f k 1 e kit having introduced a new cf in the form of f k the next step is to estimate this f k and subsequently estimate the k values for each combination of slope and intensity the following steps explain the procedure to estimate f k and k values 1 the first step is to find f k which best fits the experimental results to keep the new equation as simple as possible f k is assumed as a factor of k which leads to the following equation 5 w t w o ck 1 e k it where c is a constant with a unit of mm as unit of k is mm 1 note that k is changed to k since the new values for k will be different from conventional k values 2 the next step is to estimate the value of c constant and k varies with slope and intensity which gives the smallest residual sum of squares between the fitted models and experimental results hence for a given value of c the residual sum of squares are calculated for 20 fitted curves derived from 20 k values each corresponding to a combination of a slope and an intensity the objective function is to minimise the sum of all residual sum of squares derived from these 20 curves for different c values there are two constraints the first constraint is that c and k cannot have negative values and the second constraint is that the product of c and k cannot exceed the maximum possible fraction which is 1 fig 5 shows the sum of residual sum of squares plotted against the range of c it can be seen that the sum of residual sum of squares is at its minimum when c is 20 the corresponding fitted curves with different k are shown in fig 6 for all the combinations of intensity and slope where the initial load is 200 g m2 the sum of the residual sum of squares for all these fitted curves is only 0 13 which shows the model fits well with the experimental results the k values derived from the fitted models corresponding to a c value of 20 are plotted against intensity for each slope in fig 7 a fig 7 b shows the surface plot that is obtained by linearly interpolating k values over the domain from both plots it can be noted that the rate of change in k values against slope increases with increasing rainfall intensities at 2 slope the change of k against rainfall intensity is negligible due to the negligible difference in the wash off fraction against rainfall intensity at this slope at 8 and 16 slopes the rate of change in k values after 110 mm h shows a drop this is a reflection of the similar drop in the increase in the wash off fraction as can be seen in fig 6 the k values range from 2 6 10 3 to 4 2 10 2 which gives a range of 0 05 0 84 for cf 20 k the highest cf of 0 84 corresponds to the extreme case where intensity and slopes are 155 mm h and 16 respectively when transferring these c and k values to other catchments other parameters has to be taken into account especially the sediment size and surface texture both the capacity factor c k and wash off rate represented by k would most likely to increase with decreasing sediment size and or decreasing surface texture depth nevertheless the improved model structure as shown in eq 5 is expected to perform well for any sediment size and surface texture as the underlying physical processes will be the same as those on which the equation was developed 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the effect of rainfall intensity surface slope and initial load on sediment wash off using an artificial rainfall generator and a typical urban road surface of 1 m2 there has not been a previous experimental study which explored the effect of all the above three dominant parameters on wash off in an integrated and systematic way the experimental results show that the effect of initial load on wash off fraction at any given time is negligible for most general combinations of rainfall intensity and surface slope this essentially means that the washed off load at any given time is proportional to initial load for a given combination of a rainfall intensity and a surface slope hence a dedicated modelling approach to predict build up to help subsequently predict wash off despite the challenges mentioned in shaw et al 2010 should not be overlooked the negative inverse exponential nie trend due to the effect of first flush is clearly observed at combinations of catchment slopes steeper than 8 and rainfall intensities higher than 75 mm h for combinations of milder slope and lower rainfall intensity the effect of first flush becomes negligible note that these threshold values could be different for a different sediment size and or a different surface roughness a rainfall event has the capacity to mobilise only a fraction of sediment from the road surface and once it reaches that capacity as observed during the experiments wash off becomes almost zero even though a significant fraction of sediment is still available on the surface the maximum fraction that can be washed off from the surface increases with both rainfall intensity and the surface slope this final observation above led us to the second part of the study where the existing wash off model is modified by introducing a capacity factor which defines the maximum fraction this capacity factor is derived as a function of wash off coefficient making use of the correlation between maximum fraction and the wash off rate this new and improved equation is expected to perform better compared to the original equation as it models the underlying physical process better values for the wash off coefficient are derived for combinations of rainfall intensity and slope which can be transferred to other urban catchments with similar conditions in the future in addition to the initial load rainfall intensity and surface slope it is important to examine the effect of surface texture and sediment size on the wash off process this way a complete matrix of values for capacity factor and wash off coefficient can be derived which can be transferred to any urban catchments acknowledgements this research was carried out as part of the marie curie itn quantifying uncertainty in

silt or metallic inclusions and has a sub angular to semi rounded shape the effect of three parameters rainfall intensity surface slope and initial sediment load on sediment wash off were tested five intensities ranging from 33 to 155 mm h four slopes ranging from 2 to 16 and three initial loads ranging from 50 to 200 g m2 were selected these upper limits cover the extreme values derived from literature for example the highest ever recorded one hour note that all simulations were carried out for one hour table 1 rainfall intensity in uk is 92 mm h metoffice uk 2017 further the uk department of transport suggests a maximum gradient of 10 for most types of the road other than in exceptional circumstances manual for streets 2009 finally the average of ultimate sediment loads found in 8 selected urban sites located in lambeth uk is 172 g m2 butler and clark 1995 the lower limits were selected using trial simulations to be able to produce a measurable amount of wash off sampling times are adjusted based on the corresponding intensities and at least nine samples were collected for each simulation see table 1 note that for the 2 slope the wash off load was found to be less than 2 of the initial load even for the highest intensity of 155 mm h hence only simulations with an initial load of 200 g m2 were carried out for this slope all wash off samples were collected using numbered foil containers and then these foil containers were dried using standard laboratory moisture extraction ovens until they are completely dry all dried samples were then weighed using a high precision accuracy of 0 1 g laboratory measuring scale 2 2 quality control the bituminous road surface was subdivided into 16 equal grid squares fig 2b to aid distribution of the sediment uniformly over the surface initially trial tests were repeated with the same conditions rainfall intensity surface slope and initial load to confirm that the experimental setup gave consistent results comparing results from these repeated tests showed that the difference was within 2 at the end of both the trial and the actual tests the remaining sand from the surface was collected by washing off the surface to carry out a mass balance check in all cases the mass loss was found to be less than 2 of the original sediment load ensuring that there is no significant loss of sand during the tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results to compare the results from different initial loads on a common scale we used a normalised measure the wash off fraction f w which is a ratio between transported sediment load after time t w t and initial load of the sediment w o eq 2 fig 3 shows the wash off fraction plotted against the duration for all of the tests summarised in table 1 2 f w w t w o the most interesting observation is the effect of initial load on f w initial load does not affect f w until the slope gets steeper 8 and 16 even in the case of 8 slope initial load has an effect only when the rainfall intensity is higher than 110 mm h in these cases there is an increasing pattern of values of f w with increasing initial load these combinations of high rainfall intensity and steep slope where the initial load has an impact on f w are very rare in reality metoffice uk 2017 manual for streets 2009 it implies that the effect of initial load on f w is negligible for most general combinations of rainfall intensity and surface slope this essentially means the actual mass of sediment washed off at any given time w t is proportional to initial load for a given rainfall intensity and surface slope hence the prediction of build up is perhaps the most preferred way to subsequently predict wash off compared to the methods presented in recent studies e g shaw et al 2010 but on the other hand as shaw et al 2010 correctly pointed out it is a challenging task to model the build up process due to unpredicted occurrences of activities like construction work or the input of vegetative debris from wind storms despite these challenges the strong correlation observed between build up load and wash off load indicates the importance of modelling the build up process this observation does not necessarily invalidate the criticisms on the build up model of sartor and boyd 1972 by charbeneau and barrett 1998 shaw et al 2010 and he et al 2010 as their criticism is mainly on the use of antecedent dry days as the main parameter controlling the build up process rather this finding calls for more attention to be paid on modelling of build up process taking more parameters wijesiri et al 2015 morgan et al 2017 into consideration in addition to antecedent dry days looking at the effect of intensity and slope for a given intensity f w increases with increasing slope regardless of initial load similarly for a given slope f w increases with increasing intensity regardless of the initial load at 2 slope the wash off load is negligible for all the rainfall intensities with a maximum f w of 0 018 at the highest rainfall intensity of 155 mm h the highest f w after one hour is 0 9 for the extreme case where intensity slope and initial load are 155 mm h 16 and 200 g m2 respectively another important observation from fig 3 especially at steeper slopes 8 and 16 is that only a certain fraction of the available sediment is mobilised during a simulated rain event before the curve becomes almost flat and this maximum fraction increases with rainfall intensity and surface slope this behaviour suggests a rainfall event for a given surface slope has the capacity to mobilise only a fraction of sediment from the road surface and once it reaches that capacity as observed during the experiments wash off becomes almost zero even though a significant fraction of the original sediment is still available on the surface although at milder slopes 2 and 4 the wash off fraction has not reached its maximum value within the duration of the test it would have reached this value if the tests were long enough this trend was also observed in a similar study by egodawatta et al 2007 in which they analysed this maximum fraction against rainfall intensity hence there are two parameters which characterise these curves wash off rate and maximum fraction both of which increase with increasing slope and increasing intensity the negative inverse exponential pattern nie of these curves can mainly be attributed to the first flush effect the concept of first flush is that the initial period of storm flow carries most of the pollutant including sediments from the urban surface helsel et al 1979 sansalone and steven 1997 bertrand krajewski et al 1998 the most common value of k 4 6 in 1 0 18 mm 1 in eq 1 is basically derived from the concept that the first one half inch of total run off in one hour would wash off 0 9 fraction of the initial load huber and robert 1992 but such generalisation is not valid for all the conditions as can be seen in fig 3 where the strength of first flush changes with rainfall intensity and surface slope we believe in addition to rainfall intensity and surface slope surface texture and sediment size also play a major role in deciding the strength of the first flush fig 3 shows the effect of first flush is negligible during smaller intensities and milder slopes this can mainly be attributed to the surface texture depth and or sediment size used in the experiments if it is a smoother surface typically associated with roofs the effect of the first flush will possibly be magnified farreny et al 2011 also with a smaller sediment size one would expect a more pronounced first flush and a higher wash off fraction for instance egodawatta and goonetilleke 2008 in their study found that the most of the sediment that is washed off initially is the finer sand 200 Âµm but it can be noted that the range of sediment sizes used in egodawatta and goonetilleke 2008 is much wider 0 1000 Âµm compared to the sediment size used in this study which also explains the higher wash off fractions they observed in a similar experimental setup although we would expect an increase in wash off fraction with smaller sediment size there is also a possibility for smaller sediment to get trapped in the pores of the surface due to the surface roughness and so significantly reduce their mobility but on the other hand if the sediment size is bigger than the surface texture depth it might be too large for the rainfall impact to mobilise the particles and for the runoff process to transport it especially on mild surface slopes when the surface is rougher similar to the one used in this study the interaction between sediment size and texture depth becomes complicated and it needs to be explored in depth 3 2 model improvement we attempt to modify eq 1 based on the experimental data discussed in section 3 1 from fig 3 and the corresponding discussion it is clear that the effect of the initial load on the wash off fraction is negligible for most cases hence the effect of initial load has not been considered in this section and a modification in eq 1 is proposed based only on experimental results from a constant initial load of 200 g m2 as discussed in the previous section only a certain fraction of the available sediment is mobilised during a simulated rain event before the curve becomes almost flat and this fraction increases with rainfall intensity and surface slope to replicate this behaviour in the modelling of wash off egodawatta et al 2007 introduced a new parameter called the capacity factor cf ranging from 0 to 1 into eq 1 as shown in eq 3 3 w t w o c f 1 e kit but due to the limitations of their study they concluded that cf primarily varies with rainfall intensity disregarding the effect of other parameters such as slope but from fig 3 it is clear that this fraction of sediment which a rainfall event has the capacity to wash off also strongly depends on the surface slope in addition to rainfall intensity this implies cf needs to be adjusted according to the surface slope too hence cf which is the maximum fraction available and k which defines the wash off rate both need to be calibrated for all combinations of rainfall intensities and surface slopes from fig 3 it can also be noted that the higher the maximum fraction the faster the f w reaches the maximum fraction meaning these two parameters are dependent fig 4 is a simplified version of the experimental results to illustrate this concept where the maximum wash off fractions are indicated by f w 1 f w 2 and f w 3 and the time taken to reach these fractions are indicated by t1 t2 and t3 respectively this figure shows that f w 1 f w 2 f w 3 and consequently t1 t2 t3 applying this concept into eq 3 suggests that cf and k are dependent therefore it was decided to make cf a function of k as shown in eq 4 instead of introducing a new cf altogether as in egodawatta et al 2007 this way it does not only give some physical meaning to this empirical equation but also avoids the compensation of two independent parameters in order to over fit the experimental results such compensation between two independent parameters could lead to identifiability problems sorooshian and gupta 1983 4 w t w o f k 1 e kit having introduced a new cf in the form of f k the next step is to estimate this f k and subsequently estimate the k values for each combination of slope and intensity the following steps explain the procedure to estimate f k and k values 1 the first step is to find f k which best fits the experimental results to keep the new equation as simple as possible f k is assumed as a factor of k which leads to the following equation 5 w t w o ck 1 e k it where c is a constant with a unit of mm as unit of k is mm 1 note that k is changed to k since the new values for k will be different from conventional k values 2 the next step is to estimate the value of c constant and k varies with slope and intensity which gives the smallest residual sum of squares between the fitted models and experimental results hence for a given value of c the residual sum of squares are calculated for 20 fitted curves derived from 20 k values each corresponding to a combination of a slope and an intensity the objective function is to minimise the sum of all residual sum of squares derived from these 20 curves for different c values there are two constraints the first constraint is that c and k cannot have negative values and the second constraint is that the product of c and k cannot exceed the maximum possible fraction which is 1 fig 5 shows the sum of residual sum of squares plotted against the range of c it can be seen that the sum of residual sum of squares is at its minimum when c is 20 the corresponding fitted curves with different k are shown in fig 6 for all the combinations of intensity and slope where the initial load is 200 g m2 the sum of the residual sum of squares for all these fitted curves is only 0 13 which shows the model fits well with the experimental results the k values derived from the fitted models corresponding to a c value of 20 are plotted against intensity for each slope in fig 7 a fig 7 b shows the surface plot that is obtained by linearly interpolating k values over the domain from both plots it can be noted that the rate of change in k values against slope increases with increasing rainfall intensities at 2 slope the change of k against rainfall intensity is negligible due to the negligible difference in the wash off fraction against rainfall intensity at this slope at 8 and 16 slopes the rate of change in k values after 110 mm h shows a drop this is a reflection of the similar drop in the increase in the wash off fraction as can be seen in fig 6 the k values range from 2 6 10 3 to 4 2 10 2 which gives a range of 0 05 0 84 for cf 20 k the highest cf of 0 84 corresponds to the extreme case where intensity and slopes are 155 mm h and 16 respectively when transferring these c and k values to other catchments other parameters has to be taken into account especially the sediment size and surface texture both the capacity factor c k and wash off rate represented by k would most likely to increase with decreasing sediment size and or decreasing surface texture depth nevertheless the improved model structure as shown in eq 5 is expected to perform well for any sediment size and surface texture as the underlying physical processes will be the same as those on which the equation was developed 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the effect of rainfall intensity surface slope and initial load on sediment wash off using an artificial rainfall generator and a typical urban road surface of 1 m2 there has not been a previous experimental study which explored the effect of all the above three dominant parameters on wash off in an integrated and systematic way the experimental results show that the effect of initial load on wash off fraction at any given time is negligible for most general combinations of rainfall intensity and surface slope this essentially means that the washed off load at any given time is proportional to initial load for a given combination of a rainfall intensity and a surface slope hence a dedicated modelling approach to predict build up to help subsequently predict wash off despite the challenges mentioned in shaw et al 2010 should not be overlooked the negative inverse exponential nie trend due to the effect of first flush is clearly observed at combinations of catchment slopes steeper than 8 and rainfall intensities higher than 75 mm h for combinations of milder slope and lower rainfall intensity the effect of first flush becomes negligible note that these threshold values could be different for a different sediment size and or a different surface roughness a rainfall event has the capacity to mobilise only a fraction of sediment from the road surface and once it reaches that capacity as observed during the experiments wash off becomes almost zero even though a significant fraction of sediment is still available on the surface the maximum fraction that can be washed off from the surface increases with both rainfall intensity and the surface slope this final observation above led us to the second part of the study where the existing wash off model is modified by introducing a capacity factor which defines the maximum fraction this capacity factor is derived as a function of wash off coefficient making use of the correlation between maximum fraction and the wash off rate this new and improved equation is expected to perform better compared to the original equation as it models the underlying physical process better values for the wash off coefficient are derived for combinations of rainfall intensity and slope which can be transferred to other urban catchments with similar conditions in the future in addition to the initial load rainfall intensity and surface slope it is important to examine the effect of surface texture and sediment size on the wash off process this way a complete matrix of values for capacity factor and wash off coefficient can be derived which can be transferred to any urban catchments acknowledgements this research was carried out as part of the marie curie itn quantifying uncertainty in

7501,resolving the potential groundwater yield zonation of sandstone aquifers occurring at depths of several hundred meters has been an important and challenging objective of the hydrogeological research focused on preventing flood hazards in coal mines using accessible geological exploration data we put forward a method of predicting the spatial distribution of groundwater storage potential in sandstone aquifers from permian age coal deposits in juye coalfield shangdong china a geological tectonic and lithological composition index gtlci model was created using the following parameters sandstone depth and thickness faults length density fald faults density fad fault frequency density fafd fault scale density fasd variation coefficient of the slope vcs of the coal seam intensity index of folds in horizontal direction iifoh and lithological composition index lci each of these factors was subsequently divided into 5 classes the analytic hierarchy process ahp and trapezoidal fuzzy number tfn method was applied to calculate the weight of the conditioning factor and their respective sub classes groundwater yield potential contour map which was initially constructed using

rate of 80 was explained by the limited number of boreholes available for validation it is considered that the gtlci model is effective at predicting zonation of groundwater yield in the sandstone aquifers from permian age coal deposits in juye coalfield china keywords potential groundwater yield zone gis sandstone aquifers coal deposits china 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most important global natural resources for communities as well as for agriculture and industrial activities manap et al 2014 naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 nampak et al 2014 rahmati et al 2016 for example in the dry northern and northwestern regions of china groundwater is used for drinking by more than 70 of the population and is also used to irrigate more than 40 of the farmland qiu 2010 however groundwater can pose major risks during coal mine construction and production between 2000 and 2011 a total of 1089 water related incidents and 4329 casualties caused by mine flooding were reported in china lamoreaux et al 2014 therefore mining safety and mine water hazards mitigation are key objectives for hydrogeologists and researchers tan et al 2010a b 2012 cheng et al 2013 tan et al 2013 wu et al 2014 chen et al 2016 the exploration of potential aquifers situated in the proximity of active mine sectors is one of the most important tasks which could contribute to the prevention of mine flooding prediction of groundwater hazard potential zones has been extensively studied and all the prediction methods for groundwater hazard potential zones rely on the groundwater yield zonation therefore for mines with high risks of flooding it is necessary to develop predictive models of potential groundwater bearing zones the traditional approaches to determine the potential groundwater bearing zones has been to collect data through drilling hydrogeological tests and geophysical methods these approaches are usually very costly and time consuming nampak et al 2014 sander et al 1996 the corroboration of geomorphologic and geophysical data for locating potential groundwater yield zones dhakate et al 2012 has been an economical and effective approach employed especially in areas with shallow aquifers more recently many researchers have applied the integrated approach of the geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs for mapping groundwater potential zones dar et al 2010 madrucci et al 2008 nampak et al 2014 prasad et al 2008 the different statistical methods used for modelling are listed in table 1 the following factors were taken into account by the previously study topography geology vegetation land use climatic conditions surface drainage patterns and regional groundwater depth however additional factors should also be considered in regions with consolidated or crystalline rocks especially in the deep aquifers yin and brook 1992 pointed out that the topographic approach to locating high yield wells in crystalline rocks might not be reliable and also was skeptical of the claim that the topographic factor can strongly predict the water yield of a well therefore a compatible model to predict potential groundwater yield zonation should consider the actual condition of the aquifers in sandstone with deep depth in this study we generate the groundwater yield potential map of the deep sandstone aquifers of the coal bearing shanxi formation cisuralian f by using a gis based geological tectonic and lithological models the water that floods the mining space and associated tunnels comes usually from the sandstone aquifers of the shanxi formation therefore these aquifers affect the efficiency and safety of coal mining processes the presence and quantity of water in the sandstone aquifers have been important objectives of hydrogeological research characterizing the groundwater yield potential zone in sandstone aquifers supplements significantly the more traditional methods involving hydrogeological and geophysical techniques wu et al 2007 zhou et al 2002 xiao et al 2015 and it has become more and more common in addition some evaluation methods such as single factor analysis li et al 2012 multi factor analysis chen et al 2012 gis information fusion wu et al 2011a b adiat et al 2012 nampak et al 2014 fuzzy clustering wu et al 2011a b brittle rock percentage composition ren et al 2011 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process index han et al 2012 have also been employed to estimate the groundwater storage potential in sandstone aquifers it is relatively common that hydrogeological studies lag behind the geological exploration during mining activities especially in new coal mines therefore it is important to predict accurately the potential groundwater yield zone of the aquifers using data acquired during geological exploration this paper presents a method of predicting the potential groundwater yield zone in sandstone aquifers from permian age coal deposits using data collected from coal mine the main objective of the proposed study is to 1 demonstrate that the potential groundwater yield zone in sandstone aquifers from coal bearing formations can be predicted efficiently even without direct hydrogeological information by using geological data only by developing a complex geologic tectonic and lithological composition index and 2 discuss the relationship between each conditioning factor of the index and zonation of groundwater yield in sandstone aquifers in a coal mine throughout this study each conditioning factor will be quantitatively defined the main difference between this research and the approaches described in the aforementioned publications is that the proposed predictive model corroborates the depth and thickness of the aquifer with the local tectonics faults and folds and detailed aquifer lithology using gis 2 study area and geologic and hydrogeological setting 2 1 study area the area containing the longgu coal mine lcm which is the object of the current study lies in juye county heze city shandong province china fig 1 the site lies between 35 13 59 n and 35 22 59 n latitude and 115 49 59 e and 115 58 59 e longitude and covers an area of about 142 3 km2 the mean annual rainfall about of the area is 694 70 mm and the mean annual temperature is 14 8 c table 2 few seasonal streams lie in the coal field lcm is located in the juye coalfield shandong province and is a very large mine with a designed production of 6mt a the mining activities have focused on coal bed no 3 cb3 which is thick extensive and of high quality the age of the coal deposit is permian previous survey reports mentioned a low mine water inflow rate from sandstone aquifers during the cb3 mining however underground boreholes roadways and workface and extraction data showed that groundwater was actually abundant in the sandstone aquifers overlying cb3 thus possessing a threat to roadway excavation and efficient production zhang 2008 therefore it has become necessary to predict the groundwater distribution and potential zone in these sandstone aquifers 2 2 geologic conditions longgu coal mine is located in a typical north china coalfield of permo carboniferous age the coal bearing deposits are attributed to the benxi formation f taiyuan f shanxi f and shihezi f they are covered by neogene mudstones fine sandstones clay and sand with a thickness varying between 377 10 and 589 30 m overlaid by quaternary sandy clays fine grained sand and sand with a thickness ranging from 141 40 to 179 00 m the mined coal beds belong to the taiyuan and shanxi fs zhang 2008 as shown in fig 2 generally the area is a faulted and folded monocline with a south north strike and dipping east the major faults are oriented nne ssw and the others ene wsw and ese wnw fig 3 a total of 805 faults have been identified 2 3 hydrogeological conditions the lithology of the main aquifers is dominated by sand and gravel at the quaternary and neogene levels and sandstone within the permo carboniferous deposits water flows into the excavations from the roof sandstone during the mining of cb3 in the shanxi f the main aquitards include clay beds in quaternary and neogene and mudstone siltstone and bauxite in permo carboniferous fig 2 for the sake of the aquicludes above the clastic rock surface water and rainfall have no relationship with groundwater in sandstone aquifers as shown in fig 4 the proposed study focuses on the sandstone occurring on the roof of cb3 the sandstone is an example of fractured confined aquifer with a thickness and depth ranging between 4 80 m and 75 56 m and 690 m and 1240 m below the surface respectively the predominantly fine sandstone has intercalations of coarser sandstone and siltstone hydraulic conductivities ranged between 0 010 m d and 0 027 m d and the water yield per unit of drawdown varied from 0 008 l s m to 0 015 l s m which calculate from three drawdown within single well pumping test on the sandstone aquifers in the no l 2 and l 15 wells the initial water levels ranged between 34 97 m and 35 12 m and were calculated using information from two boreholes and showed that the aquifer had a low water yield the water level and pumping tests performed at the lcm showed that sandstone aquifers have no direct relationship with other thick aquifers according to few hydrogeological holes founded in previously hydrogeological exploration zhang 2008 3 data 3 1 selected factors that affect potential groundwater yield in sandstone usually the existence and abundance of groundwater in a given aquifer is affected by many geo environmental factors as described above the significant relationship of groundwater occurrence and conditioning factors has been studied in oh et al 2011 adiat et al 2012 lee et al 2012a b nampak et al 2014 park et al 2014 pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 razandi et al 2015 and rahmati et al 2016 the main potential groundwater yield conditioning factors considered in this study are depth of sandstone thickness of sandstone fault density fold density and detailed aquifer lithology these factors are considered as the most important in controlling the flow and storage of groundwater and therefore affect the potential groundwater yield zonation in sandstone the geologic data were collected prior to and during mining activities mainly from boreholes and 3d seismic exploration throughout the mine area 3 2 factors 3 2 1 depth dp the bottom of the sandstone layer that formed the roof of cb3 was at depths ranging from 690 m to1240 m below the ground surface the data acquired from 3d seismic exploration geo exploration and roadway and workface constructions fig 5 a as lithostatic pressure increases with depth do does the degree of sandstone compaction which decreases secondary porosity slightly by possibly closing the fractures present 3 2 2 thickness tk the thickness of sandstone aquifers is one of the most important hydrogeological factors and can be applied to evaluate potential groundwater yield rao and briz kishore 1991 razandi et al 2015 the thickness of sandstone in this study area was acquired from the geo exploration data as shown in fig 5b the thickness of the sandstone is the basis for determining the absolute water yield in the aquifer the thicker the layer the greater the yield when all other factors are the same the sandstone overlying cb3 varies between 4 80 m and 75 56 m 3 2 3 fault length density fald faults have a great importance for groundwater potential and especially on groundwater storage and migration faults have usually been used as an indicative tool for locating potential groundwater yield zones dar et al 2010 mabee et al 1994 2002 magowe and carr 1999 sander et al 1997 yin and brook 1992 therefore the analysis of faults in coal fields helps build quantitative indices which leads to follow the groundwater potential variability throughout the sandstone faults are linear features of tectonic origin that are long narrow and relatively straight and as revealed by 3d seismic exploration geo exploration and roadway and workface extractions in the study area had throws ranging from 0 5 m to 500 m the major faults are oriented nne ssw and the rest ene wsw and ese wnw fig 3 the horizontal stress plays a leading role in the regional stress field and the direction of the maximal principal stress was ne65 87 and almost perpendicular to more fault strikes wang et al 2010 a total of 805 faults have been identified the faults length density fald is the total length of all recorded faults with various throws divided by a unit cell area fig 5c 1 fald i 1 n l i s where the l i is the sum of length of all faults unit is m s is an area with a grid cell size of 100 m 100 m 0 001 km2 see also fig 5c 3 2 4 fault density fad the faults density fad is the total number of faults multiplied by throw and divided by the product of the average throw for all faults and the area and is expressed by eq 2 2 fad n i 1 n h i s h where the n is the total quantity of all faults i 1 n h i is the sum of throw of all faults in a grid h is the average of all throws in the study area and s is the grid cell area here we take into account the throw of the faults to distinguish the different scale present the coefficient of correction with the sum of throw in the grid divided by the average of all faults in this study area which is unlike the previous research cao et al 2002 wu et al 2013 as shown in fig 5d the more numerous and large the faults the more space for conduction and storage of groundwater 3 2 5 fault frequency density fafd the fault frequency density fafd is the sum of all the intersection points and endpoints of all faults divided by the cell grid area and is expressed by eq 3 park et al 2014 wu et al 2013 and shown in fig 5e 3 fafd ni ne s where the ni and ne is the total intersection and end points respectively of all faults in the grid cell with area s more fault intersections weaken the integrity of the rock mass and therefore increase sandstone permeability and water storing capacity and thus the groundwater potential as well 3 2 6 fault scale density fasd the fault scale density fasd is the sum of the products of fault throws multiplied by their corresponding fault length divided by the grid cell and is expressed by eq 4 wu et al 2013 and shown in fig 5f 4 fasd i 1 n h i l i s in general fasd is directly correlated with the groundwater potential in a similar manner to fafd and fald naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 eqs 1 to 4 are used to calculate the fald fad fafd and fasd values for all the grids with a 100 m by 100 m cell each value was plotted at the respective grid center and then interpolated with the kriging interpolation technique to create maps for each parameter five classes were created for each parameter based on the values marked by contour lines 3 2 7 variation coefficient of slope vcs of coal seam the variation coefficient of slope vcs of coal seam is defined as the ratio of the coal seam slope values standard deviation to the mean slope and is expressed by eq 5 it also indicates the degree of fold development cao et al 2002 the slope of the coal seam floor was calculated from the coal seam floor elevation contour map which was drawn based on geo exploration 3d seismic exploration roadway and workface constructions data the variation coefficient is expressed by eq 5 and shown in fig 5g 5 cdavc 1 n i 1 n Î± i Î± 2 Î± where the Î± i and Î± are the slope of individual and average coal seam floor dip respectively in a 50 m 50 m grid cell 3 2 8 intensity index of folds in horizontal direction iifoh intensity index of folds in horizontal direction iifoh describes the horizontal complexity of folds it is expressed by eq 6 and takes into account horizontal projection on the grid edge of the fold length and the actual length of the fold it is also shown in fig 5 h 6 iifop d 0 d 1 d 1 100 where the d 0 is the actual length of the folds on plan and d 1 is the horizontal projection length of the folds on plan in a 50 m 50 m grid cell 3 2 9 lithological composition index lci the shanxi f is composed of dark grey to black mudstone and coal beds and a series of grey medium grained sandstone grey to white fine grained sandstone and dark grey siltstone cb3 is the main object of the mining activities in the lcm this coal layer is overlain by sandstone of all grain sizes siltstone sandy mudstone and mudstone fig 6 the different types of lithology control groundwater storage the coarser the sandstone the thicker the sandstone layer and the greater the water storage capacity the presence of mudstone intercalations limits the development of the fractures as well as any connection between sandstone aquifers zhang 2008 clay content influences the degree of fissure development the more the clay content of a rock unit the less fissures and the less the permeability of the rock and hence the less its potentiality for groundwater storage adiat et al 2012 sandstone is often brittle and susceptible to fracturing which thus increases porosity and permeability secondary porosity is the key factor in hard rocks especially in clastic ones huang et al 2014 and enhances groundwater potentiality therefore a sandstone with bigger grain size and little clay content would have a higher rating in terms of groundwater storage capacity than a soft rock with small grain size and more clay content in this study we put forward the lithological composition index lci in order to integrate the different kind of rock overlaying cb3 7 lci a 1 b 0 8 c 0 6 d 0 2 e 1 g where lci is the lithological composition index a b c d e are the thicknesses of coarse sandstone medium grained sandstone fine grained sandstone siltstone and fracture zones or limestone respectively g is the structure coefficient and 0 2 0 6 0 8 and 1 are the equivalent coefficients for different rock types for example when the sandstone thickness represents more than 80 of the total thickness which defined the height of 20 times thickness of cb3 above cb3 the structure coefficient equals 1 when the proportion is between 55 and 80 the structure coefficient equals 0 8 when the proportion ranges between 45 and 55 the structure coefficient equals 0 6 when the proportion ranges between 20 and 45 the structure coefficient equals 0 4 and when the proportion is 20 or less the structure coefficient equals 0 2 as shown in fig 5i 4 methodology 4 1 procedures the prediction of zone of groundwater yield potential of sandstone aquifers in coal deposits consisted of four main steps 1 selecting the factors that control groundwater storage potentiality in the aquifer and geological data collection 2 calculation of the quantitative evaluation indices 3 data standardization building the index model and validation of the results and 4 description and visual interpretation of the results the steps are shown in fig 7 4 2 data normalization in order to combine all the available depth thickness geologic tectonic and lithological data into a unified model and also take into account the multiple orders of magnitude of various parameters the following normalization is employed eq 8 8 x ik x ik min x ik max x ik min x ik where xik is the original value of a parameter and max xik and min xik are the original maximum and minimum values respectively 4 3 determining factors weights it is critical to obtain the weight of the factors integrated during groundwater susceptibility mapping there are many methods of calculating the weights such as the statistical index si weighting factor methods wf sener et al 2005 and the analytic hierarchy process ahp adiat et al 2012 razandi et al 2015 in this paper we applied the ahp to determine factor weights and put forward the trapezoidal fuzzy number method tfn to calculate the weights of the factors subclasses xie 2011 4 3 1 ahp method the details and steps of ahp were described by malczewski 1999 and adiat 2012 accordingly the weights of faults fas folds fos lci thickness tk and depth dp are shown in tables 3 and 4 and the weights of fad fasd fald and fafd are shown in table 5 4 3 2 tfn method the tfn can evaluate ambiguity and uncertainty xie 2011 five levels of factor weights were thus evaluated table 6 and of each factor weighting representation different evaluation of fuzzy language as shown in table 6 a medium level of attribute factor can be expressed as 3 5 5 7 in tfn 4 3 3 steps of calculating weights with tfn method step 1 determining decision making weights of each member of the expert group if there are k experts in a group then the decision making weight of each member is rt t 1 2 k where rt 0 1 and Ïrt 1 rt is defined by the eq 9 if r 1 r 2 r t 1 k this expert group is called affirmative decision otherwise the expert group is exclusive decision 9 r t w t i 1 t w t t 1 2 3 k where wt is the weight obtained from each expert step 2 evaluating the importance of each sub factor according to the table 6 with fuzzy vocabulary and calculating the comprehensive weight from the expert group for example set w jt ajt bjt cjt djt for the no t expert and evaluate the relative importance of the no aj category then the comprehensive weight w j from the expert group evaluates the no aj category as shown by eq 10 10 w j a j b j c j d j t 1 k r t a jt t 1 k r t b jt t 1 k r t c jt t 1 k r t d jt step 3 calculating fuzzy weight fuzzy weight d w j was calculated with eq 11 11 d w j a j b j c j d j 4 j 1 2 5 step 4 construction weight vector the fuzzy weight of the no aj category was further processed eq 12 12 w ij d w j j 1 5 d w j j 1 2 5 where j 1 5 w ij 1 and the weight vector of the no aj category is shown with eq 13 13 w w 11 w 12 w 13 w 14 w 15 in this paper the weights of each category were determined with the tfn method in order to estimate the weight of each conditioning factor questionnaires were given to four geology and or hydrogeology experts all the experts made decisions and submitted different tfns on different levels for each factor based on their interpretation of table 6 information take into account for example the tk and fald to illustrate the different tfns on five levels from the four experts tables 7 and 8 4 3 4 weighting the classified factors the thematic layer of each factor was classified based on experts decisions and literature review different classes were assigned to each factor with ratings ranging from 1 to 5 corresponding to very low low medium high and very high groundwater storage potential the classes and their corresponding ratings and normalized weights of all factors are shown in table 9 4 4 building the potential groundwater yield prediction model the comprehensive multiple factor analysis was considered to be the best method to account for all the factors controlling the groundwater storage potential in a sandstone aquifer chenini et al 2010 murthy and mamo 2009 magesh et al 2012 park et al 2014 in this paper the weighted linear average was used to estimate the geological tectonic and lithological structure index gtlci this technique is usually expressed in terms of standardized weightings for each factor as well as normalized scores for all options relative to each of the criteria the final utility d for each option ci is then calculated as follows 14 d i 1 i n c i w i where ci is the normalized standard weight for each class of each factor wi is the individual weighting for each factor and d is the value of gtlci then the value of gtlci in each grid was computed using eqs 14 and 15 15 gtlci c dp w a c tk w b c fald w c c fafd w d c fasd w e c fod w g c cdavc w f c iifoh w h c lci w i where c dp to c lci are the normalized values for each class weight and wa to wi are the normalized weight ratings as shown on the fifth row in table 9 gtlci model combined the nine conditioning factors in one formula and the depth and thickness of sandstone aquifer were measured and the lci need calculate from the thickness of different rock and ratio and the others factors need calculate in each grid 5 results and discussion 5 1 results the gtlci value was calculated for each 50 m 50 m grid cell all cell data was then processed using the surfer and mapgis k9 software which are specialized in drawing contour maps and spatial overlapping analysis the value of gtlci was plotted at the center of the grid cells using the coordinates of the grid cell centers the overall gtlci contour model map was constructed using the kriging function interpolation technique fig 8 according to the map the potential groundwater yield as expressed by gtlci values ranges in the study area between 0 01and 0 18 thus the area can be divided into four water abundance zones low 0 03 low medium 0 03 0 07 medium high 0 07 0 12 and high greater than 0 12 table 10 the map also shows that the areas with the highest groundwater potential are located mainly in the western central and northeast parts of the coal field whereas the low low medium and medium high potential areas are located in the western and southern south and west central and northeastern and eastern parts respectively as shown in fig 8 the high values of thickness fald fad fafd and lci were responsible for the high water potential 5 2 validating the prediction validation is the key to verify the results adiat et al 2012 therefore in order to ensure that the potential groundwater yield zone prediction by gtlci was accurate for the study area validation tests were carried out in the field the validation was accomplished by processing pumping test results from two boreholes drainage water inflow from dewatering boreholes constructed in roadways and mine water inflow from roadways and workfaces the locations names and the actual yields q measured from borehole pumping tests and different water inflows from dewatering boreholes were displayed on the groundwater potential map together with water inflow data at different workfaces fig 8 and table 11 take the dewatering boreholes for underground roadways as an example the data for 16 boreholes were in accordance with the gtlci prediction data from 4 boreholes were in disagreement with the prediction therefore based on 20 boreholes the success rate was 80 a comparison of the field and gtlci data at various locations as shown in table 11 and indicates that the gtlci model predictions were in general consistent with the actual yield therefore the gtlci based prediction was considered to be accurate and reliable for guiding the process of dewatering the mine roadways by drilling boreholes 5 3 discussions predicting accurately potential groundwater yield zones in sandstone aquifers is a challenging and difficult task dar et al 2011 especially in the present study area the exploration of sandstone aquifers still remains a tough task because of the complex geo circumstances such as multistage tectonic movement wide range of lithology with different mineral compositions l anisotropy and heterogeneity of rock media and complicated fracture networks there are many factors influencing groundwater storage in the sandstone aquifers of the study area including the original and induced fractures for example the geological conditions present before the mining of cb3 depth of sandstone floor thickness of sandstone aquifers faults folds and lithology data were collected analyzed overlayed spatial interpolated processed and plotted with gis each of the factors taken into account controls the groundwater storage potential in the sandstone aquifers the main controlling factors are faults folds lci thickness and depth with weights of 0 449 0 258 0 174 0 082 and 0 037 respectively calculated by ahp which offers the advantage of using a hierarchical processing of each factor and therefore is able to evaluate the impact of each factor furthermore tfn eliminated the need for more field tests by asking experts to rank the factor weights and thus taking into account the ambiguity and uncertainty of factor importance estimation the relationship between gtlci and faults factors including fault length density fault density fault frequency density and fault scale density are considered critical when delineating groundwater potential zones in sandstone aquifers the richest groundwater potential zones have been observed to have a high faults density adiat et al 2012 khairul et al 2000 magesh et al 2012 the more faults the higher the gtlci and this can be seen in the west central part of the study area fig 8 in this area many small faults otherwise not detectable by 3d seismic surveys or boreholes were identified during the construction of roadways and advancement of the workface the relationship between gtlci and folds namely vcs and iifoh can be deduced from table 4 vcs and iifoh play a very important role in distributing the fissures or fractures that benefit the groundwater potential the lci was put forward in this research to indicate how different lithologies affect groundwater distribution in sandstone from coal deposits the lci is taking into account not only the type and thickness of clastic rock but also the thickness ratio of different lithologies and groundwater storage reduction coefficient by different lithologies the lci values were calculated with geo boreholes drilled to explore the coal field although the most important factors affecting groundwater distribution and flow in sandstone are the number fractures and their connectivity the thickness of sandstone is also is notable because it controls the total volume of pore and fracture space available for groundwater storage with the increase of thickness from west to east the gtlci also increase from west to east in general the depth of sandstone aquifers impacts the degree of compaction and secondary porosity usually enhances the ground pressure on the sandstone and alleviates groundwater movement within the aquifers therefore the available spaces for the storage of groundwater decrease with depth although the gtlci values decrease from west to east in general which also indicates that depth impacts the gtlci only slightly it is evident that the faults and folds reservoir thickness and lci have the greatest influence on the model the gtlci map shows that groundwater distribution within the sandstone aquifers is very inhomogeneous and depends on the degree of exploration by different methods more data is necessary in order to calculate the gtlci by 3d seismic and geo boreholes in particular the data acquired during mining activities is able to reveal the presence of small faults and folds fig 8 which are difficult to acquire by 3d seismics the proposed prediction model is more detailed for the west central parts than for the rest of the study area fig 8 the field data from 20 dewatering boreholes 2 pumping test holes and 16 workfaces located in the west central parts successfully validated the gtlci model gtlci values rely on theabundant of geological exploration data and which will change by the quantity distribution of all the influential factors more borehole data will lead to more realistic results and changing grid size would not make a different in the prediction the proposed model is not based on hydrogeological exploration data but built based on several factors that have close relations to the sandstone groundwater storage potential therefore the gtlci model works better for predicting groundwater distribution within sandstone aquifers than the single well pumping test method which is widely applied to evaluate the groundwater yield in aquifers 6 conclusions to prevent coal mine flooding it is essential to determine the distribution of groundwater in sandstone aquifers from coal deposits however delineating accurately the groundwater occurrence zones using mainly data from boreholes drilled for dewatering during coal extraction is challenging a gtlci model was successfully applied to refine groundwater zonation in the sandstone aquifers overlying cb3 which is the object of mining operations in lcm shandong province china without using direct field information on groundwater storage and flow the gtlci model integrated nine factors including aquifer depth aquifer thickness faults length density faults density fault frequency density fault scale density variation coefficient of the slope of the coal seam intensity index of folds in horizontal direction and lithological composition index each factor was divided into 5 classes that closely control the potential for groundwater storage in sandstone aquifers then the ahp and tfn method were applied to weight each class resulting thus in 45 normalized ratings table 9 the factors that played the most important role for groundwater storage in sandstone were fault length density fault density fault frequency density fault scale density folds vcs and iifoh and they were able to explain 70 of groundwater zonation within the aquifer potential groundwater yield contour map was constructed based on the gtlci values using the kriging function interpolation technique the predicted groundwater potential zones were divided into four water abundance zones low 0 03 low medium 0 03 0 07 medium high 0 07 0 12 and high greater than 0 12 the zonation was compared to that obtained from single well pumping test workface and roadway data and the gtlci model was essentially in agreement with the field data therefore supporting its applicability the results of the study can be used to dewater the sandstone aquifers during the mining of cb3 using boreholes they also can be applied to provide water for mining activities for other mines with sandstone aquifers and to search for groundwater in area where it is sparse acknowledgements this research was financially supported by national key r d program of china grant no 2017yfc0804100 and

7501,resolving the potential groundwater yield zonation of sandstone aquifers occurring at depths of several hundred meters has been an important and challenging objective of the hydrogeological research focused on preventing flood hazards in coal mines using accessible geological exploration data we put forward a method of predicting the spatial distribution of groundwater storage potential in sandstone aquifers from permian age coal deposits in juye coalfield shangdong china a geological tectonic and lithological composition index gtlci model was created using the following parameters sandstone depth and thickness faults length density fald faults density fad fault frequency density fafd fault scale density fasd variation coefficient of the slope vcs of the coal seam intensity index of folds in horizontal direction iifoh and lithological composition index lci each of these factors was subsequently divided into 5 classes the analytic hierarchy process ahp and trapezoidal fuzzy number tfn method was applied to calculate the weight of the conditioning factor and their respective sub classes groundwater yield potential contour map which was initially constructed using the gtlci values revealed four groundwater abundance zones the map was further refined by taking into account hydrogeologic data collected during mining activities the gtlci model predictive success rate of 80 was explained by the limited number of boreholes available for validation it is considered that the gtlci model is effective at predicting zonation of groundwater yield in the sandstone aquifers from permian age coal deposits in juye coalfield china keywords potential groundwater yield zone gis sandstone aquifers coal deposits china 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most important global natural resources for communities as well as for agriculture and industrial activities manap et al 2014 naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 nampak et al 2014 rahmati et al 2016 for example in the dry northern and northwestern regions of china groundwater is used for drinking by more than 70 of the population and is also used to irrigate more than 40 of the farmland qiu 2010 however groundwater can pose major risks during coal mine construction and production between 2000 and 2011 a total of 1089 water related incidents and 4329 casualties caused by mine flooding were reported in china lamoreaux et al 2014 therefore mining safety and mine water hazards mitigation are key objectives for hydrogeologists and researchers tan et al 2010a b 2012 cheng et al 2013 tan et al 2013 wu et al 2014 chen et al 2016 the exploration of potential aquifers situated in the proximity of active mine sectors is one of the most important tasks which could contribute to the prevention of mine flooding prediction of groundwater hazard potential zones has been extensively studied and all the prediction methods for groundwater hazard potential zones rely on the groundwater yield zonation therefore for mines with high risks of flooding it is necessary to develop predictive models of potential groundwater bearing zones the traditional approaches to determine the potential groundwater bearing zones has been to collect data through drilling hydrogeological tests and geophysical methods these approaches are usually very costly and time consuming nampak et al 2014 sander et al 1996 the corroboration of geomorphologic and geophysical data for locating potential groundwater yield zones dhakate et al 2012 has been an economical and effective approach employed especially in areas with shallow aquifers more recently many researchers have applied the integrated approach of the geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs for mapping groundwater potential zones dar et al 2010 madrucci et al 2008 nampak et al 2014 prasad et al 2008 the different statistical methods used for modelling are listed in table 1 the following factors were taken into account by the previously study topography geology vegetation land use climatic conditions surface drainage patterns and regional groundwater depth however additional factors should also be considered in regions with consolidated or crystalline rocks especially in the deep aquifers yin and brook 1992 pointed out that the topographic approach to locating high yield wells in crystalline rocks might not be reliable and also was skeptical of the claim that the topographic factor can strongly predict the water yield of a well therefore a compatible model to predict potential groundwater yield zonation should consider the actual condition of the aquifers in sandstone with deep depth in this study we generate the groundwater yield potential map of the deep sandstone aquifers of the coal bearing shanxi formation cisuralian f by using a gis based geological tectonic and lithological models the water that floods the mining space and associated tunnels comes usually from the sandstone aquifers of the shanxi formation therefore these aquifers affect the efficiency and safety of coal mining processes the presence and quantity of water in the sandstone aquifers have been important objectives of hydrogeological research characterizing the groundwater yield potential zone in sandstone aquifers supplements significantly the more traditional methods involving hydrogeological and geophysical techniques wu et al 2007 zhou et al 2002 xiao et al 2015 and it has become more and more common in addition some evaluation methods such as single factor analysis li et al 2012 multi factor analysis chen et al 2012 gis information fusion wu et al 2011a b adiat et al 2012 nampak et al 2014 fuzzy clustering wu et al 2011a b brittle rock percentage composition ren et al 2011 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process index han et al 2012 have also been employed to estimate the groundwater storage potential in sandstone aquifers it is relatively common that hydrogeological studies lag behind the geological exploration during mining activities especially in new coal mines therefore it is important to predict accurately the potential groundwater yield zone of the aquifers using data acquired during geological exploration this paper presents a method of predicting the potential groundwater yield zone in sandstone aquifers from permian age coal deposits using data collected from coal mine the main objective of the proposed study is to 1 demonstrate that the potential groundwater yield zone in sandstone aquifers from coal bearing formations can be predicted efficiently even without direct hydrogeological information by using geological data only by developing a complex geologic tectonic and lithological composition index and 2 discuss the relationship between each conditioning factor of the index and zonation of groundwater yield in sandstone aquifers in a coal mine throughout this study each conditioning factor will be quantitatively defined the main difference between this research and the approaches described in the aforementioned publications is that the proposed predictive model corroborates the depth and thickness of the aquifer with the local tectonics faults and folds and detailed aquifer lithology using gis 2 study area and geologic and hydrogeological setting 2 1 study area the area containing the longgu coal mine lcm which is the object of the current study lies in juye county heze city shandong province china fig 1 the site lies between 35 13 59 n and 35 22 59 n latitude and 115 49 59 e and 115 58 59 e longitude and covers an area of about 142 3 km2 the mean annual rainfall about of the area is 694 70 mm and the mean annual temperature is 14 8 c table 2 few seasonal streams lie in the coal field lcm is located in the juye coalfield shandong province and is a very large mine with a designed production of 6mt a the mining activities have focused on coal bed no 3 cb3 which is thick extensive and of high quality the age of the coal deposit is permian previous survey reports mentioned a low mine water inflow rate from sandstone aquifers during the cb3 mining however underground boreholes roadways and workface and extraction data showed that groundwater was actually abundant in the sandstone aquifers overlying cb3 thus possessing a threat to roadway excavation and efficient production zhang 2008 therefore it has become necessary to predict the groundwater distribution and potential zone in these sandstone aquifers 2 2 geologic conditions longgu coal mine is located in a typical north china coalfield of permo carboniferous age the coal bearing deposits are attributed to the benxi formation f taiyuan f shanxi f and shihezi f they are covered by neogene mudstones fine sandstones clay and sand with a thickness varying between 377 10 and 589 30 m overlaid by quaternary sandy clays fine grained sand and sand with a thickness ranging from 141 40 to 179 00 m the mined coal beds belong to the taiyuan and shanxi fs zhang 2008 as shown in fig 2 generally the area is a faulted and folded monocline with a south north strike and dipping east the major faults are oriented nne ssw and the others ene wsw and ese wnw fig 3 a total of 805 faults have been identified 2 3 hydrogeological conditions the lithology of the main aquifers is dominated by sand and gravel at the quaternary and neogene levels and sandstone within the permo carboniferous deposits water flows into the excavations from the roof sandstone during the mining of cb3 in the shanxi f the main aquitards include clay beds in quaternary and neogene and mudstone siltstone and bauxite in permo carboniferous fig 2 for the sake of the aquicludes above the clastic rock surface water and rainfall have no relationship with groundwater in sandstone aquifers as shown in fig 4 the proposed study focuses on the sandstone occurring on the roof of cb3 the sandstone is an example of fractured confined aquifer with a thickness and depth ranging between 4 80 m and 75 56 m and 690 m and 1240 m below the surface respectively the predominantly fine sandstone has intercalations of coarser sandstone and siltstone hydraulic conductivities ranged between 0 010 m d and 0 027 m d and the water yield per unit of drawdown varied from 0 008 l s m to 0 015 l s m which calculate from three drawdown within single well pumping test on the sandstone aquifers in the no l 2 and l 15 wells the initial water levels ranged between 34 97 m and 35 12 m and were calculated using information from two boreholes and showed that the aquifer had a low water yield the water level and pumping tests performed at the lcm showed that sandstone aquifers have no direct relationship with other thick aquifers according to few hydrogeological holes founded in previously hydrogeological exploration zhang 2008 3 data 3 1 selected factors that affect potential groundwater yield in sandstone usually the existence and abundance of groundwater in a given aquifer is affected by many geo environmental factors as described above the significant relationship of groundwater occurrence and conditioning factors has been studied in oh et al 2011 adiat et al 2012 lee et al 2012a b nampak et al 2014 park et al 2014 pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 razandi et al 2015 and rahmati et al 2016 the main potential groundwater yield conditioning factors considered in this study are depth of sandstone thickness of sandstone fault density fold density and detailed aquifer lithology these factors are considered as the most important in controlling the flow and storage of groundwater and therefore affect the potential groundwater yield zonation in sandstone the geologic data were collected prior to and during mining activities mainly from boreholes and 3d seismic exploration throughout the mine area 3 2 factors 3 2 1 depth dp the bottom of the sandstone layer that formed the roof of cb3 was at depths ranging from 690 m to1240 m below the ground surface the data acquired from 3d seismic exploration geo exploration and roadway and workface constructions fig 5 a as lithostatic pressure increases with depth do does the degree of sandstone compaction which decreases secondary porosity slightly by possibly closing the fractures present 3 2 2 thickness tk the thickness of sandstone aquifers is one of the most important hydrogeological factors and can be applied to evaluate potential groundwater yield rao and briz kishore 1991 razandi et al 2015 the thickness of sandstone in this study area was acquired from the geo exploration data as shown in fig 5b the thickness of the sandstone is the basis for determining the absolute water yield in the aquifer the thicker the layer the greater the yield when all other factors are the same the sandstone overlying cb3 varies between 4 80 m and 75 56 m 3 2 3 fault length density fald faults have a great importance for groundwater potential and especially on groundwater storage and migration faults have usually been used as an indicative tool for locating potential groundwater yield zones dar et al 2010 mabee et al 1994 2002 magowe and carr 1999 sander et al 1997 yin and brook 1992 therefore the analysis of faults in coal fields helps build quantitative indices which leads to follow the groundwater potential variability throughout the sandstone faults are linear features of tectonic origin that are long narrow and relatively straight and as revealed by 3d seismic exploration geo exploration and roadway and workface extractions in the study area had throws ranging from 0 5 m to 500 m the major faults are oriented nne ssw and the rest ene wsw and ese wnw fig 3 the horizontal stress plays a leading role in the regional stress field and the direction of the maximal principal stress was ne65 87 and almost perpendicular to more fault strikes wang et al 2010 a total of 805 faults have been identified the faults length density fald is the total length of all recorded faults with various throws divided by a unit cell area fig 5c 1 fald i 1 n l i s where the l i is the sum of length of all faults unit is m s is an area with a grid cell size of 100 m 100 m 0 001 km2 see also fig 5c 3 2 4 fault density fad the faults density fad is the total number of faults multiplied by throw and divided by the product of the average throw for all faults and the area and is expressed by eq 2 2 fad n i 1 n h i s h where the n is the total quantity of all faults i 1 n h i is the sum of throw of all faults in a grid h is the average of all throws in the study area and s is the grid cell area here we take into account the throw of the faults to distinguish the different scale present the coefficient of correction with the sum of throw in the grid divided by the average of all faults in this study area which is unlike the previous research cao et al 2002 wu et al 2013 as shown in fig 5d the more numerous and large the faults the more space for conduction and storage of groundwater 3 2 5 fault frequency density fafd the fault frequency density fafd is the sum of all the intersection points and endpoints of all faults divided by the cell grid area and is expressed by eq 3 park et al 2014 wu et al 2013 and shown in fig 5e 3 fafd ni ne s where the ni and ne is the total intersection and end points respectively of all faults in the grid cell with area s more fault intersections weaken the integrity of the rock mass and therefore increase sandstone permeability and water storing capacity and thus the groundwater potential as well 3 2 6 fault scale density fasd the fault scale density fasd is the sum of the products of fault throws multiplied by their corresponding fault length divided by the grid cell and is expressed by eq 4 wu et al 2013 and shown in fig 5f 4 fasd i 1 n h i l i s in general fasd is directly correlated with the groundwater potential in a similar manner to fafd and fald naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 eqs 1 to 4 are used to calculate the fald fad fafd and fasd values for all the grids with a 100 m by 100 m cell each value was plotted at the respective grid center and then interpolated with the kriging interpolation technique to create maps for each parameter five classes were created for each parameter based on the values marked by contour lines 3 2 7 variation coefficient of slope vcs of coal seam the variation coefficient of slope vcs of coal seam is defined as the ratio of the coal seam slope values standard deviation to the mean slope and is expressed by eq 5 it also indicates the degree of fold development cao et al 2002 the slope of the coal seam floor was calculated from the coal seam floor elevation contour map which was drawn based on geo exploration 3d seismic exploration roadway and workface constructions data the variation coefficient is expressed by eq 5 and shown in fig 5g 5 cdavc 1 n i 1 n Î± i Î± 2 Î± where the Î± i and Î± are the slope of individual and average coal seam floor dip respectively in a 50 m 50 m grid cell 3 2 8 intensity index of folds in horizontal direction iifoh intensity index of folds in horizontal direction iifoh describes the horizontal complexity of folds it is expressed by eq 6 and takes into account horizontal projection on the grid edge of the fold length and the actual length of the fold it is also shown in fig 5 h 6 iifop d 0 d 1 d 1 100 where the d 0 is the actual length of the folds on plan and d 1 is the horizontal projection length of the folds on plan in a 50 m 50 m grid cell 3 2 9 lithological composition index lci the shanxi f is composed of dark grey to black mudstone and coal beds and a series of grey medium grained sandstone grey to white fine grained sandstone and dark grey siltstone cb3 is the main object of the mining activities in the lcm this coal layer is overlain by sandstone of all grain sizes siltstone sandy mudstone and mudstone fig 6 the different types of lithology control groundwater storage the coarser the sandstone the thicker the sandstone layer and the greater the water storage capacity the presence of mudstone intercalations limits the development of the fractures as well as any connection between sandstone aquifers zhang 2008 clay content influences the degree of fissure development the more the clay content of a rock unit the less fissures and the less the permeability of the rock and hence the less its potentiality for groundwater storage adiat et al 2012 sandstone is often brittle and susceptible to fracturing which thus increases porosity and permeability secondary porosity is the key factor in hard rocks especially in clastic ones huang et al 2014 and enhances groundwater potentiality therefore a sandstone with bigger grain size and little clay content would have a higher rating in terms of groundwater storage capacity than a soft rock with small grain size and more clay content in this study we put forward the lithological composition index lci in order to integrate the different kind of rock overlaying cb3 7 lci a 1 b 0 8 c 0 6 d 0 2 e 1 g where lci is the lithological composition index a b c d e are the thicknesses of coarse sandstone medium grained sandstone fine grained sandstone siltstone and fracture zones or limestone respectively g is the structure coefficient and 0 2 0 6 0 8 and 1 are the equivalent coefficients for different rock types for example when the sandstone thickness represents more than 80 of the total thickness which defined the height of 20 times thickness of cb3 above cb3 the structure coefficient equals 1 when the proportion is between 55 and 80 the structure coefficient equals 0 8 when the proportion ranges between 45 and 55 the structure coefficient equals 0 6 when the proportion ranges between 20 and 45 the structure coefficient equals 0 4 and when the proportion is 20 or less the structure coefficient equals 0 2 as shown in fig 5i 4 methodology 4 1 procedures the prediction of zone of groundwater yield potential of sandstone aquifers in coal deposits consisted of four main steps 1 selecting the factors that control groundwater storage potentiality in the aquifer and geological data collection 2 calculation of the quantitative evaluation indices 3 data standardization building the index model and validation of the results and 4 description and visual interpretation of the results the steps are shown in fig 7 4 2 data normalization in order to combine all the available depth thickness geologic tectonic and lithological data into a unified model and also take into account the multiple orders of magnitude of various parameters the following normalization is employed eq 8 8 x ik x ik min x ik max x ik min x ik where xik is the original value of a parameter and max xik and min xik are the original maximum and minimum values respectively 4 3 determining factors weights it is critical to obtain the weight of the factors integrated during groundwater susceptibility mapping there are many methods of calculating the weights such as the statistical index si weighting factor methods wf sener et al 2005 and the analytic hierarchy process ahp adiat et al 2012 razandi et al 2015 in this paper we applied the ahp to determine factor weights and put forward the trapezoidal fuzzy number method tfn to calculate the weights of the factors subclasses xie 2011 4 3 1 ahp method the details and steps of ahp were described by malczewski 1999 and adiat 2012 accordingly the weights of faults fas folds fos lci thickness tk and depth dp are shown in tables 3 and 4 and the weights of fad fasd fald and fafd are shown in table 5 4 3 2 tfn method the tfn can evaluate ambiguity and uncertainty xie 2011 five levels of factor weights were thus evaluated table 6 and of each factor weighting representation different evaluation of fuzzy language as shown in table 6 a medium level of attribute factor can be expressed as 3 5 5 7 in tfn 4 3 3 steps of calculating weights with tfn method step 1 determining decision making weights of each member of the expert group if there are k experts in a group then the decision making weight of each member is rt t 1 2 k where rt 0 1 and Ïrt 1 rt is defined by the eq 9 if r 1 r 2 r t 1 k this expert group is called affirmative decision otherwise the expert group is exclusive decision 9 r t w t i 1 t w t t 1 2 3 k where wt is the weight obtained from each expert step 2 evaluating the importance of each sub factor according to the table 6 with fuzzy vocabulary and calculating the comprehensive weight from the expert group for example set w jt ajt bjt cjt djt for the no t expert and evaluate the relative importance of the no aj category then the comprehensive weight w j from the expert group evaluates the no aj category as shown by eq 10 10 w j a j b j c j d j t 1 k r t a jt t 1 k r t b jt t 1 k r t c jt t 1 k r t d jt step 3 calculating fuzzy weight fuzzy weight d w j was calculated with eq 11 11 d w j a j b j c j d j 4 j 1 2 5 step 4 construction weight vector the fuzzy weight of the no aj category was further processed eq 12 12 w ij d w j j 1 5 d w j j 1 2 5 where j 1 5 w ij 1 and the weight vector of the no aj category is shown with eq 13 13 w w 11 w 12 w 13 w 14 w 15 in this paper the weights of each category were determined with the tfn method in order to estimate the weight of each conditioning factor questionnaires were given to four geology and or hydrogeology experts all the experts made decisions and submitted different tfns on different levels for each factor based on their interpretation of table 6 information take into account for example the tk and fald to illustrate the different tfns on five levels from the four experts tables 7 and 8 4 3 4 weighting the classified factors the thematic layer of each factor was classified based on experts decisions and literature review different classes were assigned to each factor with ratings ranging from 1 to 5 corresponding to very low low medium high and very high groundwater storage potential the classes and their corresponding ratings and normalized weights of all factors are shown in table 9 4 4 building the potential groundwater yield prediction model the comprehensive multiple factor analysis was considered to be the best method to account for all the factors controlling the groundwater storage potential in a sandstone aquifer chenini et al 2010 murthy and mamo 2009 magesh et al 2012 park et al 2014 in this paper the weighted linear average was used to estimate the geological tectonic and lithological structure index gtlci this technique is usually expressed in terms of standardized weightings for each factor as well as normalized scores for all options relative to each of the criteria the final utility d for each option ci is then calculated as follows 14 d i 1 i n c i w i where ci is the normalized standard weight for each class of each factor wi is the individual weighting for each factor and d is the value of gtlci then the value of gtlci in each grid was computed using eqs 14 and 15 15 gtlci c dp w a c tk w b c fald w c c fafd w d c fasd w e c fod w g c cdavc w f c iifoh w h c lci w i where c dp to c lci are the normalized values for each class weight and wa to wi are the normalized weight ratings as shown on the fifth row in table 9 gtlci model combined the nine conditioning factors in one formula and the depth and thickness of sandstone aquifer were measured and the lci need calculate from the thickness of different rock and ratio and the others factors need calculate in each grid 5 results and discussion 5 1 results the gtlci value was calculated for each 50 m 50 m grid cell all cell data was then processed using the surfer and mapgis k9 software which are specialized in drawing contour maps and spatial overlapping analysis the value of gtlci was plotted at the center of the grid cells using the coordinates of the grid cell centers the overall gtlci contour model map was constructed using the kriging function interpolation technique fig 8 according to the map the potential groundwater yield as expressed by gtlci values ranges in the study area between 0 01and 0 18 thus the area can be divided into four water abundance zones low 0 03 low medium 0 03 0 07 medium high 0 07 0 12 and high greater than 0 12 table 10 the map also shows that the areas with the highest groundwater potential are located mainly in the western central and northeast parts of the coal field whereas the low low medium and medium high potential areas are located in the western and southern south and west central and northeastern and eastern parts respectively as shown in fig 8 the high values of thickness fald fad fafd and lci were responsible for the high water potential 5 2 validating the prediction validation is the key to verify the results adiat et al 2012 therefore in order to ensure that the potential groundwater yield zone prediction by gtlci was accurate for the study area validation tests were carried out in the field the validation was accomplished by processing pumping test results from two boreholes drainage water inflow from dewatering boreholes constructed in roadways and mine water inflow from roadways and workfaces the locations names and the actual yields q measured from borehole pumping tests and different water inflows from dewatering boreholes were displayed on the groundwater potential map together with water inflow data at different workfaces fig 8 and table 11 take the dewatering boreholes for underground roadways as an example the data for 16 boreholes were in accordance with the gtlci prediction data from 4 boreholes were in disagreement with the prediction therefore based on 20 boreholes the success rate was 80 a comparison of the field and gtlci data at various locations as shown in table 11 and indicates that the gtlci model predictions were in general consistent with the actual yield therefore the gtlci based prediction was considered to be accurate and reliable for guiding the process of dewatering the mine roadways by drilling boreholes 5 3 discussions predicting accurately potential groundwater yield zones in sandstone aquifers is a challenging and difficult task dar et al 2011 especially in the present study area the exploration of sandstone aquifers still remains a tough task because of the complex geo circumstances such as multistage tectonic movement wide range of lithology with different mineral compositions l anisotropy and heterogeneity of rock media and complicated fracture networks there are many factors influencing groundwater storage in the sandstone aquifers of the study area including the original and induced fractures for example the geological conditions present before the mining of cb3 depth of sandstone floor thickness of sandstone aquifers faults folds and lithology data were collected analyzed overlayed spatial interpolated processed and plotted with gis each of the factors taken into account controls the groundwater storage potential in the sandstone aquifers the main controlling factors are faults folds lci thickness and depth with weights of 0 449 0 258 0 174 0 082 and 0 037 respectively calculated by ahp which offers the advantage of using a hierarchical processing of each factor and therefore is able to evaluate the impact of each factor furthermore tfn eliminated the need for more field tests by asking experts to rank the factor weights and thus taking into account the ambiguity and uncertainty of factor importance estimation the relationship between gtlci and faults factors including fault length density fault density fault frequency density and fault scale density are considered critical when delineating groundwater potential zones in sandstone aquifers the richest groundwater potential zones have been observed to have a high faults density adiat et al 2012 khairul et al 2000 magesh et al 2012 the more faults the higher the gtlci and this can be seen in the west central part of the study area fig 8 in this area many small faults otherwise not detectable by 3d seismic surveys or boreholes were identified during the construction of roadways and advancement of the workface the relationship between gtlci and folds namely vcs and iifoh can be deduced from table 4 vcs and iifoh play a very important role in distributing the fissures or fractures that benefit the groundwater potential the lci was put forward in this research to indicate how different lithologies affect groundwater distribution in sandstone from coal deposits the lci is taking into account not only the type and thickness of clastic rock but also the thickness ratio of different lithologies and groundwater storage reduction coefficient by different lithologies the lci values were calculated with geo boreholes drilled to explore the coal field although the most important factors affecting groundwater distribution and flow in sandstone are the number fractures and their connectivity the thickness of sandstone is also is notable because it controls the total volume of pore and fracture space available for groundwater storage with the increase of thickness from west to east the gtlci also increase from west to east in general the depth of sandstone aquifers impacts the degree of compaction and secondary porosity usually enhances the ground pressure on the sandstone and alleviates groundwater movement within the aquifers therefore the available spaces for the storage of groundwater decrease with depth although the gtlci values decrease from west to east in general which also indicates that depth impacts the gtlci only slightly it is evident that the faults and folds reservoir thickness and lci have the greatest influence on the model the gtlci map shows that groundwater distribution within the sandstone aquifers is very inhomogeneous and depends on the degree of exploration by different methods more data is necessary in order to calculate the gtlci by 3d seismic and geo boreholes in particular the data acquired during mining activities is able to reveal the presence of small faults and folds fig 8 which are difficult to acquire by 3d seismics the proposed prediction model is more detailed for the west central parts than for the rest of the study area fig 8 the field data from 20 dewatering boreholes 2 pumping test holes and 16 workfaces located in the west central parts successfully validated the gtlci model gtlci values rely on theabundant of geological exploration data and which will change by the quantity distribution of all the influential factors more borehole data will lead to more realistic results and changing grid size would not make a different in the prediction the proposed model is not based on hydrogeological exploration data but built based on several factors that have close relations to the sandstone groundwater storage potential therefore the gtlci model works better for predicting groundwater distribution within sandstone aquifers than the single well pumping test method which is widely applied to evaluate the groundwater yield in aquifers 6 conclusions to prevent coal mine flooding it is essential to determine the distribution of groundwater in sandstone aquifers from coal deposits however delineating accurately the groundwater occurrence zones using mainly data from boreholes drilled for dewatering during coal extraction is challenging a gtlci model was successfully applied to refine groundwater zonation in the sandstone aquifers overlying cb3 which is the object of mining operations in lcm shandong province china without using direct field information on groundwater storage and flow the gtlci model integrated nine factors including aquifer depth aquifer thickness faults length density faults density fault frequency density fault scale density variation coefficient of the slope of the coal seam intensity index of folds in horizontal direction and lithological composition index each factor was divided into 5 classes that closely control the potential for groundwater storage in sandstone aquifers then the ahp and tfn method were applied to weight each class resulting thus in 45 normalized ratings table 9 the factors that played the most important role for groundwater storage in sandstone were fault length density fault density fault frequency density fault scale density folds vcs and iifoh and they were able to explain 70 of groundwater zonation within the aquifer potential groundwater yield contour map was constructed based on the gtlci values using the kriging function interpolation technique the predicted groundwater potential zones were divided into four water abundance zones low 0 03 low medium 0 03 0 07 medium high 0 07 0 12 and high greater than 0 12 the zonation was compared to that obtained from single well pumping test workface and roadway data and the gtlci model was essentially in agreement with the field data therefore supporting its applicability the results of the study can be used to dewater the sandstone aquifers during the mining of cb3 using boreholes they also can be applied to provide water for mining activities for other mines with sandstone aquifers and to search for groundwater in area where it is sparse acknowledgements this research was financially supported by national key r d program of china grant no 2017yfc0804100 and

7502,assessing how forest disturbance and climate variability affect streamflow components is critical for watershed management ecosystem protection and engineering design previous studies have mainly evaluated the effects of forest disturbance on total streamflow rarely with attention given to its components e g base flow and surface runoff particularly in large watersheds 1000 km2 in this study the upper similkameen river watershed 1810 km2 an international watershed situated between canada and the usa was selected to examine how forest disturbance and climate variability interactively affect total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff baseflow was separated using a combination of the recursive digital filter method and conductivity mass balance method time series analysis and modified double mass curves were then employed to quantitatively separate the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to each streamflow component our results showed that average annual baseflow and baseflow index baseflow streamflow were 113 3 35 6 mm year 1 and 0 27 for 1954 2013 respectively forest disturbance increased annual streamflow baseflow and surface runoff of 27 7 13 7 mm 7 4 3 6 mm and 18 4 12 9 mm respectively with its relative contributions to the changes in respective streamflow components being 27 0 23 0 29 2 23 1 and 25 7 23 4 respectively in contrast climate variability decreased them by 74 9 13 7 mm 17 9 3 6 mm and 53 3 12 9 mm respectively with its relative contributions to the changes in respective streamflow components being 73 0 23 0 70 8 23 1 and 73 1 23 4 respectively despite working in opposite ways the impacts of climate variability on annual streamflow baseflow and surface runoff were of a much greater magnitude than forest disturbance impacts this study has important implications for the protection of aquatic habitat engineering design and watershed planning in the context of future forest disturbance and climate change keywords forest disturbance climate variability baseflow separation relative contributions streamflow components cumulative effects 1 introduction the impacts of changes in forest cover on water yield have long been investigated across the globe andrÃ©assian 2004 brown et al 2005 farley et al 2005 stednick 1996 wei et al 2013 wei et al 2017 recent reviews on the relationship between forest change and water yield across multiple spatial scales have concluded that deforestation increases water yield while reforestation decreases it li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a the implications of these reviews are pivotal for water supply ecosystem protection and engineering design however previous studies have mainly focused on how forest change affects total streamflow with limited attention given to major streamflow components i e baseflow and surface runoff considering all streamflow components can lead to a more complete understanding of hydrological responses to forest change in a watershed limited studies have examined the impacts of change in forest cover or land use on baseflow and surface runoff a global summary on this subject with watershed sizes ranging from plot level 1 ha to large watershed scale 1000 km2 is provided in table 1 in small watersheds 100 km2 the impacts of change in forest cover on baseflow or groundwater recharge are mainly inferred from the change in groundwater table with relatively consistent conclusions for example a rising of the groundwater table was observed after forest logging indicating forest disturbance increased groundwater recharge or baseflow table 1 smerdon et al 2009 while streamflow dried up completely in the ninth year after eucalyptus plantation in south africa scott and lesch 1997 demonstrating that an increase in forest cover decreased baseflow for large watersheds 1000 km2 hydrological models were often adopted to study the effects of forest change on streamflow components and the conclusions from those model based studies were inconsistent khoi and suetsugi 2014 ma et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 for instance vegetation expansion has dramatically reduced total streamflow and surface runoff but baseflow was increased using the soil and water assessment tool swat in the kejie watershed 1755 km2 southwestern china ma et al 2009 conversely khoi and suetsugi 2014 concluded that a reduction in forest cover augmented total streamflow and surface runoff while decreased baseflow in the be river catchment 7500 km2 vietnam these contrasting results highlight large variations in hydrological responses of streamflow components especially baseflow alteration due to forest or land cover change the limited studies along with inconsistent results in large watersheds demonstrate that more case studies are needed in large forested watersheds forest change and climate variability are two major drivers influencing hydrological variation to investigate the impacts of forest change on hydrology the effects of climate variability on flow must be either removed or taken into consideration the interest in considering both drivers and their relative contributions to streamflow has been growing significantly e g li et al 2017 wei et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 wei et al 2017 however a direct and quantitative assessment of how annual streamflow responds to both forest change and climate variability is challenging particularly in large watersheds as it requires explicit consideration of climate variability when assessing the hydrological effects of forest change wei and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2012 it is even more challenging to study the relative contributions of climate variability and forest change to all streamflow components advanced statistical analyses have been used to explore the effects of land cover or forest change on total streamflow for example statistical techniques such as the sensitivity based method double mass curves simple water balance and the time trend method have been developed and widely used wei et al 2013 among them wei and zhang 2010 devised modified double mass curves mdmc and time series analysis to separate the relative contributions of forest change and climate variability to annual streamflow as the mdmc method is based on water balance it has the potential to separate the relative effects of forest change and climate variability on baseflow and surface runoff another challenge in this research subject is the accurate separation of baseflow from total streamflow numerous methods have been developed to separate total streamflow into baseflow and surface runoff zhang et al 2013 among them the conductivity mass balance cmb method has received growing attention because 1 it is developed based on the close correlation between discharge and water specific conductance referred to as conductivity hereafter in theory baseflow percolates through soil and rock and therefore picks up more ions on its route than surface runoff which leads to higher ion concentrations than surface runoff matsubayashi et al 1993 stewart et al 2007 and 2 conductivity data are easy to obtain with moderate cost however cmb applications are often constrained by long term daily conductivity data to address this shortcoming zhang et al 2013 developed a combined baseflow separation method which used the cmb method to calibrate the recursive digital filter method in this way long term baseflow can be accurately separated in this combined method li et al 2014 found that a minimum of 6 months continuous conductivity data in low flow seasons e g summer should be collected to assure its reliability based on our literature review the hypothesis of this study was that for a large forested watershed located in a snow dominated hydrological regime forest disturbance has significant effects on streamflow and its components our specific key objectives of this study were 1 to explore the effects of forest disturbance on total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff in the upper similkameen river watershed 2 to quantify the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff and 3 to discuss possible implications of our results for management of water resource and protection of aquatic functions 2 study site and data 2 1 study site the upper similkameen river usr watershed has a drainage area of 1810 km2 of which 540 km2 is located in washington usa the headwaters of the watershed are on the usa side of the border draining north into canada fig 1 elevation ranges from 635 to 2546 m above sea level in 1954 2013 the average annual precipitation was 1000 mm the highest and lowest monthly mean temperatures were 19 6 c in july and 9 7 c in january the watershed covers several biogeoclimatic zones including the interior douglas fir zone on the valley floors and the montane spruce and the engelmann spruce subalpine fir at higher elevations pojar et al 1987 2 2 watershed data 2 2 1 climate data monthly mean tmean maximum tmax and minimum tmin temperatures and precipitation of the study watershed were generated from the climate west north american wna dataset for 1954 2013 wang et al 2016 climatewna is a standalone program that extracts and downscales historical climate data from climate research unit at the university of east anglia mitchell and jones 2005 from 1901 to 2014 wang et al 2016 it calculates monthly and annual climate variables for any given location based on latitude longitude and elevation given the large spatial variations in climate across the watershed monthly climate data were generated at a resolution of 500 500 m across the study watershed fig 2 2 2 2 forest disturbance data two provincial level databases were obtained from the british columbia ministry of forests lands and natural resources operations the cutblocks 2010 and the vegetation resources inventory vri 2010 the cutblocks database is a spatial record of forest harvest size location and timing the vri database provides detailed tree characteristics and additional non logging disturbance type i e fire and insect infestation therefore these two databases are complementary and were both used to quantify the forest disturbance history in the study watershed it should be noted that forest disturbance data are not available in the part of the watershed located in the usa the quantification of forest disturbance was only made in the canadian portion of the watershed 2 2 3 hydrology and conductivity data daily stream discharge data were collected from the hydrometric station station id 08nl007 similkameen river at princeton that is operated and maintained by environment canada the annual average discharge was 423 mm in 1954 2013 agricultural irrigation was the largest water consumer in the watershed and accounted for less than 2 of the annual mean flow summit 2011 the highest discharge occurred in the snow melting season march to may accounting for 68 of the annual discharge the in situ conductivity probe ctd diver di 271 schlumberger water service canada was installed near the hydrometric station to measure continuous conductivity at a frequency of 30 min from may 19 2015 to june 21 2016 the conductivity measurements for each day were averaged to derive daily conductivity fig 3 3 methods 3 1 quantification of forest disturbance levels logging mountain pine beetle mpb infestation and wildfire are the three major forest disturbance types in the study watershed fig 4 according to the vri database a forest stand in the study watershed was either disturbed by only one type e g logging or wildfire or mpb or two types of disturbances where a forest stand that was first disturbed by one type and was followed by another e g a forest stand that is disturbed by wildfire first and then by salvage logging different kinds of forest disturbance cumulate over space and time in any forested watersheds equivalent clear cut area eca is used to quantify forest disturbance levels and is defined as the area that has been clear cut fire killed or infested by mpb with a reduction factor eca coefficient to account for hydrological recovery due to forest regeneration an eca coefficient of 100 means that there is no hydrological recovery in a disturbed area while an eca coefficient of zero indicates a full hydrological recovery the cumulative equivalent clear cut area ceca is the sum of annual eca values in the watershed the hydrological recovery of a forest stand is related to its growth rate over time and is therefore determined by many factors including disturbance type climate and tree species a detailed description of the eca estimation procedure can be found in wei and zhang 2010 logging or post disturbance salvage logging was the dominant disturbance type in the usr watershed over the study period the upper reaches of the watershed are in the e c manning provincial park canada where logging is prohibited fig 1 the average annual area logged was 0 38 of the watershed area the ceca from logging was 17 5 of the watershed area in 1954 2011 forest fire occasionally occurred with the largest forest fire occurring in 1984 on average 1 of the watershed area was burnt annually mpb was not a significant disturbance type until 2003 about 1 4 and 2 3 of the watershed area were affected by mpb in 2004 and 2007 respectively in 2011 the ceca from mpb reached 15 7 of the watershed area in summary the total ceca from all disturbance types was 37 1 of the total watershed area in 2011 fig 4 3 2 baseflow separation methods 3 2 1 conductivity mass balance cmb method the conductivity mass balance cmb method stewart et al 2007 is expressed as 1 bf q c q c ro c bf c ro where bf is baseflow m3 s 1 q is daily streamflow discharge m3 s 1 cq is the conductivity of streamflow Âµs cm 1 cbf is the conductivity of baseflow Âµs cm 1 and cro is the conductivity of surface runoff Âµs cm 1 cro is assumed to correspond to the highest daily streamflow while cbf corresponds to the lowest daily streamflow assumptions of applying the cmb method are 1 contributions from other streamflow components are negligible 2 cbf and cro are constant over the specific period and 3 cbf and cro values are different from each other as baseflow percolates through soil and rocks and carries more ions on its route and thus has higher conductivity than surface runoff li et al 2014 miller et al 2014 stewart et al 2007 3 2 2 recursive digital filter rdf method the recursive digital filter rdf method eq 2 proposed by eckhardt 2005 was used for the long term baseflow separation in this study 2 bf t 1 bfi max Î± bf t 1 1 Î± bfi max q t 1 Î± bfi max subject to bft qt where bf is baseflow m3 s 1 q is daily streamflow discharge m3 s 1 Î± is recession constant dimensionless and bfimax is the maximum value of the baseflow index the ratio of baseflow to total streamflow in the rdf method Î± can be determined from the hydrograph however bfimax cannot be directly measured li et al 2014 the accuracy of the baseflow results from the rdf method is more sensitive to the bfimax than to the recession constant the bfimax should normally be estimated from a tracer method zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017a in this study the bfi calculated from the cmb method was used as the initial value of bfimax in the rdf method then the recession constant Î± and bfimax were adjusted to minimize the residuals of total baseflow between the rdf and cmb the baseflow separated by paired Î± and bfimax with minimum residuals compared to that by the cmb method were determined as the final parameters for the rdf method li et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 the calibrated rdf method was finally employed to separate the long term baseflow 1954 2013 for the study watershed 3 3 cross correlations analysis cross correlation analysis is an effective method to test whether there are significant relationships among time series variables its advantage is that it can remove autocorrelations existing in data series and identify lagged causality between two data series zhang and wei 2014 in this study cross correlation was used to detect the relationships and lagged effects between ceca and annual streamflow baseflow and surface runoff all of the tested hydrological variables and ceca data were pre whitened to remove autocorrelation by fitting arima autoregressive integrated moving average models model residuals from the arima model with the best performance achievement of model stationary and coefficient of determination were selected for cross correlation analysis liu et al 2015a 3 4 quantification of the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to streamflow components forest disturbance and climate variability are commonly considered two major drivers for hydrological variations in large forested watersheds modified double mass curves mdmc have been used to quantify the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to annual streamflow liu et al 2015a yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 to quantify the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to annual total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff respectively we applied the same approach as for annual streamflow the basic assumption of mdmc is that a linear relationship is assumed between cumulative effective annual precipitation pae and cumulative annual total streamflow qa baseflow bfa and surface runoff sra liu et al 2015a wei and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2012 2017c zheng et al 2009 the effective annual precipitation pe is defined as the difference between annual precipitation and actual evapotranspiration each mdmc was plotted as qa bfa and sra respectively against pae in this way the effects of climate variability on each streamflow component can be eliminated wei and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2017c for a period with no or little forest disturbance a straight line between each cumulative annual streamflow component and pae is expected which is considered the reference break points between periods with different slopes can be identified on mdmc if there are significant influences from non climatic variables such as forest disturbance in our study the pettitt break point test was used to test the statistical significance of break points pettitt 1979 before implementation of the pettitt test any autocorrelation existing in the slope of mdmc must be removed following the method by yue et al 2002 the nonparametric mann whitney u test z statistic was further adopted to compare the statistical difference of the mdmc slopes before and after each break point liu et al 2015a once the statistical difference of each break point was confirmed the whole study period was subsequently divided into reference before the break point and disturbance after the break point periods the baseline relationship in the reference period was therefore employed to predict each cumulative annual streamflow component for the respective disturbance period the difference between each observed and predicted annual streamflow component was treated as the deviations caused by forest disturbance Î´qf thus the deviations caused by climate variability on each annual streamflow component can be determined as 3 Î´ q c Î´ q Î´ q f where Î´q Î´qf and Î´qc are the deviations of each annual streamflow component between disturbance and reference periods annual flow deviations caused by forest disturbance and annual flow deviations caused by climate variability respectively thus the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to streamflow components can be calculated as 4 r f Î´ q f Î´ q f Î´ q c 100 5 r c Î´ q c Î´ q f Î´ q c 100 where rf and rc are the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climatic variability to annual streamflow components respectively wei and zhang 2010 in this study monthly potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated through the priestley taylor method eq 6 and hamon method eqs 7 and 8 the average monthly pet values from two methods were then used to calculate actual evapotranspiration et by eqs 9 and 10 the final monthly et estimates were averaged values from eqs 9 and 10 finally the monthly

initial value of bfimax for the rdf method paired Î± and bfimax in the rdf method were finally determined as 0 90 and 0 27 respectively the mean annual baseflow was 113 3 35 6 mm and the mean annual bfi was 0 27 0 004 in 1954 2013 the baseflow in the usr watershed showed temporal variations with the lowest bfi of 0 21 during the snow melting seasons while the highest bfi of 0 37 was in july and august fig 5 4 2 trends of hydrometeorological variables for annual hydrometeorological variables over the study period significant increasing trends p 01 were detected in annual tmax tmin and tmean and pet in 1954 2013 table 2 no significant trends p 05 were found in annual p et streamflow and baseflow significant upward trends p 05 were detected in seasonal tmin and tmean only a significant upward trend was identified in spring et p 01 while no significant trends p 05 were found in the other seasons significant downward trends p 05 were found in summer streamflow and baseflow while no significant trends p 05 were detected in the other seasonal flow variables results of the trend analyses indicated that climate variability which was characterized by the increase in temperature and pet may play a negative role in the changes of all streamflow components 4 3 cross correlations between ceca and streamflow components cross correlations analysis between the ceca and each streamflow component in table 3 showed that forest disturbance and all streamflow components were significantly related p 05 suggesting that forest disturbance has significantly affected all streamflow components in addition positive coefficients of cross correlation indicated that forest disturbance significantly increased annual total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff in the study watershed in 1954 2013 it should be noted that the ceca was only calculated in canada although the upper portion of the watershed is mainly located in the conservation parks of canada and the usa recent mpb infestation might have increased forest disturbance in these areas which was not included in our analysis thus our results on the relationship between the ceca and the streamflow components are conservative 4 4 quantification of the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to streamflow components as shown in fig 6 one break point was detected for total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff which occurred in 1984 1985 and 1984 respectively additionally mann whitney u tests confirmed that the slopes of mdmcs before and after the break points were statistically different p 001 table 4 the break points coincided with the history of forest disturbance as the ceca increased from 7 8 in 1983 to 12 9 in 1985 fig 4 forest disturbance increased annual streamflow baseflow and surface runoff of 27 7 13 7 mm 7 4 3 6 mm and 18 4 12 9 mm respectively with its relative contributions to the changes in respective streamflow components being 27 0 23 0 29 2 23 1 and 25 7 23 4 respectively while climate variability reduced total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff by 74 9 13 7 mm 17 9 3 6 mm and 53 3 12 9 mm respectively with its relative contributions to the changes in respective streamflow components being 73 0 23 0 70 8 23 1 and 73 1 23 4 respectively tables 5 7 respectively overall the effects of climate variability on all streamflow components were much higher than those from forest disturbance indicating the flow variations in the usr watershed were mainly caused by climate variability the disturbance period was further divided into two sub periods including 1985 1998 and 1998 2013 based on the distinct change in the rate of forest disturbance fig 4 the relative contribution of forest disturbance to all flow components showed temporal variations for example the relative contributions of forest disturbance to all streamflow components were higher in 1986 1994 than those in 1995 2013 in summary our results demonstrated that climate variability played a more important role in the variations of all streamflow components in comparison to forest disturbance but in the opposite direction 5 discussion 5 1 baseflow separation our baseflow separation results showed that the average annual baseflow and bfi were 113 3 35 6 mm year 1 or 11 3 of average annual precipitation and 0 27 0 004 in 1954 2013 respectively our estimations of baseflow were comparable with groundwater recharge rates estimated by other studies in the region for example average annual recharge rates were 88 mm or 19 7 of precipitation in vernon northern okanagan british columbia liggett and allen 2010 and 77 8 50 8 mm or 15 7 of precipitation in the deep creek watershed in north okanagan assefa and woodbury 2013 several studies at the small watershed scale indicated that forest disturbance increased the conductivity in streams pike et al 2010 this may lead to a concern over the assumption of the conductivity being temporally constant for applying the cmb method in our study watershed the long term discrete conductivity about twice per month has been measured since 1967 supplementary materials fig s1 our analysis using kendall tau and spearman rho s tests on the cro cbf and cq the details of the calculations are provided in the supplementary materials section 3 and table s3 showed that no significant temporal trends were detected in those variables indicating that cumulative forest disturbance did not cause a significant change in conductivity in the usr watershed table s3 therefore we believe that the effects of forest disturbance did not affect the applications of the cmb method in the usr watershed in addition li et al 2014 suggested that a minimum data requirement for the baseflow separation method is 6 months over a dry period in this study continuous conductivity data were collected for one year to minimize the possible uncertainties in the baseflow separation method furthermore the rdf method has been proven to be an accurate baseflow separation method with a good estimation of bfimax from a tracer method zhang et al 2017a in summary the selected baseflow separation method rdf is sound for this study and its application provides reliable estimates of baseflow or groundwater recharge in the study watershed 5 2 the cumulative effects of forest disturbance on streamflow components over the disturbance periods the average increments of annual total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff attributed to forest disturbance were 27 7 13 7 mm 7 4 3 6 mm and 18 4 12 9 mm respectively cumulative forest disturbance in the usr watershed has caused significant changes in all streamflow components likely due to increasing soil water storage as a result of less evapotranspiration caused by forest disturbance the usr watershed has a snow melt dominated hydrological regime after forest disturbance more snow accumulation and earlier and quicker melting are expected winkler et al 2005 which consequently results in an increase in surface runoff and total streamflow meanwhile forest disturbance also increases soil moisture and groundwater recharge leading to more baseflow the impacts of forest disturbance on annual total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff have been investigated separately in previous studies these studies consistently found that annual total streamflow was increased by forest disturbance in both small and large watersheds li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a in contrast the results of baseflow and surface runoff were inconsistent across different spatial scales in small watersheds a decrease in forest cover can increase baseflow or groundwater recharge table 1 le maitre et al 1999 smerdon et al 2009 while in large watersheds ahiablame et al 2017 found that every 1 increase in the agricultural land can lead to 0 2 decrease in baseflow using the swat model ma et al 2009 showed that reforestation decreased surface runoff and total streamflow but increased baseflow zhou et al 2013 also found that surface runoff was increased of 11 3 while baseflow was decreased by 11 2 due to forest deduction and increase in urban area in xitiaoxi basin 1371 km2 china those inconsistent responses may be attributed to different forest structures altered soil conditions and climatic regimes bruijnzeel 2004 liu et al 2015b liu et al 2016 highlighting that the effects of forest change on streamflow components are likely watershed specific it further demonstrates that focusing on one or two streamflow components might not provide a holistic picture of hydrological responses to forest or land cover changes understanding the impacts of forest disturbance on baseflow has profound implications for managing groundwater resources dynamics of baseflow or groundwater recharge are critical for explaining the variations of groundwater storage and water quality in a watershed for example zhang and schilling 2006 found that elevated nitrate levels in streams were mainly from baseflow zhou et al 2013 demonstrated that the expansion of urban area led to 11 3 increase in surface runoff and 11 2 decrease in baseflow such a pattern shift has important influences on droughts and consequently groundwater management this also suggests that a full understanding of how various streamflow components respond to forest disturbance or land cover change can help in understanding and managing groundwater resources 5 3 relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to streamflow components numerous studies have revealed that forest disturbance and climate variability played a similar role in total streamflow changes li et al 2017 however the relative contributions of forest disturbance to total streamflow was only 27 0 with the ceca being 21 4 in the usr watershed which was lower than those from other studies in the interior of british columbia for example zhang et al 2017c investigated the relative contributions of the forest disturbance to annual streamflow were 42 7 in the willow river watershed ceca of 23 8 40 4 in the bake river watershed ceca of 35 0 43 3 in the moffat river watershed ceca of 40 0 and 50 4 in the tulameen river watershed ceca of 16 6 this may be due to differences in climate regimes and levels of forest disturbance the typical bc interior watersheds normally have a continental climate however the usr watershed has a mixed type of climate including a moist climate in the upper portion mainly located in the conservation parks and a relatively dry continental climate in the lower reaches of the watershed this mixed type of climate may promote a larger influence of climate variability on total streamflow nevertheless the effects of forest disturbance on total streamflow in the usr watershed should be considered when managing water resources and water related functions variations in the relative contributions of land cover change and climate variability to the streamflow components have been reported in the literature table 1 for example all streamflow components were more sensitive to climate variability than to land cover change in the heihe river basin 12 800 km2 in northwest china zhang et al 2016 and in xixian basin china 10 191 km2 shi et al 2013 similarly the application of the variable infiltration capacity model in the qingyi river watershed 13 263 km2 showed that total streamflow and baseflow changes were mainly attributed to climate variability rather than land cover changes liu et al 2013 conversely land cover played a more dominant role in the changes of all major streamflow components in the kejie watershed ma et al 2009 and upper du watershed 8961 km2 huang et al 2016 in china those contrasting results suggested large variations in hydrological responses were mainly due to the different magnitudes of disturbance and climate variability across watersheds forest disturbance and climate variability can have offsetting or additive effects on annual streamflow wei and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2008 2012 li et al 2017 wei et al 2017 our study indicated that the effects of forest disturbance and climate variability offset each other on all streamflow components similarly the offsetting effects of forest disturbance and climate variability on all streamflow components have been detected in the be river catchment using swat khoi and suetsugi 2014 in contrast liu et al 2013 detected that land cover changes enhanced the impacts of climate variability on all streamflow components in the qingyi river watershed china normally offsetting effects can lead to less variations in water resource while additive effects can cause river flows to either increase e g higher chances of floods or decrease e g higher chances of droughts li et al 2017 forest disturbance may increase annual streamflow baseflow and surface runoff which can help to alleviate water stress in areas with water scarcity however the negative effects of forest disturbance on aquatic ecosystems such as increasing turbidity may overshadow any potential positive effects thus forest disturbance climate and their interactions must be carefully managed in order to sustain water supply for human use as well as for aquatic functioning 5 4 recommendations and uncertainties in this study our mdmc framework was successfully applied to quantify the long term cumulative effects of forest disturbance on all major streamflow components which can be extended to other watershed studies this study is the first application of this framework on annual baseflow and surface runoff to successfully implement this methodology on all streamflow components it is necessary to generate the relatively accurate baseflow data series the objective tracer based method was used for baseflow separation which reduced the uncertainties in baseflow separation methods to extend this method to other watersheds long term data on climate streamflow and forest change must be available in addition any selected watersheds must experience significant forest change e g disturbance or reforestation so that possible hydrological shifts can be detected there are several uncertainties in this study first the pet values were derived from the priestley taylor method and hamon method based on the recommendation of lu et al 2005 in this study we used the averaged pet values from two methods which minimized some uncertainties introduced by adopting one method alone however various studies have demonstrated that the changes in surface humidity willett et al 2008 vapor pressure wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 and net radiation wild 2009 have impacts on evaporative demand and thus pet yet these factors were not considered in the pet calculations in this study second the changes in seasonal climate patterns and their effects on streamflow were not considered berghuijs et al 2014 shen et al 2017 for instance berghuijs et al 2014 revealed that precipitation shift from snow to rain leads to a decrease in streamflow third possible feedbacks between forest change and climate ellison et al 2012 khanna et al 2017 were not fully accounted for 6 conclusion quantifying the long term and cumulative effects of forest disturbance and climate variability on streamflow components has rarely been reported in the literature in this study we concluded that forest disturbance significantly increased all streamflow components while climatic variability decreased them in the upper similkameen river watershed the relative contributions of climate variability to annual total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff were 75 6 25 0 72 4 24 6 and 76 3 76 3 respectively while the rest of the changes in all streamflow components were attributed to forest disturbance climate variability played a more important role than forest disturbance in all streamflow components but in the opposite direction these findings help water or watershed managers

7502,assessing how forest disturbance and climate variability affect streamflow components is critical for watershed management ecosystem protection and engineering design previous studies have mainly evaluated the effects of forest disturbance on total streamflow rarely with attention given to its components e g base flow and surface runoff particularly in large watersheds 1000 km2 in this study the upper similkameen river watershed 1810 km2 an international watershed situated between canada and the usa was selected to examine how forest disturbance and climate variability interactively affect total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff baseflow was separated using a combination of the recursive digital filter method and conductivity mass balance method time series analysis and modified double mass curves were then employed to quantitatively separate the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to each streamflow component our results showed that average annual baseflow and baseflow index baseflow streamflow were 113 3 35 6 mm year 1 and 0 27 for 1954 2013 respectively forest disturbance increased annual streamflow baseflow and surface runoff of 27 7 13 7 mm 7 4 3 6 mm and 18 4 12 9 mm respectively with its relative contributions to the changes in respective streamflow components being 27 0 23 0 29 2 23 1 and 25 7 23 4 respectively in contrast climate variability decreased them by 74 9 13 7 mm 17 9 3 6 mm and 53 3 12 9 mm respectively with its relative contributions to the changes in respective streamflow components being 73 0 23 0 70 8 23 1 and 73 1 23 4 respectively despite working in opposite ways the impacts of climate variability on annual streamflow baseflow and surface runoff were of a much greater magnitude than forest disturbance impacts this study has important implications for the protection of aquatic habitat engineering design and watershed planning in the context of future forest disturbance and climate change keywords forest disturbance climate variability baseflow separation relative contributions streamflow components cumulative effects 1 introduction the impacts of changes in forest cover on water yield have long been investigated across the globe andrÃ©assian 2004 brown et al 2005 farley et al 2005 stednick 1996 wei et al 2013 wei et al 2017 recent reviews on the relationship between forest change and water yield across multiple spatial scales have concluded that deforestation increases water yield while reforestation decreases it li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a the implications of these reviews are pivotal for water supply ecosystem protection and engineering design however previous studies have mainly focused on how forest change affects total streamflow with limited attention given to major streamflow components i e baseflow and surface runoff considering all streamflow components can lead to a more complete understanding of hydrological responses to forest change in a watershed limited studies have examined the impacts of change in forest cover or land use on baseflow and surface runoff a global summary on this subject with watershed sizes ranging from plot level 1 ha to large watershed scale 1000 km2 is provided in table 1 in small watersheds 100 km2 the impacts of change in forest cover on baseflow or groundwater recharge are mainly inferred from the change in groundwater table with relatively consistent conclusions for example a rising of the groundwater table was observed after forest logging indicating forest disturbance increased groundwater recharge or baseflow table 1 smerdon et al 2009 while streamflow dried up completely in the ninth year after eucalyptus plantation in south africa scott and lesch 1997 demonstrating that an increase in forest cover decreased baseflow for large watersheds 1000 km2 hydrological models were often adopted to study the effects of forest change on streamflow components and the conclusions from those model based studies were inconsistent khoi and suetsugi 2014 ma et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 for instance vegetation expansion has dramatically reduced total streamflow and surface runoff but baseflow was increased using the soil and water assessment tool swat in the kejie watershed 1755 km2 southwestern china ma et al 2009 conversely khoi and suetsugi 2014 concluded that a reduction in forest cover augmented total streamflow and surface runoff while decreased baseflow in the be river catchment 7500 km2 vietnam these contrasting results highlight large variations in hydrological responses of streamflow components especially baseflow alteration due to forest or land cover change the limited studies along with inconsistent results in large watersheds demonstrate that more case studies are needed in large forested watersheds forest change and climate variability are two major drivers influencing hydrological variation to investigate the impacts of forest change on hydrology the effects of climate variability on flow must be either removed or taken into consideration the interest in considering both drivers and their relative contributions to streamflow has been growing significantly e g li et al 2017 wei et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 wei et al 2017 however a direct and quantitative assessment of how annual streamflow responds to both forest change and climate variability is challenging particularly in large watersheds as it requires explicit consideration of climate variability when assessing the hydrological effects of forest change wei and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2012 it is even more challenging to study the relative contributions of climate variability and forest change to all streamflow components advanced statistical analyses have been used to explore the effects of land cover or forest change on total streamflow for example statistical techniques such as the sensitivity based method double mass curves simple water balance and the time trend method have been developed and widely used wei et al 2013 among them wei and zhang 2010 devised modified double mass curves mdmc and time series analysis to separate the relative contributions of forest change and climate variability to annual streamflow as the mdmc method is based on water balance it has the potential to separate the relative effects of forest change and climate variability on baseflow and surface runoff another challenge in this research subject is the accurate separation of baseflow from total streamflow numerous methods have been developed to separate total streamflow into baseflow and surface runoff zhang et al 2013 among them the conductivity mass balance cmb method has received growing attention because 1 it is developed based on the close correlation between discharge and water specific conductance referred to as conductivity hereafter in theory baseflow percolates through soil and rock and therefore picks up more ions on its route than surface runoff which leads to higher ion concentrations than surface runoff matsubayashi et al 1993 stewart et al 2007 and 2 conductivity data are easy to obtain with moderate cost however cmb applications are often constrained by long term daily conductivity data to address this shortcoming zhang et al 2013 developed a combined baseflow separation method which used the cmb method to calibrate the recursive digital filter method in this way long term baseflow can be accurately separated in this combined method li et al 2014 found that a minimum of 6 months continuous conductivity data in low flow seasons e g summer should be collected to assure its reliability based on our literature review the hypothesis of this study was that for a large forested watershed located in a snow dominated hydrological regime forest disturbance has significant effects on streamflow and its components our specific key objectives of this study were 1 to explore the effects of forest disturbance on total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff in the upper similkameen river watershed 2 to quantify the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff and 3 to discuss possible implications of our results for management of water resource and protection of aquatic functions 2 study site and data 2 1 study site the upper similkameen river usr watershed has a drainage area of 1810 km2 of which 540 km2 is located in washington usa the headwaters of the watershed are on the usa side of the border draining north into canada fig 1 elevation ranges from 635 to 2546 m above sea level in 1954 2013 the average annual precipitation was 1000 mm the highest and lowest monthly mean temperatures were 19 6 c in july and 9 7 c in january the watershed covers several biogeoclimatic zones including the interior douglas fir zone on the valley floors and the montane spruce and the engelmann spruce subalpine fir at higher elevations pojar et al 1987 2 2 watershed data 2 2 1 climate data monthly mean tmean maximum tmax and minimum tmin temperatures and precipitation of the study watershed were generated from the climate west north american wna dataset for 1954 2013 wang et al 2016 climatewna is a standalone program that extracts and downscales historical climate data from climate research unit at the university of east anglia mitchell and jones 2005 from 1901 to 2014 wang et al 2016 it calculates monthly and annual climate variables for any given location based on latitude longitude and elevation given the large spatial variations in climate across the watershed monthly climate data were generated at a resolution of 500 500 m across the study watershed fig 2 2 2 2 forest disturbance data two provincial level databases were obtained from the british columbia ministry of forests lands and natural resources operations the cutblocks 2010 and the vegetation resources inventory vri 2010 the cutblocks database is a spatial record of forest harvest size location and timing the vri database provides detailed tree characteristics and additional non logging disturbance type i e fire and insect infestation therefore these two databases are complementary and were both used to quantify the forest disturbance history in the study watershed it should be noted that forest disturbance data are not available in the part of the watershed located in the usa the quantification of forest disturbance was only made in the canadian portion of the watershed 2 2 3 hydrology and conductivity data daily stream discharge data were collected from the hydrometric station station id 08nl007 similkameen river at princeton that is operated and maintained by environment canada the annual average discharge was 423 mm in 1954 2013 agricultural irrigation was the largest water consumer in the watershed and accounted for less than 2 of the annual mean flow summit 2011 the highest discharge occurred in the snow melting season march to may accounting for 68 of the annual discharge the in situ conductivity probe ctd diver di 271 schlumberger water service canada was installed near the hydrometric station to measure continuous conductivity at a frequency of 30 min from may 19 2015 to june 21 2016 the conductivity measurements for each day were averaged to derive daily conductivity fig 3 3 methods 3 1 quantification of forest disturbance levels logging mountain pine beetle mpb infestation and wildfire are the three major forest disturbance types in the study watershed fig 4 according to the vri database a forest stand in the study watershed was either disturbed by only one type e g logging or wildfire or mpb or two types of disturbances where a forest stand that was first disturbed by one type and was followed by another e g a forest stand that is disturbed by wildfire first and then by salvage logging different kinds of forest disturbance cumulate over space and time in any forested watersheds equivalent clear cut area eca is used to quantify forest disturbance levels and is defined as the area that has been clear cut fire killed or infested by mpb with a reduction factor eca coefficient to account for hydrological recovery due to forest regeneration an eca coefficient of 100 means that there is no hydrological recovery in a disturbed area while an eca coefficient of zero indicates a full hydrological recovery the cumulative equivalent clear cut area ceca is the sum of annual eca values in the watershed the hydrological recovery of a forest stand is related to its growth rate over time and is therefore determined by many factors including disturbance type climate and tree species a detailed description of the eca estimation procedure can be found in wei and zhang 2010 logging or post disturbance salvage logging was the dominant disturbance type in the usr watershed over the study period the upper reaches of the watershed are in the e c manning provincial park canada where logging is prohibited fig 1 the average annual area logged was 0 38 of the watershed area the ceca from logging was 17 5 of the watershed area in 1954 2011 forest fire occasionally occurred with the largest forest fire occurring in 1984 on average 1 of the watershed area was burnt annually mpb was not a significant disturbance type until 2003 about 1 4 and 2 3 of the watershed area were affected by mpb in 2004 and 2007 respectively in 2011 the ceca from mpb reached 15 7 of the watershed area in summary the total ceca from all disturbance types was 37 1 of the total watershed area in 2011 fig 4 3 2 baseflow separation methods 3 2 1 conductivity mass balance cmb method the conductivity mass balance cmb method stewart et al 2007 is expressed as 1 bf q c q c ro c bf c ro where bf is baseflow m3 s 1 q is daily streamflow discharge m3 s 1 cq is the conductivity of streamflow Âµs cm 1 cbf is the conductivity of baseflow Âµs cm 1 and cro is the conductivity of surface runoff Âµs cm 1 cro is assumed to correspond to the highest daily streamflow while cbf corresponds to the lowest daily streamflow assumptions of applying the cmb method are 1 contributions from other streamflow components are negligible 2 cbf and cro are constant over the specific period and 3 cbf and cro values are different from each other as baseflow percolates through soil and rocks and carries more ions on its route and thus has higher conductivity than surface runoff li et al 2014 miller et al 2014 stewart et al 2007 3 2 2 recursive digital filter rdf method the recursive digital filter rdf method eq 2 proposed by eckhardt 2005 was used for the long term baseflow separation in this study 2 bf t 1 bfi max Î± bf t 1 1 Î± bfi max q t 1 Î± bfi max subject to bft qt where bf is baseflow m3 s 1 q is daily streamflow discharge m3 s 1 Î± is recession constant dimensionless and bfimax is the maximum value of the baseflow index the ratio of baseflow to total streamflow in the rdf method Î± can be determined from the hydrograph however bfimax cannot be directly measured li et al 2014 the accuracy of the baseflow results from the rdf method is more sensitive to the bfimax than to the recession constant the bfimax should normally be estimated from a tracer method zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017a in this study the bfi calculated from the cmb method was used as the initial value of bfimax in the rdf method then the recession constant Î± and bfimax were adjusted to minimize the residuals of total baseflow between the rdf and cmb the baseflow separated by paired Î± and bfimax with minimum residuals compared to that by the cmb method were determined as the final parameters for the rdf method li et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 the calibrated rdf method was finally employed to separate the long term baseflow 1954 2013 for the study watershed 3 3 cross correlations analysis cross correlation analysis is an effective method to test whether there are significant relationships among time series variables its advantage is that it can remove autocorrelations existing in data series and identify lagged causality between two data series zhang and wei 2014 in this study cross correlation was used to detect the relationships and lagged effects between ceca and annual streamflow baseflow and surface runoff all of the tested hydrological variables and ceca data were pre whitened to remove autocorrelation by fitting arima autoregressive integrated moving average models model residuals from the arima model with the best performance achievement of model stationary and coefficient of determination were selected for cross correlation analysis liu et al 2015a 3 4 quantification of the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to streamflow components forest disturbance and climate variability are commonly considered two major drivers for hydrological variations in large forested watersheds modified double mass curves mdmc have been used to quantify the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to annual streamflow liu et al 2015a yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 to quantify the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to annual total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff respectively we applied the same approach as for annual streamflow the basic assumption of mdmc is that a linear relationship is assumed between cumulative effective annual precipitation pae and cumulative annual total streamflow qa baseflow bfa and surface runoff sra liu et al 2015a wei and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2012 2017c zheng et al 2009 the effective annual precipitation pe is defined as the difference between annual precipitation and actual evapotranspiration each mdmc was plotted as qa bfa and sra respectively against pae in this way the effects of climate variability on each streamflow component can be eliminated wei and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2017c for a period with no or little forest disturbance a straight line between each cumulative annual streamflow component and pae is expected which is considered the reference break points between periods with different slopes can be identified on mdmc if there are significant influences from non climatic variables such as forest disturbance in our study the pettitt break point test was used to test the statistical significance of break points pettitt 1979 before implementation of the pettitt test any autocorrelation existing in the slope of mdmc must be removed following the method by yue et al 2002 the nonparametric mann whitney u test z statistic was further adopted to compare the statistical difference of the mdmc slopes before and after each break point liu et al 2015a once the statistical difference of each break point was confirmed the whole study period was subsequently divided into reference before the break point and disturbance after the break point periods the baseline relationship in the reference period was therefore employed to predict each cumulative annual streamflow component for the respective disturbance period the difference between each observed and predicted annual streamflow component was treated as the deviations caused by forest disturbance Î´qf thus the deviations caused by climate variability on each annual streamflow component can be determined as 3 Î´ q c Î´ q Î´ q f where Î´q Î´qf and Î´qc are the deviations of each annual streamflow component between disturbance and reference periods annual flow deviations caused by forest disturbance and annual flow deviations caused by climate variability respectively thus the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to streamflow components can be calculated as 4 r f Î´ q f Î´ q f Î´ q c 100 5 r c Î´ q c Î´ q f Î´ q c 100 where rf and rc are the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climatic variability to annual streamflow components respectively wei and zhang 2010 in this study monthly potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated through the priestley taylor method eq 6 and hamon method eqs 7 and 8 the average

initial value of bfimax for the rdf method paired Î± and bfimax in the rdf method were finally determined as 0 90 and 0 27 respectively the mean annual baseflow was 113 3 35 6 mm and the mean annual bfi was 0 27 0 004 in 1954 2013 the baseflow in the usr watershed showed temporal variations with the lowest bfi of 0 21 during the snow melting seasons while the highest bfi of 0 37 was in july and august fig 5 4 2 trends of hydrometeorological variables for annual hydrometeorological variables over the study period significant increasing trends p 01 were detected in annual tmax tmin and tmean and pet in 1954 2013 table 2 no significant trends p 05 were found in annual p et streamflow and baseflow significant upward trends p 05 were detected in seasonal tmin and tmean only a significant upward trend was identified in spring et p 01 while no significant trends p 05 were found in the other seasons significant downward trends p 05 were found in summer streamflow and baseflow while no significant trends p 05 were detected in the other seasonal flow variables results of the trend analyses indicated that climate variability which was characterized by the increase in temperature and pet may play a negative role in the changes of all streamflow components 4 3 cross correlations between ceca and streamflow components cross correlations analysis between the ceca and each streamflow component in table 3 showed that forest disturbance and all streamflow components were significantly related p 05 suggesting that forest disturbance has significantly affected all streamflow components in addition positive coefficients of cross correlation indicated that forest disturbance significantly increased annual total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff in the study watershed in 1954 2013 it should be noted that the ceca was only calculated in canada although the upper portion of the watershed is mainly located in the conservation parks of canada and the usa recent mpb infestation might have increased forest disturbance in these areas which was not included in our analysis thus our results on the relationship between the ceca and the streamflow components are conservative 4 4 quantification of the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to streamflow components as shown in fig 6 one break point was detected for total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff which occurred in 1984 1985 and 1984 respectively additionally mann whitney u tests confirmed that the slopes of mdmcs before and after the break points were statistically different p 001 table 4 the break points coincided with the history of forest disturbance as the ceca increased from 7 8 in 1983 to 12 9 in 1985 fig 4 forest disturbance increased annual streamflow baseflow and surface runoff of 27 7 13 7 mm 7 4 3 6 mm and 18 4 12 9 mm respectively with its relative contributions to the changes in respective streamflow components being 27 0 23 0 29 2 23 1 and 25 7 23 4 respectively while climate variability reduced total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff by 74 9 13 7 mm 17 9 3 6 mm and 53 3 12 9 mm respectively with its relative contributions to the changes in respective streamflow components being 73 0 23 0 70 8 23 1 and 73 1 23 4 respectively tables 5 7 respectively overall the effects of climate variability on all streamflow components were much higher than those from forest disturbance indicating the flow variations in the usr watershed were mainly caused by climate variability the disturbance period was further divided into two sub periods including 1985 1998 and 1998 2013 based on the distinct change in the rate of forest disturbance fig 4 the relative contribution of forest disturbance to all flow components showed temporal variations for example the relative contributions of forest disturbance to all streamflow components were higher in 1986 1994 than those in 1995 2013 in summary our results demonstrated that climate variability played a more important role in the variations of all streamflow components in comparison to forest disturbance but in the opposite direction 5 discussion 5 1 baseflow separation our baseflow separation results showed that the average annual baseflow and bfi were 113 3 35 6 mm year 1 or 11 3 of average annual precipitation and 0 27 0 004 in 1954 2013 respectively our estimations of baseflow were comparable with groundwater recharge rates estimated by other studies in the region for example average annual recharge rates were 88 mm or 19 7 of precipitation in vernon northern okanagan british columbia liggett and allen 2010 and 77 8 50 8 mm or 15 7 of precipitation in the deep creek watershed in north okanagan assefa and woodbury 2013 several studies at the small watershed scale indicated that forest disturbance increased the conductivity in streams pike et al 2010 this may lead to a concern over the assumption of the conductivity being temporally constant for applying the cmb method in our study watershed the long term discrete conductivity about twice per month has been measured since 1967 supplementary materials fig s1 our analysis using kendall tau and spearman rho s tests on the cro cbf and cq the details of the calculations are provided in the supplementary materials section 3 and table s3 showed that no significant temporal trends were detected in those variables indicating that cumulative forest disturbance did not cause a significant change in conductivity in the usr watershed table s3 therefore we believe that the effects of forest disturbance did not affect the applications of the cmb method in the usr watershed in addition li et al 2014 suggested that a minimum data requirement for the baseflow separation method is 6 months over a dry period in this study continuous conductivity data were collected for one year to minimize the possible uncertainties in the baseflow separation method furthermore the rdf method has been proven to be an accurate baseflow separation method with a good estimation of bfimax from a tracer method zhang et al 2017a in summary the selected baseflow separation method rdf is sound for this study and its application provides reliable estimates of baseflow or groundwater recharge in the study watershed 5 2 the cumulative effects of forest disturbance on streamflow components over the disturbance periods the average increments of annual total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff attributed to forest disturbance were 27 7 13 7 mm 7 4 3 6 mm and 18 4 12 9 mm respectively cumulative forest disturbance in the usr watershed has caused significant changes in all streamflow components likely due to increasing soil water storage as a result of less evapotranspiration caused by forest disturbance the usr watershed has a snow melt dominated hydrological regime after forest disturbance more snow accumulation and earlier and quicker melting are expected winkler et al 2005 which consequently results in an increase in surface runoff and total streamflow meanwhile forest disturbance also increases soil moisture and groundwater recharge leading to more baseflow the impacts of forest disturbance on annual total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff have been investigated separately in previous studies these studies consistently found that annual total streamflow was increased by forest disturbance in both small and large watersheds li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a in contrast the results of baseflow and surface runoff were inconsistent across different spatial scales in small watersheds a decrease in forest cover can increase baseflow or groundwater recharge table 1 le maitre et al 1999 smerdon et al 2009 while in large watersheds ahiablame et al 2017 found that every 1 increase in the agricultural land can lead to 0 2 decrease in baseflow using the swat model ma et al 2009 showed that reforestation decreased surface runoff and total streamflow but increased baseflow zhou et al 2013 also found that surface runoff was increased of 11 3 while baseflow was decreased by 11 2 due to forest deduction and increase in urban area in xitiaoxi basin 1371 km2 china those inconsistent responses may be attributed to different forest structures altered soil conditions and climatic regimes bruijnzeel 2004 liu et al 2015b liu et al 2016 highlighting that the effects of forest change on streamflow components are likely watershed specific it further demonstrates that focusing on one or two streamflow components might not provide a holistic picture of hydrological responses to forest or land cover changes understanding the impacts of forest disturbance on baseflow has profound implications for managing groundwater resources dynamics of baseflow or groundwater recharge are critical for explaining the variations of groundwater storage and water quality in a watershed for example zhang and schilling 2006 found that elevated nitrate levels in streams were mainly from baseflow zhou et al 2013 demonstrated that the expansion of urban area led to 11 3 increase in surface runoff and 11 2 decrease in baseflow such a pattern shift has important influences on droughts and consequently groundwater management this also suggests that a full understanding of how various streamflow components respond to forest disturbance or land cover change can help in understanding and managing groundwater resources 5 3 relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to streamflow components numerous studies have revealed that forest disturbance and climate variability played a similar role in total streamflow changes li et al 2017 however the relative contributions of forest disturbance to total streamflow was only 27 0 with the ceca being 21 4 in the usr watershed which was lower than those from other studies in the interior of british columbia for example zhang et al 2017c investigated the relative contributions of the forest disturbance to annual streamflow were 42 7 in the willow river watershed ceca of 23 8 40 4 in the bake river watershed ceca of 35 0 43 3 in the moffat river watershed ceca of 40 0 and 50 4 in the tulameen river watershed ceca of 16 6 this may be due to differences in climate regimes and levels of forest disturbance the typical bc interior watersheds normally have a continental climate however the usr watershed has a mixed type of climate including a moist climate in the upper portion mainly located in the conservation parks and a relatively dry continental climate in the lower reaches of the watershed this mixed type of climate may promote a larger influence of climate variability on total streamflow nevertheless the effects of forest disturbance on total streamflow in the usr watershed should be considered when managing water resources and water related functions variations in the relative contributions of land cover change and climate variability to the streamflow components have been reported in the literature table 1 for example all streamflow components were more sensitive to climate variability than to land cover change in the heihe river basin 12 800 km2 in northwest china zhang et al 2016 and in xixian basin china 10 191 km2 shi et al 2013 similarly the application of the variable infiltration capacity model in the qingyi river watershed 13 263 km2 showed that total streamflow and baseflow changes were mainly attributed to climate variability rather than land cover changes liu et al 2013 conversely land cover played a more dominant role in the changes of all major streamflow components in the kejie watershed ma et al 2009 and upper du watershed 8961 km2 huang et al 2016 in china those contrasting results suggested large variations in hydrological responses were mainly due to the different magnitudes of disturbance and climate variability across watersheds forest disturbance and climate variability can have offsetting or additive effects on annual streamflow wei and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2008 2012 li et al 2017 wei et al 2017 our study indicated that the effects of forest disturbance and climate variability offset each other on all streamflow components similarly the offsetting effects of forest disturbance and climate variability on all streamflow components have been detected in the be river catchment using swat khoi and suetsugi 2014 in contrast liu et al 2013 detected that land cover changes enhanced the impacts of climate variability on all streamflow components in the qingyi river watershed china normally offsetting effects can lead to less variations in water resource while additive effects can cause river flows to either increase e g higher chances of floods or decrease e g higher chances of droughts li et al 2017 forest disturbance may increase annual streamflow baseflow and surface runoff which can help to alleviate water stress in areas with water scarcity however the negative effects of forest disturbance on aquatic ecosystems such as increasing turbidity may overshadow any potential positive effects thus forest disturbance climate and their interactions must be carefully managed in order to sustain water supply for human use as well as for aquatic functioning 5 4 recommendations and uncertainties in this study our mdmc framework was successfully applied to quantify the long term cumulative effects of forest disturbance on all major streamflow components which can be extended to other watershed studies this study is the first application of this framework on annual baseflow and surface runoff to successfully implement this methodology on all streamflow components it is necessary to generate the relatively accurate baseflow data series the objective tracer based method was used for baseflow separation which reduced the uncertainties in baseflow separation methods to extend this method to other watersheds long term data on climate streamflow and forest change must be available in addition any selected watersheds must experience significant forest change e g disturbance or reforestation so that possible hydrological shifts can be detected there are several uncertainties in this study first the pet values were derived from the priestley taylor method and hamon method based on the recommendation of lu et al 2005 in this study we used the averaged pet values from two methods which minimized some uncertainties introduced by adopting one method alone however various studies have demonstrated that the changes in surface humidity willett et al 2008 vapor pressure wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 and net radiation wild 2009 have impacts on evaporative demand and thus pet yet these factors were not considered in the pet calculations in this study second the changes in seasonal climate patterns and their effects on streamflow were not considered berghuijs et al 2014 shen et al 2017 for instance berghuijs et al 2014 revealed that precipitation shift from snow to rain leads to a decrease in streamflow third possible feedbacks between forest change and climate ellison et al 2012 khanna et al 2017 were not fully accounted for 6 conclusion quantifying the long term and cumulative effects of forest disturbance and climate variability on streamflow components has rarely been reported in the literature in this study we concluded that forest disturbance significantly increased all streamflow components while climatic variability decreased them in the upper similkameen river watershed the relative contributions of climate variability to annual total streamflow baseflow and surface runoff were 75 6 25 0 72 4 24 6 and 76 3 76 3 respectively while the rest of the changes in all streamflow components were attributed to forest disturbance climate variability played a more important role than forest disturbance in all streamflow components but in the opposite direction these findings help water or watershed managers make informed decisions when coping with future forest and climate changes in the usr watershed so that aquatic functioning and water supply can be sustained acknowledgements we thank the british

7503,water is an essential natural resource among many stressors altered climate is exerting pressure on water resource systems increasing its demand and creating a need for vulnerability assessments the overall objective of this study was to develop a novel tool that can translate a theoretical concept vulnerability of water resources vwr to an operational framework mainly under altered temperature and precipitation as well as for population change smaller extent the developed tool had three stages and utilized a novel systems thinking approach stage 1 translating theoretical concept

outside the us keywords ipcc adaptive capacity exposure sensitivity dpsir driver pressure state impact response high plains aquifer kansas vista 1 introduction water is widely regarded as an essential natural resource vÃ¶rÃ¶smarty et al 2010 and a necessary resource for nearly all human activities eea 2012 it can be viewed as a resource for domestic use as an input for agricultural and industrial uses a sustainer of ecosystems as well as a hazard in the form of floods and drought brown et al 2015 water availability will be one of the constraints for crop production and food security kang et al 2009 understanding the water resource system and its exposure to stressors are vital to secure and increase world food production to feed its growing population anandhi et al 2016b climate change and its consequences limit the adaptive capacity of water resource systems making them vulnerable to such changes al kalbani et al 2014 these systems are transformed through land cover change urbanization industrialization and several man made systems such as reservoirs irrigation and inter basin water transfers that increase human access to water vÃ¶rÃ¶smarty et al 2010 therefore water resource systems have complex interactions with both social and ecological sub systems gain et al 2013 in addition to climatic change other stressors such as increasing population socio economic growth and associated land cover changes have direct impacts on increasing water demands as well as vulnerability to the resource al kalbani et al 2014 this study focuses on the vulnerability of water resources vwr to stressors such as changes and variability in temperature and precipitation to a large extent and population change to a smaller extent vulnerability is a theoretical concept and difficult to be measured directly tonmoy et al 2014 making a theoretical concept operational consists of providing a method or procedures an operation for mapping it to observable concepts kim 2015 the method or procedures are then called the operational definition while in the case of vulnerability the operational definition is called the methodology of a vulnerability assessment hinkel 2011 the scientific information and knowledge in the methodology later become part of a process in a much broader decision making system weaver et al 2013 and modeling frameworks can be useful tools translating a theoretical concept vwr to an operational tool is very useful but not often clearly explained in most studies this study attempts to provide a clear explanation in general vulnerability assessments are complex given the multiple uses for the assessments the multi disciplinary nature of the problem limited understanding dynamic structure of vulnerability scale issues problems when devising vulnerability indicators adger et al 2004 and it being a theoretical concept due to the complexity in vulnerability assessment and water resource systems dual complexity estimating the vulnerabilities of water resources vwr to climate change is challenging but very important gain et al 2012 previous works have used econometric methods using survey information from questionnaires or index based methods using indicators for vulnerability assessments deressa et al 2008 the index based method is the most commonly used approach in vwr bÃ¤r et al 2015 our study identified several needs in vwr to a changing and variable climate the needs were grouped into those related to indicators and those related to decision tools some needs related to indicators were experts need to provide indicator relevance for clear unambiguous messages to be conveyed to users decision and policy makers and also the public hÃ¡k et al 2016 most indicator studies do not incorporate multiple spatial and temporal scales malone and engle 2011 and there has been a need for indicator providers to develop and or apply adequate approaches for strengthening the largely neglected indicators characteristic relevance hÃ¡k et al 2016 selected needs related to tools were there is an important need to develop tools for water managers whose systems are vulnerable to climate change and variability to assist them with planning sharda and srivastava 2016 there is a growing demand among stakeholders across public and private institutions for spatially explicit information regarding vulnerability to climate change at the local scale preston et al 2011 while recognizing that extensive literature exists to represent the vwr using multiple systems e g ecological natural biophysical social socio ecological or combinations and multiple frameworks at various spatial and temporal scales there still exists a need to synthesize the literature and develop tools within a decision making framework and there is a need to translate a theoretical concept vwr to an operational one for decision making our study attempted to address several of these needs the specific objective was to develop an innovative framework that translated the theoretical concept vwr to a tool useful for decision making mainly under a changing and variable temperature and precipitation and population change to a smaller extent this involved integration of characteristics in vulnerability assessments water resources and stressors e g climate change population change through indicators selected by systems thinking approaches the novelty was the translation of the theoretical concept vwr to a decision support tool by adaptation of gallopÃ­n 2006 generic vulnerability framework for vwr modifying bÃ¤r et al 2015 flowchart developed for agricultural vwr to a generic framework for vwr that integrated two important frameworks integrating two vulnerability assessments frameworks european s driver pressure state impact response framework dpsir and the intergovernmental panel on climate change s framework ipcc s and modifying anandhi et al 2016b framework developed for a single component exposure of agricultural production to a changing variable climate to include multiple components in vwr driver pressure state impact response exposure sensitivity adaptive capacity and processes the objective was carried out in three stages fig 1 stage 1 translating theoretical concept to charateristics identified from literature fig 2 stage 2 operationalizing charateristics to methodology in vwr fig 3 stage 3 utilizing the methodology for development of a conceptual modeling tool for vwr wr vista water resource vulnerability assessment conceptual model using indicators selected by system s thinking approach that is useful in the decision making framework fig 4 we hypothesize that 1 the developed tool using novel systems thinking approaches would support several stakeholders to select and highlight trends in indicators as well as simplify and communicate the complex and complicated information and phenomena within a decision making framework and 2 the compiled characteristics in vulnerability assessments from existing vulnerability assessments wr vista conceptualization as well as a discussion on the information related to using multiple indicators scaling normalization weighting and aggregation methodology and uncertainty would improve conceptualization of vwr assessments and tailor the developed tool for multiple stakeholders the developed tool was demonstrated by application to a case study the high plains region overlying the ogallala aquifer was chosen in this study because it is one of the most productive agricultural regions and called the breadbasket of the world sanderson and frey 2014 additionally this study addresses an important need for assessment of the vulnerability of water resources in the region brought out by a previous study steward et al 2013 2 descriptions of key terms and methodology 2 1 definitions descriptions of key terms used in this study a water resources system is described as the whole made from connected hydrologic infrastructure ecologic and human processes that involve water brown et al 2015 vulnerability is defined as the degree to which the system is susceptible to and is unable to cope with adverse effects of change adger 2006 complex systems involve the collective behavior of a large group of relatively simple elements or agents in which the interactions among these elements typically are local and non linear anandhi 2017 or simply put the whole is more than the sum of its parts ratter 2012 systems thinking focuses on understanding the relationships and feedbacks between the parts to understand the entire system anandhi 2017 caulfield and maj 2001 thereby providing a big picture of the system an indicator can be defined as any variable that indicates the magnitude e g mean seasonal temperature or variability e g standard deviation seasonal rainfall of a parameter alessa et al 2008 or the statistical relationship among variables anandhi 2017 gain et al 2012 finally stakeholders have been defined as individuals or groups with a vested interest in the outcome of a decision or the research project delorme et al 2016 food security is typically defined as when all people at all times have access to sufficient safe nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life glamann et al 2017 2 2 methodology this study s objective was achieved in three stages fig 1 stage 1 translating theoretical concept to charateristics identified from literature fig 2 stage 2 operationalizing charateristics to methodology in vwr fig 3 stage 3 development of a conceptual modeling tool for vwr in a changing climate wr vista fig 4 2 2 1 stage 1 translating theoretical concept to characteristics in vwr the studies on index based methods for vulnerability of water resource assessments were synthesized by identifying the commonality in them fig 2 they were also referred as steps methods procedures and or classification schemes in studies adger et al 2004 tonmoy et al 2014 in this study we referred to them as characteristics of the operational definition of vwr the characteristics we observed from studies on vulnerability in general and vwr in particular were target system system components scale level of detail data source frameworks indicators normalization weights aggregation etc the characteristics were subjective for example the characteristic scale represented spatial temporal scale and could be divided into two classification schemes geographical scale and temporal scale tonmoy et al 2014 target system we observed that in vwr the target system is also referred to as knowledge domain tonmoy et al 2014 unit exposed or system of reference gallopÃ­n 2006 the target system could have an ecological natural biophysical social or socio ecological perspective tonmoy et al 2014 some target systems can be more easily and clearly definable than others allen et al 2007 selected examples of target systems artic alessa et al 2008 ford and smit 2004 and agro ecosystems bÃ¤r et al 2015 system components the target system was divided into one or more components also referred to as parts and the divisions varied with studies for example babel et al 2011 used two main components represented as system s stressors and adaptive capacity brooks 2003 defined two components bio physical and social subsystems tonmoy et al 2014 referred them as socio ecological system ses classification scheme beekman et al 2003 used three components natural physiography socio economic and management components and target systems could be interchangeable scale there can be multiple spatial also referred as geographical scale tonmoy et al 2014 and temporal scales an example of spatial scales household or political boundaries ranging from regional farm or county level babel et al 2011 pandey et al 2011 to global scales national to continent levels hydrology based boundaries alessa et al 2008 or based on ecoregions snelder and biggs 2002 the temporal scales could vary from monthly annual to decadal scales as well as at current and future time studies looking at social components seem to be more focused on current time while studies with biophysical in vwr focused on future scale tonmoy et al 2014 level of detail vwr assessments could have multiple levels of detail they could be based on study objective and resource availability beekman et al 2003 the details in vwr could be classified into three tiers rapid intermediate and comprehensive respectively data sources directly measuring vulnerability is particularly misleading and challenging hinkel 2011 so data on proxy variables were used the data used could be hydrologic socio economic etc data could be from multiple sources such as measured observed modeled or from secondary sources e g federal state and non government organizations as well as information obtained from public participation and discussions with the stakeholder group gain et al 2012 frameworks for vulnerability assessments of water resources multiple conceptual frameworks for vwr assessments exists to address the various aspects of the dual complexity of vwr its multiple uses and resource availability tonmoy et al 2014 selected frameworks were stressor based perveen and james 2011 drivers and moderators based alessa et al 2008 requirement availability based brown and matlock 2011 additional framework also include van der vyver 2013 who estimated using stressors and expressed water stress using water poverty index system characteristics based defined by the ipcc exposure sensitivity adaptive capacity european s driver pressure state impact response dpsir framework many studies used the parts of the frameworks or combined multiple frameworks gain et al 2012 for example babel et al 2011 used a framework with stressors and adaptive capacity while hamouda et al 2009 and xia et al 2016 focused on sensitivity and adaptive capacity ford and smit 2004 focused on exposure and adaptive capacity while brooks 2003 developed vulnerability as a function of exposure sensitivity and social vulnerability pandey et al 2011 defined vulnerability as the ratio between water stress index wsi and adaptive capacity index aci and bÃ¤r et al 2015 combined dpsir with the ipcc s framework they observed that each of the frameworks had its advantages and disadvantages refer to bÃ¤r et al 2015 for a more detailed explanation on some of these frameworks indicator selection in vwr there were several indicators used in vulnerability assessments their choice can be subjective to the study s goals and targets hinkel 2011 the degree of response to changes perveen and james 2011 etc in general indicators could be selected using deductive framework based or theory based or physical relationship based inductive statistical based normative based on value judgements non substantial argument based only on data of the indicating variables approaches adger et al 2004 hinkel 2011 or their combination referred as hybrid approaches detailed discussion of these approaches can be found in adger et al 2004 hamouda et al 2009 gain et al 2012 hinkel 2011 heink and kowarik 2010 and anandhi 2017 many vulnerability studies do not clearly belong to either of the approaches each of the approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages normalization weights and aggregation methods for vwr while constructing the vulnerability index using multiple indicators scientifically sound methods for normalization weighting to specify the correct interrelationships and aggregation to get the right functional relationship are important bÃ¶hringer and jochem 2007 the normalization is to make data comparable when a variety of measurement units in which the indicator variables are expressed ebert and welsch 2004 they are carried out to avoid disproportionalities while combining multiple indicators for example xia et al 2016 used max min normalization the normalized indicators are aggregated using specific formulas and the indicators are assigned weights within the aggregation procedure 2 2 2 stage 2 characteristics to methodology development for vwr in this second stage the eight characteristics identified and discussed in stage 1 were translated to methodology steps for vwr fig 3 to apply the methodology characteristics of the flowchart column 1 fig 3 namely the target system the spatial and temporal scales the level of detail data sources the framework indicators normalization weights and aggregation methods need to be identified an example application of these characteristics for the kansas study region was provided in column 2 of fig 3 the vulnerability index vii from time series data having i time steps was calculated using the ratio in eq 1 1 vi i average value of indicator for a period the actual value of indicator for a year vi 1 indicated negligible vulnerability of the system to external stressors e g climate change and variability vi deviating from 1 vi 1 or vi 1 indicated a higher vulnerability of

systems and span multiple spatial temporal scales for example hydrological processes can span over larger areas with internationally shared rivers and aquifers to smaller scale watersheds while human processes such as water treatment or delivery systems are usually limited to smaller areas of regulation and governance in the figure fig 4 climate change was one of the external stressors represented as cloud thunder snow heat other stressors such as increasing population socio economic growth and associated land cover changes can also be considered depending on how the target system is viewed climate change could be treated as a gradual predictable and continuous change in environmental conditions over time or as the changing occurrence of discrete climatic extreme events such as droughts heat waves or floods butt et al 2016 the external stressors were represented using driver pressure characteristics for example precipitation characteristics such as quantity magnitude frequency intensity rate seasonality etc which impact the water resource availability and supply at multiple spatio temporal scales these drivers social economic environmental exerted pressures on the target system which in turn changed the target system s internal characteristics as a consequence the resulting impacts evoke responses e g political actions or management measures that can affect drivers pressures states or impacts bÃ¤r et al 2015 for example droughts and low flows in many areas of the us indicated that even small changes in drought severity and frequency would have a major impact on the various ecosystem services relating to water resource systems e g drinking water supplies ford et al 2011 the response of the target system to the impacts of external stressors was framed as the ability of the target system to adapt to change knowledge power and resources mediated the set of responses e g political actions management measures and adaptation strategies these involved the characteristics of the target system and stressors the drivers of change and operators of the responses e g policy makers water managers the thick arrows in fig 4 represented the overall flow direction of processes in wr vsta as well as the direction of movement of time in the figure the dotted arrows and flowchart in fig 4 represented the synthesized flowchart incorporated in the conceptual framework detailed methodology is provided in section 4 the observed modeled biotic and abiotic information were used to represent the water resource system s target system and the stressors the target system s internal characteristics adaptive capacity and sensitivity and processes as well its stressor characteristics driver pressure were represented using indicators identified in the conceptual model using systems thinking approaches 3 study region and data used 3 1 study region the developed wr vista model was applied to a case study in kansas which is comprised of 105 counties fig s1 in the supplementary material the region is important in many ways the region has the second highest cropland acreage in the us anandhi et al 2013a the study region is part of the breadbasket of the world or the grain basket of the united states anandhi 2016 and has some of the most productive agricultural lands in the country the corn production land in kansas over lies the high plains ogallala aquifer and the kansas portion has one of the steepest water level declines in the aquifer sanderson and frey 2014 the high plains aquifer is the largest aquifer in the us supplying 70 of the total groundwater and providing 30 of the irrigated water to the country zhang et al 2016 additionally kansas has the highest decrease in ground water level in the aquifer declining water levels in the aquifer affect the agricultural production in the region steward et al 2013 national food production and impact the nation s food security previous studies have indicated changes in the last spring freeze first fall freeze growing season plant phenology warm cold wet dry spells plant failure temperatures and extreme rainfall in the region anandhi 2016 anandhi and blocksome 2017 anandhi et al 2013a rahmani et al 2015 rahmani et al 2014 additionally exposure of the agricultural production in the region to these changes can amplify the vulnerability of hydrological systems anandhi et al 2016b 3 2 data used water resource systems have distinct spatial temporal and physical characteristics because of its complexity and multidisciplinary nature for example the spatial management of these systems involves many stakeholder collaborations e g policy makers researchers citizens producers at different levels of action murgue et al 2015 therefore data collection at common temporal and spatial scales is a big challenge khan et al 2017 multiple spatial e g point watershed scale and temporal scales e g daily annual scale data were used additionally these data were from multiple sources such as measurements e g temperature modeled e g evapotranspiration and secondary sources e g kansas department of agriculture the details of the data used in the case study were provided in table 1 4 results 4 1 application to the case study in stages 1 and 2 translating the theoretical concept to the operational tool for vwr in three stages is demonstrated in the kansas region of the ogallala aquifer high plains aquifer in stage 1 eight characteristics were selected for translation they were target system system components scale level of detail data source frameworks indicators and methods for normalization weights aggregation for the application six steps were used in stage 2 for operationalizing charateristics to methodology in vwr column 2 of fig 3 in this study the water resources system was the chosen target system with mainly biophysical components the data was at several spatial and temporal scales for example streamflow and et were at 8 digit hydrologic unit code huc spatial scale precipitation was the station data at point scale at daily time steps and population data were at county level and annual scale the case study was at an intermediate level of detail using data from several sources e g measurements modeled information and secondary statistics table 1 the wr vista framework was used to select 26 indicators the indicators were selected using a hybrid approach more details in section 4 3 normalization was carried by averaging and aggregated using equal weight and correlation with historical events 4 2 hydrologic model calibration and validation results in the absence of observed measured information on multiple components biophysical social economic combinations model simulations were used in this application runoff et was estimated using the swat model and the plant growth stage was simulated using the heat unit model anandhi 2016 the swat model calibration and validation were carried out on annual average runoff 1965 1985 and annual average actual et 1971 2000 the results were aggregated from the model at the 8 digit huc level for a comparison with the observations statistical measures such as mean standard deviation coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe prediction efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and rsr legates and mccabe 1999 were used to evaluate the model performance of predicting annual runoff and annual actual et if the r2 and nse values were less than or very close to zero the model prediction is considered unacceptable or poor if the values are 1 0 then the model prediction is perfect values greater than 0 6 for r2 and greater than 0 5 for nse less than 25 for pbias and less than 0 7 for rsr were considered acceptable for flow moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 the validation of the swat model was carried out using the guidelines of biondi et al 2012 there was a close correlation between the model predicted annual runoff and the observations except for a few 8 digit hucs this was evident from the patterns of predicted and observed annual runoff as well as the model performance evaluation statistics nse r2 pbias and rsr presented in fig 5 except nse and rsr all of the other model performance evaluation measures suggest an acceptable quality of modeled et with respect to observations in summary the quality of model estimated annual average runoff and et values appear reasonable and acceptable 4 3 application of wr vista stage 3 for identification of indicators in the case study utilizing the wr vista conceptual modeling tool 26 indicators were selected in the case study for vwr to stressors which largely represented changes and variability in temperature and precipitation and to a smaller extent on population change table 2 the application of systems thinking approaches in their selection for the development of wr vista is given below the water resources system target system in kansas includes bio geo physical processes e g elements of the hydrologic cycle runoff evapotranspiration precipitation ecosystem functioning and human processes e g human decisions and actions regarding irrigation with the declining groundwater levels in the ogallala aquifer runoff evaporation evapotranspiration and ground water recharge could be some examples of hydrological processes vegetation growth and development could be examples of the ecological process while those for internal characteristics could be land use and soil characteristics these processes could span over the entire state with a shared hydrology of rivers e g kansas river and aquifers e g ogallala shared across neighboring states e g colorado nebraska human processes such as regarding increasing water demands and declining water supply are usually limited to smaller areas of regulation and governance e g county level groundwater management district 1 3 and 4 levels some of the processes could vary across the water cycles from a larger scale to smaller scales water resource systems in this study were examined from biophysical bp dimensions each of these dimensions in the water resource system could be divided into individual parts some examples include water supply systems and water distribution systems for agricultural and urban water use in the wr vista runoff evapotranspiration stages of plant growth and development and water resource variability wrv were some of the internal processes chosen in the target system we used both inductive and deductive approaches to identify these indicators that represented internal characteristics of the water resource system vegetation plays an import role in the water resource system growing degree days was the indicator used to represent plant growth and development while other indicators such as runoff and evapotranspiration represent the hydrological components of the water cycle the internal characteristics and processes of the water resource systems were represented using adaptive capacity adjustment to stress and sensitivity response to stress to represent the sensitivity of the water resource system to climate change and variability stressor the changes in the target system characteristics runoff and evapotranspiration across time were correlated with the changes in the indicators to represent the response of the target system to external stress fig 6 wrv over a period of years determines the reliability of annual available water resources table s2 in the supplementary material wrv was expressed in percentages variability in rainfall is a key parameter related to agricultural production and water management devineni et al 2013 in managed and natural ecosystems to identify the long term variation of water resources we used the county level coefficient of variation of annual precipitation cv during the 2000 2012 period water resources scarcity wrs indicator equation in the supplementary material or social water stress is the average water available per year per person perveen and james 2011 the water scarcity threshold is subjective to the region society and its affordability the highest vulnerability had a maximum value of water stress 1 the county level per capita water availability for the period of 1985 2010 was calculated it is the total water use both from fresh and saline water sources divided by the population the irrigation coverage represented the extent of water resources used for irrigation a high value indicated more dependence on irrigation and a low value indicated a lower dependence the sensitivity of the water resources system is affected by population density and the area cultivated that is dependent on water resources land use patterns that maintain the integrity of watersheds have a significant influence on surface water resources price et al 2011 and have interactions with drought xia et al 2016 vulnerable groups are more exposed and less capable of adapting to stressors due to limited infrastructure and inputs mcdowell and hess 2012 for example smallholder farmers are often considered particularly vulnerable to climate related food insecurity such as exposure to drought than more commercial farmers who have higher adaptive capacity from that exposure using irrigation narrow yield etc adaptive capacity is necessary to convert natural and social resources into useful adaptation strategies briske et al 2015 for example changes in frost indicators first fall freeze last spring freeze are useful to develop incremental adaptation strategies such as planting earlier harvesting later or systems adaptation such as different crop variety trends in growing degree days gdd are useful to develop adaptation strategies such as irrigation amount and timing water management and selecting crop varieties changes in drought e g spi index and crop growth gdd will support water management more information in translating these indicators to adaptation strategies in agro ecosystems and water management can be obtained from anandhi 2017 and steiner et al 2017 for an application the indicators described in this study can be used as a model by stakeholders e g farmers water managers and decision makers or a completely a new set of indicators can be selected using wr vista framework temperature and precipitation change and to a smaller extent population change were the external stressors considered in this study given the uncertainty of the future climate and other changes consideration for enhancing the robustness of such a decision is warranted we used the hybrid approach for the indicator selection climate was represented using variables such as precipitation and temperature while the population was represented using the number of people for example changes in rainfall and temperature characteristics stressor characteristics impact water resource systems and its internal characteristics and processes as a consequence the resulting impacts evoke responses e g political actions or management measures that can affect drivers pressures states or impacts bÃ¤r et al 2015 climatic processes drive the water resource system processes e g hydrological cycle water temperature snelder and biggs 2002 we incorporated the mean and extreme climate its variability and relevant hydrological elements for ecosystem functioning information the coefficient of variation of precipitation variability in drought mean and extreme precipitation and temperature duration of spells wet dry warm cold growing season length population density and change and proportion of cultivated area dependent on irrigation were some of the indicators selected in this study fig 6 defined in table s2 figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary material they were chosen to represent the variations in stressor characteristics the magnitude of the pressure and intensity of the drivers of water resource system processes many of these indicators represented the stresses of extreme climate impacting land use e g agriculture irrigation water use e g irrigation and processes in water cycle e g et runoff some of these indicators represented the variability in precipitation a key parameter related to runoff agricultural production and water management devineni et al 2013 while others represented the prolonged periods with precipitation and temperature extremes e g wet dry spells frost these have many ecological and hydrological consequences such as implications on the water cycle changes in the growing season crop growth and yield milk production in livestock and reproductive capabilities of farm animals anandhi et al 2016a changes in frost indices impact the hydrological and energy cycles by changing the patterns in et and streamflow and the frequency of drought anandhi et al 2013b changes in precipitation and et may cause annual runoff to change additionally changes in temperature are expected to change the hydrology of the region by decreasing the precipitation falling as snow shifting the timing of snowmelt and the streamflow resulting from snow melt to occur earlier in the spring or in late winter which eventually changes the magnitude of streamflow warming and drying are expected to modify vegetation composition and land surface cover including an increase in the density and cover of woody plants in the region briske et al 2015 very few indicators representing the social unit are chosen in this study the density of population is one of them it is the number of people per square mile and represented the population centers in kansas indirectly the land use a higher value indicated the presence of a relatively bigger city and a lower value indicated a rural setting an index of the cultivated area under irrigation was developed to identify the dependence of agriculture on water resources 4 4 vulnerability results estimated in the case study using the developed tool our results indicate that vulnerability components in the wr vista model exposure driver pressure stressors sensitivity adaptive capacity state impact and response are not static but change over time and space these changes were translated to changes in the vulnerability indicators and observed from the red shaded portion obtained from the time series in fig 6 and synthesized in table 2 the correlation of the indicators to the region runoff and evapotranspiration for the period 1971 2000 were plotted in fig s3 in supplementary material while the spatial variation were potted at a county level in fig 6 time series of the indices estimated in the study using eq 1 and the indicator description provided in table s2 in the supplementary material mean values of selected indicators obtained from 105 counties in kansas are discussed in this section as spatial plots fig 6 understanding adaptation to multiple stressors allows us to address the complexity of vulnerability mcdowell and hess 2012 from the time series plot of the exposure indicators across kansas we observed the degree of stress varied with the indicator and time period in fig s2 in supplementary material a greater spread of the shaded portion indicated greater spatial variability the hills and valleys in the plot indicated higher vulnerability of the indicators the higher the peaks of the hills and valleys the greater the vulnerability observed by higher deviation of the index from 1 for example in kansas the 1930s and 1950s had high vulnerability and served as benchmarks for severe climate stressed periods although the spatial dimensions of both the 1930s and 1950s droughts were different the vulnerability varied with the indicator as seen by the different y axis in the sub plots indicators that represent the mean stressor and target system characteristics e g average annual precipitation pptn maximum minimum and average temperature tmax tmin tave have smaller vulnerability indices when compared to the indicators representing extremes the sensitivity of the indicators to evapotranspiration and runoff also varied with indicators no one indicator showed a strong sensitivity to evapotranspiration and runoff this was observed from a five year moving average of the time series plot of evapotranspiration and runoff for the 1971 2000 time period were shown for the various indicators selected in this study fig s3 in supplementary material the shaded portion in the figure represents the 95th and 5th percentile values of the indicators in each year the solid bold black line in the middle of the shaded portion represents the median value for each year in this study the simple probabilistic approach 95th and 5th percentile values was used to represent the sensitivity the results can be more reliable if more advanced uncertainty analysis methods are used biondi et al 2012 similarly observed values of streamflow evapotranspiration at the location of the stressors can provide more reliable sensitivity results the wrv is provided in fig 6 and its variability is more in central kansas wrv a function of the coefficient of rainfall is a key parameter that represents agricultural production its water management especially for rain fed agriculture the western kansas regions with higher wrv overlie the high plains aquifer and also have the highest market value for agriculture in the nation steward et al 2013 changes in precipitation and temperature observed in the region anandhi 2016 anandhi et al 2013a rahmani et al 2014 would increase the wrv in the region this in turn would increase the region s exposure to climate change ground water use for irrigation buffers the variability in precipitation for agriculture devineni et al 2013 and domestic water use stresses the region s already declining ground water levels in the aquifer the counties in western kansas had a higher area under irrigation fig 6b declining water levels was predicted to cut agricultural production in the region steward 2014 thereby decreasing their adaptive capacity and increasing the vwr in the region the wrs map is provided in fig 6c and the scarcity was more in eastern kansas when compared to western kansas in this study wrs is a function of water availability and social water stress which in turn was a function of the population in the region counties in eastern kansas had increased urbanization in the last few decades applegate et al 2003 with a higher population density fig 6d no clear patterns in population change were observed fig 6e the wrs was higher in this part of kansas even though they have higher rainfall and higher surface water availability when compared to the western part of the state 5 discussion 5 1 indicator selection and systems thinking approaches there is extensive literature on various indicators relating to the ecological biophysical socio economic and political dimensions that underlie vwr ecological biophysical indicators measure impacts of water resource and use on the environmental domain while the socioeconomic indicators measure fiscal or societal effects of water resource lane et al 1999 system thinking approaches were used in this study to develop the tool figs 1 4 the introduction of systems thinking has had major benefits in the world of change and has also been a powerful stimulus to the development of an understanding of the natural systems allowing an integration of disciplines rÃ¶ling 1997 while recognizing that extensive literature exists in applying systems thinking approaches to various applications e g agriculture van keulen and schiere 2004 to the knowledge of the authors hardly any studies have applied systems thinking to vulnerability assessments of water resources in the past anandhi et al 2016b had used the systems thinking approach for one component of vulnerability exposure for a different target system agriculture than this study hard and soft thinking are the two extremes of system thinking the hard system thinking is based on deductive thinking while soft system thinking focuses on mindsets van keulen and schiere 2004 which are highly dependent on context and purpose in hard thinking the system is perceived with boundaries e g time and space rÃ¶ling 1997 inputs and outputs and using coded variables e g indicators examples of spatial boundaries include political county state hydrological watershed river basin while decadal and annual could be temporal boundaries an example of inputs could be rain and outputs could be streamflow evapotranspiration etc these approaches are used to characterize entities and areas concerned with alternatives and to assess the impacts of the alternatives by using indicators for example such as water volume withdrawn for irrigation hard thinking approaches provide quantitative and stable information ensuring the saliency of inputs outputs in contrast soft thinking approaches perceived the systems with highly fuzzy boundaries inputs and outputs rÃ¶ling 1997 these approaches could be used for interacting with stakeholders and designing change options under investigation which ensures the legitimacy of the process because it avoids the black box effect murgue et al 2015 examples could include perceptions of vulnerability stress exposure etc the fuzziness could be that each stakeholder understands the complex system according to his her own interests activities and management strategies murgue et al 2015 therefore combining both hard and soft thinking when selecting elements hybrid approach can be challenging but it provides support in explaining the complexity of the system anandhi 2017 salerno et al 2010 5 2 adaptation of the developed tool for multiple stakeholders the study goals and objectives the characteristics stage 1 methods stage 2 and indicator selection using wr vista conceptualizations stage 3 depends on the water use stakeholder requirement and their he resource availability our description of the assessment of vwr is presented in stepwise fashion recognizing that various scientific and social processes will likely proceed simultaneously and many need to be repeated iteratively while recognizing the existence of an extensive literature on various characteristics which underlined vwr for various stressors there is subjectivity in selecting the eight characteristics from stage 1 of this study in this stage the number of characteristics used in a study could be modified in a way that is beneficial to stakeholder and their water use e g for domestic agricultural industrial use used as a sustainer of ecosystems or viewed as a hazard characteristics could be added removed and or split e g scale to spatial and temporal scales in this study we were interested in the application of the proposed framework for an intermediate level of detail using a few selected indicators for simplicity in the future by utilizing the 3 stage framework a user stakeholder could choose steps figs 1 4 and indicators to develop the conceptual model we believe that depending on the available resources and the need stakeholders are likely to adapt this tool including the wr vista model for vwr assessment for various stressors depending on the study goals and objectives the definitions of target system and components could be interchangeable a target system could be a component of a larger system at the same time the component could be a system with smaller components the choice of indicators for representation of the processes and internal and external characteristics for these assessments could also vary an elaborate discussion on indicators for ecology and environmental planning can be found in heink and kowarik 2010 hamouda et al 2009 categorized the indicators into hydro physical indicators and socio economic or political nature depending on the availability of data and resources the vulnerability assessments could be carried out at multiple levels of detail for example in the short term changes in temperature had the potential to change plant water use via transpiration and evaporation and hence change the rainfall runoff ratio or groundwater recharge in the longer term changes in temperature could produce shifts in species distributions e g a shift from deciduous to evergreen forests which was likely to result in changed water use due to changed year round transpiration and interception ford et al 2011 other hydrological models as well as crop and biogeochemical model outputs could be used to simulate processes and characteristics of the target system and its components additional indicators to represent the adaptive capacity that encompasses the ability to recognize and manage risk plan and implement adaptation strategies display financial and emotional flexibility described in the section below and even exhibit awareness of climate change and the need for adaptation could be added the current study did not include the comprehensive list of indicators that could be potentially used for the study region because the framework does not attempt to provide optimal solutions in the traditional decision analytic sense instead using only a few indicators in vwr at an intermediate level of detail the approach was described identifying indicator s is an important component in vwr assessments we recommend systems thinking approaches to identify region specific indicators based on expert and local knowledge through discussion with stakeholders e g water managers extension specialists etc also indicators could be selected based on a literature review or available data indicator identification exercise is difficult because each stakeholder understands this complex water resource system according to his her interests activities and management strategies for example agricultural practices vary from an agricultural viewpoint where they are the result of decisions of individual farming systems involved in socio professional networks while from the viewpoint of water managers the practices are considered at the river basin level 5 3 adaptation of the developed tool for other stressors our description of the assessment of vwr is presented in stepwise fashion recognizing that various other stressors will likely to impact them the same procedure could be repeated iteratively or simultaneously for other indicators stressors as well with the emerging scientific consensus that the global population was likely to exceed 9 billion people by 2050 gerland et al 2014 most of the increasing population will be in cities of the world urbanization and population growth can be potential stressors in the context of climate change and other stressors physical stressors may determine the physical quantity or quality of the water resource however the ability to benefit from such water depends on a broader set of abilities or access mechanisms such as technologies landscape configurations social capital violence or theft mcdowell and hess 2012 some region specific stressors are that the area under forests and wetlands can be used as the natural capacity parameter to indicate the ecosystem state a higher value of the indicator indicates a more natural state or less human interventions thus suggesting less vulnerable water resources system physical capacity can be represented using indicators such as the area covered by irrigation with drinking water supply or industrial use the area covered with drinking water represents the percentage of the population with access to improved water supply the industrial coverage indicates industrial development area with water supply higher coverage indicates better physical infrastructures and financial resources the literacy rate and economically active population indicators are considered to represent the socio economic capacity a higher literacy rate suggests a relatively better awareness and ability to understand water related issues it may in due course steer the people to cope with a variety of water related stresses and thereby increasing the adaptive capacity of the water resources system the economically active population is another indicator the age of working people a higher economically active population reflects a higher flexibility to adapt to the new conditions living patterns under increased stresses in the water resource system this indicator is not used in this study due to a higher literacy rate in the region 5 4 potential uncertainties in wr vista uncertainty in wr vista can arise from many sources that can be grouped into three categories model uncertainty scenario uncertainty and measurement uncertainty some model uncertainties arise due to insufficient knowledge indicator fatigue scoring framework and weighing uncertainty due to insufficient knowledge arises when a few criteria were assessed due to limited knowledge about the abstract components or from assumptions or limitations of simplified models describing complex processes such as the models describing future climate conditions or the algorithms describing components of water cycle climate relationships studies have shown that changes in climate have important implications on the water availability to understand the entire target system it was necessary to examine the individual components and the interrelationships among them allen et al 2007 the vulnerability indicators in the wr vista model were used as one or more proxy variables to represent abstract components namely exposure driver pressure stressors sensitivity adaptive capacity state impact and response depending on the stakeholder s judgment the scope location of the study and the question to be answered the indicators or sets of indicators in wr vista would differ from study to study the model can accommodate different units of analysis if not adequately integrated it will result in indicator fatigue this is due to missing of important variables co linearity lack of accounting for interactions feedbacks situation specific normative judgments of researchers and users knowledge malone and engle 2011 the scoring uncertainty occurs when an expert feels that more than one value is equally likely to represent the vulnerability of the target system and weighting uncertainty occurs when one or two criteria contribute disproportionately to the vulnerability or value score reece and noss 2014 for a component weighting is to specify the correct interrelationships bÃ¶hringer and jochem 2007 to appropriate parameters this study did not weigh constituent indicators differently because it was difficult to determine the order of importance of constituent indicators and parameters for example we had difficulty determining if precipitation change is more important than surface water change in vwr assessments equal weight method is recommended for applications where there is no sufficient expert knowledge or information on indicators while using equal weight method use caution because the vulnerability index can be highly influenced by dominating indicators anandhi 2016 in the past different indicators have been weighted differently with some indicators given greater importance than others baettig et al 2007 previously weights were assigned using expert judgment or statistical analysis such as geometric mean principal component correlation fuzzy logic or econometrically anandhi et al 2016b bhattacharya and das 2007 bÃ¶hringer and jochem 2007 deressa et al 2008 simelton et al 2009 aggregation is to get the right functional relationship bÃ¶hringer and jochem 2007 the functional relationship could involve known scientific relationships among variables e g hydrological models growing degree days indicator to represent plant growth stage and its water use experts could be consulted in a rather open discussion process and statistical relationships among variables choosing normalization methods and weightings will in general be associated with subjective judgments bÃ¶hringer and jochem 2007 some of the selected indicators may require the definition of thresholds see section 4 2 the thresholds or values indicated acceptable conditions and standards they provided a measure on whether or not the indicators contributed significantly to vulnerability the critical values of some indicators proposed in the literature falkenmark and widstrand 1992 can be used while others need to be estimated based on the prevailing conditions in the study area uncertainty in how we are defining the target system and its components because the terms target system and components can be interchangeable a target system could be a component of a larger system at the same time the component could be a system with smaller components the choice of indicators in wr vista could be region specific more details in the next sub section the estimated indicators from observed and modeled biotic and abiotic information were aggregated using eq 1 for determining vwr in wr vista incorporating mean and extreme climate its variability and relevant bio geo physical processes relevant hydrological elements ecosystem functioning information and human processes are useful but complicated omitting them will almost certainly lead to incomplete understanding and should be taken up or addressed in comprehensive vulnerability analyses butt et al 2016 scenario uncertainty arose when the indicators were chosen to attempt to capture the range of uncertainty in vulnerability assessments in space and time although the true range of the uncertainty remains unknown these indicated how vulnerable current conditions are and future conditions might be the variation in the indicators provide a range of scenarios and presents the stakeholders with difficult choices for example the ranges might include one scenario where no action is necessary and another where very costly investments are necessary planning for either of the above mentioned sceanarios could result in considerable potential regrets given the limited resources typically associated with addressing some of the extreme case scenarios a water manager is unlikely to be comfortable committing resources by a single or small number of scenarios brown et al 2012 measurement uncertainty arises from imprecision or errors in obtaining data and can occur when geographic coordinates of observations are recorded or transcribed incorrectly or alternative climate datasets use different weather stations time periods and interpolation techniques to create climate maps watling et al 2015 use of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis can assist in identifying the gaps and check the robustness thereby further enhancing the transparency and credibility of the tool singh et al 2012 5 5 water resource vulnerability and societal impacts vulnerability assessments on water resources are powerful analytical tools for describing states of risk powerlessness the marginality of systems and for guiding actions to enhance prosperity through mitigation of risk adger 2006 against various stressors besides they show where unsustainability may be the most likely bÃ¤r et al 2015 these assessments can provide decision makers with credible and transparent parameters to identify priority needs and justify their actions harley et al 2008 they provide planners with insights on focus areas to reduce the system s vulnerability hamouda et al 2009 and options to formulate new water resource management policies as well as evaluate modify and improve existing ones babel et al 2011 unep 2011 these assessments support building internal linkages of water resource vulnerability and adaptation allan et al 2013 which are critical for management of aquifer sustainability in light of potential global climate change gurdak et al 2007 agriculture is the largest single user of water with about 75 of the world s freshwater being currently used for irrigation qadir et al 2007 this leads to an intrinsic relationship between the renewable water resources and the capacity for food production yang et al 2003 water availability is one of the main limiting factors for food production kang et al 2009 with a world population that is expected to grow from current level to about 6 9 9 2 billion by 2050 as well as changing lifestyles and consumption patterns global demand for food is projected to increase by 70 110 by 2050 delzeit et al 2017 future projections of increasing population as well as the changes in the crop s growing season length due to increasing minimum temperature would exacerbate the existing demand for water together they will create unprecedented stress on water and food demand and supply thus impacting food security vwr will describe states of risk of food and water systems in an altered climate they will support the identification of these systems powerlessness as well as guide actions that enhance prosperity through risk mitigation against various stressors therefore understanding the water resource system and its vulnerability to stressors such as changing temperature and precipitation are vital to secure and increase world food production to feed its growing population anandhi 2016 we deliberately provide only cursory treatment of the social and policy challenges inherent in gaining the adoption and implementation of vwr assessments we expect that other authors with expertise in water policy and the social sciences will offer their perspectives on the need and challenges associated with effectively implementing our methodology in a variety of social and governance contexts vulnerability is a dynamic phenomenon with dynamic processes biophysical economical social and combinations that shape local conditions also the ability of the water resource system to cope is also dynamic measuring vulnerability is also a challenge because it is often not a directly observable phenomenon and so the vwr assessments are difficult to validate it is also a difficult complex concept with inherent difficulties for quantifying it therefore proxy variables or indicators were used in vwr assessment or modeling and are often used in environmental and social studies the symbolic representation of vwr framework developed in this study can be useful in developing desirable proxy indicators given the uncertainty of future climate and other changes consideration for enhancing the robustness of such a decision is warranted 6 conclusion water is critical for human survival everywhere but especially in the study region the high plains region overlying the ogallala aquifer because it is considered one of the most productive agricultural regions the breadbasket of the world increasing demand on the limited resource of water can make it vulnerable to climate and land cover changes thereby creating a need for vulnerability assessments the overall goal and objective of this study was to develop tools to address stakeholders need for assessment of vulnerability of water resources to climate change and variability the tool could assist them with planning and decision making decision support is hard not only because long term prediction is hard but also because creating decision relevant processes from available information is hard this was carried out in three stages using indicators selected by novel systems thinking approaches stage 1 translating theoretical concept to charateristics identified from literature stage 2 operationalizing charateristics to methodology in vwr stage 3 utilizing the methodology for development of a conceptual modeling tool for vwr wr vista water resource vulnerability assessment conceptual model using indicators selected by system s thinking approach useful in decision making framework the wr vista model was developed in one of the three stages and presented in this study the development of wr vista utilized the several important characteristics of vwr synthesized in this study from the literature review fig 2 we adapted gallopÃ­n 2006 generic framework of vulnerability for water resources system additionally we modified bÃ¤r et al 2015 flowchart originally developed for agricultural water resources vulnerability combining dpsir ipcc frameworks to the generic framework and anandhi et al 2016b framework originally developed for a single component exposure of agricultural production to changing variable climate to include multiple components the novelty of the theoretical framework in wr vista is the representation of multiple components driver pressure state impact response exposure sensitivity adaptive capacity and processes using indicators to explain the critical elements of vwr the application of the study region is important because it overlies the high plains aquifer which supplies 30 of the nation s irrigated groundwater and produces agricultural products worth 35 billion market value we selected and estimated 26 indicators to study the vwr in kansas our results showed in a changing environment an increased vulnerability in the western part of the state for agriculture while in the eastern part an increased vulnerability was observed for urban water use the indicators used in this study demonstrate the framework and may may not be suitable for all applications of vwr the wr vista framework can be applied by multiple stakeholders to identify indicators for vwr assessments the framework does not attempt to provide optimal solutions in the traditional decision analytic sense instead the approach identifies the best decision conditional on the weight of the indicator based evidence using a more sophisticated approach for assigning the weights and including multiple socio economic indicators which measure fiscal or societal effects of water resource for vwr differs for future work the changes in future climate projections from global climate models can be applied to estimate the change in vwr and are deferred for future work acknowledgements this material is based upon work partially supported from the usda national institute of food and agriculture s evans allen project

7503,water is an essential natural resource among many stressors altered climate is exerting pressure on water resource systems increasing its demand and creating a need for vulnerability assessments the overall objective of this study was to develop a novel tool that can translate a theoretical concept vulnerability of water resources vwr to an operational framework mainly under altered temperature and precipitation as well as for population change smaller extent the developed tool had three stages and utilized a novel systems thinking approach stage 1 translating theoretical concept to characteristics identified from studies stage 2 operationalizing characteristics to methodology in vwr stage 3 utilizing the methodology for development of a conceptual modeling tool for vwr wr vista water resource vulnerability assessment conceptual model using indicators selected by system s thinking approach the specific novelties were 1 the important characteristics in vwr were

outside the us keywords ipcc adaptive capacity exposure sensitivity dpsir driver pressure state impact response high plains aquifer kansas vista 1 introduction water is widely regarded as an essential natural resource vÃ¶rÃ¶smarty et al 2010 and a necessary resource for nearly all human activities eea 2012 it can be viewed as a resource for domestic use as an input for agricultural and industrial uses a sustainer of ecosystems as well as a hazard in the form of floods and drought brown et al 2015 water availability will be one of the constraints for crop production and food security kang et al 2009 understanding the water resource system and its exposure to stressors are vital to secure and increase world food production to feed its growing population anandhi et al 2016b climate change and its consequences limit the adaptive capacity of water resource systems making them vulnerable to such changes al kalbani et al 2014 these systems are transformed through land cover change urbanization industrialization and several man made systems such as reservoirs irrigation and inter basin water transfers that increase human access to water vÃ¶rÃ¶smarty et al 2010 therefore water resource systems have complex interactions with both social and ecological sub systems gain et al 2013 in addition to climatic change other stressors such as increasing population socio economic growth and associated land cover changes have direct impacts on increasing water demands as well as vulnerability to the resource al kalbani et al 2014 this study focuses on the vulnerability of water resources vwr to stressors such as changes and variability in temperature and precipitation to a large extent and population change to a smaller extent vulnerability is a theoretical concept and difficult to be measured directly tonmoy et al 2014 making a theoretical concept operational consists of providing a method or procedures an operation for mapping it to observable concepts kim 2015 the method or procedures are then called the operational definition while in the case of vulnerability the operational definition is called the methodology of a vulnerability assessment hinkel 2011 the scientific information and knowledge in the methodology later become part of a process in a much broader decision making system weaver et al 2013 and modeling frameworks can be useful tools translating a theoretical concept vwr to an operational tool is very useful but not often clearly explained in most studies this study attempts to provide a clear explanation in general vulnerability assessments are complex given the multiple uses for the assessments the multi disciplinary nature of the problem limited understanding dynamic structure of vulnerability scale issues problems when devising vulnerability indicators adger et al 2004 and it being a theoretical concept due to the complexity in vulnerability assessment and water resource systems dual complexity estimating the vulnerabilities of water resources vwr to climate change is challenging but very important gain et al 2012 previous works have used econometric methods using survey information from questionnaires or index based methods using indicators for vulnerability assessments deressa et al 2008 the index based method is the most commonly used approach in vwr bÃ¤r et al 2015 our study identified several needs in vwr to a changing and variable climate the needs were grouped into those related to indicators and those related to decision tools some needs related to indicators were experts need to provide indicator relevance for clear unambiguous messages to be conveyed to users decision and policy makers and also the public hÃ¡k et al 2016 most indicator studies do not incorporate multiple spatial and temporal scales malone and engle 2011 and there has been a need for indicator providers to develop and or apply adequate approaches for strengthening the largely neglected indicators characteristic relevance hÃ¡k et al 2016 selected needs related to tools were there is an important need to develop tools for water managers whose systems are vulnerable to climate change and variability to assist them with planning sharda and srivastava 2016 there is a growing demand among stakeholders across public and private institutions for spatially explicit information regarding vulnerability to climate change at the local scale preston et al 2011 while recognizing that extensive literature exists to represent the vwr using multiple systems e g ecological natural biophysical social socio ecological or combinations and multiple frameworks at various spatial and temporal scales there still exists a need to synthesize the literature and develop tools within a decision making framework and there is a need to translate a theoretical concept vwr to an operational one for decision making our study attempted to address several of these needs the specific objective was to develop an innovative framework that translated the theoretical concept vwr to a tool useful for decision making mainly under a changing and variable temperature and precipitation and population change to a smaller extent this involved integration of characteristics in vulnerability assessments water resources and stressors e g climate change population change through indicators selected by systems thinking approaches the novelty was the translation of the theoretical concept vwr to a decision support tool by adaptation of gallopÃ­n 2006 generic vulnerability framework for vwr modifying bÃ¤r et al 2015 flowchart developed for agricultural vwr to a generic framework for vwr that integrated two important frameworks integrating two vulnerability assessments frameworks european s driver pressure state impact response framework dpsir and the intergovernmental panel on climate change s framework ipcc s and modifying anandhi et al 2016b framework developed for a single component exposure of agricultural production to a changing variable climate to include multiple components in vwr driver pressure state impact response exposure sensitivity adaptive capacity and processes the objective was carried out in three stages fig 1 stage 1 translating theoretical concept to charateristics identified from literature fig 2 stage 2 operationalizing charateristics to methodology in vwr fig 3 stage 3 utilizing the methodology for development of a conceptual modeling tool for vwr wr vista water resource vulnerability assessment conceptual model using indicators selected by system s thinking approach that is useful in the decision making framework fig 4 we hypothesize that 1 the developed tool using novel systems thinking approaches would support several stakeholders to select and highlight trends in indicators as well as simplify and communicate the complex and complicated information and phenomena within a decision making framework and 2 the compiled characteristics in vulnerability assessments from existing vulnerability assessments wr vista conceptualization as well as a discussion on the information related to using multiple indicators scaling normalization weighting and aggregation methodology and uncertainty would improve conceptualization of vwr assessments and tailor the developed tool for multiple stakeholders the developed tool was demonstrated by application to a case study the high plains region overlying the ogallala aquifer was chosen in this study because it is one of the most productive agricultural regions and called the breadbasket of the world sanderson and frey 2014 additionally this study addresses an important need for assessment of the vulnerability of water resources in the region brought out by a previous study steward et al 2013 2 descriptions of key terms and methodology 2 1 definitions descriptions of key terms used in this study a water resources system is described as the whole made from connected hydrologic infrastructure ecologic and human processes that involve water brown et al 2015 vulnerability is defined as the degree to which the system is susceptible to and is unable to cope with adverse effects of change adger 2006 complex systems involve the collective behavior of a large group of relatively simple elements or agents in which the interactions among these elements typically are local and non linear anandhi 2017 or simply put the whole is more than the sum of its parts ratter 2012 systems thinking focuses on understanding the relationships and feedbacks between the parts to understand the entire system anandhi 2017 caulfield and maj 2001 thereby providing a big picture of the system an indicator can be defined as any variable that indicates the magnitude e g mean seasonal temperature or variability e g standard deviation seasonal rainfall of a parameter alessa et al 2008 or the statistical relationship among variables anandhi 2017 gain et al 2012 finally stakeholders have been defined as individuals or groups with a vested interest in the outcome of a decision or the research project delorme et al 2016 food security is typically defined as when all people at all times have access to sufficient safe nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life glamann et al 2017 2 2 methodology this study s objective was achieved in three stages fig 1 stage 1 translating theoretical concept to charateristics identified from literature fig 2 stage 2 operationalizing charateristics to methodology in vwr fig 3 stage 3 development of a conceptual modeling tool for vwr in a changing climate wr vista fig 4 2 2 1 stage 1 translating theoretical concept to characteristics in vwr the studies on index based methods for vulnerability of water resource assessments were synthesized by identifying the commonality in them fig 2 they were also referred as steps methods procedures and or classification schemes in studies adger et al 2004 tonmoy et al 2014 in this study we referred to them as characteristics of the operational definition of vwr the characteristics we observed from studies on vulnerability in general and vwr in particular were target system system components scale level of detail data source frameworks indicators normalization weights aggregation etc the characteristics were subjective for example the characteristic scale represented spatial temporal scale and could be divided into two classification schemes geographical scale and temporal scale tonmoy et al 2014 target system we observed that in vwr the target system is also referred to as knowledge domain tonmoy et al 2014 unit exposed or system of reference gallopÃ­n 2006 the target system could have an ecological natural biophysical social or socio ecological perspective tonmoy et al 2014 some target systems can be more easily and clearly definable than others allen et al 2007 selected examples of target systems artic alessa et al 2008 ford and smit 2004 and agro ecosystems bÃ¤r et al 2015 system components the target system was divided into one or more components also referred to as parts and the divisions varied with studies for example babel et al 2011 used two main components represented as system s stressors and adaptive capacity brooks 2003 defined two components bio physical and social subsystems tonmoy et al 2014 referred them as socio ecological system ses classification scheme beekman et al 2003 used three components natural physiography socio economic and management components and target systems could be interchangeable scale there can be multiple spatial also referred as geographical scale tonmoy et al 2014 and temporal scales an example of spatial scales household or political boundaries ranging from regional farm or county level babel et al 2011 pandey et al 2011 to global scales national to continent levels hydrology based boundaries alessa et al 2008 or based on ecoregions snelder and biggs 2002 the temporal scales could vary from monthly annual to decadal scales as well as at current and future time studies looking at social components seem to be more focused on current time while studies with biophysical in vwr focused on future scale tonmoy et al 2014 level of detail vwr assessments could have multiple levels of detail they could be based on study objective and resource availability beekman et al 2003 the details in vwr could be classified into three tiers rapid intermediate and comprehensive respectively data sources directly measuring vulnerability is particularly misleading and challenging hinkel 2011 so data on proxy variables were used the data used could be hydrologic socio economic etc data could be from multiple sources such as measured observed modeled or from secondary sources e g federal state and non government organizations as well as information obtained from public participation and discussions with the stakeholder group gain et al 2012 frameworks for vulnerability assessments of water resources multiple conceptual frameworks for vwr assessments exists to address the various aspects of the dual complexity of vwr its multiple uses and resource availability tonmoy et al 2014 selected frameworks were stressor based perveen and james 2011 drivers and moderators based alessa et al 2008 requirement availability based brown and matlock 2011 additional framework also include van der vyver 2013 who estimated using stressors and expressed water stress using water poverty index system characteristics based defined by the ipcc exposure sensitivity adaptive capacity european s driver pressure state impact response dpsir framework many studies used the parts of the frameworks or combined multiple frameworks gain et al 2012 for example babel et al 2011 used a framework with stressors and adaptive capacity while hamouda et al 2009 and xia et al 2016 focused on sensitivity and adaptive capacity ford and smit 2004 focused on exposure and adaptive capacity while brooks 2003 developed vulnerability as a function of exposure sensitivity and social vulnerability pandey et al 2011 defined vulnerability as the ratio between water stress index wsi and adaptive capacity index aci and bÃ¤r et al 2015 combined dpsir with the ipcc s framework they observed that each of the frameworks had its advantages and disadvantages refer to bÃ¤r et al 2015 for a more detailed explanation on some of these frameworks indicator selection in vwr there were several indicators used in vulnerability assessments their choice can be subjective to the study s goals and targets hinkel 2011 the degree of response to changes perveen and james 2011 etc in general indicators could be selected using deductive framework based or theory based or physical relationship based inductive statistical based normative based on value judgements non substantial argument based only on data of the indicating variables approaches adger et al 2004 hinkel 2011 or their combination referred as hybrid approaches detailed discussion of these approaches can be found in adger et al 2004 hamouda et al 2009 gain et al 2012 hinkel 2011 heink and kowarik 2010 and anandhi 2017 many vulnerability studies do not clearly belong to either of the approaches each of the approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages normalization weights and aggregation methods for vwr while constructing the vulnerability index using multiple indicators scientifically sound methods for normalization weighting to specify the correct interrelationships and aggregation to get the right functional relationship are important bÃ¶hringer and jochem 2007 the normalization is to make data comparable when a variety of measurement units in which the indicator variables are expressed ebert and welsch 2004 they are carried out to avoid disproportionalities while combining multiple indicators for example xia et al 2016 used max min normalization the normalized indicators are aggregated using specific formulas and the indicators are assigned weights within the aggregation procedure 2 2 2 stage 2 characteristics to methodology development for vwr in this second stage the eight characteristics identified and discussed in stage 1 were translated to methodology steps for vwr fig 3 to apply the methodology characteristics of the flowchart column 1 fig 3 namely the target system the spatial and temporal scales the level of detail data sources the framework indicators normalization weights and aggregation methods need to be identified an example application of these characteristics for the kansas study region was provided in column 2 of fig 3 the vulnerability index vii from time series data having i time steps was calculated using the ratio in eq 1 1 vi i average value of indicator for a period the actual value of indicator for a year vi 1 indicated negligible vulnerability of the system to external stressors e g climate change and variability vi deviating from 1 vi 1 or vi 1 indicated a higher vulnerability of the system to external stressors the wider the deviation from 1 the greater the stress 2 2 3 stage 3 methodology to conceptual modeling tool for vwr wr vista in the novel conceptual model wr vista fig

dotted spiral within the water drop represented the various internal characteristics e g land use and soil characteristics and processes e g runoff vegetation growth evapotranspiration et that described the target system s adaptive capacity adjustment to stress and sensitivity response to stress they could be divided into multiple components e g water supply systems water distribution systems and span multiple spatial temporal scales for example hydrological processes can span over larger areas with internationally shared rivers and aquifers to smaller scale watersheds while human processes such as water treatment or delivery systems are usually limited to smaller areas of regulation and governance in the figure fig 4 climate change was one of the external stressors represented as cloud thunder snow heat other stressors such as increasing population socio economic growth and associated land cover changes can also be considered depending on how the target system is viewed climate change could be treated as a gradual predictable and continuous change in environmental conditions over time or as the changing occurrence of discrete climatic extreme events such as droughts heat waves or floods butt et al 2016 the external stressors were represented using driver pressure characteristics for example precipitation characteristics such as quantity magnitude frequency intensity rate seasonality etc which impact the water resource availability and supply at multiple spatio temporal scales these drivers social economic environmental exerted pressures on the target system which in turn changed the target system s internal characteristics as a consequence the resulting impacts evoke responses e g political actions or management measures that can affect drivers pressures states or impacts bÃ¤r et al 2015 for example droughts and low flows in many areas of the us indicated that even small changes in drought severity and frequency would have a major impact on the various ecosystem services relating to water resource systems e g drinking water supplies ford et al 2011 the response of the target system to the impacts of external stressors was framed as the ability of the target system to adapt to change knowledge power and resources mediated the set of responses e g political actions management measures and adaptation strategies these involved the characteristics of the target system and stressors the drivers of change and operators of the responses e g policy makers water managers the thick arrows in fig 4 represented the overall flow direction of processes in wr vsta as well as the direction of movement of time in the figure the dotted arrows and flowchart in fig 4 represented the synthesized flowchart incorporated in the conceptual framework detailed methodology is provided in section 4 the observed modeled biotic and abiotic information were used to represent the water resource system s target system and the stressors the target system s internal characteristics adaptive capacity and sensitivity and processes as well its stressor characteristics driver pressure were represented using indicators identified in the conceptual model using systems thinking approaches 3 study region and data used 3 1 study region the developed wr vista model was applied to a case study in kansas which is comprised of 105 counties fig s1 in the supplementary material the region is important in many ways the region has the second highest cropland acreage in the us anandhi et al 2013a the study region is part of the breadbasket of the world or the grain basket of the united states anandhi 2016 and has some of the most productive agricultural lands in the country the corn production land in kansas over lies the high plains ogallala aquifer and the kansas portion has one of the steepest water level declines in the aquifer sanderson and frey 2014 the high plains aquifer is the largest aquifer in the us supplying 70 of the total groundwater and providing 30 of the irrigated water to the country zhang et al 2016 additionally kansas has the highest decrease in ground water level in the aquifer declining water levels in the aquifer affect the agricultural production in the region steward et al 2013 national food production and impact the nation s food security previous studies have indicated changes in the last spring freeze first fall freeze growing season plant phenology warm cold wet dry spells plant failure temperatures and extreme rainfall in the region anandhi 2016 anandhi and blocksome 2017 anandhi et al 2013a rahmani et al 2015 rahmani et al 2014 additionally exposure of the agricultural production in the region to these changes can amplify the vulnerability of hydrological systems anandhi et al 2016b 3 2 data used water resource systems have distinct spatial temporal and physical characteristics because of its complexity and multidisciplinary nature for example the spatial management of these systems involves many stakeholder collaborations e g policy makers researchers citizens producers at different levels of action murgue et al 2015 therefore data collection at common temporal and spatial scales is a big challenge khan et al 2017 multiple spatial e g point watershed scale and temporal scales e g daily annual scale data were used additionally these data were from multiple sources such as measurements e g temperature modeled e g evapotranspiration and secondary sources e g kansas department of agriculture the details of the data used in the case study were provided in table 1 4 results 4 1 application to the case study in stages 1 and 2 translating the theoretical concept to the operational tool for vwr in three stages is demonstrated in the kansas region of the ogallala aquifer high plains aquifer in stage 1 eight characteristics were selected for translation they were target system system components scale level of detail data source frameworks indicators and methods for normalization weights aggregation for the application six steps were used in stage 2 for operationalizing charateristics to methodology in vwr column 2 of fig 3 in this study the water resources system was the chosen target system with mainly biophysical components the data was at several spatial and temporal scales for example streamflow and et were at 8 digit hydrologic unit code huc spatial scale precipitation was the station data at point scale at daily time steps and population data were at county level and annual scale the case study was at an intermediate level of detail using data from several sources e g measurements modeled information and secondary statistics table 1 the wr vista framework was used to select 26 indicators the indicators were selected using a hybrid approach more details in section 4 3 normalization was carried by averaging and aggregated using equal weight and correlation with historical events 4 2 hydrologic model calibration and validation results in the absence of observed measured information on multiple components biophysical social economic combinations model simulations were used in this application runoff et was estimated using the swat model and the plant growth stage was simulated using the heat unit model anandhi 2016 the swat model calibration and validation were carried out on annual average runoff 1965 1985 and annual average actual et 1971 2000 the results were aggregated from the model at the 8 digit huc level for a comparison with the observations statistical measures such as mean standard deviation coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe prediction efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and rsr legates and mccabe 1999 were used to evaluate the model performance of predicting annual runoff and annual actual et if the r2 and nse values were less than or very close to zero the model prediction is considered unacceptable or poor if the values are 1 0 then the model prediction is perfect values greater than 0 6 for r2 and greater than 0 5 for nse less than 25 for pbias and less than 0 7 for rsr were considered acceptable for flow moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 the validation of the swat model was carried out using the guidelines of biondi et al 2012 there was a close correlation between the model predicted annual runoff and the observations except for a few 8 digit hucs this was evident from the patterns of predicted and observed annual runoff as well as the model performance evaluation statistics nse r2 pbias and rsr presented in fig 5 except nse and rsr all of the other model performance evaluation measures suggest an acceptable quality of modeled et with respect to observations in summary the quality of model estimated annual average runoff and et values appear reasonable and acceptable 4 3 application of wr vista stage 3 for identification of indicators in the case study utilizing the wr vista conceptual modeling tool 26 indicators were selected in the case study for vwr to stressors which largely represented changes and variability in temperature and precipitation and to a smaller extent on population change table 2 the application of systems thinking approaches in their selection for the development of wr vista is given below the water resources system target system in kansas includes bio geo physical processes e g elements of the hydrologic cycle runoff evapotranspiration precipitation ecosystem functioning and human processes e g human decisions and actions regarding irrigation with the declining groundwater levels in the ogallala aquifer runoff evaporation evapotranspiration and ground water recharge could be some examples of hydrological processes vegetation growth and development could be examples of the ecological process while those for internal characteristics could be land use and soil characteristics these processes could span over the entire state with a shared hydrology of rivers e g kansas river and aquifers e g ogallala shared across neighboring states e g colorado nebraska human processes such as regarding increasing water demands and declining water supply are usually limited to smaller areas of regulation and governance e g county level groundwater management district 1 3 and 4 levels some of the processes could vary across the water cycles from a larger scale to smaller scales water resource systems in this study were examined from biophysical bp dimensions each of these dimensions in the water resource system could be divided into individual parts some examples include water supply systems and water distribution systems for agricultural and urban water use in the wr vista runoff evapotranspiration stages of plant growth and development and water resource variability wrv were some of the internal processes chosen in the target system we used both inductive and deductive approaches to identify these indicators that represented internal characteristics of the water resource system vegetation plays an import role in the water resource system growing degree days was the indicator used to represent plant growth and development while other indicators such as runoff and evapotranspiration represent the hydrological components of the water cycle the internal characteristics and processes of the water resource systems were represented using adaptive capacity adjustment to stress and sensitivity response to stress to represent the sensitivity of the water resource system to climate change and variability stressor the changes in the target system characteristics runoff and evapotranspiration across time were correlated with the changes in the indicators to represent the response of the target system to external stress fig 6 wrv over a period of years determines the reliability of annual available water resources table s2 in the supplementary material wrv was expressed in percentages variability in rainfall is a key parameter related to agricultural production and water management devineni et al 2013 in managed and natural ecosystems to identify the long term variation of water resources we used the county level coefficient of variation of annual precipitation cv during the 2000 2012 period water resources scarcity wrs indicator equation in the supplementary material or social water stress is the average water available per year per person perveen and james 2011 the water scarcity threshold is subjective to the region society and its affordability the highest vulnerability had a maximum value of water stress 1 the county level per capita water availability for the period of 1985 2010 was calculated it is the total water use both from fresh and saline water sources divided by the population the irrigation coverage represented the extent of water resources used for irrigation a high value indicated more dependence on irrigation and a low value indicated a lower dependence the sensitivity of the water resources system is affected by population density and the area cultivated that is dependent on water resources land use patterns that maintain the integrity of watersheds have a significant influence on surface water resources price et al 2011 and have interactions with drought xia et al 2016 vulnerable groups are more exposed and less capable of adapting to stressors due to limited infrastructure and inputs mcdowell and hess 2012 for example smallholder farmers are often considered particularly vulnerable to climate related food insecurity such as exposure to drought than more commercial farmers who have higher adaptive capacity from that exposure using irrigation narrow yield etc adaptive capacity is necessary to convert natural and social resources into useful adaptation strategies briske et al 2015 for example changes in frost indicators first fall freeze last spring freeze are useful to develop incremental adaptation strategies such as planting earlier harvesting later or systems adaptation such as different crop variety trends in growing degree days gdd are useful to develop adaptation strategies such as irrigation amount and timing water management and selecting crop varieties changes in drought e g spi index and crop growth gdd will support water management more information in translating these indicators to adaptation strategies in agro ecosystems and water management can be obtained from anandhi 2017 and steiner et al 2017 for an application the indicators described in this study can be used as a model by stakeholders e g farmers water managers and decision makers or a completely a new set of indicators can be selected using wr vista framework temperature and precipitation change and to a smaller extent population change were the external stressors considered in this study given the uncertainty of the future climate and other changes consideration for enhancing the robustness of such a decision is warranted we used the hybrid approach for the indicator selection climate was represented using variables such as precipitation and temperature while the population was represented using the number of people for example changes in rainfall and temperature characteristics stressor characteristics impact water resource systems and its internal characteristics and processes as a consequence the resulting impacts evoke responses e g political actions or management measures that can affect drivers pressures states or impacts bÃ¤r et al 2015 climatic processes drive the water resource system processes e g hydrological cycle water temperature snelder and biggs 2002 we incorporated the mean and extreme climate its variability and relevant hydrological elements for ecosystem functioning information the coefficient of variation of precipitation variability in drought mean and extreme precipitation and temperature duration of spells wet dry warm cold growing season length population density and change and proportion of cultivated area dependent on irrigation were some of the indicators selected in this study fig 6 defined in table s2 figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary material they were chosen to represent the variations in stressor characteristics the magnitude of the pressure and intensity of the drivers of water resource system processes many of these indicators represented the stresses of extreme climate impacting land use e g agriculture irrigation water use e g irrigation and processes in water cycle e g et runoff some of these indicators represented the variability in precipitation a key parameter related to runoff agricultural production and water management devineni et al 2013 while others represented the prolonged periods with precipitation and temperature extremes e g wet dry spells frost these have many ecological and hydrological consequences such as implications on the water cycle changes in the growing season crop growth and yield milk production in livestock and reproductive capabilities of farm animals anandhi et al 2016a changes in frost indices impact the hydrological and energy cycles by changing the patterns in et and streamflow and the frequency of drought anandhi et al 2013b changes in precipitation and et may cause annual runoff to change additionally changes in temperature are expected to change the hydrology of the region by decreasing the precipitation falling as snow shifting the timing of snowmelt and the streamflow resulting from snow melt to occur earlier in the spring or in late winter which eventually changes the magnitude of streamflow warming and drying are expected to modify vegetation composition and land surface cover including an increase in the density and cover of woody plants in the region briske et al 2015 very few indicators representing the social unit are chosen in this study the density of population is one of them it is the number of people per square mile and represented the population centers in kansas indirectly the land use a higher value indicated the presence of a relatively bigger city and a lower value indicated a rural setting an index of the cultivated area under irrigation was developed to identify the dependence of agriculture on water resources 4 4 vulnerability results estimated in the case study using the developed tool our results indicate that vulnerability components in the wr vista model exposure driver pressure stressors sensitivity adaptive capacity state impact and response are not static but change over time and space these changes were translated to changes in the vulnerability indicators and observed from the red shaded portion obtained from the time series in fig 6 and synthesized in table 2 the correlation of the indicators to the region runoff and evapotranspiration for the period 1971 2000 were plotted in fig s3 in supplementary material while the spatial variation were potted at a county level in fig 6 time series of the indices estimated in the study using eq 1 and the indicator description provided in table s2 in the supplementary material mean values of selected indicators obtained from 105 counties in kansas are discussed in this section as spatial plots fig 6 understanding adaptation to multiple stressors allows us to address the complexity of vulnerability mcdowell and hess 2012 from the time series plot of the exposure indicators across kansas we observed the degree of stress varied with the indicator and time period in fig s2 in supplementary material a greater spread of the shaded portion indicated greater spatial variability the hills and valleys in the plot indicated higher vulnerability of the indicators the higher the peaks of the hills and valleys the greater the vulnerability observed by higher deviation of the index from 1 for example in kansas the 1930s and 1950s had high vulnerability and served as benchmarks for severe climate stressed periods although the spatial dimensions of both the 1930s and 1950s droughts were different the vulnerability varied with the indicator as seen by the different y axis in the sub plots indicators that represent the mean stressor and target system characteristics e g average annual precipitation pptn maximum minimum and average temperature tmax tmin tave have smaller vulnerability indices when compared to the indicators representing extremes the sensitivity of the indicators to evapotranspiration and runoff also varied with indicators no one indicator showed a strong sensitivity to evapotranspiration and runoff this was observed from a five year moving average of the time series plot of evapotranspiration and runoff for the 1971 2000 time period were shown for the various indicators selected in this study fig s3 in supplementary material the shaded portion in the figure represents the 95th and 5th percentile values of the indicators in each year the solid bold black line in the middle of the shaded portion represents the median value for each year in this study the simple probabilistic approach 95th and 5th percentile values was used to represent the sensitivity the results can be more reliable if more advanced uncertainty analysis methods are used biondi et al 2012 similarly observed values of streamflow evapotranspiration at the location of the stressors can provide more reliable sensitivity results the wrv is provided in fig 6 and its variability is more in central kansas wrv a function of the coefficient of rainfall is a key parameter that represents agricultural production its water management especially for rain fed agriculture the western kansas regions with higher wrv overlie the high plains aquifer and also have the highest market value for agriculture in the nation steward et al 2013 changes in precipitation and temperature observed in the region anandhi 2016 anandhi et al 2013a rahmani et al 2014 would increase the wrv in the region this in turn would increase the region s exposure to climate change ground water use for irrigation buffers the variability in precipitation for agriculture devineni et al 2013 and domestic water use stresses the region s already declining ground water levels in the aquifer the counties in western kansas had a higher area under irrigation fig 6b declining water levels was predicted to cut agricultural production in the region steward 2014 thereby decreasing their adaptive capacity and increasing the vwr in the region the wrs map is provided in fig 6c and the scarcity was more in eastern kansas when compared to western kansas in this study wrs is a function of water availability and social water stress which in turn was a function of the population in the region counties in eastern kansas had increased urbanization in the last few decades applegate et al 2003 with a higher population density fig 6d no clear patterns in population change were observed fig 6e the wrs was higher in this part of kansas even though they have higher rainfall and higher surface water availability when compared to the western part of the state 5 discussion 5 1 indicator selection and systems thinking approaches there is extensive literature on various indicators relating to the ecological biophysical socio economic and political dimensions that underlie vwr ecological biophysical indicators measure impacts of water resource and use on the environmental domain while the socioeconomic indicators measure fiscal or societal effects of water resource lane et al 1999 system thinking approaches were used in this study to develop the tool figs 1 4 the introduction of systems thinking has had major benefits in the world of change and has also been a powerful stimulus to the development of an understanding of the natural systems allowing an integration of disciplines rÃ¶ling 1997 while recognizing that extensive literature exists in applying systems thinking approaches to various applications e g agriculture van keulen and schiere 2004 to the knowledge of the authors hardly any studies have applied systems thinking to vulnerability assessments of water resources in the past anandhi et al 2016b had used the systems thinking approach for one component of vulnerability exposure for a different target system agriculture than this study hard and soft thinking are the two extremes of system thinking the hard system thinking is based on deductive thinking while soft system thinking focuses on mindsets van keulen and schiere 2004 which are highly dependent on context and purpose in hard thinking the system is perceived with boundaries e g time and space rÃ¶ling 1997 inputs and outputs and using coded variables e g indicators examples of spatial boundaries include political county state hydrological watershed river basin while decadal and annual could be temporal boundaries an example of inputs could be rain and outputs could be streamflow evapotranspiration etc these approaches are used to characterize entities and areas concerned with alternatives and to assess the impacts of the alternatives by using indicators for example such as water volume withdrawn for irrigation hard thinking approaches provide quantitative and stable information ensuring the saliency of inputs outputs in contrast soft thinking approaches perceived the systems with highly fuzzy boundaries inputs and outputs rÃ¶ling 1997 these approaches could be used for interacting with stakeholders and designing change options under investigation which ensures the legitimacy of the process because it avoids the black box effect murgue et al 2015 examples could include perceptions of vulnerability stress exposure etc the fuzziness could be that each stakeholder understands the complex system according to his her own interests activities and management strategies murgue et al 2015 therefore combining both hard and soft thinking when selecting elements hybrid approach can be challenging but it provides support in explaining the complexity of the system anandhi 2017 salerno et al 2010 5 2 adaptation of the developed tool for multiple stakeholders the study goals and objectives the characteristics stage 1 methods stage 2 and indicator selection using wr vista conceptualizations stage 3 depends on the water use stakeholder requirement and their he resource availability our description of the assessment of vwr is presented in stepwise fashion recognizing that various scientific and social processes will likely proceed simultaneously and many need to be repeated iteratively while recognizing the existence of an extensive literature on various characteristics which underlined vwr for various stressors there is subjectivity in selecting the eight characteristics from stage 1 of this study in this stage the number of characteristics used in a study could be modified in a way that is beneficial to stakeholder and their water use e g for domestic agricultural industrial use used as a sustainer of ecosystems or viewed as a hazard characteristics could be added removed and or split e g scale to spatial and temporal scales in this study we were interested in the application of the proposed framework for an intermediate level of detail using a few selected indicators for simplicity in the future by utilizing the 3 stage framework a user stakeholder could choose steps figs 1 4 and indicators to develop the conceptual model we believe that depending on the available resources and the need stakeholders are likely to adapt this tool including the wr vista model for vwr assessment for various stressors depending on the study goals and objectives the definitions of target system and components could be interchangeable a target system could be a component of a larger system at the same time the component could be a system with smaller components the choice of indicators for representation of the processes and internal and external characteristics for these assessments could also vary an elaborate discussion on indicators for ecology and environmental planning can be found in heink and kowarik 2010 hamouda et al 2009 categorized the indicators into hydro physical indicators and socio economic or political nature depending on the availability of data and resources the vulnerability assessments could be carried out at multiple levels of detail for example in the short term changes in temperature had the potential to change plant water use via transpiration and evaporation and hence change the rainfall runoff ratio or groundwater recharge in the longer term changes in temperature could produce shifts in species distributions e g a shift from deciduous to evergreen forests which was likely to result in changed water use due to changed year round transpiration and interception ford et al 2011 other hydrological models as well as crop and biogeochemical model outputs could be used to simulate processes and characteristics of the target system and its components additional indicators to represent the adaptive capacity that encompasses the ability to recognize and manage risk plan and implement adaptation strategies display financial and emotional flexibility described in the section below and even exhibit awareness of climate change and the need for adaptation could be added the current study did not include the comprehensive list of indicators that could be potentially used for the study region because the framework does not attempt to provide optimal solutions in the traditional decision analytic sense instead using only a few indicators in vwr at an intermediate level of detail the approach was described identifying indicator s is an important component in vwr assessments we recommend systems thinking approaches to identify region specific indicators based on expert and local knowledge through discussion with stakeholders e g water managers extension specialists etc also indicators could be selected based on a literature review or available data indicator identification exercise is difficult because each stakeholder understands this complex water resource system according to his her interests activities and management strategies for example agricultural practices vary from an agricultural viewpoint where they are the result of decisions of individual farming systems involved in socio professional networks while from the viewpoint of water managers the practices are considered at the river basin level 5 3 adaptation of the developed tool for other stressors our description of the assessment of vwr is presented in stepwise fashion recognizing that various other stressors will likely to impact them the same procedure could be repeated iteratively or simultaneously for other indicators stressors as well with the emerging scientific consensus that the global population was likely to exceed 9 billion people by 2050 gerland et al 2014 most of the increasing population will be in cities of the world urbanization and population growth can be potential stressors in the context of climate change and other stressors physical stressors may determine the physical quantity or quality of the water resource however the ability to benefit from such water depends on a broader set of abilities or access mechanisms such as technologies landscape configurations social capital violence or theft mcdowell and hess 2012 some region specific stressors are that the area under forests and wetlands can be used as the natural capacity parameter to indicate the ecosystem state a higher value of the indicator indicates a more natural state or less human interventions thus suggesting less vulnerable water resources system physical capacity can be represented using indicators such as the area covered by irrigation with drinking water supply or industrial use the area covered with drinking water represents the percentage of the population with access to improved water supply the industrial coverage indicates industrial development area with water supply higher coverage indicates better physical infrastructures and financial resources the literacy rate and economically active population indicators are considered to represent the socio economic capacity a higher literacy rate suggests a relatively better awareness and ability to understand water related issues it may in due course steer the people to cope with a variety of water related stresses and thereby increasing the adaptive capacity of the water resources system the economically active population is another indicator the age of working people a higher economically active population reflects a higher flexibility to adapt to the new conditions living patterns under increased stresses in the water resource system this indicator is not used in this study due to a higher literacy rate in the region 5 4 potential uncertainties in wr vista uncertainty in wr vista can arise from many sources that can be grouped into three categories model uncertainty scenario uncertainty and measurement uncertainty some model uncertainties arise due to insufficient knowledge indicator fatigue scoring framework and weighing uncertainty due to insufficient knowledge arises when a few criteria were assessed due to limited knowledge about the abstract components or from assumptions or limitations of simplified models describing complex processes such as the models describing future climate conditions or the algorithms describing components of water cycle climate relationships studies have shown that changes in climate have important implications on the water availability to understand the entire target system it was necessary to examine the individual components and the interrelationships among them allen et al 2007 the vulnerability indicators in the wr vista model were used as one or more proxy variables to represent abstract components namely exposure driver pressure stressors sensitivity adaptive capacity state impact and response depending on the stakeholder s judgment the scope location of the study and the question to be answered the indicators or sets of indicators in wr vista would differ from study to study the model can accommodate different units of analysis if not adequately integrated it will result in indicator fatigue this is due to missing of important variables co linearity lack of accounting for interactions feedbacks situation specific normative judgments of researchers and users knowledge malone and engle 2011 the scoring uncertainty occurs when an expert feels that more than one value is equally likely to represent the vulnerability of the target system and weighting uncertainty occurs when one or two criteria contribute disproportionately to the vulnerability or value score reece and noss 2014 for a component weighting is to specify the correct interrelationships bÃ¶hringer and jochem 2007 to appropriate parameters this study did not weigh constituent indicators differently because it was difficult to determine the order of importance of constituent indicators and parameters for example we had difficulty determining if precipitation change is more important than surface water change in vwr assessments equal weight method is recommended for applications where there is no sufficient expert knowledge or information on indicators while using equal weight method use caution because the vulnerability index can be highly influenced by dominating indicators anandhi 2016 in the past different indicators have been weighted differently with some indicators given greater importance than others baettig et al 2007 previously weights were assigned using expert judgment or statistical analysis such as geometric mean principal component correlation fuzzy logic or econometrically anandhi et al 2016b bhattacharya and das 2007 bÃ¶hringer and jochem 2007 deressa et al 2008 simelton et al 2009 aggregation is to get the right functional relationship bÃ¶hringer and jochem 2007 the functional relationship could involve known scientific relationships among variables e g hydrological models growing degree days indicator to represent plant growth stage and its water use experts could be consulted in a rather open discussion process and statistical relationships among variables choosing normalization methods and weightings will in general be associated with subjective judgments bÃ¶hringer and jochem 2007 some of the selected indicators may require the definition of thresholds see section 4 2 the thresholds or values indicated acceptable conditions and standards they provided a measure on whether or not the indicators contributed significantly to vulnerability the critical values of some indicators proposed in the literature falkenmark and widstrand 1992 can be used while others need to be estimated based on the prevailing conditions in the study area uncertainty in how we are defining the target system and its components because the terms target system and components can be interchangeable a target system could be a component of a larger system at the same time the component could be a system with smaller components the choice of indicators in wr vista could be region specific more details in the next sub section the estimated indicators from observed and modeled biotic and abiotic information were aggregated using eq 1 for determining vwr in wr vista incorporating mean and extreme climate its variability and relevant bio geo physical processes relevant hydrological elements ecosystem functioning information and human processes are useful but complicated omitting them will almost certainly lead to incomplete understanding and should be taken up or addressed in comprehensive vulnerability analyses butt et al 2016 scenario uncertainty arose when the indicators were chosen to attempt to capture the range of uncertainty in vulnerability assessments in space and time although the true range of the uncertainty remains unknown these indicated how vulnerable current conditions are and future conditions might be the variation in the indicators provide a range of scenarios and presents the stakeholders with difficult choices for example the ranges might include one scenario where no action is necessary and another where very costly investments are necessary planning for either of the above mentioned sceanarios could result in considerable potential regrets given the limited resources typically associated with addressing some of the extreme case scenarios a water manager is unlikely to be comfortable committing resources by a single or small number of scenarios brown et al 2012 measurement uncertainty arises from imprecision or errors in obtaining data and can occur when geographic coordinates of observations are recorded or transcribed incorrectly or alternative climate datasets use different weather stations time periods and interpolation techniques to create climate maps watling et al 2015 use of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis can assist in identifying the gaps and check the robustness thereby further enhancing the transparency and credibility of the tool singh et al 2012 5 5 water resource vulnerability and societal impacts vulnerability assessments on water resources are powerful analytical tools for describing states of risk powerlessness the marginality of systems and for guiding actions to enhance prosperity through mitigation of risk adger 2006 against various stressors besides they show where unsustainability may be the most likely bÃ¤r et al 2015 these assessments can provide decision makers with credible and transparent parameters to identify priority needs and justify their actions harley et al 2008 they provide planners with insights on focus areas to reduce the system s vulnerability hamouda et al 2009 and options to formulate new water resource management policies as well as evaluate modify and improve existing ones babel et al 2011 unep 2011 these assessments support building internal linkages of water resource vulnerability and adaptation allan et al 2013 which are critical for management of aquifer sustainability in light of potential global climate change gurdak et al 2007 agriculture is the largest single user of water with about 75 of the world s freshwater being currently used for irrigation qadir et al 2007 this leads to an intrinsic relationship between the renewable water resources and the capacity for food production yang et al 2003 water availability is one of the main limiting factors for food production kang et al 2009 with a world population that is expected to grow from current level to about 6 9 9 2 billion by 2050 as well as changing lifestyles and consumption patterns global demand for food is projected to increase by 70 110 by 2050 delzeit et al 2017 future projections of increasing population as well as the changes in the crop s growing season length due to increasing minimum temperature would exacerbate the existing demand for water together they will create unprecedented stress on water and food demand and supply thus impacting food security vwr will describe states of risk of food and water systems in an altered climate they will support the identification of these systems powerlessness as well as guide actions that enhance prosperity through risk mitigation against various stressors therefore understanding the water resource system and its vulnerability to stressors such as changing temperature and precipitation are vital to secure and increase world food production to feed its growing population anandhi 2016 we deliberately provide only cursory treatment of the social and policy challenges inherent in gaining the adoption and implementation of vwr assessments we expect that other authors with expertise in water policy and the social sciences will offer their perspectives on the need and challenges associated with effectively implementing our methodology in a variety of social and governance contexts vulnerability is a dynamic phenomenon with dynamic processes biophysical economical social and combinations that shape local conditions also the ability of the water resource system to cope is also dynamic measuring vulnerability is also a challenge because it is often not a directly observable phenomenon and so the vwr assessments are difficult to validate it is also a difficult complex concept with inherent difficulties for quantifying it therefore proxy variables or indicators were used in vwr assessment or modeling and are often used in environmental and social studies the symbolic representation of vwr framework developed in this study can be useful in developing desirable proxy indicators given the uncertainty of future climate and other changes consideration for enhancing the robustness of such a decision is warranted 6 conclusion water is critical for human survival everywhere but especially in the study region the high plains region overlying the ogallala aquifer because it is considered one of the most productive agricultural regions the breadbasket of the world increasing demand on the limited resource of water can make it vulnerable to climate and land cover changes thereby creating a need for vulnerability assessments the overall goal and objective of this study was to develop tools to address stakeholders need for assessment of vulnerability of water resources to climate change and variability the tool could assist them with planning and decision making decision support is hard not only because long term prediction is hard but also because creating decision relevant processes from available information is hard this was carried out in three stages using indicators selected by novel systems thinking approaches stage 1 translating theoretical concept to charateristics identified from literature stage 2 operationalizing charateristics to methodology in vwr stage 3 utilizing the methodology for development of a conceptual modeling tool for vwr wr vista water resource vulnerability assessment conceptual model using indicators selected by system s thinking approach useful in decision making framework the wr vista model was developed in one of the three stages and presented in this study the development of wr vista utilized the several important characteristics of vwr synthesized in this study from the literature review fig 2 we adapted gallopÃ­n 2006 generic framework of vulnerability for water resources system additionally we modified bÃ¤r et al 2015 flowchart originally developed for agricultural water resources vulnerability combining dpsir ipcc frameworks to the generic framework and anandhi et al 2016b framework originally developed for a single component exposure of agricultural production to changing variable climate to include multiple components the novelty of the theoretical framework in wr vista is the representation of multiple components driver pressure state impact response exposure sensitivity adaptive capacity and processes using indicators to explain the critical elements of vwr the application of the study region is important because it overlies the high plains aquifer which supplies 30 of the nation s irrigated groundwater and produces agricultural products worth 35 billion market value we selected and estimated 26 indicators to study the vwr in kansas our results showed in a changing environment an increased vulnerability in the western part of the state for agriculture while in the eastern part an increased vulnerability was observed for urban water use the indicators used in this study demonstrate the framework and may may not be suitable for all applications of vwr the wr vista framework can be applied by multiple stakeholders to identify indicators for vwr assessments the framework does not attempt to provide optimal solutions in the traditional decision analytic sense instead the approach identifies the best decision conditional on the weight of the indicator based evidence using a more sophisticated approach for assigning the weights and including multiple socio economic indicators which measure fiscal or societal effects of water resource for vwr differs for future work the changes in future climate projections from global climate models can be applied to estimate the change in vwr and are deferred for future work acknowledgements this material is based upon work partially supported from the usda national institute of food and agriculture s evans allen project

7504,recent observations indicate that over the last decades climate change has increasingly influenced the frequency intensity and duration of extreme climatic and hydrologic events the main aim of this study is to determine the hydrologic response especially the flood evolution of the lena river in eastern siberia to ongoing climate change draining the coldest region of the northern hemisphere the lena river is impacted by global warming which is particularly pronounced in periglacial areas characterized by deep and continuous permafrost we document the hydrologic variability of the middle lena river first by characterizing trend and stationarity of monthly discharges second we analyze on the basis of the peak over threshold method pot the temporal evolution of intensity and duration of three discharge classes bar full discharge bank full discharge and large floods finally we also determined the dates of the flood beginning and of the flood peak data on mean monthly discharge and flood peaks are available since 1936 and daily discharges since 1954 our results provide evidence for a net hydrologic change with an increase in the intensity and duration of floods in the two decades ending in 2012 the frequency of high floods is unprecedented and small floods no longer occur the tail of the temporal distribution of the flood peak is also changing more frequent early floods are occurring in spring with secondary flood peaks in summer the latest probably represents the most striking change furthermore the changes have been accelerating since 2004 finally two islands were instrumented 2008 2012 in order to study the flooding dynamics with a better precision keywords flood peak over threshold climatic change eastern siberia 1 introduction numerous publications recently reported important hydrologic changes in arctic and sub arctic rivers related to climate change bennett et al 2015 berezovskaya et al 2005 dÃ©ry et al 2009 dÃ©ry and wood 2005 peterson et al 2002 serreze et al 2002 shiklomanov et al 2007 woo et al 2008 ye et al 2009 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 arctic hydrologic cycles are intensifying due to the increase in air temperature and atmospheric moisture and hence in precipitation fedorov et al 2014 fukutomi et al 2004 iijima et al 2016 yang et al 2002 zhang et al 2012 increasing solid precipitation in winter is also well documented over northern europe and asia bring and destouni 2013 bulygina et al 2009 rawlins et al 2009 stieglitz et al 2003 tan et al 2011 watson et al 2013 yang et al 2002 and winter and or spring runoff have been shown to be positively correlated with winter precipitation over extensive regions in the arctic snowmelt on frozen ground together with earlier thawing tends to increase runoff rather than infiltration berezovskaya et al 2005 brabets and walvoord 2009 peterson et al 2002 rawlins et al 2009 watson et al 2013 yang et al 2004 ye et al 2009 future projections suggest that an earlier 0 c isotherm in spring will have a major impact on the water discharge of large arctic rivers in the 2050 s prowse et al 2010 recent studies highlight the enhancement of poleward moisture transport and storm activity in summer iijima et al 2016 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 in the coldest arctic regions the fluvial regime of periglacial hydrosystems depends to a great extent on permafrost characteristics the extent temperature and depth of the active layer the contribution of underground water and talik etc beltaos 2000 osterkamp 2005 2 rowland et al 2010 woo et al 2008 ye et al 2009 over the course of the year the arctic fluvial regime combines a long low water stage in winter because of the limited contribution of underground water and brief and often brutal flooding in spring both features depending on interactions between the permafrost and the temperature permafrost areas are very sensitive to warming in alaska the warming average was around 1 c but reached 3 4 c in the arctic coastal plain osterkamp 2005 in eastern siberia permafrost temperature already underwent an increase up to 1 c over the course of the 20th century fedorov and konstantinov 2003 and an increase in warming has been observed since the beginning of the 21st century fedorov et al 2014 in the lena basin an increase up to 4 c is projected for the period 2040 2069 under the warm wet a2 scenario bring and destouni 2013 a general long term increase in mean annual discharge has been observed in many siberian rivers including the lena river shiklomanov et al 2006 as many long arctic and sub arctic hydrosystems are oriented south north they are affected by different climatic influences the contribution of the snowmelt water decreases downstream and the influence of the permafrost and its associated active layer takes over in the 1960 2001 period n kichigina 2013 examined the hydrological changes in the upper basin of the lena river before and after the climate change 1960 1979 and 1980 2005 and reported intra annual redistribution of runoff kichigina 2013 as the regime is dominated by the supply of snowmelt water the upper lena river is witnessing a marked increase in winter because of less freezing and early snowmelt downstream in eastern siberia the middle lena river reflects the influence of its upper basin but also the strong influence of the deep continuous permafrost and the seasonal thawing of the active layer in yakutia permafrost covers more than 80 of the area and it is an ice rich permafrost 40 80 of ice content soloviev 1973 consequently the monthly ratio of maximum to minimum water discharge increases downstream correlated with the permafrost cover of the basin ye et al 2009 since the 1980s there has been actually a moderate increase in the mean annual discharge of the middle lena river 3 but the supply of water increased markedly at the end of winter and in early spring 22 23 in march and april gautier et al 2008 yang et al 2002 the 10 increase in downstream lena river discharge from 1936 to 2001 was mainly due to large scale atmospheric change and to the impact of the large dams built on a major tributary viliuy r of the lower lena river berezovskaya et al 2005 the temperature of the lena river also directly reflects the temperature of the air and the temperature of the stream has been much warmer since the 1980 s than before 3 23 c in july 1 72 c in june and 1 05 c in may costard et al 2007 the fluvial regime of the arctic rivers is immoderate with very low flow during winter and a spring flood characterized by a steep rising limb and a peak discharge that can exceed by ten times the winter discharge because of their south north course the flood wave generated by the snowmelt in the upper basin arrives in still frozen areas creating a specific river process called river outburst the outburst causes a very rapid rise in water level with the dislocation of the river ice cover on the river during the winter flooding ice jams and brutal ice breaks are common features of the breakup even if their intensity varies greatly costard et al 2014 distinguished two main phases during the spring flood i the breakup sensu stricto of the ice cover with subsequent ice jams that usually correspond to the rising limb of the hydrograph and ii overbank flooding following the sudden rise in the water level the extreme hydrologic events vary with natural climatic variability large scale atmospheric changes causing wet and dry cycles on artic rivers berezovskaya et al 2005 however shiklomanov et al 2007 compiled data on daily river discharge from 139 gauging stations distributed across the russian arctic examined spring maximum discharge and found no widespread significant change in spring maximum discharge except for the lena river which showed a general positive trend between 1940 and 2001 however identifying the factors that drive hydrologic changes in these very large basins remains challenging recently bennett et al 2015 underlined the lack of long term high quality continuous records of streamflow available for in depth analysis bennett et al 2015 for this reason we aim to detail the hydrologic reaction of the lena river to global warming since the first part of the 20th century more precisely the present paper examines changes in water discharges and flood events in the middle lena river in eastern siberia water discharge data are compiled for a period of 76 years with longer time series 1936 2012 than the previous studies yang et al 2002 peterson et al 2002 shiklomanov and lammers 2009 we are able to analyze long term changes and focus on very recent changes the analysis of daily and monthly discharge helps define important hydrologic changes that could have a major impact on the river bed we describe changes in flooding in terms of the date the duration and the intensity of hydrologic events we examine three discharge thresholds bar full level bank full level and large floods and investigated the intensity duration and distribution of these discharges over time the precise flooding process is also analyzed on two instrumented islands 2008 2012 2 study area the lena river is one of the longest rivers in the arctic it is 4 400 km long and drains a 2 49 106 km2 basin at kusur station in terms of discharge the lena river is the second biggest supplier of water to the arctic oceans with 525 257 km3 per year just after the yenisei river 581 603 km3 and well before the mackenzie 333 km3 antonov 1960 gordeev and sidorov 1993 shiklomanov et al 2006 our study area is located in the upper part of the middle lena river near yakutsk 62 01 37 n 129 43 57 e fig 1 where the active floodplain widens after a long course through a narrow valley fig 1a the river takes on a multiple channel pattern fig 1 with numerous channels surrounding large barren sand bars and islands entirely covered by a willow forest gautier and costard 2000 costard et al 2014 our field observations lasted from 2008 to 2012 program agence nationale de la recherche climaflu the aim was to quantify erosion and sedimentation on river islands the two islands that were instrumented and surveyed 2008 2012 are located upstream eselyakh 12 km and timochka 5 km upstream of tabaga gauging station fig 1a the islands themselves are composed of fluvial deposits colonized by perennial alluvial vegetation 3 data and methods 3 1 hydrologic data the study combined different approaches the first was the analysis of monthly and daily hydrologic data water discharge data were compiled for 76 years at tabaga gauging site 61 47 38 48 n 129 40 4 70 e fig 1 which is located at the beginning of the middle lena floodplain and drains the upper lena basin 897 000 km2 the tabaga site represents the influences of a quasi pristine basin without large dam in its upper reach which is why we preferred tabaga over kusur station where the influence of the large dams installed on the viliuy river can be detected we analyzed the hydrologic year books available at the permafrost institute at yakutsk for the 1937 2012 period mean monthly discharge and the maximum stage are available since 1937 daily discharges are also available since 1954 we reconstructed maximum water discharges on the basis of a rating curve for the period 1937 1954 according to a previous precise study of water discharge uncertainty in cold regions shiklomanov et al 2006 the greatest error in daily discharge is observed during winter because of the ice cover so large uncertainties are calculated during low water stage varying between 5 and 25 for the lena river at kusur the error represents 20 during the minimal water stage period winter and 4 5 during the high water stage spring and summer shiklomanov et al 2006 for this reason the russian hydrologic survey calculates a correction coefficient for the discharge on rivers that have a stable ice cover during the winter thus the same uncertainty can be assumed for tabaga gauging station 3 2 multi decadal analysis of water discharge first we calculated the mean monthly discharge particularly for the spring and summer seasons may september we used long term trend analysis to identify changes and the mann kendall test to determine the statistical significance of the changes we also used the pettitt test a non parametric one performed for testing the null hypothesis that there is no break in a series against the alternative that a stepwise shift in the mean is present second we focused on the high water level and the flooding period with an appropriate peak over threshold pot method also called partial duration series on daily discharges may september the peak over threshold method developed by lang et al 1999 can be adapted to different environments dÃ©pret et al 2015 gob et al 2016 gu et al 2016 and enables the determination of flood maxima and the calculation of flood duration the method consists of retaining the discharge peaks that exceed a given threshold or base level thereby enabling a more rational selection of events to be considered as floods lang et al 1999 103 the first step is to check if two successive events are separated or not two events are identified if they are separated by at least five days plus the natural logarithm of the basin area in miles2 i e 18 days for the lena river at tabaga gauging site 5 ln 346333 6 mi2 or if the discharge between the two peaks drops below 75 of the lowest of the two peaks to select threshold levels we used an approach based on the identification of different water levels in the river the thresholds were determined based on our in situ observations during the study years and according to data from the hydrologic survey of the sakha republic the first discharge with 20 000 m3 s 1 corresponds to the submersion of the entire width of the active bed composed of all active channels and barren sandy bars which is considered as a bar full discharge according to the study conducted by biedenharn and thorne 1994 on the mississippi river the bar full stage has a geomorphic effect on the river bed by transporting a large load of sediment biedenharn and thorne 1994 second the discharge of 30 000 m3 s 1 corresponds to the mean bank full discharge for the study reach the hydrologic survey of the sakha republic considers that population alerts about flooding should begin at 8 m at tabaga a level that corresponds to approximately 31 000 32 000 m3 s 1 the third discharge threshold 40 000 m3 s 1 i e a height of 9 m at yakutsk is considered as a major flood hence the three discharge classes analyzed were i between 20 000 and 30 000 m3 s 1 ii between 30 000 and 40 000 m3 s 1 and iii above 40 000 m3 s 1 the duration was measured based on the number of days in a given discharge class two dates in the hydrologic year were also examined the first day of bar full level in spring considering that it expresses the beginning of the flood season and the date of the peak flow 3 3 analysis of the in situ flooding process 2008 2012 it was not possible to make direct measurements on floodplain and islands during floods thus two islands timochka and eselyakh fig 1 were equipped 2008 2012 i first flood duration and water height were directly measured on the two islands with temperature sensors thermo buttons 0 5 c accuracy progesplus willems france the thermo buttons were installed on different trees at 0 5 m intervals from the soil surface to a height of 4 m the temperature was recorded at 3 hourly intervals from the end of april until october fig 2 comparing the temperature measured by the buttons with the temperature of the river water and with the air temperature made it possible to determine the level of submersion when the inundation occurs the temperature of the lowest submerged button 0 5 m suddenly changes and differs from the upper thermo buttons that are not inundated the upper button 1m that can be submerged few hours after will show the same evolution by that mean it is possible to have a good appreciation of the water height on islands with a 50 cm uncertainty during the flooding the data were of course compared with the discharge data provided by tabaga gauging station ii since water temperature plays an important role in the thermal erosion of the frozen banks temperature data are also analyzed and compared for each flood the detailed timing of the flood on the lena river was also recorded each year from a relatively high terrace in the lena floodplain using wide angle and high resolution optical instruments every spring from 2008 to 2013 photographs were taken to evaluate the level of ice and water on the two islands costard et al 2014 4 results 4 1 major increase in mean annual and monthly discharge the hydrograph of the middle lena river is highly representative of a periglacial and high latitude continental area where permafrost plays a major role the main annual hydrologic features since 1937 are listed in table 1 and mean monthly discharge per decade is shown in fig 3 with a low mean annual discharge around 7200 m3 s 1 at tabaga the lena river has a weak specific discharge 7 8 l s 1 km 2 reflecting the low contribution of underground water from october to the end of april the river goes through a long low water stage and is covered by ice between 200 and 250 days fig 3 the hydrologic year is dominated by rapid flooding and breakup that occurs around the middle of may the rising limb of the flood is most of the time very steep discharge can be multiplied by a factor of 10 in a single day the flood peak sometimes reaches 40 000 50 000 m3 s 1 at tabaga the flood wave coming from the upper part of the basin located in the prebaÃ¯kal mountains propagates across the floodplain and active channels that are still frozen the flood wave arrives in eastern siberia between may 15th and may 30th the breakup and subsequent overbank flooding are highly variable in may the initial breakup of the ice cover on the river which can be very short and brutal is followed by overbank flooding more rarely the rising limb is gentler because of a progressive arrival of the upstream flood the water level drops from july to october with a plateau in august and september due to late summer storms a secondary peak created by intense rainfall can occur in summer the mean annual discharge for the whole 1936 2012 period was around 7200 m3 s 1 7210 m3 s 1 for 1936 2012 and 7212 m3 s 1 for 1960 1990 the standard period it increased by 22 7 after 2004 i e a mean discharge of 8846 m3 s 1 for the 2005 2012 period from 2006 to 2009 the average annual discharge exceeded 9200 m3 s 1 records for 1983 and 2012 showed a mean annual discharge of 10 500 and 10 200 m3 s 1 respectively table 1 mean monthly discharges have increased significantly in recent decades fig 3 the mann kendall test revealed a positive tendency for several months in winter november to january and in summer june and september p value 5 winter and spring discharges were characterized by a significant increase after the late 1980 s especially at the end of winter and spring 21 4 and 16 6 in may and june respectively for example the mean discharge in may increased significantly pettitt s test after 1995 positive anomalies were recorded for monthly discharge in may except 2003 2004 every year since 1996 was positive from the end of spring to the end of summer hydrologic changes were less pronounced 4 8 7 the reinforced trend was quite clear in the last period 2006 2012 fig 3 after 2006 the mean annual discharge was 31 higher than in the previous period this increase was mainly due to the increase in april and may 44 7 and 43 8 respectively and in late summer and autumn august to october 22 to 33 the monthly discharge in the last period is easy to distinguish from the previous periods i e before 2006 as it was above the other periods in almost all the months fig 3 the recent hydrologic change is also reflected in the increased frequency of positive anomalies one period of positive anomalies is observed from 1958 to 1963 however 14 positive anomalies were recorded in the 20 years preceding 2012 and there was one positive anomaly every year after 2006 fig 4 furthermore very marked positive anomalies were recorded exceeding 130 a value that was not registered between 1936 and 1982 4 2 changes in the flooding regime 4 2 1 recent changes in flood peaks the great majority of flood peaks occurs in may and june associated with the flood wave coming from the upper basin and with the local break up the floods present generally a steep rising limb type r for rapid table 1 and more rarely a progressive flood rising limb type p table 1 a steep rising limb generally implies a brutal break up and a flood peak in may but it does not necessarily imply a high magnitude event a progressive flooding generally causes a flood peak in june secondary peaks may be registered in summer their origin is different they are triggered by rainstorms in the 1954 2012 period for which daily data were available the pot method helped identify 90 peaks i e a mean value of 1 55 events exceeding 20 000 m3 s 1 per year indeed one or two peaks were usually recorded in the same spring or summer in 1981 and in 2012 four flood peaks were recorded and since 2004 at least two peaks occurred every year together may and june accounted for the highest discharges 20 peaks exceeding 40 000 m3 s 1 were recorded at tabaga gauging site between 1954 and 2012 table 1 fig 5 the highest floods generally occurred in may 14 events and were rarer in june fig 5 the 29 peaks of between 30 000 and 40 000 m3 s 1 were more frequent in june 16 peaks in june and 13 peaks in may but they were less frequent in the summer 10 events distributed in july august and september fig 5 these summer overbank flows were as good as absent before 1981 only one flood in july 1958 bar full discharges between 20 000 and 30 000 m3 s 1 occurred from may to september with a maximum occurrence in july and august with 14 events between 1954 and 2012 fig 5 the river showed high inter annual variability in terms of floods and the annual maximum ranged from 20 000 to more than 50 000 m3 s 1 two historic floods occurred one on may 22 1955 52 700 m3 s 1 and the other on may 20 2010 with 51 600 m3 s 1 table 1 the 2010 flood was catastrophic in the area of yakutsk where many inhabitants had to be evacuated two periods were characterized by frequent high floods first the 1957 1966 period was an active period with several high floods frequency 0 6 six events exceeding 40 000 m3 s 1 year this was also an abundant hydrologic period in terms of mean annual and monthly discharge fig 3 and fig 4 second after the 1980s the frequency of floods greater than 40 000 m3 s 1 increased progressively fig 6 whereas normal floods were less frequent in the last years leading up to 2012 an unprecedented frequency of high floods was recorded whereas small events between 20 000 and 30 000 m3 s 1 no longer occurred the period between 1967 and 1986 was relatively calm with only one high flood this corresponded to a dry period in terms of average annual discharge with a majority of negative anomalies fig 4 4 2 2 the duration of the three discharge classes hydrologic changes can also be detected by analyzing the duration of the different classes of discharge reflecting the general immoderation of the river the duration was also subject to great inter annual variability fig 7 the first discharge class 20 000 30 000 m3 s 1 lasted from a few days 12 13 days in 1972 and 2003 for example up to three months 1988 for example the mean annual duration of this class represented a minimum value for the period 1954 1963 26 days further evidence for the dry period the longest durations were recorded in 1988 82 days and in 2005 57 days of bar full level the two classes of floods i e above 30 000 m3 s 1 varied greatly the mean duration of overbank discharge 30 000 40 000 m3 s 1 ranged from zero days to more than 20 days per year the abundant decade mid 1950s to mid 1960s was marked by long flood durations 17 days per year on average however after the 1990s the duration progressively increased the longest floods were recorded after 2004 16 day between 30 000 and 40 000 m3 s 1 for the 2004 2012 period and more than 5 days for the greatest floods fig 7 as a consequence by cumulating the two flooding classes the mean annual duration of flooding was actually 21 days after 2004 contrasting with a dozen days in the previous periods after 2004 there was a significant increase in the highest floods discharges higher than 40 000 m3 s 1 rarely exceeded a few days when they occurred except in 1959 12 days after 2004 longer durations became more frequent 9 days in 2004 a historic maximum of 21 days in 2006 and 8 days in 2012 mean and maximum values underwent a net increase after 2004 fig 7 whatever the flooding level considered 30 000 or 40 000 m3 s 1 the last decade before 2012 witnessed a major change in the intensity and duration of flood events the consequences were important the local population was faced with 40 days of submersion in 2006 a historical record 36 days in 2007 and in 2012 however the pettitt tests at the level of significance of 5 done on the duration data shows that there is no break probably because the change is too recent 4 3 changing temporal distribution 4 3 1 date of flooding two parameters can help identify a possible change the first day of bar full level and the date of the flood peak first we examined the first day the discharge reached the bar full level as this marks the beginning of the flood the lena river generally reaches the bar full level between may 15 and may 25 fig 8 over the entire period flooding generally began on may 22 mean date in the second half of the 20th century the probability of flooding before may 15 was rare the situation clearly changed after 1994 as in several years flooding began 5 10 days earlier second detailed analysis of the temporal distribution of the spring flood maximum revealed different phases after 1937 fig 9 for the period as a whole the mean date of the flood maximum peak was may 30 early floods i e before may 30th were common before 1973 correlatively flood peaks were rare in june after that the date of the flood maximum was more variable late rising limbs and peaks i e in june increased two late events were also recorded in july 1988 and 1998 so the flooding season that was previously expected at the end of may is now much more unpredictable 4 3 2 secondary flood peaks rainfall events can create a secondary flood in the summer august or september a flood can be actually produced by local intense rainfall or by rainfall in the upstream basin however these summer events are exceptional table 1 as mentioned above bar full and bank full water levels are rarely observed in late summer and early autumn august september 18 events table 1 it would be more accurate to say were rarely observed before 1981 water discharge a little above 20 000 m3 s 1 occurred six times i e at a frequency of 0 22 time per year the longest durations were recorded in september 1959 12 days and in september 1973 16 days after 1981 the frequency and the intensity of these secondary peaks appear to be increasing with a frequency of 0 39 time per year they exceeded 30 000 m3 s 1 three times table 1 furthermore several overbank flooding events with exceptional peaks were observed at the end of summer at the end of august and in september 1981 25 days exceeding 20 000 m3 s 1 were measured with an exceptional peak at 33 500 m3 s 1 on september 2 the same observation applies to september 2008 with 16 days above 20 000 m3 s 1 and a peak of 36 700 m3 s 1 in september 2011 with 34 300 m3 s 1 and in august 2012 38 000 m3 s 1 thus these events are more frequent from the beginning of the 21st century recently secondary peaks that occur in summer or at the beginning of autumn started to occur with unprecedented frequency and intensity table 1 multi peak flooding was observed in several recent years in 2008 an inversion of the flood hydrograph was observed the secondary peak in september was higher than the spring flood fig 10 bar full level lasted 16 days and overbank flow nine in august 2012 four peaks higher than 30 000 m3 s 1 were recorded 4 4 high spatial resolution analysis of flooding the four study years represent a good panel of hydrologic situations in terms of flood intensity flood date and duration table 2 the effect of different hydrologic parameters on river dynamics can be analyzed here we report the changes we observed on different islands in the lena river between 2008 and 2012 4 4 1 floods and stream temperature the gauging station and the thermo buttons installed on islands in the river provided precise information on flood heights and duration first the four year study revealed high variability in flood peaks and duration table 2 three floods showed a steep rising limb 2010 2011 2012 fig 10 with flood peaks between may 15 and may 20 an exceptional breakup occurred in 2010 when discharge reached 51 600 m3 s 1 although flooding was catastrophic in the area of yakutsk it was short table 2 conversely in 2009 the ice cover melted slowly and the discharge increased progressively and reached maximum in mid june the floodplain and islands were flooded for a long time the year 2011 was dominated by two flood peaks the first one on may 15 and the second late one that was also more than 30 000 m3 s 1 on august 8 in 2012 several peaks exceeding 30 000 m3 s 1 occurred between mid may and the beginning of august causing long lasting flooding more than a month table 2 thus peak discharge and flooding duration are not necessarily correlated the thermo buttons provided more precise data on the beginning of flooding and its duration on the islands for example in 2010 fig 11 flooding began on may 18 23 00 at a discharge slightly below 30 000 m3 s 1 the water reached a button placed at a height of 3 m at 11 a m on may 19 confirming the very brutal beak up which occurred that year the water level began to go down in the morning on may 22 the emerged button at a height of 3 m showed a marked difference with the other buttons that were still submerged the thermo button installed 0 5 m from the ground showed flooding ended in the morning on may 26 on eselyakh island we measured the same flood which began 2 4 h earlier the two islands were submerged for nine days during this flood the water temperature was low ranging from 0 c to 2 c the graph of the temperatures measured by the thermo buttons in 2012 illustrates the increase in water temperature in spring and summer fig 12 during the first phase of the flood may the water temperature was 0 c 1 c equivalent to the temperature measured in may 2010 in june the second peak of flooding submerged the island with warmer water 10 c 12 c and in july the temperature of the water during the third and fourth flood peaks reached 15 c and 17 c respectively thus the stream temperature strongly increases from the beginning to the end of the flooding season 5 discussion examination of discharge between 1936 and 2012 confirmed that high variability is an intrinsic feature of the hydrologic functioning of the lena river and this can be seen at different time scales a recent historical record of siberian floods highlights different phases myglan and vaganov 2011 after a period of hydrologic calm 1680 1725 these authors observed more frequent spring floods after 1750 and more frequent summer floods in the 19th century on the lena river during early floods on april 27 1800 for example a brutal breakup with massive ice dams caused serious damage to villages summer floods destroyed pastures livestock and crops for example july 1745 because of heavy rains double peak events are also feared by local people for example in may and june 1765 when two flood events were recorded according to rowlands et al 2010 permafrost dominated regions are fundamentally different from their temperate counterparts 2010 p 230 in periglacial areas covered by continuous permafrost winter discharge can be supplied by deep unfrozen water by a potential talik or by sub surface water stored in the channel french 1996 brabets and walvoord 2009 watson et al 2013 woo et al 2008 ye et al 2009 established a link between the ratio of maximum to minimum monthly river discharge and the permafrost cover a high ratio is associated with an extensive permafrost cover 60 of the basin area in the middle and lower part of the lena river basin where the permafrost is continuous and thick the maximum minimum monthly ratio varies between 16 and 48 ye et al 2009 from the middle of the 1980 s to the end of the 1990 s the data covers the period 1936 1999 the ratio was markedly low even if no trend emerged the change was mainly due to the increased minimum river base flow in winter this change was identified by yang et al 2002 2004 from 1988 to 2004 at tabaga gauging site the change affected the monthly minimal discharge 12 in april our study shows that after 2004 both minimum and maximum discharge have been concerned with respectively 41 in april and 16 in june when calculating the ratio mean maximal monthly discharge to minimal monthly discharge with additional data fig 13 it clearly demonstrates that the diminishing trend of the ratio is confirmed for the 21st century fig 13 shows a good correlation between the mean air temperature at yakutsk and the ratio a cold year generally implies a high ratio and a low ratio corresponds to a warm year however since the beginning of the 21st century high ratios qmax qmin are more likely linked to a net increase of the maximal monthly discharge in june that strongly exceeds the increase of the low discharge in april for example in 2006 the ratio was very high 40 mainly due to an exceptional monthly discharge in june 43 000 m3 s 1 versus an average value around 24 000 m3 s 1 for 1936 2012 the same observation concerning the winter base flow was made by bennett et al 2015 for the yukon tanana and nuyakuk rivers in alaska whose basins are dominated by permafrost concerning the yukon river the increasing discharge in winter and in april reflects a greater supply of groundwater a general trend showing earlier breakup on the yukon and tanana rivers also accompanies the hydrological change brabets and walvoord 2009 watson et al 2013 also confirmed that continuous permafrost controls low winter discharge in small sub catchments in eastern and western siberia concerning the low lena river at kusur near the delta it has been shown that the cold season october april is affected by a significant increase in stream flow related to winter warming yang et al 2002 however the low lena river and the yenisei basins are mainly influenced by the hydrologic alteration caused by dams and reservoirs berezovskaya et al 2005 yang et al 2004 which is not the case in the upper and middle sections of the lena present study as these can be considered as pristine warm season hydrology is governed by different climatic and meteorological processes that act at different time scales a thicker snow cover accompanied by a warmer winter and or spring limits penetration of the soil by the cold wave and creates a thicker active layer muskett and romanovsky 2009 stieglitz et al 2003 the thickness of the active layer represents non negligible groundwater storage once again because of its huge basin the different sub catchments of the lena river react differently to the different parameters a reduction in the duration of the snow cover has been recorded in the mountains of south siberia whereas central and eastern siberia are still subject to longer lasting snow cover bulygina et al 2009 concerning permafrost according to fedorov et al 2014 the thawing index sum of positive mean daily air temperature provides significant information on the dynamics of the permafrost and of the active layer these authors identified different phases of warming and cooling and reported different reactions in the different regions of asia the central yakutia was hardly affected by arctic warming 1935 1945 and during the same period the thawing index was very slightly positive this phase was characterized by negative anomalies of the average annual discharge fig 4 the warm phase was followed by a period of cooling 1961 1970 expressed by a negative thawing index we can underline the fact that the mean annual discharge does not appear to be affected by the cooling phase as positive anomalies occurred between 1956 and 1963 followed by alternating positive and negative anomalies fig 4 the consequence of the cooling phase could be a slight decrease in the monthly minimal discharge 8 in april that could express a reduction in snow cover and delayed snowmelt and ice thawing no anomaly of the monthly maximum in june occurred during this cooling phase an increase in the thawing index was evidenced from 1988 to 1995 and the increase was much more pronounced after 2005 fedorov et al 2014 the increased occurrence of early floods at the beginning of may fig 6 fig 9 could also be explained by the early contribution of snowmelt and ice thawing earlier snowmelt and thawing of the active layer or of the ice covering the river in spring are expected along the lower 2000 km reach of the lena river 4 9 7 5 days earlier in the 2050s and 8 1 13 6 days in the 2080s prowse et al 2010 monitoring sites on siberian plateaus very close to our study site clearly revealed an abrupt change in soil temperature and in the depth of the active layer after 2004 iijima et al 2010 iijima et al 2016 soil moisture content and the depth of the active layer are increasing in parallel iijima et al 2016 according to these authors moisture and the depth of the active layer are closely linked to summer precipitation june to september and to the snow thickness both factors that have evolved synchronously since the beginning of the 21st century the combined effect of rainfall in late summer and snow thickness in early winter has a direct impact on soil temperature the main cause of these recent anomalies is the more frequent and or more intense advections of storms in eastern and central siberia iijima et al 2016 overland et al 2008 overland and wang 2010 shiklomanov and lammers 2009 before the 2000s summer rain was usually associated with a cool summer the association between wet and cool summers was also reported by myglan and vaganov 2011 for the historical period in contrast since the beginning of the 21st century a wet summer is synonymous with a warm summer iijima et al 2016 a pluviometric and hydrologic record occurred in 2007 shiklomanov and lammers 2009 however the following years far exceeded this ephemeral maximum wet years occurred between 2004 and 2008 linked with abnormal storm activity in eastern siberia precipitation maxima were recorded in yakutia in 2005 and 2006 more than 200 mm versus an annual average of 150 mm iijima et al 2016 shiklomanov and lammers 2009 calculated an exceptional water contribution to the arctic ocean in 2007 by six large russian rivers including the lena river the increased water supply 25 occurred in the context of a warmer 2 c and wetter 100 mm year runoff anomalies were observed particularly in three permafrost dominated basins and in parts in the transition between permafrost and non permafrost areas hydro climatic conditions over the northern eurasian continent depend on interactions between arctic sea ice pressure centers and the arctic dipole wind pattern serreze et al 2002 shiklomanov and lammers 2009 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 the increasing occurrence of cyclones in northern and eastern siberia depends on specific atmospheric fields in arctic regions in the summer a surface air temperature associated with sea level pressure creates an anticyclonic situation over north america and a cyclonic situation over north asia causing frequent intrusions of storms in siberia inoue and kikuchi 2009 shiklomanov and lammers 2009 iijima et al 2016 this recent change corresponds to the net increase in river discharge we pointed out with the exception of 2010 and 2011 all the years after 2005 exceeded the mean annual discharge by more than 30 fig 4 and the duration of flooding was also exceptional in these years the years 2004 and 2005 thus clearly represent a major transition in the hydrologic dynamics of the middle lena river the recent occurrence of storms in summer and the early autumn is probably the main cause of the multi peak hydrograph we identified in the decade preceding 2012 fig 9 and fig 10 it also explains the inversion of the hydrologic year we observed in 2008 with a higher flood peak in september than the normal peak in spring when comparing the daily discharge data with the air temperature and precipitation data yakutsk station several evidences can be detected concerning the origin of the secondary peaks occurring in summer we attempted to determine the origin of the secondary peaks the analysis demonstrates that a wet summer at yakutsk does not necessarily imply a secondary flood a wet summer is characterized by precipitation above 38 mm in august and 28 mm in september mean values for 1936 2014 the comparison between hydrologic data and rainfall data shows that a local rainfall triggers a hydrologic response i e a discharge increase when it exceeds at least 80 mm per month the determination of this rainfall threshold helps identify the main but not exclusive origin of a summer flood table 1 at tabaga there is actually no clear correlation between the occurrence of a secondary flood peak in august or september and the local precipitation few floods correspond to local rainfall events and when a flood peak triggered by a local rainstorm occurs it is very short table 1 in august 2006 a very humid period 151 mm caused a secondary peak during five days 2006 being the second wettest year since 1937 at yakutsk with 326 mm in 1960 a rainy august 120 mm created a secondary peak during two days thus the great majority of the secondary summer peaks mainly corresponds to a flood wave coming from the upper basin the change in the chronology of the river hydrology deeply can impact the river morphodynamics not only because of higher and longer floods but also because of warmer water the stream temperature of the lena river depends directly on the air temperature and the summer stream temperature has increased significantly costard et al 2007 the thermo buttons measured very warm stream temperatures in june july and august one of the most specific processes of periglacial hydrosystems is the thermal mechanical erosion of their frozen banks are 1983 costard et al 2007 tananaev 2016 during the high water stage the permanent contact between the water and the non cohesive frozen sediment results in rapid bank retreat and in the formation of specific forms such as thermal basal nichas and baydzheraks soloviev 1973 costard et al 2014 longer contact between the warm water up to 15 c in july as mentioned above and the bank implies a higher erosion rate furthermore it has been demonstrated that stream temperature is a key factor in thermal erosion an ablation velocity model constructed on the basis of a mathematical model and on laboratory simulations revealed that the efficiency of thermal erosion is mainly controlled by the temperature of the water costard et al 2003 thermal erosion does not necessarily require high discharge to be efficient bar full discharge which enables contact between the base of the bank and the water is sufficient to destabilize the frozen bank 6 conclusion by reporting on the hydrologic response of the middle lena river our study contributes to the demonstration of an arctic warm period overland et al 2008 overland and wang 2010 the concomitance of several hydrologic changes in the two decades preceding 2012 reflects a real change in the dynamics of the middle lena river the flood period is being affected in different ways spring monthly discharge has undergone a net increase caused by longer bar full and bank full water levels flood peaks are also more frequent and the date of the beginning of flooding appears to be less predictable both earlier and later flood peaks are observed late summer secondary peaks are much more frequent and more intense we assume that the increasing frequency of the secondary peaks is principally linked to more frequent floods originated in the upstream basin the hydrologic change is not only expressed by the flood intensity but also and mainly by the increasing duration of the flood discharges bank full and extreme discharges furthermore all changes mean annual or monthly discharges flood magnitude and duration appear to have been strongly reinforced since the beginning of the 21st century more precisely since 2004 2005 extreme hydrologic events are a major threat for society cred 2015 both flooding and low flow have a great effect on human and ecological systems even if the projected future impacts of climatic change are subject to strong regional variability and uncertainty approximately 450 million people who live in floodplains will face double the frequency of flooding in 2050 arnell and gosling 2016 arnell and lloyd hughes 2014 extreme hydrologic events threaten river infrastructure and navigation and flood risk management and water resources depend on a good understanding of hydrologic hazards that is particularly true in central and northern siberia where even if population density is very low around 0 3 inhabitants per km2 in the sakha republic social activities and industry are mainly associated with rivers the six main cities located on the banks of the lena river are particularly vulnerable to flooding the city of lensk was partly destroyed by the huge flood in 2001 sudden flooding of the frozen river caused a 16 m rise in the water level and flooded the two thirds of the city thousands of people in lensk were homeless and 1800 homes were destroyed a large flood of the angara river also occurred in 2001 kichigina 2013 in may 2010 a historic flood in the region of yakutsk led to the evacuation of thousands of people all the villages in the floodplain between pokrovsk and kangalassy were submerged the efficiency of the water discharges is reinforced by the increase in water temperature later and longer hydrologic processes are combined with much warmer stream temperatures both changes cause more rapid erosion of the frozen banks costard et al 2007 gautier et al 2008 the interactions between the duration of discharge and stream temperature affect the stability of the river bed a higher erosion rate implies an increasing supply of sediments to the river bed thus we assume that the mobility of the channels and islands certainly threatens numerous activities navigation and river infrastructure is destabilized or on the contrary sedimentation increases these developments will certainly disrupt economic activities in siberia which partly depend on the strategic role played by the river river infrastructure and navigation playing a key role rivers are

7504,recent observations indicate that over the last decades climate change has increasingly influenced the frequency intensity and duration of extreme climatic and hydrologic events the main aim of this study is to determine the hydrologic response especially the flood evolution of the lena river in eastern siberia to ongoing climate change draining the coldest region of the northern hemisphere the lena river is impacted by global warming which is particularly pronounced in periglacial areas characterized by deep and continuous permafrost we document the hydrologic variability of the middle lena river first by characterizing trend and stationarity of monthly discharges second we analyze on the basis of the peak over threshold method pot the temporal evolution of intensity and duration of three discharge classes bar full discharge bank full discharge and large floods finally we also determined the dates of the flood beginning and of the flood peak data on mean monthly discharge and flood peaks are available since 1936 and daily discharges since 1954 our results provide evidence for a net hydrologic change with an increase in the intensity and duration of floods in the two decades ending in 2012 the frequency of high floods is unprecedented and small floods no longer occur the tail of the temporal distribution of the flood peak is also changing more frequent early floods are occurring in spring with secondary flood peaks in summer the latest probably represents the most striking change furthermore the changes have been accelerating since 2004 finally two islands were instrumented 2008 2012 in order to study the flooding dynamics with a better precision keywords flood peak over threshold climatic change eastern siberia 1 introduction numerous

et al 2009 over the course of the year the arctic fluvial regime combines a long low water stage in winter because of the limited contribution of underground water and brief and often brutal flooding in spring both features depending on interactions between the permafrost and the temperature permafrost areas are very sensitive to warming in alaska the warming average was around 1 c but reached 3 4 c in the arctic coastal plain osterkamp 2005 in eastern siberia permafrost temperature already underwent an increase up to 1 c over the course of the 20th century fedorov and konstantinov 2003 and an increase in warming has been observed since the beginning of the 21st century fedorov et al 2014 in the lena basin an increase up to 4 c is projected for the period 2040 2069 under the warm wet a2 scenario bring and destouni 2013 a general long term increase in mean annual discharge has been observed in many siberian rivers including the lena river shiklomanov et al 2006 as many long arctic and sub arctic hydrosystems are oriented south north they are affected by different climatic influences the contribution of the snowmelt water decreases downstream and the influence of the permafrost and its associated active layer takes over in the 1960 2001 period n kichigina 2013 examined the hydrological changes in the upper basin of the lena river before and after the climate change 1960 1979 and 1980 2005 and reported intra annual redistribution of runoff kichigina 2013 as the regime is dominated by the supply of snowmelt water the upper lena river is witnessing a marked increase in winter because of less freezing and early snowmelt downstream in eastern siberia the middle lena river reflects the influence of its upper basin but also the strong influence of the deep continuous permafrost and the seasonal thawing of the active layer in yakutia permafrost covers more than 80 of the area and it is an ice rich permafrost 40 80 of ice content soloviev 1973 consequently the monthly ratio of maximum to minimum water discharge increases downstream correlated with the permafrost cover of the basin ye et al 2009 since the 1980s there has been actually a moderate increase in the mean annual discharge of the middle lena river 3 but the supply of water increased markedly at the end of winter and in early spring 22 23 in march and april gautier et al 2008 yang et al 2002 the 10 increase in downstream lena river discharge from 1936 to 2001 was mainly due to large scale atmospheric change and to the impact of the large dams built on a major tributary viliuy r of the lower lena river berezovskaya et al 2005 the temperature of the lena river also directly reflects the temperature of the air and the temperature of the stream has been much warmer since the 1980 s than before 3 23 c in july 1 72 c in june and 1 05 c in may costard et al 2007 the fluvial regime of the arctic rivers is immoderate with very low flow during winter and a spring flood characterized by a steep rising limb and a peak discharge that can exceed by ten times the winter discharge because of their south north course the flood wave generated by the snowmelt in the upper basin arrives in still frozen areas creating a specific river process called river outburst the outburst causes a very rapid rise in water level with the dislocation of the river ice cover on the river during the winter flooding ice jams and brutal ice breaks are common features of the breakup even if their intensity varies greatly costard et al 2014 distinguished two main phases during the spring flood i the breakup sensu stricto of the ice cover with subsequent ice jams that usually correspond to the rising limb of the hydrograph and ii overbank flooding following the sudden rise in the water level the extreme hydrologic events vary with natural climatic variability large scale atmospheric changes causing wet and dry cycles on artic rivers berezovskaya et al 2005 however shiklomanov et al 2007 compiled data on daily river discharge from 139 gauging stations distributed across the russian arctic examined spring maximum discharge and found no widespread significant change in spring maximum discharge except for the lena river which showed a general positive trend between 1940 and 2001 however identifying the factors that drive hydrologic changes in these very large basins remains challenging recently bennett et al 2015 underlined the lack of long term high quality continuous records of streamflow available for in depth analysis bennett et al 2015 for this reason we aim to detail the hydrologic reaction of the lena river to global warming since the first part of the 20th century more precisely the present paper examines changes in water discharges and flood events in the middle lena river in eastern siberia water discharge data are compiled for a period of 76 years with longer time series 1936 2012 than the previous studies yang et al 2002 peterson et al 2002 shiklomanov and lammers 2009 we are able to analyze long term changes and focus on very recent changes the analysis of daily and monthly discharge helps define important hydrologic changes that could have a major impact on the river bed we describe changes in flooding in terms of the date the duration and the intensity of hydrologic events we examine three discharge thresholds bar full level bank full level and large floods and investigated the intensity duration and distribution of these discharges over time the precise flooding process is also analyzed on two instrumented islands 2008 2012 2 study area the lena river is one of the longest rivers in the arctic it is 4 400 km long and drains a 2 49 106 km2 basin at kusur station in terms of discharge the lena river is the second biggest supplier of water to the arctic oceans with 525 257 km3 per year just after the yenisei river 581 603 km3 and well before the mackenzie 333 km3 antonov 1960 gordeev and sidorov 1993 shiklomanov et al 2006 our study area is located in the upper part of the middle lena river near yakutsk 62 01 37 n 129 43 57 e fig 1 where the active floodplain widens after a long course through a narrow valley fig 1a the river takes on a multiple channel pattern fig 1 with numerous channels surrounding large barren sand bars and islands entirely covered by a willow forest gautier and costard 2000 costard et al 2014 our field observations lasted from 2008 to 2012 program agence nationale de la recherche climaflu the aim was to quantify erosion and sedimentation on river islands the two islands that were instrumented and surveyed 2008 2012 are located upstream eselyakh 12 km and timochka 5 km upstream of tabaga gauging station fig 1a the islands themselves are composed of fluvial deposits colonized by perennial alluvial vegetation 3 data and methods 3 1 hydrologic data the study combined different approaches the first was the analysis of monthly and daily hydrologic data water discharge data were compiled for 76 years at tabaga gauging site 61 47 38 48 n 129 40 4 70 e fig 1 which is located at the beginning of the middle lena floodplain and drains the upper lena basin 897 000 km2 the tabaga site represents the influences of a quasi pristine basin without large dam in its upper reach which is why we preferred tabaga over kusur station where the influence of the large dams installed on the viliuy river can be detected we analyzed the hydrologic year books available at the permafrost institute at yakutsk for the 1937 2012 period mean monthly discharge and the maximum stage are available since 1937 daily discharges are also available since 1954 we reconstructed maximum water discharges on the basis of a rating curve for the period 1937 1954 according to a previous precise study of water discharge uncertainty in cold regions shiklomanov et al 2006 the greatest error in daily discharge is observed during winter because of the ice cover so large uncertainties are calculated during low water stage varying between 5 and 25 for the lena river at kusur the error represents 20 during the minimal water stage period winter and 4 5 during the high water stage spring and summer shiklomanov et al 2006 for this reason the russian hydrologic survey calculates a correction coefficient for the discharge on rivers that have a stable ice cover during the winter thus the same uncertainty can be assumed for tabaga gauging station 3 2 multi decadal analysis of water discharge first we calculated the mean monthly discharge particularly for the spring and summer seasons may september we used long term trend analysis to identify changes and the mann kendall test to determine the statistical significance of the changes we also used the pettitt test a non parametric one performed for testing the null hypothesis that there is no break in a series against the alternative that a stepwise shift in the mean is present second we focused on the high water level and the flooding period with an appropriate peak over threshold pot method also called partial duration series on daily discharges may september the peak over threshold method developed by lang et al 1999 can be adapted to different environments dÃ©pret et al 2015 gob et al 2016 gu et al 2016 and enables the determination of flood maxima and the calculation of flood duration the method consists of retaining the discharge peaks that exceed a given threshold or base level thereby enabling a more rational selection of events to be considered as floods lang et al 1999 103 the first step is to check if two successive events are separated or not two events are identified if they are separated by at least five days plus the natural logarithm of the basin area in miles2 i e 18 days for the lena river at tabaga gauging site 5 ln 346333 6 mi2 or if the discharge between the two peaks drops below 75 of the lowest of the two peaks to select threshold levels we used an approach based on the identification of different water levels in the river the thresholds were determined based on our in situ observations during the study years and according to data from the hydrologic survey of the sakha republic the first discharge with 20 000 m3 s 1 corresponds to the submersion of the entire width of the active bed composed of all active channels and barren sandy bars which is considered as a bar full discharge according to the study conducted by biedenharn and thorne 1994 on the mississippi river the bar full stage has a geomorphic effect on the river bed by transporting a large load of sediment biedenharn and thorne 1994 second the discharge of 30 000 m3 s 1 corresponds to the mean bank full discharge for the study reach the hydrologic survey of the sakha republic considers that population alerts about flooding should begin at 8 m at tabaga a level that corresponds to approximately 31 000 32 000 m3 s 1 the third discharge threshold 40 000 m3 s 1 i e a height of 9 m at yakutsk is considered as a major flood hence the three discharge classes analyzed were i between 20 000 and 30 000 m3 s 1 ii between 30 000 and 40 000 m3 s 1 and iii above 40 000 m3 s 1 the duration was measured based on the number of days in a given discharge class two dates in the hydrologic year were also examined the first day of bar full level in spring considering that it expresses the beginning of the flood season and the date of the peak flow 3 3 analysis of the in situ flooding process 2008 2012 it was not possible to make direct measurements on floodplain and islands during floods thus two islands timochka and eselyakh fig 1 were equipped 2008 2012 i first flood duration and water height were directly measured on the two islands with temperature sensors thermo buttons 0 5 c accuracy progesplus willems france the thermo buttons were installed on different trees at 0 5 m intervals from the soil surface to a height of 4 m the temperature was recorded at 3 hourly intervals from the end of april until october fig 2 comparing the temperature measured by the buttons with the temperature of the river water and with the air temperature made it possible to determine the level of submersion when the inundation occurs the temperature of the lowest submerged button 0 5 m suddenly changes and differs from the upper thermo buttons that are not inundated the upper button 1m that can be submerged few hours after will show the same evolution by that mean it is possible to have a good appreciation of the water height on islands with a 50 cm uncertainty during the flooding the data were of course compared with the discharge data provided by tabaga gauging station ii since water temperature plays an important role in the thermal erosion of the frozen banks temperature data are also analyzed and compared for each flood the detailed timing of the flood on the lena river was also recorded each year from a relatively high terrace in the lena floodplain using wide angle and high resolution optical instruments every spring from 2008 to 2013 photographs were taken to evaluate the level of ice and water on the two islands costard et al 2014 4 results 4 1 major increase in mean annual and monthly discharge the hydrograph of the middle lena river is highly representative of a periglacial and high latitude continental area where permafrost plays a major role the main annual hydrologic features since 1937 are listed in table 1 and mean monthly discharge per decade is shown in fig 3 with a low mean annual discharge around 7200 m3 s 1 at tabaga the lena river has a weak specific discharge 7 8 l s 1 km 2 reflecting the low contribution of underground water from october to the end of april the river goes through a long low water stage and is covered by ice between 200 and 250 days fig 3 the hydrologic year is dominated by rapid flooding and breakup that occurs around the middle of may the rising limb of the flood is most of the time very steep discharge can be multiplied by a factor of 10 in a single day the flood peak sometimes reaches 40 000 50 000 m3 s 1 at tabaga the flood wave coming from the upper part of the basin located in the prebaÃ¯kal mountains propagates across the floodplain and active channels that are still frozen the flood wave arrives in eastern siberia between may 15th and may 30th the breakup and subsequent overbank flooding are highly variable in may the initial breakup of the ice cover on the river which can be very short and brutal is followed by overbank flooding more rarely the rising limb is gentler because of a progressive arrival of the upstream flood the water level drops from july to october with a plateau in august and september due to late summer storms a secondary peak created by intense rainfall can occur in summer the mean annual discharge for the whole 1936 2012 period was around 7200 m3 s 1 7210 m3 s 1 for 1936 2012 and 7212 m3 s 1 for 1960 1990 the standard period it increased by 22 7 after 2004 i e a mean discharge of 8846 m3 s 1 for the 2005 2012 period from 2006 to 2009 the average annual discharge exceeded 9200 m3 s 1 records for 1983 and 2012 showed a mean annual discharge of 10 500 and 10 200 m3 s 1 respectively table 1 mean monthly discharges have increased significantly in recent decades fig 3 the mann kendall test revealed a positive tendency for several months in winter november to january and in summer june and september p value 5 winter and spring discharges were characterized by a significant increase after the late 1980 s especially at the end of winter and spring 21 4 and 16 6 in may and june respectively for example the mean discharge in may increased significantly pettitt s test after 1995 positive anomalies were recorded for monthly discharge in may except 2003 2004 every year since 1996 was positive from the end of spring to the end of summer hydrologic changes were less pronounced 4 8 7 the reinforced trend was quite clear in the last period 2006 2012 fig 3 after 2006 the mean annual discharge was 31 higher than in the previous period this increase was mainly due to the increase in april and may 44 7 and 43 8 respectively and in late summer and autumn august to october 22 to 33 the monthly discharge in the last period is easy to distinguish from the previous periods i e before 2006 as it was above the other periods in almost all the months fig 3 the recent hydrologic change is also reflected in the increased frequency of positive anomalies one period of positive anomalies is observed from 1958 to 1963 however 14 positive anomalies were recorded in the 20 years preceding 2012 and there was one positive anomaly every year after 2006 fig 4 furthermore very marked positive anomalies were recorded exceeding 130 a value that was not registered between 1936 and 1982 4 2 changes in the flooding regime 4 2 1 recent changes in flood peaks the great majority of flood peaks occurs in may and june associated with the flood wave coming from the upper basin and with the local break up the floods present generally a steep rising limb type r for rapid table 1 and more rarely a progressive flood rising limb type p table 1 a steep rising limb generally implies a brutal break up and a flood peak in may but it does not necessarily imply a high magnitude event a progressive flooding generally causes a flood peak in june secondary peaks may be registered in summer their origin is different they are triggered by rainstorms in the 1954 2012 period for which daily data were available the pot method helped identify 90 peaks i e a mean value of 1 55 events exceeding 20 000 m3 s 1 per year indeed one or two peaks were usually recorded in the same spring or summer in 1981 and in 2012 four flood peaks were recorded and since 2004 at least two peaks occurred every year together may and june accounted for the highest discharges 20 peaks exceeding 40 000 m3 s 1 were recorded at tabaga gauging site between 1954 and 2012 table 1 fig 5 the highest floods generally occurred in may 14 events and were rarer in june fig 5 the 29 peaks of between 30 000 and 40 000 m3 s 1 were more frequent in june 16 peaks in june and 13 peaks in may but they were less frequent in the summer 10 events distributed in july august and september fig 5 these summer overbank flows were as good as absent before 1981 only one flood in july 1958 bar full discharges between 20 000 and 30 000 m3 s 1 occurred from may to september with a maximum occurrence in july and august with 14 events between 1954 and 2012 fig 5 the river showed high inter annual variability in terms of floods and the annual maximum ranged from 20 000 to more than 50 000 m3 s 1 two historic floods occurred one on may 22 1955 52 700 m3 s 1 and the other on may 20 2010 with 51 600 m3 s 1 table 1 the 2010 flood was catastrophic in the area of yakutsk where many inhabitants had to be evacuated two periods were characterized by frequent high floods first the 1957 1966 period was an active period with several high floods frequency 0 6 six events exceeding 40 000 m3 s 1 year this was also an abundant hydrologic period in terms of mean annual and monthly discharge fig 3 and fig 4 second after the 1980s the frequency of floods greater than 40 000 m3 s 1 increased progressively fig 6 whereas normal floods were less frequent in the last years leading up to 2012 an unprecedented frequency of high floods was recorded whereas small events between 20 000 and 30 000 m3 s 1 no longer occurred the period between 1967 and 1986 was relatively calm with only one high flood this corresponded to a dry period in terms of average annual discharge with a majority of negative anomalies fig 4 4 2 2 the duration of the three discharge classes hydrologic changes can also be detected by analyzing the duration of the different classes of discharge reflecting the general immoderation of the river the duration was also subject to great inter annual variability fig 7 the first discharge class 20 000 30 000 m3 s 1 lasted from a few days 12 13 days in 1972 and 2003 for example up to three months 1988 for example the mean annual duration of this class represented a minimum value for the period 1954 1963 26 days further evidence for the dry period the longest durations were recorded in 1988 82 days and in 2005 57 days of bar full level the two classes of floods i e above 30 000 m3 s 1 varied greatly the mean duration of overbank discharge 30 000 40 000 m3 s 1 ranged from zero days to more than 20 days per year the abundant decade mid 1950s to mid 1960s was marked by long flood durations 17 days per year on average however after the 1990s the duration progressively increased the longest floods were recorded after 2004 16 day between 30 000 and 40 000 m3 s 1 for the 2004 2012 period and more than 5 days for the greatest floods fig 7 as a consequence by cumulating the two flooding classes the mean annual duration of flooding was actually 21 days after 2004 contrasting with a dozen days in the previous periods after 2004 there was a significant increase in the highest floods discharges higher than 40 000 m3 s 1 rarely exceeded a few days when they occurred except in 1959 12 days after 2004 longer durations became more frequent 9 days in 2004 a historic maximum of 21 days in 2006 and 8 days in 2012 mean and maximum values underwent a net increase after 2004 fig 7 whatever the flooding level considered 30 000 or 40 000 m3 s 1 the last decade before 2012 witnessed a major change in the intensity and duration of flood events the consequences were important the local population was faced with 40 days of submersion in 2006 a historical record 36 days in 2007 and in 2012 however the pettitt tests at the level of significance of 5 done on the duration data shows that there is no break probably because the change is too recent 4 3 changing temporal distribution 4 3 1 date of flooding two parameters can help identify a possible change the first day of bar full level and the date of the flood peak first we examined the first day the discharge reached the bar full level as this marks the beginning of the flood the lena river generally reaches the bar full level between may 15 and may 25 fig 8 over the entire period flooding generally began on may 22 mean date in the second half of the 20th century the probability of flooding before may 15 was rare the situation clearly changed after 1994 as in several years flooding began 5 10 days earlier second detailed analysis of the temporal distribution of the spring flood maximum revealed different phases after 1937 fig 9 for the period as a whole the mean date of the flood maximum peak was may 30 early floods i e before may 30th were common before 1973 correlatively flood peaks were rare in june after that the date of the flood maximum was more variable late rising limbs and peaks i e in june increased two late events were also recorded in july 1988 and 1998 so the flooding season that was previously expected at the end of may is now much more unpredictable 4 3 2 secondary flood peaks rainfall events can create a secondary flood in the summer august or september a flood can be actually produced by local intense rainfall or by rainfall in the upstream basin however these summer events are exceptional table 1 as mentioned above bar full and bank full water levels are rarely observed in late summer and early autumn august september 18 events table 1 it would be more accurate to say were rarely observed before 1981 water discharge a little above 20 000 m3 s 1 occurred six times i e at a frequency of 0 22 time per year the longest durations were recorded in september 1959 12 days and in september 1973 16 days after 1981 the frequency and the intensity of these secondary peaks appear to be increasing with a frequency of 0 39 time per year they exceeded 30 000 m3 s 1 three times table 1 furthermore several overbank flooding events with exceptional peaks were observed at the end of summer at the end of august and in september 1981 25 days exceeding 20 000 m3 s 1 were measured with an exceptional peak at 33 500 m3 s 1 on september 2 the same observation applies to september 2008 with 16 days above 20 000 m3 s 1 and a peak of 36 700 m3 s 1 in september 2011 with 34 300 m3 s 1 and in august 2012 38 000 m3 s 1 thus these events are more frequent from the beginning of the 21st century recently secondary peaks that occur in summer or at the beginning of autumn started to occur with unprecedented frequency and intensity table 1 multi peak flooding was observed in several recent years in 2008 an inversion of the flood hydrograph was observed the secondary peak in september was higher than the spring flood fig 10 bar full level lasted 16 days and overbank flow nine in august 2012 four peaks higher than 30 000 m3 s 1 were recorded 4 4 high spatial resolution analysis of flooding the four study years represent a good panel of hydrologic situations in terms of flood intensity flood date and duration table 2 the effect of different hydrologic parameters on river dynamics can be analyzed here we report the changes we observed on different islands in the lena river between 2008 and 2012 4 4 1 floods and stream temperature the gauging station and the thermo buttons installed on islands in the river provided precise information on flood heights and duration first the four year study revealed high variability in flood peaks and duration table 2 three floods showed a steep rising limb 2010 2011 2012 fig 10 with flood peaks between may 15 and may 20 an exceptional breakup occurred in 2010 when discharge reached 51 600 m3 s 1 although flooding was catastrophic in the area of yakutsk it was short table 2 conversely in 2009 the ice cover melted slowly and the discharge increased progressively and reached maximum in mid june the floodplain and islands were flooded for a long time the year 2011 was dominated by two flood peaks the first one on may 15 and the second late one that was also more than 30 000 m3 s 1 on august 8 in 2012 several peaks exceeding 30 000 m3 s 1 occurred between mid may and the beginning of august causing long lasting flooding more than a month table 2 thus peak discharge and flooding duration are not necessarily correlated the thermo buttons provided more precise data on the beginning of flooding and its duration on the islands for example in 2010 fig 11 flooding began on may 18 23 00 at a discharge slightly below 30 000 m3 s 1 the water reached a button placed at a height of 3 m at 11 a m on may 19 confirming the very brutal beak up which occurred that year the water level began to go down in the morning on may 22 the emerged button at a height of 3 m showed a marked difference with the other buttons that were still submerged the thermo button installed 0 5 m from the ground showed flooding ended in the morning on may 26 on eselyakh island we measured the same flood which began 2 4 h earlier the two islands were submerged for nine days during this flood the water temperature was low ranging from 0 c to 2 c the graph of the temperatures measured by the thermo buttons in 2012 illustrates the increase in water temperature in spring and summer fig 12 during the first phase of the flood may the water temperature was 0 c 1 c equivalent to the temperature measured in may 2010 in june the second peak of flooding submerged the island with warmer water 10 c 12 c and in july the temperature of the water during the third and fourth flood peaks reached 15 c and 17 c respectively thus the stream temperature strongly increases from the beginning to the end of the flooding season 5 discussion examination of discharge between 1936 and 2012 confirmed that high variability is an intrinsic feature of the hydrologic functioning of the lena river and this can be seen at different time scales a recent historical record of siberian floods highlights different phases myglan and vaganov 2011 after a period of hydrologic calm 1680 1725 these authors observed more frequent spring floods after 1750 and more frequent summer floods in the 19th century on the lena river during early floods on april 27 1800 for example a brutal breakup with massive ice dams caused serious damage to villages summer floods destroyed pastures livestock and crops for example july 1745 because of heavy rains double peak events are also feared by local people for example in may and june 1765 when two flood events were recorded according to rowlands et al 2010 permafrost dominated regions are fundamentally different from their temperate counterparts 2010 p 230 in periglacial areas covered by continuous permafrost winter discharge can be supplied by deep unfrozen water by a potential talik or by sub surface water stored in the channel french 1996 brabets and walvoord 2009 watson et al 2013 woo et al 2008 ye et al 2009 established a link between the ratio of maximum to minimum monthly river discharge and the permafrost cover a high ratio is associated with an extensive permafrost cover 60 of the basin area in the middle and lower part of the lena river basin where the permafrost is continuous and thick the maximum minimum monthly ratio varies between 16 and 48 ye et al 2009 from the middle of the 1980 s to the end of the 1990 s the data covers the period 1936 1999 the ratio was markedly low even if no trend emerged the change was mainly due to the increased minimum river base flow in winter this change was identified by yang et al 2002 2004 from 1988 to 2004 at tabaga gauging site the change affected the monthly minimal discharge 12 in april our study shows that after 2004 both minimum and maximum discharge have been concerned with respectively 41 in april and 16 in june when calculating the ratio mean maximal monthly discharge to minimal monthly discharge with additional data fig 13 it clearly demonstrates that the diminishing trend of the ratio is confirmed for the 21st century fig 13 shows a good correlation between the mean air temperature at yakutsk and the ratio a cold year generally implies a high ratio and a low ratio corresponds to a warm year however since the beginning of the 21st century high ratios qmax qmin are more likely linked to a net increase of the maximal monthly discharge in june that strongly exceeds the increase of the low discharge in april for example in 2006 the ratio was very high 40 mainly due to an exceptional monthly discharge in june 43 000 m3 s 1 versus an average value around 24 000 m3 s 1 for 1936 2012 the same observation concerning the winter base flow was made by bennett et al 2015 for the yukon tanana and nuyakuk rivers in alaska whose basins are dominated by permafrost concerning the yukon river the increasing discharge in winter and in april reflects a greater supply of groundwater a general trend showing earlier breakup on the yukon and tanana rivers also accompanies the hydrological change brabets and walvoord 2009 watson et al 2013 also confirmed that continuous permafrost controls low winter discharge in small sub catchments in eastern and western siberia concerning the low lena river at kusur near the delta it has been shown that the cold season october april is affected by a significant increase in stream flow related to winter warming yang et al 2002 however the low lena river and the yenisei basins are mainly influenced by the hydrologic alteration caused by dams and reservoirs berezovskaya et al 2005 yang et al 2004 which is not the case in the upper and middle sections of the lena present study as these can be considered as pristine warm season hydrology is governed by different climatic and meteorological processes that act at different time scales a thicker snow cover accompanied by a warmer winter and or spring limits penetration of the soil by the cold wave and creates a thicker active layer muskett and romanovsky 2009 stieglitz et al 2003 the thickness of the active layer represents non negligible groundwater storage once again because of its huge basin the different sub catchments of the lena river react differently to the different parameters a reduction in the duration of the snow cover has been recorded in the mountains of south siberia whereas central and eastern siberia are still subject to longer lasting snow cover bulygina et al 2009 concerning permafrost according to fedorov et al 2014 the thawing index sum of positive mean daily air temperature provides significant information on the dynamics of the permafrost and of the active layer these authors identified different phases of warming and cooling and reported different reactions in the different regions of asia the central yakutia was hardly affected by arctic warming 1935 1945 and during the same period the thawing index was very slightly positive this phase was characterized by negative anomalies of the average annual discharge fig 4 the warm phase was followed by a period of cooling 1961 1970 expressed by a negative thawing index we can underline the fact that the mean annual discharge does not appear to be affected by the cooling phase as positive anomalies occurred between 1956 and 1963 followed by alternating positive and negative anomalies fig 4 the consequence of the cooling phase could be a slight decrease in the monthly minimal discharge 8 in april that could express a reduction in snow cover and delayed snowmelt and ice thawing no anomaly of the monthly maximum in june occurred during this cooling phase an increase in the thawing index was evidenced from 1988 to 1995 and the increase was much more pronounced after 2005 fedorov et al 2014 the increased occurrence of early floods at the beginning of may fig 6 fig 9 could also be explained by the early contribution of snowmelt and ice thawing earlier snowmelt and thawing of the active layer or of the ice covering the river in spring are expected along the lower 2000 km reach of the lena river 4 9 7 5 days earlier in the 2050s and 8 1 13 6 days in the 2080s prowse et al 2010 monitoring sites on siberian plateaus very close to our study site clearly revealed an abrupt change in soil temperature and in the depth of the active layer after 2004 iijima et al 2010 iijima et al 2016 soil moisture content and the depth of the active layer are increasing in parallel iijima et al 2016 according to these authors moisture and the depth of the active layer are closely linked to summer precipitation june to september and to the snow thickness both factors that have evolved synchronously since the beginning of the 21st century the combined effect of rainfall in late summer and snow thickness in early winter has a direct impact on soil temperature the main cause of these recent anomalies is the more frequent and or more intense advections of storms in eastern and central siberia iijima et al 2016 overland et al 2008 overland and wang 2010 shiklomanov and lammers 2009 before the 2000s summer rain was usually associated with a cool summer the association between wet and cool summers was also reported by myglan and vaganov 2011 for the historical period in contrast since the beginning of the 21st century a wet summer is synonymous with a warm summer iijima et al 2016 a pluviometric and hydrologic record occurred in 2007 shiklomanov and lammers 2009 however the following years far exceeded this ephemeral maximum wet years occurred between 2004 and 2008 linked with abnormal storm activity in eastern siberia precipitation maxima were recorded in yakutia in 2005 and 2006 more than 200 mm versus an annual average of 150 mm iijima et al 2016 shiklomanov and lammers 2009 calculated an exceptional water contribution to the arctic ocean in 2007 by six large russian rivers including the lena river the increased water supply 25 occurred in the context of a warmer 2 c and wetter 100 mm year runoff anomalies were observed particularly in three permafrost dominated basins and in parts in the transition between permafrost and non permafrost areas hydro climatic conditions over the northern eurasian continent depend on interactions between arctic sea ice pressure centers and the arctic dipole wind pattern serreze et al 2002 shiklomanov and lammers 2009 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 the increasing occurrence of cyclones in northern and eastern siberia depends on specific atmospheric fields in arctic regions in the summer a surface air temperature associated with sea level pressure creates an anticyclonic situation over north america and a cyclonic situation over north asia causing frequent intrusions of storms in siberia inoue and kikuchi 2009 shiklomanov and lammers 2009 iijima et al 2016 this recent change corresponds to the net increase in river discharge we pointed out with the exception of 2010 and 2011 all the years after 2005 exceeded the mean annual discharge by more than 30 fig 4 and the duration of flooding was also exceptional in these years the years 2004 and 2005 thus clearly represent a major transition in the hydrologic dynamics of the middle lena river the recent occurrence of storms in summer and the early autumn is probably the main cause of the multi peak hydrograph we identified in the decade preceding 2012 fig 9 and fig 10 it also explains the inversion of the hydrologic year we observed in 2008 with a higher flood peak in september than the normal peak in spring when comparing the daily discharge data with the air temperature and precipitation data yakutsk station several evidences can be detected concerning the origin of the secondary peaks occurring in summer we attempted to determine the origin of the secondary peaks the analysis demonstrates that a wet summer at yakutsk does not necessarily imply a secondary flood a wet summer is characterized by precipitation above 38 mm in august and 28 mm in september mean values for 1936 2014 the comparison between hydrologic data and rainfall data shows that a local rainfall triggers a hydrologic response i e a discharge increase when it exceeds at least 80 mm per month the determination of this rainfall threshold helps identify the main but not exclusive origin of a summer flood table 1 at tabaga there is actually no clear correlation between the occurrence of a secondary flood peak in august or september and the local precipitation few floods correspond to local rainfall events and when a flood peak triggered by a local rainstorm occurs it is very short table 1 in august 2006 a very humid period 151 mm caused a secondary peak during five days 2006 being the second wettest year since 1937 at yakutsk with 326 mm in 1960 a rainy august 120 mm created a secondary peak during two days thus the great majority of the secondary summer peaks mainly corresponds to a flood wave coming from the upper basin the change in the chronology of the river hydrology deeply can impact the river morphodynamics not only because of higher and longer floods but also because of warmer water the stream temperature of the lena river depends directly on the air temperature and the summer stream temperature has increased significantly costard et al 2007 the thermo buttons measured very warm stream temperatures in june july and august one of the most specific processes of periglacial hydrosystems is the thermal mechanical erosion of their frozen banks are 1983 costard et al 2007 tananaev 2016 during the high water stage the permanent contact between the water and the non cohesive frozen sediment results in rapid bank retreat and in the formation of specific forms such as thermal basal nichas and baydzheraks soloviev 1973 costard et al 2014 longer contact between the warm water up to 15 c in july as mentioned above and the bank implies a higher erosion rate furthermore it has been demonstrated that stream temperature is a key factor in thermal erosion an ablation velocity model constructed on the basis of a mathematical model and on laboratory simulations revealed that the efficiency of thermal erosion is mainly controlled by the temperature of the water costard et al 2003 thermal erosion does not necessarily require high discharge to be efficient bar full discharge which enables contact between the base of the bank and the water is sufficient to destabilize the frozen bank 6 conclusion by reporting on the hydrologic response of the middle lena river our study contributes to the demonstration of an arctic warm period overland et al 2008 overland and wang 2010 the concomitance of several hydrologic changes in the two decades preceding 2012 reflects a real change in the dynamics of the middle lena river the flood period is being affected in different ways spring monthly discharge has undergone a net increase caused by longer bar full and bank full water levels flood peaks are also more frequent and the date of the beginning of flooding appears to be less predictable both earlier and later flood peaks are observed late summer secondary peaks are much more frequent and more intense we assume that the increasing frequency of the secondary peaks is principally linked to more frequent floods originated in the upstream basin the hydrologic change is not only expressed by the flood intensity but also and mainly by the increasing duration of the flood discharges bank full and extreme discharges furthermore all changes mean annual or monthly discharges flood magnitude and duration appear to have been strongly reinforced since the beginning of the 21st century more precisely since 2004 2005 extreme hydrologic events are a major threat for society cred 2015 both flooding and low flow have a great effect on human and ecological systems even if the projected future impacts of climatic change are subject to strong regional variability and uncertainty approximately 450 million people who live in floodplains will face double the frequency of flooding in 2050 arnell and gosling 2016 arnell and lloyd hughes 2014 extreme hydrologic events threaten river infrastructure and navigation and flood risk management and water resources depend on a good understanding of hydrologic hazards that is particularly true in central and northern siberia where even if population density is very low around 0 3 inhabitants per km2 in the sakha republic social activities and industry are mainly associated with rivers the six main cities located on the banks of the lena river are particularly vulnerable to flooding the city of lensk was partly destroyed by the huge flood in 2001 sudden flooding of the frozen river caused a 16 m rise in the water level and flooded the two thirds of the city thousands of people in lensk were homeless and 1800 homes were destroyed a large flood of the angara river also occurred in 2001 kichigina 2013 in may 2010 a historic flood in the region of yakutsk led to the evacuation of thousands of people all the villages in the floodplain between pokrovsk and kangalassy were submerged the efficiency of the water discharges is reinforced by the increase in water temperature later and longer hydrologic processes are combined with much warmer stream temperatures both changes cause more rapid erosion of the frozen banks costard et al 2007 gautier et al 2008 the interactions between the duration of discharge and stream temperature affect the stability of the river bed a higher erosion rate implies an increasing supply of sediments to the river bed thus we assume that the mobility of the channels and islands certainly threatens numerous activities navigation and river infrastructure is destabilized or on the contrary sedimentation increases these developments will certainly disrupt economic activities in siberia which partly depend on the strategic role played by the river river infrastructure and navigation playing a key role rivers are used to transport people goods mining resources and gas and petroleum during the short summer acknowledgments these investigations were supported by the agence nationale de la recherche anr 07 vuln
