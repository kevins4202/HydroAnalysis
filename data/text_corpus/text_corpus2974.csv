14870,aluminum salts are widely used to immobilize phosphorus p in lakes suffering from internal loading however longevity of treatments varies among lakes some lakes eutrophy faster than others we conducted biogeochemical investigations of sediments of a closed artificial lake barleber germany that was successfully remediated with aluminum sulfate in 1986 the lake became mesotrophic for almost 30 years a rather rapid re eutrophication took place in 2016 leading to massive cyanobacterial blooms we quantified internal loading from sediment and analyzed two environmental factors that might have contributed to the sudden shift in trophic state increase in lake p concentration started in 2016 reaching 0 3 mg l 1 and remained elevated into the spring of 2018 reducible p fraction in the sediment was 37 58 of total p indicating a high potential for mobilization of benthic p during anoxia estimated p release from sediments for 2017 was approximately 600 kg for the whole lake this is consistent with sediment incubation results higher temperature 20 c and anoxia contributed to release of p 27 9 7 1 mg m 2 d 1 0 94 0 23 mmol m 2 d 1 to the lake triggering re eutrophication loss of aluminum p adsorption capacity together with anoxia and high water temperatures organic matter mineralization are major drivers of re eutrophication accordingly treated lakes at some time require a repeated aluminum treatment for sustaining acceptable water quality and we recommend regular sediment monitoring in treated lakes this is crucial given the effects of climate warming on duration of stratification in lakes which may result in the need for treatment of many lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords internal phosphorus loading aluminum sulfate redox conditions sediment p fractionation lake restoration success data availability data is provided in the supplementary information 1 introduction internal loading of excessive nutrient is often a long lasting problem in lakes that suffered from long lasting external nutrient loading foy 1985 jeppesen et al 2005 these lakes could remain eutrophic over a decade even after external loads have been reduced due to high p release from sediments søndergaard et al 2005 application of p binding agents in lake restoration has been practiced by lake managers for several decades huser et al 2016 lürling and oosterhout 2013 among the early treatments water column p was low and stable for just a few years after treatment whereas in other cases long term stabilization of low p concentrations in the water column lasted more than 30 years huser et al 2016 although it is known that lakes treated to immobilize p can switch back to a eutrophic state after decades of high water quality studies are rare that quantify responsible mechanisms because restoration efforts are not paralleled by concurrent water quality monitoring over the scale of decades and sediment studies are also only rarely done in such lakes here we provide p dynamics in a lake that switched its trophic state back towards eutrophy a phenomenon we call re eutrophication re eutrophication is likely to occur in shallow lakes i e 3 10 m mesman et al 2021 because of their higher ratio of sediment surface to water volume and higher temperature there are several potential reasons for re eutrophication insufficient reduction of external p loading huser et al 2016 changes in the catchment leading to increased external p loading jarvie et al 2017 saturation of the addition to p adsorption capacity from added p binding agents berkowitz et al 2006 excessive historical p in the sediment mobilized through sediment resuspension by wind or benthivorous fish jeppesen et al 2005 and high concentration of p bound to redox dependent iron hydroxides which is mobilized during anoxia einsele 1936 mortimer 1942 however for lakes with intermediate depth the cause of re eutrophication may be complex and far from conclusive because although also quite shallow they can become stratified and anoxic mesman et al 2021 lakes of shallow to intermediate depth are prone to shorter term stratification i e polymictic with sporadic anoxia in the deeper water which may result in release of redox sensitive p and subsequent decrease in n p ratios shatwell and köhler 2019 this can trigger self enhancing eutrophication in contrast to deep stratified lakes where summer anoxia commonly results in temporary accumulation of p in the hypolimnion particularly in its deepest layers anoxia in a lake of intermediate depth can result in rapid transport of released p into the euphotic zone by subsequent mixing events taranu et al 2012 therefore mixing events are a shortcut between sediments and the photic zone supplying p to the photic zone transfer of p from sediment to the euphotic zone can occur in hours transfer of p from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion is typically wind induced accompanying deepening of the epilimnion and erosion of the upper hypolimnion this paper focuses on lake barleber a closed lake formed by gravel mining in central germany restoration was successful for nearly 30 years a rather rapid increase in p concentration led to excessive cyanobacteria bloom in summer 2017 which prompted investigations into potential cause s of the re eutrophication rinke et al 2018 kong et al 2021 rönicke et al 2021 we seek to understand and highlight reasons for re occurrence of p release from lake sediments after al treatment and to determine and quantify underlying processes we hypothesize that nutrient enrichment was due to internal lake processes because the lake has no surface water inflows and almost all sediment is autochthonous gravel excavation lakes like lake barleber are widely distributed in the world and provide valuable habitats and ecosystem services mollema and antonellini 2016 seelen et al 2022 therefore management issues for lake barleber may apply to many of these artificial lakes with intermediate depth and low external loading first we wanted to quantify if increased internal loading explains the sudden re eutrophication of lake barleber second if this is true which combination of environmental factors contributed to the sudden shift in trophic state after almost three decades of low trophy invoked by an aluminum treatment in 1986 we investigated the causes of the re eutrophication in lake barleber by quantifying release of redox dependent p during phases of anoxia by multiple approaches we employed sediment incubation at different temperature and oxygen conditions p fractionation in the sediment and general sediment characterization to determine main processes of p release and quantify the solute inventory in the sediment we then compared these results with observed p dynamics in the field because internal p loading in lake barleber was substantially reduced by aluminum in autumn 1986 rönicke et al 2021 our findings are important for understanding the long term processes regulating p in such lakes and for evaluating the effective duration of lake restoration techniques using aluminum salts 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and historical monitoring data lake barleber is an artificial lake located near magdeburg germany 52 13 15 n 11 39 0 e fig 1 it has a maximum depth of 11 m mean depth of 6 7 m area of 103 hectares and volume of 6 9 million cubic meters rönicke et al 2021 the lake was created from gravel excavation at the beginning of the 1930s bauch 1953 it has no surface inflow or outflow but is fed by groundwater the lake was phytoplankton dominated during the 1970s of the last century klapper and geller 2001 the eutrophic state threatened the recreational use of the lake mostly swimming to safeguard a sustained recreational use the lake was successfully remediated in 1986 by applying 480 tonnes of aluminum sulfate klapper and geller 2001 this equates to a total of al3 dosage of 37 tonnes a volumetric dosage of 5 7 mg l 1 and an areal dosage 36 g m 2 one year later the lake switched back to a clear water status and macrophytes re established klapper and geller 2001 in 2017 31 years after remediation massive cyanobacterial blooms suddenly re occurred in the lake nutrients concentrations for 2013 2014 2016 and 2017 are shown in table 1 lake barleber is monomictic it experiences thermal stratification the hypolimnion is very small and restricted to the deepest part of the lake during summer and early autumn kong et al 2021 stable ice cover and thus stable inverse stratification rarely forms lake barleber has a net groundwater inflow due to the deficit created by evaporation from the lake surface which is greater than precipitation on the lake this deficit amounts to 190 mm per year which translates to an annual volume of 200 000 m3 hannappel and strom 2020 rinke et al 2018 annual groundwater inflow and outflow are 640 000 and 530 000 m3 respectively based on measurements in 2018 and 2019 hannappel and strom 2020 external p loads are low atmospheric deposition 42 kg yr 1 groundwater 13 kg yr 1 and bathing 10 kg yr 1 contribute insignificantly to the lake s phosphorus dynamics hannappel and strom 2020 rinke et al 2018 to understand the trophic state prior to the massive bloom in 2017 we analyzed lake barleber historical surface integrated

chambers at 6 c and 20 c and oxic anoxic conditions in the overlying water lower temperature was the in situ lake temperature at the time of sampling ca 4 c and similar to the hypolimnetic temperatures during early spring higher temperature was chosen as a realistic maximum sediment temperature for epilimnetic sediments in summer epilimnetic sediments in lake barleber extend to 8 m depth and therefore comprise more than 90 of the total sediment area experimental setup thus was a crossed 2 2 factorial approach with 3 replicates cores with temperature and oxic state as factors each with two values resulting in four treatment combinations oxic 6 c oxic 20 c anoxic 6 c and anoxic 20 c cores were wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid light penetration and algal growth cores were oxic prior to sampling anoxia was achieved by bubbling the overlying water phase of the cores with a mixture of n2 and co2 99 96 n2 0 04 co2 to maintain oxic conditions in the oxic treatments overlying water of cores was gently bubbled with air using aquarium pumps without inducing resuspension of sediment material dissolved oxygen was monitored by optical o2 sensors pyro science germany oxygen consumption rate was calculated as the rate of change in o2 concentration over time multiplied by the volume of overlying water and divided by surface area of the sediment core eq 1 section 2 6 2 redox potential ph and temperature were measured in the overlying water during sampling with a multi parameter meter fitted with conventional ph and redox potential electrodes wtw multi3430 germany to convert measured oxidation reduction potential orp to the standard hydrogen electrode potential a correction of 221 mv at 5 c and 211 mv at 20 c was applied we sampled 140 ml water for chemical analyses from the sediment cores and we refilled the cores with 140 ml of water from the lake the refill water was sampled in the lake about 50 cm from the sediment at the time when we extracted the sediments from the lake refill water was stored at the same temperature and oxygen status as the treatment i e anoxic treatment received water that had been treated by bubbling with a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in order to remove the initially present oxygen as a control for each treatment 0 5 l replacement water was introduced into a glass bottle and incubated at the same conditions as the cores this was done to separate the changes due to sediment from the changes occurring in free water and independent of the sediment water interaction the water overlying the sediment water interface in each core was sampled 9 times during the 35 day incubation period on days 2 3 4 7 10 14 17 21 35 controls were sampled every second sampling of the sediment cores all samples were analyzed as described in section 2 3 above 2 6 2 calculation of solute release rates calculation of solute flux for the incubation experiment was performed using the equation below from steinman et al 2004 1 s o l u t e f l u x c t c 0 v a 1 t 1 where s o l u t e f l u x solute release rate in mg m 2 d 1 c t solute concentration at time t in mg l 1 c 0 solute concentration at t 0 in

triplicate therefore the slope of the regression line from the linear fit was used instead of the term c t c 0 positive values indicate phosphorus release from the sediment negative values adsorption or binding of p to the sediment 2 7 water and sediment p budgets we quantified p in the lake in summer based on vertical gradients of tp concentration along the vertical axis of lake barleber in summer 2017 algal bloom and in previous summers no algal blooms we quantified total mass of phosphorus in open water of lake barleber from vertical profiles of tp at least sampled at four different depths maximum was seven depths and calculated a volume weighted total tp content by using bathymetric data of lake barleber we estimated annual total amount of p released in 2017 from the p flux rates and lake surface area these estimates were compared to the quantity of p in water and in the sediment 2 8 osgood index the osgood index osgood 1988 was calculated to estimate the mixing intensity of the lake and to assess effects of lake morphology on treatment longevity huser et al 2016 3 o s g o o d i n d e x z m a 0 5 where z m is mean water column depth m and a is lake surface area km2 when osgood index is above seven it indicates that the lake has stable summer stratification and a lower resuspension potential lakes with an osgood index below seven have unstable stratification are potentially polymictic and have a higher sediment resuspension potential 2 8 statistics we used t tests to determine if the incubation fluxes from manipulations were significantly different from zero we used anova to test whether fluxes of the four treatments were significantly different from each other tukey hsd test was used for post hoc comparisons all statistics were done using spss version 22 3 results 3 1 physical structure and water quality at the time of sampling in august 2017 the lake was stratified below 6 m with anoxia in the hypolimnion in november 2017 and january 2018 the lake was mixed fig 2 the hypolimnion created when the lake stratifies is very small kong et al 2021 the lake has an osgood index of 6 6 the ph varied with season fig 2 high ph of up to 10 occurred during the peak of algal blooms historical monitoring data for 2010 2013 and 2014 were very similar and characterized by relatively low concentrations of n and p fig 3 in all years the oxygen concentration dropped to values below 2 mg l 1 in summer the seasonal temperature trend close to the sediment was also very similar in all years increases for nutrients began during the growing season of 2016 elevated nutrient concentrations persisted over winter into 2017 fig 3 in 2016 the srp and nh4 n hypolimnion concentrations were 1 and 2 mg l 1 respectively in 2017 these concentrations doubled fig 3 3 2 porewater and sediment characteristics the solute gradients between porewater and bottom water favored release of nutrients into overlying water i e concentrations of solutes were higher in porewater than in overlying water fig 4 in particular for doc fe mn and nh4 n seasonal and spatial variability was high for srp doc so4 2 mn and nh4 n fig 4 oxidation reduction potential orp ranged between 157 and 20 mv it decreased in the upper 3 cm and remained constant in the lower sediment fig 5 percent water decreased with depth fig 5 with a considerable difference between the surface sediment 90 and the bottom of the core 60 sediment ph ranged from 7 5 to 8 1 across the sampling points but was constant with depth tp loi tc and tn were generally higher in the upper sediment than lower sediment there was a positive correlation of tp and tc pearson r 0 93 n 5 and tp and tn pearson r 0 98 n 5 aluminum fe and s concentrations were rather constant fig 5 3 2 1 p fractionation total phosphorus and the respective fractions in upper layers were systematically higher than in bottom layers fig 6 and showed strongest gradients generally in the upper 2 cm the tp at point ba1 in august 2017 was distinctly higher than for other sampling points in the upper 4 cm fig 6 the mean tp concentration in the upper 5 cm sediment was 1 mg p g 1 solid sediment in four cores an exception was the sediment core taken in august 2017 which had a high tp concentration of 5 mg p g 1 fig 6 the upper 3 cm of sediment were dominated by redox sensitive bd p which constituted 37 58 of total p in the sediment fig 6 while the remaining part was mainly organic bound naohnrp 25 39 and carbonate and apatite bound hcl p 15 32 the sediment below 3 cm had a balanced proportion of the bd and naoh and hcl fractions based on bd p fraction in the surface layers the sediments can be characterised as highly sensitive to p release through anoxia and reductive redox conditions which agrees with the incubation results see section 3 5 below easily available nh4cl p metal oxide bound naoh srp and refractory residual were very low p fractionation and subsequent analysis of metals of the 40 cm sediment core from ba1 revealed more information about the deeper sediment chemistry fig 7 the lowest p concentration was in the 38 40 cm there was a larger concentration peak at 28 34 cm and a smaller peak at 7 5 cm fig 7 the big p peak corresponds to the greatest naoh p concentration which indicates that the application of aluminum sulfate in the lake in 1987 this is also shown by a peak in naoh al in the similar depths fig 7b this peak spans over 6 cm which is an indication of sediment recycling for a longer time nh4cl p bd p and residual p significantly decreased with increasing depth while naoh p significantly increased with increasing depth fig 7 table 2 bd fe concentration was very low 0 1 mg g 1 and was more or less uniform from 28 cm to the surface fig 7 the bottom most layers have a lower calcium concentration and there is 3 fold increase in calcium at the surface sediments the p concentrations in the extracts was positively correlated to the following elements p in each fraction table 2 nh4cl p to ca and mn bd p to mn naoh p to al and mn and hcl p to ca and mn when we combined the nh4cl bd fractions we found that the nh4cl bd p was positively correlated to mn loi550 and loi950 table 2 the naoh al nh4cl bd p molar ratios increased with depth and ranged from 2 to 9 fig 7 naoh al naoh p molar ratios had a narrow range 3 to 7 and they decreased in the upper sediment layers 13 cm and also in the sediment depth 26 32 cm fig 7 the nh4cl p bd p naoh sum al sum fe was generally higher in the sediment below 15 cm in comparison to the sediment above the difference was 2 3 fold fig 7 the naoh al nh4cl bd fe molar ratio increased with depth and ranged between 5 and 51 and 7 to 37 respectively fig 7 naoh al nh4cl bd mn molar ratio widely resembled the changes of naoh al with depth fig 7b lower panel i e it increased with depth until 26 cm and decreased again from 34 to 40 cm sediment depth 3 3 solute fluxes from incubation experiments conditions during the incubation were maintained at the prescribed values for each treatment oxic treatments were kept oxic 95 oxygen saturation and anoxic treatments were kept anoxic 2 5 oxygen saturation oxygen over the course of the whole laboratory experiment table 3 redox potential remained relatively high for anoxic low temperature treatment despite the very low no3 and oxygen concentration but became negative in anoxic high temperature treatment which also had a lower ph compared to other treatments table 3 phosphorus srp dp tp nh4 n fe mn decreased under oxic conditions negative fluxes and increased positive fluxes under anoxic conditions table 4 the opposite pattern emerged for no3 n and so4 2 which were rising under oxic conditions and diminished under anoxic conditions doc showed a decrease in three treatments oxic low temperature oxic high temperature anoxic low temperature but increased in the anoxic high temperature treatment oxygen consumption for the high temperature oxic treatments was twice as high as in the low temperature oxic treatment incubations clearly showed that sediment borne p could only be released under anoxic conditions while under oxic conditions the sediment was even a sink for srp temperature increase from 6 c to 20 c led to a five fold higher srp release rates under anoxic conditions which for the entire lake resulted in a total mass flux of approximately 30 kg d 1 temperature is a major influencing factor for p release from sediments of lake barleber most of the fluxes for the treatments oxic low temperature oxic high temperature anoxic low temperature were not significantly different from zero based on t test table 4 all of measured fluxes for the anoxic high temperature treatment were significantly different from zero except for fe there was a significant difference between treatments p 0 05 for all fluxes except fe flux table s1 tukey hsd post hoc test confirmed that anoxic high temperature treatment was significantly different to at least one of the other treatments with the exception of mn table s1 4 discussion 4 1 longevity of al treatment lake barleber is a special case of a relatively young gravel extraction lake 90 years it was successfully remediated for about 30 years before we sampled the sediment and remained with low total p until 2017 in comparison to the mean treatment longevity of about 11 years for lakes treated with aluminum huser et al 2016 the main factors influencing longevity of water quality improvements after al treatment are al dose area hydraulic residence time and osgood morphological index huser et al 2016 an aluminum treatment dosage of 36 g al m 2 was applied to lake barleber the lake water has a residence time of 10 years hannappel and strom 2020 and an osgood index of 6 6 the magnitude of these factors are in agreement with the findings of huser et al 2016 i e al dose 15 1 g al m 2 high residence time and osgood index 5 7 lake barleber however does not meet the upper al dose of 44 7 g al m 2 observed by huser et al 2016 for lakes with similar or higher treatment longevity in addition sedimentation rate might play an important role in treatment longevity we hypothesize that lakes with lower sedimentation are likely to have longer treatment effectiveness due to the longer exposure of the aluminum layer to the water column i e limited aluminum burial lake barleber is a closed lake with no surface inflows and has a low inflow of groundwater therefore internal mobilization of nutrients from sediments into water are a predominant source of nutrients in addition lakes with long residence times are generally mostly influenced by internal processes huser et al 2016 monitoring data and incubation results point to the influence of temperature and dissolved o2 as the major cause of the excessive nutrients release monitoring data also clearly showed that elevated temperatures and low o2 concentration coincided with release of nutrients starting in autumn 2016 fig 2 the effect of temperature and low oxygen on nutrient release is well known gudasz et al 2010 jensen and andersen 1992 temperature affects mineralization processes and increase oxygen uptake leading to anoxia we also postulate from the water chemistry data in april 2017 that immobilization of nutrients into the sediment in winter of 2016 17 did not take place or was insufficient to reduce nutrient levels to those similar to previous years this is confirmed by data collected in the winter of 2018 2019 when a winter diatom bloom triggered by temperature and light intensity under ice cover occurred peak chlorophyll a concentration of 93 4 μg l 1 causing a reduction of the srp concentration in the water column from 337 to 242 µg l 1 and si from 1 55 to 0 05 mg l 1 kong et al 2021 it is not known if winter diatom blooms occur every year but it is clear that their occurrence has a huge bearing on nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton succession in spring as internal stores of p within the algal biomass can be quickly recycled into the srp pool once the algal bloom is mineralized 4 2 phosphorus release was predominantly redox dependent our results provide consistent evidence that redox dependent p release was the major process responsible for p release in lake barleber during summer this classical p release model is well known from literature einsele 1936 jensen and andersen 1992 mortimer 1942 nürnberg 2020 nürnberg et al 2012 however mn seems to be the major element binding p the correlation of the nh4cl bd p to nh4cl bd fe was low and insignificant we think fe is immobilized by sulphides hence the poor correlation this implies that mn may be a better indicator of redox dependent p release in lakes with a high sulfide content we also observed significant correlation of nh4cl bd p with loi550 proxy for organic matter content and loi950 proxy for calcium carbonates which implies that organic matter content and calcium carbonates play a role in the in mobilization and immobilization of p nutrients fluxes were highest under the anoxic high temperature conditions this shows that besides low redox potential also high temperatures enhance release of nutrients jensen and andersen 1992 dadi et al 2020 as shown by the correlations above thus redox potential and temperature work here synergistically and are major drivers of eutrophication lake warming indeed played a role a recent study shows that internal loading and lake warming explains 68 and 32 of the blooms respectively kong et al 2023 the self amplifying mechanisms between high temperature and low redox conditions are multiple i high temperature accelerate oxygen depletion and hence rapidly induce low redox conditions ii high temperatures also amplify mineralization gudasz et al 2010 and thus support nutrient recycling iii high temperatures induce a shift towards cyanobacteria paerl and huisman 2008 that have a high potential for bloom formation and such a shift comes along with low phosphorus sedimentation horn et al 2015 once a lake becomes eutrophic as what happened to lake barleber in 2016 there are also self stabilizing mechanisms at play given that the higher algal biomasses lead to higher sediment oxygen demand and a phosphorus accumulation at the sediment surface it is therefore not surprising that the algal bloom in 2016 stimulated bloom formation and a further increase in epilimnetic srp concentration in the summer of 2017 similar positive feedback mechanism of algal blooms have been observed in lake taihu qin et al 2021 the algal bloom that followed the srp release resulted in notable changes in the upper sediment layer i e the pn and poc in the upper sediment were higher than in the lower sediment layers most probably due to the rapid change in sediment composition after only one vegetative season the senescence of algal blooms led to an increase in easily mobilized p sources nh4cl p and bd p in the upper layers 4 3 sediment p adsorption capacity the tp concentration in the upper 5 cm of the sediment in august 2017 was 3 times higher 3 4 mg p g 1 than the other four cores 1 mg p g 1 the tp concentration of four cores is on the lower end of the scale in other lakes up to 7 mg p g 1 with an average of approximately 2 mg p g 1 hupfer 1995 the higher concentration observed in august 2017 could be either due to sediment focusing at the particular point and or calcite precipitation which has been observed in the lake in 2018 and has been attributed to algal blooms which raised ph to almost 10 seewald 2019 the calcite precipitation would have been driven by increased ph level in the lake due to the algal bloom leiser et al 2021 the relatively low sediment tp concentration in lake barleber can also be interpreted as an indication of limited p adsorption capacity release of redox dependent p requires a larger pool of sedimentary p adsorbed to iron minerals which compete with al for adsorbing p aluminum treatment of lakes shifts this balance towards al minerals whose adsorption of p is insensitive to redox conditions our results indicate that in lake barleber the p fraction adsorbed to redox sensitive metal hydroxides was relatively high and this was probably due to reduced p adsorption capacity of the sediment as a result of aging al minerals berkowitz et al 2006 we estimated the p retention by calculating various molar ratios commonly used as proxies for p retention huser 2017 james and bischoff 2019 kopáček et al 2005 nürnberg et al 2018 rydin and welch 2000 the naoh al naoh p molar ratio was 3 at depth between 30 and 34 cm and it increased to about 6 then started to decrease to 4 or 5 in the upper sediment the whole sediment column has naoh al naoh p molar ratios below the thresholds of 10 and 12 6 proposed by rydin and welch 2000 and de vicente et al 2008 respectively the naoh al naoh p ratios are however mostly within the range of 2 to 100 like observed in other lake sediments de vicente et al 2008 huser 2017 nürnberg et al 2018 the naoh al nh4cl bd p molar ratio was 7 after al treatment and decreased to 3 in the upper sediment the ratios are far below the proposed threshold of 25 kopáček et al 2005 the sum al sum fe ratio nh4cl bd naoh was higher at the time of al application and decreased 5 fold approaching the 3 threshold proposed by kopáček et al 2005 this is one ratio that seems to explain clearly the loss of p retention in the lake barleber sediments over time naoh al nh4cl bd fe and naoh al nh4cl bd mn molar ratios also clearly show the deceasing p retention capacity in the sediment over time however the fe ratios have more noise the noise of the naoh al nh4cl bd fe molar ratios could be due to different rates of immobilization of fe by sulphides formed as a result of sulfate reduction the naoh al nh4cl bd fe ratios have a clear trend which also enables the identification al peak at depth between 28 and 34 cm most of the molar ratios in literature are from short term laboratory experiments or lakes which have been recently treated 3 years this makes it difficult to compare the results of lake barleber to other studies the ratios increase with depth because the influence of the aluminum treatment is diminished upward in the sediment due to sedimentation of material with a lower p binding capacity lake barleber has a high background sulfate concentration before the treatment in 1986 the sulfate concentration was ca 500 mg l 1 and it increased to ca mg l 1 after the aluminum sulfate treatment rönicke and bahr 1989 in addition phosphorus sorption capacity by aluminum decreases with time anderson and berkowitz 2010 berkowitz et al 2005 thus adsorption sites might have been saturated because of 30 years of aging al is transformed from a poorly ordered amorphous solid phase to a well ordered gibbsite and this polymerization reduces surface area i e al floc sorption capacity for phosphate decreases over time berkowitz et al 2006 james 2017 kopáček et al 2005 another factor which contributed to reduced adsorption capacity of the sediments is the high concentration of sulfate and potential sulfate reduction this can lead to formation of sulphides which permanently immobilize the reduced iron released under anoxia through formation of iron sulphides thereby leading to a reduction of the active iron pool gachter and muller 2003 all this compromise the duration of the treatment effectiveness hence the need for a monitoring of the sediment geochemistry and potential treatment again based on this observation we would recommend that lake managers apply poly aluminum chloride instead of aluminum sulfate 4 4 sediment susceptibility to resuspension and focusing sediment naoh al revealed there is an al peak in the sediment 28 34 cm sediment depth which is likely due to the al treatment in 1986 the peak is not high which could be due to a high background al concentration in the sediment in comparison to the amount added during remediation as shown by another study lewandowski et al 2003 or due to sediment re suspension re working the thickness of the al peak layer is likely an indication of sediment focusing to the deepest area sampling point ba1 sediment focusing had also been shown in the study of james and bischoff 2019 if we take 28 cm depth as the marker for 1986 al treatment this implies an average sediment accumulation rate of 0 9 cm per year which is three times higher than the mean for lakes of 0 3 cm y 1 baud et al 2021 it is therefore plausible that sediment focusing occurs in lake barleber aluminum flocs formed after the application of al are light enough to be resuspended by wind or benthivorous fish as shown in other studies egemose et al 2013 a study on macrophytes in lake barleber indeed revealed relatively high activity of benthivorous fish which would explain the sediment re distribution lana plan 2016 in addition the sediment dry density in the upper sediment is distinctly lower in comparison to the deeper sediments this is expected since lake barleber is a closed lake and sedimentation is predominantly from autochthonous material which has a lower dry density and is highly susceptible to resuspension sediment susceptibility to resuspension increases with decreasing dry density of sediment layers jepsen et al 1997 we postulate that low sedimentation prolongs the duration of the treatment effectiveness because a thin layer of fresh sediment can easily be mixed into the al rich sediment layer i e the al rich layer is not completely buried but is rather mixed with new sediment as observed this is probably what happened in lake barleber which would imply that the treatment longevity is supported by the presumably low sedimentation rate in the lake due to the low productivity in the lake the quite gradual decrease of the naoh al fig 7b lower panel supports our interpretation that sediment resuspension and focusing is a permanent feature of lake barleber 4 5 phosphorus quantity in water and sediment lake wide tp in lake barleber in the time period from 1987 after aluminum treatment until 2014 showed amounts between 173 and 373 kg tp and the average amount was approximately 258 kg tp fig 8 based on water sampling in 2017 the total tp amount in lake barleber notably increased 8 fold and reached values of approximately 2160 kg this implies that from 2014 to 2017 approximately 1900 kg tp were mobilized from the sediments given a lake sediment surface area of 103 ha this translates to a flux rate of 0 6 g p m 2 year 1 633 kg year 1 anoxic incubation flux was 0 37 g p m 2 year 1 381 kg year 1 the p flux rate from sediment incubation is therefore an underestimation of the actual flux given that atmospheric deposition groundwater and bathing are low rinke et al 2018 this underestimation may be due to sediment heterogeneity since the sediment incubation was from one sampling point estimated tp content of 633 kg year 1 is ten times higher than total external p load of 65 kg year 1 i e atmospheric deposition groundwater and bathing hannappel and strom 2020 rinke et al 2018 interestingly the tp content of 633 kg year 1 is very similar to the mean bd p content of 790 kg in the upper 1 cm sediment layer fig 6 this shows that most of the redox dependent p in the upper 1 cm layer was remobilized into the water column it is therefore clear that internal p loading was the source of the observed increase in p concentration 4 6 potential mechanism for the sudden phosphorus release lake barleber is a classic example of a lake in which p release is controlled by redox sensitive metal hydroxides and hence the application of redox insensitive al was successful in controlling p release for approximately 30 years the lake is more prone to sediment mixing in the upper sediment layers we presume that sedimentation prior to the algal blooms was low closed lake this could explain why al treatment was successful after the al application the aluminum rich layer continued to be recycled via resuspension hence continuous adsorption of p for a long time unlike in high sedimentation systems where this layer can quickly get buried and become inaccessible the autochthonous sedimentation also leads to a decrease in dry density and this coupled with a potential decrease in al sorption capacity due to aging led to a start of the tipping fig 9 towards re eutrophication the lake became highly susceptible to anoxia especially considering the high bd p fraction of associated with the redox dependent hydroxides and decrease in the p retention as shown by molar ratios fig 7 post treatment monitoring of sediment p fractionation in the upper 5 cm is important to determine the extent to which the sediment loses its permanent al adsorption capacity for p 5 conclusion we have shown that internal loading can explain the shift towards eutrophy in a lake previously treated with aluminum sulfate the study also confirms the role of anoxia and high water temperatures mineralization of organic matter as the major drivers of p release after release the p stimulates algae leading to self sustaining algal blooms i e large p pools are within the algal biomasses during blooms in winter and summer and are quickly recycled into the water before p is permanently sequestered in the sediment we analyzed nutrient dynamics in lake that had been treated with aluminum sulfate three decades before eutrophic conditions returned we identified key mechanisms that finally lead to a eutrophic condition and provide evidence that many treated lakes at some time will require additional treatment for sustaining acceptable water quality there is need for more long term studies on the sediment in aluminum treated lakes especially on the long term aging of al precipitates development and application of a method for measuring the remaining p binding capacity of the sediment and or the al precipitates is required for the management of aluminum treated lakes funding this research was partially funded by the city of magdeburg landeshauptstadt magdeburg grant

14870,aluminum salts are widely used to immobilize phosphorus p in lakes suffering from internal loading however longevity of treatments varies among lakes some lakes eutrophy faster than others we conducted biogeochemical investigations of sediments of a closed artificial lake barleber germany that was successfully remediated with aluminum sulfate in 1986 the lake became mesotrophic for almost 30 years a rather rapid re eutrophication took place in 2016 leading to massive cyanobacterial blooms we quantified internal loading from sediment and analyzed two environmental factors that might have contributed to the sudden shift in trophic state increase in lake p concentration started in 2016 reaching 0 3 mg l 1 and remained elevated into the spring of 2018 reducible p fraction in the sediment was 37 58 of total p indicating a high potential for mobilization of benthic p during anoxia estimated p release from sediments for 2017 was approximately 600 kg for the whole lake this is consistent with sediment incubation results higher temperature 20 c and anoxia contributed to release of p 27 9 7 1 mg m 2 d 1 0 94 0 23 mmol m 2 d 1 to the lake triggering re eutrophication loss of aluminum p adsorption capacity together with anoxia and high water temperatures organic matter mineralization are major drivers of re eutrophication accordingly treated lakes at some time require a repeated aluminum treatment for sustaining acceptable water quality and we recommend regular sediment monitoring in treated lakes this is crucial given the effects of climate warming on duration of stratification in lakes which may result in the need for treatment of many lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords internal phosphorus loading aluminum sulfate redox conditions sediment p fractionation lake restoration success data availability data is provided in the supplementary information 1 introduction internal loading of excessive nutrient is often a long lasting problem in lakes that suffered from long lasting external nutrient loading foy 1985 jeppesen et al 2005 these lakes could remain eutrophic over a decade even after external loads have been reduced due to high p release from sediments søndergaard et al 2005 application of p binding agents in lake restoration has been practiced by lake managers for several decades huser et al 2016 lürling and oosterhout 2013 among the early treatments water column p was low and stable for just a few years after treatment whereas in other cases long term stabilization of low p concentrations in the water column lasted more than 30 years huser et al 2016 although it is known that lakes treated to immobilize p can switch back to a eutrophic state after decades of high water quality studies are rare that quantify responsible mechanisms because restoration efforts are not paralleled by concurrent water quality monitoring over the scale of decades and sediment studies are also only rarely done in such lakes here we provide p dynamics in a lake that switched its trophic state back towards eutrophy a phenomenon we call re eutrophication re eutrophication is likely to occur in shallow lakes i e 3 10 m mesman et al 2021 because of their higher ratio of sediment surface to water volume and higher temperature there are several potential reasons for re eutrophication insufficient reduction of external p loading huser et al 2016 changes in the catchment leading to increased external p loading jarvie et al 2017 saturation of the addition to p adsorption capacity from added p binding agents berkowitz et al 2006 excessive historical p in the sediment mobilized through sediment resuspension by wind or benthivorous fish jeppesen et al 2005 and high concentration of p bound to redox dependent iron hydroxides which is mobilized during anoxia einsele 1936 mortimer 1942 however for lakes with intermediate depth the cause of re eutrophication may be complex and far from conclusive because although also quite shallow they can become stratified and anoxic mesman et al 2021 lakes of shallow to intermediate depth are prone to shorter term stratification i e polymictic with sporadic anoxia in the deeper water which may result in release of redox sensitive p and subsequent decrease in n p ratios shatwell and köhler 2019 this can trigger self enhancing eutrophication in contrast to deep stratified lakes where summer anoxia commonly results in temporary accumulation of p in the hypolimnion particularly in its deepest layers anoxia in a lake of intermediate depth can result in rapid transport of released p into the euphotic zone by subsequent mixing events taranu et al 2012 therefore mixing events are a shortcut between sediments and the photic zone supplying p to the photic zone transfer of p from sediment to the euphotic zone can occur in hours transfer of p from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion is typically wind induced accompanying deepening of the epilimnion and erosion of the upper hypolimnion this paper focuses on lake barleber a closed lake formed by gravel mining in central germany restoration was successful for nearly 30 years a rather rapid increase in p concentration led to excessive cyanobacteria bloom in summer 2017 which prompted investigations into potential cause s of the re eutrophication rinke et al 2018 kong et al 2021 rönicke et al 2021 we seek to understand and highlight reasons for re occurrence of p release from lake sediments after al treatment and to determine and quantify underlying processes we hypothesize that nutrient enrichment was due to internal lake processes because the lake has no surface water inflows and almost all sediment is autochthonous gravel excavation lakes like lake barleber are widely distributed in the world and provide valuable habitats and ecosystem services mollema and antonellini 2016 seelen et al 2022 therefore management issues for lake barleber may apply to many of these artificial lakes with intermediate depth and low external loading first we wanted to quantify if increased internal loading explains the sudden re eutrophication of lake barleber second if this is true which combination of environmental factors contributed to the sudden shift in trophic state after almost three decades of low trophy invoked by an aluminum treatment in 1986 we investigated the causes of the re eutrophication in lake barleber by quantifying release of redox dependent p during phases of anoxia by multiple approaches we employed sediment incubation at different temperature and oxygen conditions p fractionation in the sediment and general sediment characterization to determine main processes of p release and quantify the solute inventory in the sediment we then compared these results with observed p dynamics in the field because internal p loading in lake barleber was substantially reduced by aluminum in autumn 1986 rönicke et al 2021 our findings are important for understanding the long term processes regulating p in such lakes and for evaluating the effective duration of lake restoration techniques using aluminum salts 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and historical monitoring data lake barleber is an artificial lake located near magdeburg germany 52 13 15 n 11 39 0 e fig 1 it has a maximum depth of 11 m mean depth of 6 7 m area of 103 hectares and volume of 6 9 million cubic meters rönicke et al 2021 the lake was created from gravel excavation at the beginning of the 1930s bauch 1953 it has no surface inflow or outflow but is fed by groundwater the lake was phytoplankton dominated during the 1970s of the last century klapper and geller 2001 the eutrophic state threatened the recreational use of the lake mostly swimming to safeguard a sustained recreational use the lake was successfully remediated in 1986 by applying 480 tonnes of aluminum sulfate klapper and geller 2001 this equates to a total of al3 dosage of 37 tonnes a volumetric dosage of 5 7 mg l 1 and an areal dosage 36 g m 2 one year later the lake switched back to a clear water status and macrophytes re established klapper and geller 2001 in 2017 31 years after remediation massive cyanobacterial blooms suddenly re occurred in the lake nutrients concentrations for 2013 2014 2016 and 2017 are shown in table 1 lake barleber is monomictic it experiences thermal stratification the hypolimnion is very small and restricted to the deepest part of the lake during summer and early autumn kong et al 2021 stable ice cover and thus stable inverse stratification rarely forms lake barleber has a net groundwater inflow due to the deficit created by evaporation from the lake surface which is greater than precipitation on the lake this deficit amounts to 190 mm per year which translates to an annual volume of 200 000 m3 hannappel and strom 2020 rinke et al 2018 annual groundwater inflow and outflow are 640 000 and 530 000 m3 respectively based on measurements in 2018 and 2019 hannappel and strom 2020 external p loads are low atmospheric deposition 42 kg yr 1 groundwater 13 kg yr 1 and bathing 10 kg yr 1 contribute insignificantly to

chambers at 6 c and 20 c and oxic anoxic conditions in the overlying water lower temperature was the in situ lake temperature at the time of sampling ca 4 c and similar to the hypolimnetic temperatures during early spring higher temperature was chosen as a realistic maximum sediment temperature for epilimnetic sediments in summer epilimnetic sediments in lake barleber extend to 8 m depth and therefore comprise more than 90 of the total sediment area experimental setup thus was a crossed 2 2 factorial approach with 3 replicates cores with temperature and oxic state as factors each with two values resulting in four treatment combinations oxic 6 c oxic 20 c anoxic 6 c and anoxic 20 c cores were wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid light penetration and algal growth cores were oxic prior to sampling anoxia was achieved by bubbling the overlying water phase of the cores with a mixture of n2 and co2 99 96 n2 0 04 co2 to maintain oxic conditions in the oxic treatments overlying water of cores was gently bubbled with air using aquarium pumps without inducing resuspension of sediment material dissolved oxygen was monitored by optical o2 sensors pyro science germany oxygen consumption rate was calculated as the rate of change in o2 concentration over time multiplied by the volume of overlying water and divided by surface area of the sediment core eq 1 section 2 6 2 redox potential ph and temperature were measured in the overlying water during sampling with a multi parameter meter fitted with conventional ph and redox potential electrodes wtw multi3430 germany to convert measured oxidation reduction potential orp to the standard hydrogen electrode potential a correction of 221 mv at 5 c and 211 mv at 20 c was applied we sampled 140 ml water for chemical analyses from the sediment cores and we refilled the cores with 140 ml of water from the lake the refill water was sampled in the lake about 50 cm from the sediment at the time when we extracted the sediments from the lake refill water was stored at the same temperature and oxygen status as the treatment i e anoxic treatment received water that had been treated by bubbling with a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in order to remove the initially present oxygen as a control for each treatment 0 5 l replacement water was introduced into a glass bottle and incubated at the same conditions as the cores this was done to separate the changes due to sediment from the changes occurring in free water and independent of the sediment water interaction the water overlying the sediment water interface in each core was sampled 9 times during the 35 day incubation period on days 2 3 4 7 10 14 17 21 35 controls were sampled every second sampling of the sediment cores all samples were analyzed as described in section 2 3 above 2 6 2 calculation of solute release rates calculation of solute flux for the incubation experiment was performed using the equation below from

triplicate therefore the slope of the regression line from the linear fit was used instead of the term c t c 0 positive values indicate phosphorus release from the sediment negative values adsorption or binding of p to the sediment 2 7 water and sediment p budgets we quantified p in the lake in summer based on vertical gradients of tp concentration along the vertical axis of lake barleber in summer 2017 algal bloom and in previous summers no algal blooms we quantified total mass of phosphorus in open water of lake barleber from vertical profiles of tp at least sampled at four different depths maximum was seven depths and calculated a volume weighted total tp content by using bathymetric data of lake barleber we estimated annual total amount of p released in 2017 from the p flux rates and lake surface area these estimates were compared to the quantity of p in water and in the sediment 2 8 osgood index the osgood index osgood 1988 was calculated to estimate the mixing intensity of the lake and to assess effects of lake morphology on treatment longevity huser et al 2016 3 o s g o o d i n d e x z m a 0 5 where z m is mean water column depth m and a is lake surface area km2 when osgood index is above seven it indicates that the lake has stable summer stratification and a lower resuspension potential lakes with an osgood index below seven have unstable stratification are potentially polymictic and have a higher sediment resuspension potential 2 8 statistics we used t tests to determine if the incubation fluxes from manipulations were significantly different from zero we used anova to test whether fluxes of the four treatments were significantly different from each other tukey hsd test was used for post hoc comparisons all statistics were done using spss version 22 3 results 3 1 physical structure and water quality at the time of sampling in august 2017 the lake was stratified below 6 m with anoxia in the hypolimnion in november 2017 and january 2018 the lake was mixed fig 2 the hypolimnion created when the lake stratifies is very small kong et al 2021 the lake has an osgood index of 6 6 the ph varied with season fig 2 high ph of up to 10 occurred during the peak of algal blooms historical monitoring data for 2010 2013 and 2014 were very similar and characterized by relatively low concentrations of n and p fig 3 in all years the oxygen concentration dropped to values below 2 mg l 1 in summer the seasonal temperature trend close to the sediment was also very similar in all years increases for nutrients began during the growing season of 2016 elevated nutrient concentrations persisted over winter into 2017 fig 3 in 2016 the srp and nh4 n hypolimnion concentrations were 1 and 2 mg l 1 respectively in 2017 these concentrations doubled fig 3 3 2 porewater and sediment characteristics the solute gradients between porewater and bottom water favored release of nutrients into overlying water i e concentrations of solutes were higher in porewater than in overlying water fig 4 in particular for doc fe mn and nh4 n seasonal and spatial variability was high for srp doc so4 2 mn and nh4 n fig 4 oxidation reduction potential orp ranged between 157 and 20 mv it decreased in the upper 3 cm and remained constant in the lower sediment fig 5 percent water decreased with depth fig 5 with a considerable difference between the surface sediment 90 and the bottom of the core 60 sediment ph ranged from 7 5 to 8 1 across the sampling points but was constant with depth tp loi tc and tn were generally higher in the upper sediment

total phosphorus and the respective fractions in upper layers were systematically higher than in bottom layers fig 6 and showed strongest gradients generally in the upper 2 cm the tp at point ba1 in august 2017 was distinctly higher than for other sampling points in the upper 4 cm fig 6 the mean tp concentration in the upper 5 cm sediment was 1 mg p g 1 solid sediment in four cores an exception was the sediment core taken in august 2017 which had a high tp concentration of 5 mg p g 1 fig 6 the upper 3 cm of sediment were dominated by redox sensitive bd p which constituted 37 58 of total p in the sediment fig 6 while the remaining part was mainly organic bound naohnrp 25 39 and carbonate and apatite bound hcl p 15 32 the sediment below 3 cm had a balanced proportion of the bd and naoh and hcl fractions based on bd p fraction in the surface layers the sediments can be characterised as highly sensitive to p release through anoxia and reductive redox conditions which agrees with the incubation results see section 3 5 below easily available nh4cl p metal oxide bound naoh srp and refractory residual were very low p fractionation and subsequent analysis of metals of the 40 cm sediment core from ba1 revealed more information about the deeper sediment chemistry fig 7 the lowest p concentration was in the 38 40 cm there was a larger concentration peak at 28 34 cm and a smaller peak at 7 5 cm fig 7 the big p peak corresponds to the greatest naoh p concentration which indicates that the application of aluminum sulfate in the lake in 1987 this is also shown by a peak in naoh al in the similar depths fig 7b this peak spans over 6 cm which is an indication of sediment recycling for a longer time nh4cl p bd p and residual p significantly decreased with increasing depth while naoh p significantly increased with increasing depth fig 7 table 2 bd fe concentration was very low 0 1 mg g 1 and was more or less uniform from 28 cm to the surface fig 7 the bottom most layers have a lower calcium concentration and there is 3 fold increase in calcium at the surface sediments the p concentrations in the extracts was positively correlated to the following elements p in each fraction table 2 nh4cl p to ca and mn bd p to mn naoh p to al and mn and hcl p to ca and mn when we combined the nh4cl bd fractions we found that the nh4cl bd p was positively correlated to mn loi550 and loi950 table 2 the naoh al nh4cl bd p molar ratios increased with depth and ranged from 2 to 9 fig 7 naoh al naoh p molar ratios had a narrow range 3 to 7 and they decreased in the upper sediment layers 13 cm and also in the sediment depth 26 32 cm fig 7 the nh4cl p bd p naoh sum al sum fe was generally higher in the sediment below 15 cm in comparison to the sediment above the difference was 2 3 fold fig 7 the naoh al nh4cl bd fe molar ratio increased with depth and ranged between 5 and 51 and 7 to 37 respectively fig 7 naoh al nh4cl bd mn molar ratio widely resembled the changes of naoh al with depth fig 7b lower panel i e it increased with depth until 26 cm and decreased again from 34 to 40 cm sediment depth 3 3 solute fluxes from incubation experiments conditions

oxygen over the course of the whole laboratory experiment table 3 redox potential remained relatively high for anoxic low temperature treatment despite the very low no3 and oxygen concentration but became negative in anoxic high temperature treatment which also had a lower ph compared to other treatments table 3 phosphorus srp dp tp nh4 n fe mn decreased under oxic conditions negative fluxes and increased positive fluxes under anoxic conditions table 4 the opposite pattern emerged for no3 n and so4 2 which were rising under oxic conditions and diminished under anoxic conditions doc showed a decrease in three treatments oxic low temperature oxic high temperature anoxic low temperature but increased in the anoxic high temperature treatment oxygen consumption for the high temperature oxic treatments was twice as high as in the low temperature oxic treatment incubations clearly showed that sediment borne p could only be released under anoxic conditions while under oxic conditions the sediment was even a sink for srp temperature increase from 6 c to 20 c led to a five fold higher srp release rates under anoxic conditions which for the entire lake resulted in a total mass flux of approximately 30 kg d 1 temperature is a major influencing factor for p release from sediments of lake barleber most of the fluxes for the treatments oxic low temperature oxic high temperature anoxic low temperature were not significantly different from zero based on t test table 4 all of measured fluxes for the anoxic high temperature treatment were significantly different from zero except for fe there was a significant difference between treatments p 0 05 for all fluxes except fe flux table s1 tukey hsd post hoc test confirmed that anoxic high temperature treatment was significantly different to at least one of the other treatments with the exception of mn table s1 4 discussion 4 1 longevity of al treatment lake barleber is a special case of a relatively young gravel extraction lake 90 years it was successfully remediated for about 30 years before we sampled the sediment and remained with low total p until 2017 in comparison to the mean treatment longevity of about 11 years for lakes treated with aluminum huser et al 2016 the main factors influencing longevity of water quality improvements after al treatment are al dose area hydraulic residence time and osgood morphological index huser et al 2016 an aluminum treatment dosage of 36 g al m 2 was applied to lake barleber the lake water has a residence time of 10 years hannappel and strom 2020 and an osgood index of 6 6 the magnitude of these factors are in agreement with the findings of huser et al 2016 i e al dose 15 1 g al m 2 high residence time and osgood index 5 7 lake barleber however does not meet the upper al dose of 44 7 g al m 2 observed by huser et al 2016 for lakes with similar or higher treatment longevity in addition sedimentation rate might play an important role in treatment longevity we hypothesize that lakes with lower sedimentation are likely to have longer treatment effectiveness due to the longer exposure of the aluminum layer to the water column i e limited aluminum burial lake barleber is a closed lake with no surface inflows and has a low inflow of groundwater therefore internal mobilization of nutrients from sediments into water are a predominant source of nutrients in addition lakes with long residence times are generally mostly influenced by internal processes huser et al 2016 monitoring data and incubation results point to the influence of temperature and dissolved o2 as the major cause of the excessive nutrients release monitoring data also clearly showed that elevated temperatures and low o2 concentration coincided with release of nutrients starting in autumn 2016 fig 2 the effect of temperature and low oxygen on nutrient release is well known gudasz et al 2010 jensen and andersen 1992 temperature affects mineralization processes and increase oxygen uptake leading to anoxia we also postulate from the water chemistry data in april 2017 that immobilization of nutrients into the sediment in winter of 2016 17 did not take place or was insufficient to reduce nutrient levels to those similar to previous years this is confirmed by data collected in the winter of 2018 2019 when a winter diatom bloom triggered by temperature and light intensity under ice cover occurred peak chlorophyll a concentration of 93 4 μg l 1 causing a reduction of the srp concentration in the water column from 337 to 242 µg l 1 and si from 1 55 to 0 05 mg l 1 kong et al 2021 it is not known if winter diatom blooms occur every year but it is clear that their occurrence has a huge bearing on nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton succession in spring as internal stores of p within the algal biomass can be quickly recycled into the srp pool once the algal bloom is mineralized 4 2 phosphorus release was predominantly redox dependent our results provide consistent evidence that redox dependent p release was the major process responsible for p release in lake barleber during summer this classical p release model is well known from literature einsele 1936 jensen and andersen 1992 mortimer 1942 nürnberg 2020 nürnberg et al 2012 however mn seems to be the major element binding p the correlation of the nh4cl bd p to nh4cl bd fe was low and insignificant we think fe is immobilized by sulphides hence the poor correlation this implies that mn may be a better indicator of redox dependent p release in lakes with a high sulfide content we also observed significant correlation of nh4cl bd p with loi550 proxy for organic matter content and loi950 proxy for calcium carbonates which implies that organic matter content and calcium carbonates play a role in the in mobilization and immobilization of p nutrients fluxes were highest under the anoxic high temperature conditions this shows that besides low redox potential also high temperatures enhance release of nutrients jensen and andersen 1992 dadi et al 2020 as shown by the correlations above thus redox potential and temperature work here synergistically and are major drivers of eutrophication lake warming indeed played a role a recent study shows that internal loading and lake warming explains 68 and 32 of the blooms respectively kong et al 2023 the self amplifying mechanisms between high temperature and low redox conditions are multiple i high temperature accelerate oxygen depletion and hence rapidly induce low redox conditions ii high temperatures also amplify mineralization gudasz et al 2010 and thus support nutrient recycling iii high temperatures induce a shift towards cyanobacteria paerl and huisman 2008 that have a high potential for bloom formation and such a shift comes along with low phosphorus sedimentation horn et al 2015 once a lake becomes eutrophic as what happened to lake barleber in 2016 there are also self stabilizing mechanisms at play given that the higher algal biomasses lead to higher sediment oxygen demand and a phosphorus accumulation at the sediment surface it is therefore not surprising that the algal bloom in 2016 stimulated bloom formation and a further increase in epilimnetic srp concentration in the summer of 2017 similar positive feedback mechanism of algal blooms have been observed in lake taihu qin et al 2021 the algal bloom that followed the srp release resulted in notable changes in the upper sediment layer i e the pn and poc in the upper sediment were higher than in the lower sediment layers most probably due to the rapid change in sediment composition after only one vegetative season the senescence of algal blooms led to an increase in easily mobilized p sources nh4cl p and bd p in the upper layers 4 3 sediment p adsorption capacity the tp concentration in the upper 5 cm of the sediment in august 2017 was 3 times higher 3 4 mg p g 1 than the other four cores 1 mg p g 1 the tp concentration of four cores is on the lower end of the scale in other lakes up to 7 mg p g 1 with an average of approximately 2 mg p g 1 hupfer 1995 the higher concentration observed in august 2017 could be either due to sediment focusing at the particular point and or calcite precipitation which has been observed in the lake in 2018 and has been attributed to algal blooms which raised ph to almost 10 seewald 2019 the calcite precipitation would have been driven by increased ph level in the lake due to the algal bloom leiser et al 2021 the relatively low sediment tp concentration in lake barleber can also be interpreted as an indication of limited p adsorption capacity release of redox dependent p requires a larger pool of sedimentary p adsorbed to iron minerals which compete with al for adsorbing p aluminum treatment of lakes shifts this balance towards al minerals whose adsorption of p is insensitive to redox conditions our results indicate that in lake barleber the p fraction adsorbed to redox sensitive metal hydroxides was relatively high and this was probably due to reduced p adsorption capacity of the sediment as a result of aging al minerals berkowitz et al 2006 we estimated the p retention by calculating various molar ratios commonly used as proxies for p retention huser 2017 james and bischoff 2019 kopáček et al 2005 nürnberg et al 2018 rydin and welch 2000 the naoh al naoh p molar ratio was 3 at depth between 30 and 34 cm and it increased to about 6 then started to decrease to 4 or 5 in the upper sediment the whole sediment column has naoh al naoh p molar ratios below the thresholds of 10 and 12 6 proposed by rydin and welch 2000 and de vicente et al 2008 respectively the naoh al naoh p ratios are however mostly within the range of 2 to 100 like observed in other lake sediments de vicente et al 2008 huser 2017 nürnberg et al 2018 the naoh al nh4cl bd p molar ratio was 7 after al treatment and decreased to 3 in the upper sediment the ratios are far below the proposed threshold of 25 kopáček et al 2005 the sum al sum fe ratio nh4cl bd naoh was higher at the time of al application and decreased 5 fold approaching the 3 threshold proposed by kopáček et al 2005 this is one ratio that seems to explain clearly the loss of p retention in the lake barleber sediments over time naoh al nh4cl bd fe and naoh al nh4cl bd mn molar ratios also clearly show the deceasing p retention capacity in the sediment over time however the fe ratios have more noise the noise of the naoh al nh4cl bd fe molar ratios could be due to different rates of immobilization of fe by sulphides formed as a result of sulfate reduction the naoh al nh4cl bd fe ratios have a clear trend which also enables the identification al peak at depth between 28 and 34 cm most of the molar ratios in literature are from short term laboratory experiments or lakes which have been recently treated 3 years this makes it difficult to compare the results of lake barleber to other studies the ratios increase with depth because the influence of the aluminum treatment is diminished upward in the sediment due to sedimentation of material with a lower p binding capacity lake barleber has a high background sulfate concentration before the treatment in 1986 the sulfate concentration was ca 500 mg l 1 and it increased to ca mg l 1 after the aluminum sulfate treatment rönicke and bahr 1989 in addition phosphorus sorption capacity by aluminum decreases with time anderson and berkowitz 2010 berkowitz et al 2005 thus adsorption sites might have been saturated because of 30 years of aging al is transformed from a poorly ordered amorphous solid phase to a well ordered gibbsite and this polymerization reduces surface area i e al floc sorption capacity for phosphate decreases over time berkowitz et al 2006 james 2017 kopáček et al 2005 another factor which contributed to reduced adsorption capacity of the sediments is the high concentration of sulfate and potential sulfate reduction this can lead to formation of sulphides which permanently immobilize the reduced iron released under anoxia through formation of iron sulphides thereby leading to a reduction of the active iron pool gachter and muller 2003 all this compromise the duration of the treatment effectiveness hence the need for a monitoring of the sediment geochemistry and potential treatment again based on this observation we would recommend that lake managers apply poly aluminum chloride instead of aluminum sulfate 4 4 sediment susceptibility to resuspension and focusing sediment naoh al revealed there is an al peak in the sediment 28 34 cm sediment depth which is likely due to the al treatment in 1986 the peak is not high which could be due to a high background al concentration in the sediment in comparison to the amount added during remediation as shown by another study lewandowski et al 2003 or due to sediment re suspension re working the thickness of the al peak layer is likely an indication of sediment focusing to the deepest area sampling point ba1 sediment focusing had also been shown in the study of james and bischoff 2019 if we take 28 cm depth as the marker for 1986 al treatment this implies an average sediment accumulation rate of 0 9 cm per year which is three times higher than the mean for lakes of 0 3 cm y 1 baud et al 2021 it is therefore plausible that sediment focusing occurs in lake barleber aluminum flocs formed after the application of al are light enough to be resuspended by wind or benthivorous fish as shown in other studies egemose et al 2013 a study on macrophytes in lake barleber indeed revealed relatively high activity of benthivorous fish which would explain the sediment re distribution lana plan 2016 in addition the sediment dry density in the upper sediment is distinctly lower in comparison to the deeper sediments this is expected since lake barleber is a closed lake and sedimentation is predominantly from autochthonous material which has a lower dry density and is highly susceptible to resuspension sediment susceptibility to resuspension increases with decreasing dry density of sediment layers jepsen et al 1997 we postulate that low sedimentation prolongs the duration of the treatment effectiveness because a thin layer of fresh sediment can easily be mixed into the al rich sediment layer i e the al rich layer is not completely buried but is rather mixed with new sediment as observed this is probably what happened in lake barleber which would imply that the treatment longevity is supported by the presumably low sedimentation rate in the lake due to the low productivity in the lake the quite gradual decrease of the naoh al fig 7b lower panel supports our interpretation that sediment resuspension and focusing is a permanent feature of lake barleber 4 5 phosphorus quantity in water and sediment lake wide tp in lake barleber in the time period from 1987 after aluminum treatment until 2014 showed amounts between 173 and 373 kg tp and the average amount was approximately 258 kg tp fig 8 based on water sampling in 2017 the total tp amount in lake barleber notably increased 8 fold and reached values of approximately 2160 kg this implies that from 2014 to 2017 approximately 1900 kg tp were mobilized from the sediments given a lake sediment surface area of 103 ha this translates to a flux rate of 0 6 g p m 2 year 1 633 kg year 1 anoxic incubation flux was 0 37 g p m 2 year 1 381 kg year 1 the p flux rate from sediment incubation is therefore an underestimation of the actual flux given that atmospheric deposition groundwater and bathing are low rinke et al 2018 this underestimation may be due to sediment heterogeneity since the sediment incubation was from one sampling point estimated tp content of 633 kg year 1 is ten times higher than total external p load of 65 kg year 1 i e atmospheric deposition groundwater and bathing hannappel and strom 2020 rinke et al 2018 interestingly the tp content of 633 kg year 1 is very similar to the mean bd p content of 790 kg in the upper 1 cm sediment layer fig 6 this shows that most of the redox dependent p in the upper 1 cm layer was remobilized into the water column it is therefore clear that internal p loading was the source of the observed increase in p concentration 4 6 potential mechanism for the sudden phosphorus release lake barleber is a classic example of a lake in which p release is controlled by redox sensitive metal hydroxides and hence the application of redox insensitive al was successful in controlling p release for approximately 30 years the lake is more prone to sediment mixing in the upper sediment layers we presume that sedimentation prior to the algal blooms was low closed lake this could explain why al treatment was successful after the al application the aluminum rich layer continued to be recycled via resuspension hence continuous adsorption of p for a long time unlike in high sedimentation systems where this layer can quickly get buried and become inaccessible the autochthonous sedimentation also leads to a decrease in dry density and this coupled with a potential decrease in al sorption capacity due to aging led to a start of the tipping fig 9 towards re eutrophication the lake became highly susceptible to anoxia especially considering the high bd p fraction of associated with the redox dependent hydroxides and decrease in the p retention as shown by molar ratios fig 7 post treatment monitoring of sediment p fractionation in the upper 5 cm is important to determine the extent to which the sediment loses its permanent al adsorption capacity for p 5 conclusion we have shown that internal loading can explain the shift towards eutrophy in a lake previously treated with aluminum sulfate the study also confirms the role of anoxia and high water temperatures mineralization of organic matter as the major drivers of p release after release the p stimulates algae leading to self sustaining algal blooms i e large p pools are within the algal biomasses during blooms in winter and summer and are quickly recycled into the water before p is permanently sequestered in the sediment we analyzed nutrient dynamics in lake that had been treated with aluminum sulfate three decades before eutrophic conditions returned we identified key mechanisms that finally lead to a eutrophic condition and provide evidence that many treated lakes at some time will require additional treatment for sustaining acceptable water quality there is need for more long term studies on the sediment in aluminum treated lakes especially on the long term aging of al precipitates development and application of a method for measuring the remaining p binding capacity of the sediment and or the al precipitates is required for the management of aluminum treated lakes funding this research was partially funded by the city of magdeburg landeshauptstadt magdeburg grant

14871,electro fenton ef process represents an energy efficient and scalable advanced oxidation technology aot for micropollutants removal in wastewaters however mechanistic profiling and quantitation of contribution of each subprocess i e adsorption at electrode coagulation radical oxidation electrode oxidation reduction and h2o2 oxidation to the overall degradation are substantially unclear resulting in difficulty in tunability and optimization for different treatment scenarios in this study we investigated degradation kinetics of a target micropollutant in an ef system the contribution of all possible subprocesses was elucidated by comparing the observed degradation rate in the ef system with the sum of the kinetics in each subprocess the results indicated that the overall degradation can be attributed to the synergistic action of the above mentioned subprocesses the radical oxidation accounts for 87 elimination followed by electrode reoxidation reduction of 7 7 these results not only advance the fundamental understanding of synergistic effect in ef system but also open new possibilities to optimize these techniques for better scalability in addition the methodology in this study could potentially boost the in depth exploration of subprocess contribution in other fenton like systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes electro fenton micropollutant profiling degradation kinetics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the accelerating discharge of harmful and toxic contaminants to aquatic environments has led to the development of various advanced oxidation technologies aots to treat these contaminants gao et al 2019 he et al 2021 horne et al 2020 landsman et al 2007 mousset et al 2021 aots utilize energy input from chemical reactions electricity light irradiation or ultrasound to generate free radicals that enable degradation of target contaminants and even complete mineralization bai et al 2022 luo et al 2018 luo et al 2021 miklos et al 2018 min et al 2022 for example fenton s reaction degrades compounds by generating oh through the reaction of fe2 and h2o2 fenton 1894 however scaling up this process is often thwarted by narrow ph application range large volume of iron sludge and excess addition of h2o2 therefore it is necessary to seek more efficient and green alternatives brillas et al 2009 dapaah et al 2022 electro fenton ef process is one of the modifications that were developed to overcome some of the limitations of the fenton process based on the source of fe2 and h2o2 in the system ef processes can be categorized into four types figure s1 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 khatri et al 2018 pignatello et al 2006 i in situ generation of fe2 and h2o2 fe2 is generated from iron anode and h2o2 from air sparging cathode ii in situ generation of fe2 from iron anode and external addition of h2o2 iii external addition of fe2 and h2o2 and iv in situ generation of h2o2 from air sparging cathode and external addition of fe2 among these type iv seems to be a more environmentally friendly system where the reactions occur as described below mousset et al 2016a 1 o 2 2 h e aq h 2 o 2 2 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 oh o h 3 f e 3 e aq f e 2 4 micropollutants oh intermediates mineralization o2 is used to generate h2o2 through the oxygen reduction reaction orr at cathode eq 1 then the h2o2 produced reacts with fe2 forming fe3 and oh eq 2 meanwhile fe3 regenerates fe2 by reduction in cathode eq 3 the resulting oh is nonselective and thus can oxidize nearly all organic micropollutants eq 4 the type iv system exhibits unique advantages opening up new possibilities to be explored in practical wastewater treatment it avoids the use of a sacrificial anode and boosts the fe2 fe3 cycle near the cathode the continuous regeneration of fe2 at the cathode also minimizes sludge production and the on site production of h2o2 avoids the transport and handling risks brillas et al 2009 feng et al 2010 most studies of ef processes focus on development of electrode materials and optimization of experimental conditions cao et al 2018 petrucci et al 2016 sopaj et al 2020 sopaj et al 2020 studied the role of cathode materials including carbon sponge cs carbon felt cf and stainless steel ss in the degradation of a pharmaceutical sulfamethazine their results demonstrated that the most effective ef system was pt doped cs reaching a mineralization rate of 91 at a current of 300 ma gümüş and akbal 2016 investigated the factors controlling phenol phoh degradation in an ef system they found that degradation and mineralization efficiency of phoh increased with increasing h2o2 concentration and current density while decreased with increasing initial phoh concentration and initial ph value these studies are inclined to infer causal relationships from experimental variables rather than providing insights on the reaction pathways in ef system thus offering limited guidance for extrapolation to practice in the ef system a combination of degradation removal processes may take place including 1 adsorption by electrode material such as carbon felt cfa 2 aeration 3 coagulation coag 4 h2o2 oxidation 5 electrode oxidation reduction eo r and 6 radical oxidation it should be noted that instead of degradation aeration and coag remove phoh from system to water and solid phases respectively yet there is no clear picture profiling each reaction pathway to treat micropollutants in ef systems resulting in difficulty in subprocess tunability and optimization for different treatment scenarios to facilitate quantification of subprocesses we selected phoh a persistent contaminant listed as priority micropollutant by u s epa as the target compound in this study we determined the degradation kinetics of phoh in the ef system and in each possible subprocess by comparative study the contribution of each subprocess to the overall degradation process was confirmed and profiled overall we aimed to provide kinetic and mechanistic insights into the degradation of micropollutants in ef systems facilitating its efficient full scale application in real wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials phenol 99 5 and p benzoquinone p bq 99 were purchased from macklin shanghai china ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o ar ferric sulfate fe2 so4 3 ar and chemicals for conductivity adjustment and solution buffer including na2so4 99 nah2po4 99 na3po4 99 and na2hpo4 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china 2 2 electrochemical method the schematic diagram of our ef system is illustrated in fig 1 briefly experiments were performed in a 500 ml semi closed and undivided cylindrical glass cell with two electrodes totally immersed in the solutions the cathode is a piece of carbon felt 6 8 0 5 cm and the anode is a cylindrical pt grid 3 3 0 3 cm in addition to the objective of this study we chose carbon felt as our cathode due to the fact that this material is commonly used in ef system and readily available the cathode was activated using sulfuric acid ca 3 m before application the distance between the two electrodes was maintained at 2 cm the current was applied constantly at 0 1 a by linear dc power supply gps 3303c guwei china to improve the conductivity of the working solutions ionic strength was kept constant at 0 19 m by the addition of na2so4 solution ph was measured by s220 ph meter phsj 4f leici china and was kept constant at 3 0 using 50 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs in addition to the maximum efficiency at ph of 3 for the fenton s reaction solution ph of 3 was selected due to the following reasons 1 in an extremely acidic solution ph less than 2 the current efficiency is low and h2 evolution occurs on the cathode surface significantly decreasing active sites available for o2 reduction 2 when solution ph is greater than 3 the majority of fe3 precipitates as fe oh 3 thereby decreasing the quantity of fenton s reagent brillas et al 2009 sun et al 2015 it should be noted that the purpose of this study was not concerning the application of ef processes in engineering practice thus we did not explore the optimization of ef system for narrow ph range under acidic conditions the aeration rate was set as 120 ml min 1 by electromagnetic air compressor aco 318 haili china and it was measured by a rotor flowmeter lzb 3wb shuanghuan china solutions were continuously stirred with a magnetic bar at 22 c to quantify each degradation subprocess in ef system six control experiments were set and compared the specific experimental conditions are tabulated in table 1 for cfa aeration coag and h2o2 oxidation subgroups the corresponding single variable was controlled and the first order rate constant k in each process was measured for radical oxidation other conditions were set the same as in the ef system except for radical scavenger the rationale of radical scavenging experiments is based on an underlying assumption that the added scavenger only quenches the target reactive species but does not significantly influence other reaction mechanisms in the system canonica and freiburghaus 2001 therefore the k value between scavenger and radical is expected to be greater than that between phoh and radical in this study p bq was selected as the scavenger for oh and ho 2 the k values of phoh with oh and ho 2 are 6 6 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and 2 7 103 m 1 s 1 bielski et al 1985 respectively whereas the k values of p bq with oh and ho 2 are 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and 9 6 108 m 1 s 1 bielski et al 1985 respectively although the k values of phoh and p bq with oh are comparable the concentration of scavenger p bq is significantly higher than that of phoh resulting in sufficient scavenging capacity of p bq huber et al 2003 note that p bq is not a typical oh scavenger tert butanol has been frequently used it was chosen due to its sufficient scavenging capacity in addition p bq exerted no reactivity towards phoh figure s2 for the eo r group other conditions were set the same except for addition of feso4 and aeration samples volume of 1 ml were taken from the reactor at a fixed time interval for quantitative analysis the samples were collected at 15 min interval for 90 min before quantification samples were filtered through an aqueous phase filter head with a pore size of 0 22 µm all the experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility 2 3 analytical method the quantification of phoh was performed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 20ad shimadzu japan with a 5 μm 4 6 mm 250 mm diamonsil c18 column chromatography peak was monitored at the wavelength of 271 nm with mobile phase flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the composition of the mobile phase was 28 pbs and 72 methanol and the injection volume was set to be 10 μl the total iron spiked to the system was 100 µm the quantification of fe2 was conducted using the o phenanthroline colorimetric method komadel 1988 and the concentration of fe3 was determined by the subtraction of the measured concentration of fe2 from total iron dosing to the system h2o2 in aqueous samples was determined by spectrophotometric analysis using potassium titanium oxalate method sellers 1980 visual minteq 3 1 chemical software for the calculation of metal speciation and solubility equilibria gustafsson 2013 was used to investigate the equilibrium speciation of fe2 and fe3 with the initial fe2 concentration of 100 µm fixed ph of 3 0 and electrode potential of 1 4 v 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation in ef system the degradation kinetics of phoh in our ef system is illustrated in fig 2a black line and it was fit to the pseudo first order model with r 2 close to unity the removal efficiency achieved 92 1 after 90 min treatment and the overall pseudo first order rate constant k overall was determined to be 0 0262 min 1 the high removal efficiency was in good agreement with previous studies mousset et al 2016b pimentel et al 2008 pimentel et al 2008 investigated the oxidation of phoh in an ef process using cf cathode under the condition of 60 ma and 0 1 mm feso4 the complete removal of phoh at initial concentration of 1 mm took place at approximately 100 min and the k overall was reported to be 0 037 min 1 however k values are condition dependent table 2 another k overall for phoh degradation from the study of mousset et al 2016b differed significantly from that of pimentel et al 2008 they investigated the phoh degradation performance using cf as cathode under conditions of fe2 0 1 mm ph 3 and s o 4 2 50 mm after 180 min treatment the degradation of phoh was 73 with the k overall of 0 0074 min 1 these studies demonstrated that the k overall values are highly dependent on experimental conditions resulting in the lack of comparability between experiments in addition to kinetic determination we also performed the mechanistic analysis and quantification of subprocess contributions to the overall degradation profiling these degradation pathways underscore the new opportunity for increasing subprocess tunability and opens up a new horizon for in depth investigations of other complex fenton like systems 3 2 profiling degradation in subprocesses 3 2 1 radical oxidation radicals such as oh and ho 2 o 2 are frequently reported to be present in the ef system eqs 2 and 5 12 brillas 2022 casado et al 2006 chou et al 1999 oh is produced in large quantity in the fenton s reaction eqs 2 and 5 it is a strongly reactive agent with a high redox potential of 2 8 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she latimer 1952 in the ef system a fenton like reaction also generates ho 2 with the oxidation potential of 1 65 v eq 6 bard et al 1985 ho 2 can reduce the fe3 to fe2 eq 11 in addition o2 can be reduced at cathode to produce o 2 with the oxidation potential of 0 89 v eq 8 halliwell and gutteridge 2015 with the solution ph 3 ho 2 is the dominant species due to its pk a of 4 8 eq 12 thus factoring out the contribution of o 2 bielski et al 1985 note that in the subprocess of radical oxidation we did not specifically distinguish the contribution of oh and ho 2 to phoh degradation as our purpose was to quantify the contribution of all radicals collectively to the degradation 5 h 2 o oh e aq h 6 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 ho 2 h 7 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o 8 o 2 e aq o 2 9 h 2 o 2 oh o 2 h 2 o h 10 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 o 2 2 h 11 f e 3 ho 2 f e 2 o 2 h 12 o 2 h ho 2 the degradation kinetics of phoh at different p bq concentrations 0 1 2 5 10 and 15 mm were investigated to determine an appropriate initial concentration so as to be maximally effective but low enough so as to not affect solution polarity fig 3 illustrates that when p bq initial concentration increased to 10 mm the observed phoh degradation was essentially unchanged around 0 0026 min 1 indicating that p bq can sufficiently scavenge oh and ho 2 in addition the k values of p bq with oh and ho 2 are 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and 9 6 108 m 1 s 1 respectively and the concentration of scavenger p bq is significantly higher than that of phoh resulting in sufficient scavenging capacity of p bq hence the appropriate p bq concentration was determined to be 10 mm fig 2a blue line shows the degradation kinetics of phoh in the presence of radical scavenger p bq at 10 mm the k rs value was determined to be 0 0023 min 1 comparing to without p bq k overall 0 0262 min 1 it can be concluded that p bq significantly inhibited the degradation of phoh due to its competition with oh and ho 2 in the ef system 13 k radicals k overall k rs with eq 13 k radicals was determined to be 0 0239 min 1 and the contribution of free radicals accounted for 87 of phoh degradation representing the major pathway 3 2 2 electrode oxidation reduction eo r many studies reported that the degradation of micropollutants may be due to anodic oxidation in the ef system kishimoto and matsuda 2009 li et al 2016 logue and westall 2003 anodic oxidation can be through either direct or indirect routes with direct oxidation micropollutants are oxidized after adsorption on the anode surface without involvement of any other substances the occurrence of direct oxidation process is linked to the applied voltage under our operating conditions the anode electrode potential was set to be 1 4 v which is higher than the oxidation potential of phoh 0 79 v canonica et al 2000 indicating thermodynamic feasibility of direct oxidation with indirect oxidation although it does not directly exchange electrons with the electrode surface the micropollutant rather reacts with active species produced on the anode surface in addition phoh can be also degraded by reduction at the cathode in this study we did not make a detailed distinction between oxidation at the anode and reduction at the cathode fig 2b indicates that the degradation efficiency of phoh is 21 with 90 min treatment the slope of the blue line indicates that the k eo r of phoh is 0 0021 min 1 and the contribution of this subprocess to the overall degradation was only 7 gattrell and kirk 1993 studied the phoh degradation process in an electrochemical system with a platinum electrode and ph around 1 they observed a low degradation efficiency and attributed it to electrode passivation they indicated that the phoh radical generated at the anode tended to polymerize forming a film on the electrode surface then this film prevents the exchange of fresh reactive species at interface and reduced the available overpotential to initiate the degradation of phoh it should be noted that phoh polymerization is unlikely to take place in the ef system therefore it is possible that the 7 contribution for direct electrode reaction is the upper limit 3 2 3 other subprocesses cf is a commonly used cathode due to its good electrical conductivity and it is a flexible three dimensional cross linked network structure composed of carbon fibers with a highly developed microporous structure vilella et al 2005 this structure also exhibits a high adsorption capacity and broad spectrum selectivity suggesting a possible removal pathway in the system thus we investigated the contribution of cf adsorption to phoh degradation the adsorption kinetics result is shown in fig 2c blue line the k cfa was measured to be only 5 10 4 min 1 and the contribution of cf adsorption to phoh removal is trivial in principle there are two types of adsorption on an electrode namely physisorption and chemisorption physisorption is due to van der waals forces and neither the adsorbed molecule nor the electrode surface composition will be changed chemisorption indicates that there is chemical interaction e g redox or coordination between the adsorbed molecule and electrode surface leading to the rearrangement of atoms and destruction of chemical bonds our observation did not support the occurrence of physisorption and chemisorption in ef system note that under energized conditions there may be electrosorption in the system electrosorption is the formation of an electrostatic field between electrodes through an applied voltage bayram and ayranci 2010 ayranci and conway 2001 used in situ spectroscopy to study the adsorption and electrosorption behavior of phoh at high area cf electrodes they found that the process of electrosorption of phoh was affected by its degree of dissociation pk a of 9 8 in the solution however in our ef system the solution ph was buffered at 3 where phoh is in the neutral form the external electric field cannot drive its directional movement and enrichment on the cathode surface therefore no electrosorption occurs in this system explaining the trivial adsorption removal pathway aeration process is a physical treatment process to remove volatile substances from wastewaters and this process uses large volume of air to transfer volatile micropollutants from wastewater into the air stream a micropollutant is determined to be essentially nonvolatile with henry s law constant k h less than 3 10 7 atm m3 mol 1 dean 1999 the k h of phoh is 3 33 10 7 atm m3 mol 1 suggesting a nonnegligible volatility thus it is necessary to consider this removal route in the ef system in the aeration process the removal of micropollutants can occur via stripping by the turbulence of aeration and or the oxidation by o2 we do not make a detailed distinction between these physical processes and oxidation and refer it to aeration process the aeration subprocess is shown in fig 2d blue line the k aeration was fitted to be 4 10 4 min 1 and the aeration process only contributes 1 5 to the overall degradation of phoh also a trivial pathway the redox potential of h2o2 is about 1 76 v latimer 1952 exerting oxidative capacity to some extent in the ef system h2o2 is generated from o2 by oxygen reduction reaction while h2o2 is continuously consumed by participating in the fenton s reaction and electrode reaction within the reaction vessel the concentration of h2o2 will reach a steady state the steady state concentration after 90 min treatment was measured to be 161 μm therefore we used 161 μm to test the h2o2 oxidation subprocess the degradation kinetics is shown in fig 2e and the k h 2 o 2 was measured to be 2 10 4 min 1 and the degradation efficiency of phoh was only 0 73 similar results were obtained by wang et al 2013 who investigated the application of schweitmanite as a fenton like catalyst in the oxidation of phoh by h2o2 they observed that phoh was not significantly degraded after 5 hr in the presence of only h2o2 in the ef system fe2 and fe3 may hydrolyze forming solid fe oh 2 fe oh 3 and other complexes these precipitates potentially capture and sweep micropollutants from the system removing them by coagulation coag in this subprocess only feso4 and fe2 so4 3 were added to simulate the fe2 fe3 conversion process in the ef system and potential was not applied the iron concentration was added based on the concentration of fe2 and fe3 measured at the end of the treatment i e 90 min the concentrations of fe2 and fe3 were measured to be 86 1 and 13 9 μm respectively to analyze the effect of the coag subprocess on the degradation of phoh a pourbaix diagram representing the variation of equilibrium potential of the reactions with ph was plotted in fig 4 based on eqs 14 22 three solid phases i e fe oh 2 fe oh 3 and fe3o4 and three ionic species i e fe2 fe3 and fe oh 2 were included and possible reactions involved in the system are as follows 14 f e 3 e aq f e 2 15 fe oh 2 h e aq f e 2 h 2 o 16 fe oh 3 3 h e aq f e 2 3 h 2 o 17 3 fe oh 3 h e aq f e 3 o 4 5 h 2 o 18 f e 3 o 4 8 h

stability zone red star in fig 4 interestingly we did not observe any formation of fe oh 3 during the course of reaction this could be due to the fact that the solubility product of fe oh 3 is less than the solubility product constant and fe oh 3 does not precipitate the results from visual minteq 3 1 also support this speculation at infinite thermodynamic equilibrium fe2 would eventually be converted to fe3 and fe3 would exist mainly as fe oh 2 accounting for 77 2 of the total fe3 the remaining species are fe oh 2 and free fe3 but no fe oh 3 precipitation takes place the k coag of phoh degradation was determined to be 3 10 4 min 1 fig 2f and the contribution to the overall degradation was only 1 09 also an insignificant removal pathway 3 2 4 sum of subprocesses the k of the above mentioned subprocess was determined to be 0 0274 min 1 23 k total k cfa k aeration k coag k h 2 o 2 k radicals k eo r the k total accounts for 104 1 of the overall removal process k overall of 0 0262 min 1 in the ef system the uncertainty analysis is shown in table s1 the agreement between the measured k overall and k total of each pathway suggested that no other subprocesses were missing the contribution of each subprocess to the overall k of phoh degradation is shown in table 3 the radical degradation contributed the most with 87 and followed by the eo r 7 7 and other subprocesses only about 5 note that the slight overestimation 4 could be due to the fact that the indirect route by radicals in the eo r subprocess can arguably be part of the radical oxidation thus their contribution might have overlapped the small discrepancy between k total and k overall could be also attributed to the uncertainty thus confirming the complete consideration of all the subprocesses covered in this study 4 conclusions in this study we investigated possible degradation subprocesses in the ef system including carbon felt adsorption aeration coagulation h2o2 oxidation electrode reoxidation reduction and radical oxidation we adopted complementary experimental and theoretical approaches to determine the degradation kinetics of phoh with the comparison of k overall and the sum of the k values of the subprocesses it was confirmed that the overall degradation of phoh can be attributed to the synergistic action of the above mentioned subprocesses among these the radical oxidation plays a major role accounting for 87 the eo r process also represents non negligible contribution 7 7 and we speculated that constrain of eo r process could occur due to electrode passivation gattrell and kirk 1993 sivagami et al 2023 these findings make a significant stride in mechanism elucidation in the ef system paving a new avenue to control these subprocesses in different treatment scenarios for better degradation efficiency we also suggested that this methodology can be used in other micropollutants and or other complex fenton like systems e g photo fenton and sono fenton for pathway elucidation it should be noted that when this comparative methodology is applied to other micropollutants in ef systems quantification of each subprocess surely varies this is also true for other fenton like systems however we emphasized that this quantitative profiling methodology for a complex system can be extrapolated to other systems in particular to quantify each subprocess all possible degradation subprocesses need be considered then one sets up a single variable experiment to exclude other interferences ultimately confirming and profiling the contribution of each subprocess to the overall degradation kinetics understandings of contribution of each subprocess may provide a variety of emerging options for micropollutant treatments in practical engineering process declaration of

14871,electro fenton ef process represents an energy efficient and scalable advanced oxidation technology aot for micropollutants removal in wastewaters however mechanistic profiling and quantitation of contribution of each subprocess i e adsorption at electrode coagulation radical oxidation electrode oxidation reduction and h2o2 oxidation to the overall degradation are substantially unclear resulting in difficulty in tunability and optimization for different treatment scenarios in this study we investigated degradation kinetics of a target micropollutant in an ef system the contribution of all possible subprocesses was elucidated by comparing the observed degradation rate in the ef system with the sum of the kinetics in each subprocess the results indicated that the overall degradation can be attributed to the synergistic action of the above mentioned subprocesses the radical oxidation accounts for 87 elimination followed by electrode reoxidation reduction of 7 7 these results not only advance the fundamental understanding of synergistic effect in ef system but also open new possibilities to optimize these techniques for better scalability in addition the methodology in this study could potentially boost the in depth exploration of subprocess contribution in other fenton like systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes electro fenton micropollutant profiling degradation kinetics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the accelerating discharge of harmful and toxic contaminants to aquatic environments has led to the development of various advanced oxidation technologies aots to treat these contaminants gao et al 2019 he et al 2021 horne et al 2020 landsman et al 2007 mousset et al 2021 aots utilize energy input from chemical reactions electricity light irradiation or ultrasound to generate free radicals that enable degradation of target contaminants and even complete mineralization bai et al 2022 luo et al 2018 luo et al 2021 miklos et al 2018 min et al 2022 for example fenton s reaction degrades compounds by generating oh through the reaction of fe2 and h2o2 fenton 1894 however scaling up this process is often thwarted by narrow ph application range large volume of iron sludge and excess addition of h2o2 therefore it is necessary to seek more efficient and green alternatives brillas et al 2009 dapaah et al 2022 electro fenton ef process is one of the modifications that were developed to overcome some of the limitations of the fenton process based on the source of fe2 and h2o2 in the system ef processes can be categorized into four types figure s1 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 khatri et al 2018 pignatello et al 2006 i in situ generation of fe2 and h2o2 fe2 is generated from iron anode and h2o2 from air sparging cathode ii in situ generation of fe2 from iron anode and external addition of h2o2 iii external addition of fe2 and h2o2 and iv in situ generation of h2o2 from air sparging cathode and external addition of fe2 among these type iv seems to be a more environmentally friendly system where the reactions occur as described below mousset et al 2016a 1 o 2 2 h e aq h 2 o 2 2 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 oh o h 3 f e 3 e aq f e 2 4 micropollutants oh intermediates mineralization o2 is used to generate h2o2 through the oxygen reduction reaction orr at cathode eq 1 then the h2o2 produced reacts with fe2 forming fe3 and oh eq 2 meanwhile fe3 regenerates fe2 by reduction in cathode eq 3 the resulting oh is nonselective and thus can oxidize nearly all organic micropollutants eq 4 the type iv system exhibits unique advantages opening up new possibilities to be explored in practical wastewater treatment it avoids the use of a sacrificial anode and boosts the fe2 fe3 cycle near the cathode the continuous regeneration of fe2 at the cathode also minimizes sludge production and the on site production of h2o2 avoids the transport and handling risks brillas et al 2009 feng et al 2010 most studies of ef processes focus on development of electrode materials and optimization of experimental conditions cao et al 2018 petrucci et al 2016 sopaj et al 2020 sopaj et al 2020 studied the role of cathode materials including carbon sponge cs carbon felt cf and stainless steel ss in the degradation of a pharmaceutical sulfamethazine their results demonstrated that the most effective ef system was pt doped cs reaching a mineralization rate of 91 at a current of 300 ma gümüş and akbal 2016 investigated the factors controlling phenol phoh degradation in an ef system they found that degradation and mineralization efficiency of phoh increased with increasing h2o2 concentration and current density while decreased with increasing initial phoh concentration and initial ph value these studies are inclined to infer causal relationships from experimental variables rather than providing insights on the reaction pathways in ef system thus offering limited guidance for extrapolation to practice in the ef system a combination of degradation removal processes may take place including 1 adsorption by electrode material such as carbon felt cfa 2 aeration 3 coagulation coag 4 h2o2 oxidation 5 electrode oxidation reduction eo r and 6 radical oxidation it should be noted that instead of degradation aeration and coag remove phoh from system to water and solid phases respectively yet there is no clear picture profiling each reaction pathway to treat micropollutants in ef systems resulting in difficulty in subprocess tunability and optimization for different treatment scenarios to facilitate quantification of subprocesses we selected phoh a persistent contaminant listed as priority micropollutant by u s epa as the target compound in this study we determined the degradation kinetics of phoh in the ef system and in each possible subprocess by comparative study the contribution of each subprocess to the overall degradation process was confirmed and profiled overall we aimed to provide kinetic and mechanistic insights into the degradation of micropollutants in ef systems facilitating its efficient full scale application in real wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials phenol 99 5 and p benzoquinone p bq 99 were purchased from macklin shanghai china ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o ar ferric sulfate fe2 so4 3 ar and chemicals for conductivity adjustment and solution buffer including na2so4 99 nah2po4 99 na3po4 99 and na2hpo4 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china 2 2 electrochemical method the schematic diagram of our ef system is illustrated in fig 1 briefly experiments were performed in a 500 ml semi closed and undivided cylindrical glass cell with two electrodes totally immersed in the solutions the cathode is a piece of carbon felt 6 8 0 5 cm and the anode is a cylindrical pt grid 3 3 0 3 cm in addition to the objective of this study we chose carbon felt as our cathode due to the fact that this material is commonly used in ef system and readily available the cathode was activated using sulfuric acid ca 3 m before application the distance between the two electrodes was maintained at 2 cm the current was applied constantly at 0 1 a by linear dc power supply gps 3303c guwei china to improve the conductivity of the working solutions ionic strength was kept constant at 0 19 m by the addition of na2so4 solution ph was measured by s220 ph meter phsj 4f leici china and was kept constant at 3 0 using 50 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs in addition to the maximum efficiency at ph of 3 for the fenton s reaction solution ph of 3 was selected due to the following reasons 1 in an extremely acidic solution ph less than 2 the current efficiency is low and h2 evolution occurs on the cathode surface significantly decreasing active sites available for o2 reduction 2 when solution ph is greater than 3 the majority of fe3 precipitates as fe oh 3 thereby decreasing the quantity of fenton s reagent brillas et al 2009 sun et al 2015 it should be noted that the purpose of this study was not concerning the application of ef processes in engineering practice thus we did not explore the optimization of ef system for narrow ph range under acidic conditions the aeration rate was set as 120 ml min 1 by electromagnetic air compressor aco 318 haili china and it was measured by a rotor flowmeter lzb 3wb shuanghuan china solutions were continuously stirred with a magnetic bar at 22 c to quantify each degradation subprocess in ef system six control experiments were set and compared the specific experimental conditions are tabulated in table 1 for cfa aeration coag and h2o2 oxidation subgroups the corresponding single variable was controlled and the first order rate constant k in each process was measured for radical oxidation other conditions were set the same as in the ef system except for radical scavenger the rationale of radical scavenging experiments is based on an underlying assumption that the added scavenger only quenches the target reactive species but does not significantly influence other reaction mechanisms in the system canonica and freiburghaus 2001 therefore the k value between scavenger and radical is expected to be greater than that between phoh and radical in this study p bq was selected as the scavenger for oh and ho 2 the k values of phoh with oh and ho 2 are 6 6 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and 2 7 103 m 1 s 1 bielski et al 1985 respectively whereas the k values of p bq with oh and ho 2 are 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and 9 6 108 m 1 s 1 bielski et al 1985 respectively although the k values of phoh and p bq with oh are comparable the concentration of scavenger p bq is significantly higher than that of phoh resulting in sufficient scavenging capacity of p bq huber et al 2003 note that p bq is not a typical oh scavenger tert butanol has been frequently used it was chosen due to its sufficient scavenging capacity in addition p bq exerted no reactivity towards phoh figure s2 for the eo r group other conditions were set the same except for addition of feso4 and aeration samples volume of 1 ml were taken from the reactor at a fixed time interval for quantitative analysis the samples were collected at 15 min interval for 90 min before quantification samples were filtered through an aqueous phase filter head with a pore size of 0 22 µm all the experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility 2 3 analytical method the quantification of phoh was performed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 20ad shimadzu japan with a 5 μm 4 6 mm 250 mm diamonsil c18 column chromatography peak was monitored at the wavelength of 271 nm with mobile phase flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the composition of the mobile phase was 28 pbs and 72 methanol and the injection volume was set to be 10 μl the total iron spiked to the system was 100 µm the quantification of fe2 was conducted using the o phenanthroline colorimetric method komadel 1988 and the concentration of fe3 was determined by the subtraction of the measured concentration of fe2 from total iron dosing to the system h2o2 in aqueous samples was determined by spectrophotometric analysis using potassium titanium oxalate method sellers 1980 visual minteq 3 1 chemical software for the calculation of metal speciation and solubility equilibria gustafsson 2013 was used to investigate the equilibrium speciation of fe2 and fe3 with the initial fe2 concentration of 100 µm fixed ph of 3 0 and electrode potential of 1 4 v 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation in ef system the degradation kinetics of phoh in our ef system is illustrated in fig 2a black line and it was fit to the pseudo first order model with r 2 close to unity the removal efficiency achieved 92 1 after 90 min treatment and the overall pseudo first order rate constant k overall was determined to be 0 0262 min 1 the high removal efficiency was in good agreement with previous studies mousset et al 2016b pimentel et al 2008 pimentel et al 2008 investigated the oxidation of phoh in an ef process using cf cathode under the condition of 60 ma and 0 1 mm feso4 the complete removal of phoh at initial concentration of 1 mm took place at approximately 100 min and the k overall was reported to be 0 037 min 1 however k values are condition dependent table 2 another k overall for phoh degradation from the study of mousset et al 2016b differed significantly from that of pimentel et al 2008 they investigated the phoh degradation performance using cf as cathode under conditions of fe2 0 1 mm ph 3 and s o 4 2 50 mm after 180 min treatment the degradation of phoh was 73 with the k overall of 0 0074 min 1 these studies demonstrated that the k overall values are highly dependent on experimental conditions resulting in the lack of comparability between experiments in addition to kinetic determination we also performed the mechanistic analysis and quantification of subprocess contributions to the overall degradation profiling these degradation pathways underscore the new opportunity for increasing subprocess tunability and opens up a new horizon for in depth investigations of other complex fenton like systems 3 2 profiling degradation in subprocesses 3 2 1 radical oxidation radicals such as oh and ho 2 o 2 are frequently reported to be present in the ef system eqs 2 and 5 12 brillas 2022 casado et al 2006 chou et al 1999 oh is produced in large quantity in the fenton s reaction eqs 2 and 5 it is a strongly reactive agent with a high redox potential of 2 8 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she latimer 1952 in the ef system a fenton like reaction also generates ho 2 with the oxidation potential of 1 65 v eq 6 bard et al 1985 ho 2 can reduce the fe3 to fe2 eq 11 in addition o2 can be reduced at cathode to produce o 2 with the oxidation potential of 0 89 v eq 8 halliwell and gutteridge 2015 with the solution ph 3 ho 2 is the dominant species due to its pk a of 4 8 eq 12 thus factoring out the contribution of o 2 bielski et al 1985 note that in the subprocess of radical oxidation we did not specifically distinguish the contribution of oh and ho 2 to phoh degradation as our purpose was to quantify the contribution of all radicals collectively to the degradation 5 h 2 o oh e aq h 6 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 ho 2 h 7 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o 8 o 2 e aq o 2 9 h 2 o 2 oh o 2 h 2 o h 10 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 o 2 2 h 11 f e 3 ho 2 f e 2 o 2 h 12 o 2 h ho 2 the degradation kinetics of phoh at different p bq concentrations 0 1 2 5 10 and 15 mm were investigated to determine an appropriate initial concentration so as to be maximally effective but low enough so as to not affect solution polarity fig 3 illustrates that when p bq initial concentration increased to 10 mm the observed phoh degradation was essentially unchanged around 0 0026 min 1 indicating that p bq can sufficiently scavenge oh and ho 2 in addition the k values of p bq with oh and ho 2 are 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and 9 6 108 m 1 s 1 respectively and the concentration of scavenger p bq is significantly higher than that of phoh resulting in sufficient scavenging capacity of p bq hence the appropriate p bq concentration was determined to be 10 mm fig 2a blue line shows the degradation kinetics of phoh in the presence of radical scavenger p bq at 10 mm the k rs value was determined to be 0 0023 min 1 comparing to without p bq k overall 0 0262 min 1 it can be concluded that p bq significantly inhibited the degradation of phoh due to its competition with oh and ho 2 in the ef system 13 k radicals k overall k rs with eq 13 k radicals was determined to be 0 0239 min 1 and the contribution of free radicals accounted for 87 of phoh degradation representing the major pathway 3 2 2 electrode oxidation reduction eo r many studies reported that the degradation of micropollutants may be due to anodic oxidation in the ef system kishimoto and matsuda 2009 li et al 2016 logue and westall 2003 anodic oxidation can be through either direct or indirect routes with direct oxidation micropollutants are oxidized after adsorption on the anode surface without involvement of any other substances the occurrence of direct oxidation process is linked to the applied voltage under our operating conditions the anode electrode potential was set to be 1 4 v which is higher than the oxidation potential of phoh 0 79 v canonica et al 2000 indicating thermodynamic feasibility of direct oxidation with indirect oxidation although it does not directly exchange electrons with the electrode surface the micropollutant rather reacts with active species produced on the anode surface in addition phoh can be also degraded by reduction at the cathode in this study we did not make a detailed distinction between oxidation at the anode and reduction at the cathode fig 2b indicates that the degradation efficiency of phoh is 21 with 90 min treatment the slope of the blue line indicates that the k eo r of phoh is 0 0021 min 1 and the contribution of this subprocess to the overall degradation was only 7 gattrell and kirk 1993 studied the phoh degradation process in an electrochemical system with a platinum electrode and ph around 1 they observed a low degradation efficiency and attributed it to electrode passivation they indicated that the phoh radical generated at the anode tended to polymerize forming a film on the electrode surface then this film prevents the exchange of fresh reactive species at interface and reduced the available overpotential to initiate the degradation of phoh it should be noted that phoh polymerization is unlikely to take place in the ef system therefore it is possible that the 7 contribution for direct electrode reaction is the upper limit 3 2 3 other subprocesses cf is a commonly used cathode due to its good electrical conductivity and it is a flexible three

stability zone red star in fig 4 interestingly we did not observe any formation of fe oh 3 during the course of reaction this could be due to the fact that the solubility product of fe oh 3 is less than the solubility product constant and fe oh 3 does not precipitate the results from visual minteq 3 1 also support this speculation at infinite thermodynamic equilibrium fe2 would eventually be converted to fe3 and fe3 would exist mainly as fe oh 2 accounting for 77 2 of the total fe3 the remaining species are fe oh 2 and free fe3 but no fe oh 3 precipitation takes place the k coag of phoh degradation was determined to be 3 10 4 min 1 fig 2f and the contribution to the overall degradation was only 1 09 also an insignificant removal pathway 3 2 4 sum of subprocesses the k of the above mentioned subprocess was determined to be 0 0274 min 1 23 k total k cfa k aeration k coag k h 2 o 2 k radicals k eo r the k total accounts for 104 1 of the overall removal process k overall of 0 0262 min 1 in the ef system the uncertainty analysis is shown in table s1 the agreement between the measured k overall and k total of each pathway suggested that no other subprocesses were missing the contribution of each subprocess to the overall k of phoh degradation is shown in table 3 the radical degradation contributed the most with 87 and followed by the eo r 7 7 and other subprocesses only about 5 note that the slight overestimation 4 could be due to the fact that the indirect route by radicals in the eo r subprocess can arguably be part of the radical oxidation thus their contribution might have overlapped the small discrepancy between k total and k overall could be also attributed to the uncertainty thus confirming the complete consideration of all the subprocesses covered in this study 4 conclusions in this study we investigated possible degradation subprocesses in the ef system including carbon felt adsorption aeration coagulation h2o2 oxidation electrode reoxidation reduction and radical oxidation we adopted complementary experimental and theoretical approaches to determine the degradation kinetics of phoh with the comparison of k overall and the sum of the k values of the subprocesses it was confirmed that the overall degradation of phoh can be attributed to the synergistic action of the above mentioned subprocesses among these the radical oxidation plays a major role accounting for 87 the eo r process also represents non negligible contribution 7 7 and we speculated that constrain of eo r process could occur due to electrode passivation gattrell and kirk 1993 sivagami et al 2023 these findings make a significant stride in mechanism elucidation in the ef system paving a new avenue to control these subprocesses in different treatment scenarios for better degradation efficiency we also suggested that this methodology can be used in other micropollutants and or other complex fenton like systems e g photo fenton and sono fenton for pathway elucidation it should be noted that when this comparative methodology is applied to other micropollutants in ef systems quantification of each subprocess surely varies this is also true for other fenton like systems however we emphasized that this quantitative profiling methodology for a complex system can be extrapolated to other systems in particular to quantify each subprocess all possible degradation subprocesses need be considered then one sets up a single variable experiment to exclude other interferences ultimately confirming and profiling the contribution of each subprocess to the overall degradation kinetics understandings of contribution of each subprocess may provide a variety of emerging options for micropollutant treatments in practical engineering process declaration of

14872,physical heterogeneities are prevalent features of fracture systems and significantly impact transport processes in aquifers across different spatiotemporal scales upscaling solute transport parameter is an effective way of quantifying parameter variability in heterogeneous aquifers including fractured media this paper develops conceptual models for upscaling conservative transport parameters in fracture media the focus is on upscaling dispersivity lagrangian based transport model lbtm for dispersivity upscaling are derived for the solute transport in two dimensional fractures surrounded by an impermeable matrix the lbtm is validated against the random walk particle tracking rwpt model which enables highly efficient and accurate predictions of conservative solute transport the results show that the derived scale dependent analytical expressions are in excellent agreement with rwpt model results in addition lbtm results are also compared to experimental results from the observed breakthrough curve of a conservative solute transport through a single natural fracture within a granite core comparing results from the lbtm and transport experiment shows that lbtm based estimated dispersivity is 10 55 higher than the measured value errors introduced by the experiments the conceptual assumptions in deriving models and the heterogeneities of fracture apertures not fully sampled by measuring instruments are main factor for such discrepancy the sensitivity analysis indicates that the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are positively related to the integral scale and the variance of the log fracture aperture the longitudinal dispersivity is strongly contolled by the variance of the log fracture aperture the lbtm may be useful for directly predicting solute transports requiring only the acquisition of fractured geostatistical data this work provides a better understanding of transport processes in fractured media which ultimately control water quality across scales graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fracture transport experiment dispersivity lagrangian based model random walk particle tracking sensitivity analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction natural fractures serve as dominant flow and transport pathways in subsurface environments cohen and weisbrod 2018 weisbrod et al 2013 wolfsberg et al 2017 increasing our understanding of transport through fractured media is critical for different applications in various subdiscipline of earth and environmental scienses and engineering this includes underground nuclear waste repositories du et al 2022 jia et al 2022 tsang et al 2015 co2 sequestration ershadnia et al 2022 yekta et al 2020 enhanced oil recovery amirian et al 2018 gerritsen and durlofsky 2005 middleton et al 2017 hydraulic fracturing of unconventional reservoirs stringfellow et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 and the environmental remediation of contaminated sites lhotsky et al 2021 liu et al 2021a maldaner et al 2021 rice et al 2021 effective parameter estimation and well characterization of transport in naturally fractured systems remain a complex challenge due to fracture surface roughness and aperture distribution dou et al 2019 stoll et al 2019 biased estimation of parameters for developing effective solute transport models in fracture media may result in considerable uncertainty in model predictions chen et al 2021 dai et al 2012 deng et al 2018 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 zou et al 2017a with the current methods the three dimensional 3d solute transport process within fractured media at the field scale is impossible due to the difficulty of embedding complex physical and chemical processes into the fracture network and accurately measuring the geometrical characteristics of the fracture network beaudoin and farhat 2021 therefore effectively utilizing field data to obtain upscaled transport parameters in naturally fractured media is of practical importance dai et al 2007a zhang et al 2022a 2021 dispersion process is created by heterogeneity across scales and strongly affects transport processes this is due to the heterogeneous velocity fields resulting in enhanced mixing and spreading hyman and jiménez martínez 2018 johnson et al 2006 ren et al 2022 soltanian et al 2020 in addition the dispersion process in fracture depends on the domain scale and flow regimes geiger et al 2010 wang et al 2012 yoon and kang 2021 over the past few decades considerable efforts have been made to determine dispersivities of under different conditions ding et al 2020 meng and yang 2016 hyman and jiménez martínez 2018 investigated the relative impact of heterogeneity on transport processes they found that both longitudinal and transverse dispersion increased as the heterogeneity scale is increased yoon and kang 2021 shown that the recirculating flows which intensify or suppress anomalous transport depending on péclet number are influenced by the interplay between the roughness and reynolds number in experiments dispersion coefficients are usually obtained by fitting the breakthrough curve btc using an analytical solution or numerical models ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a for example reno et al 2006 investigated the colloid dispersion in a uniform aperture fracture by changing the colloid size flow rate and fracture length liu et al 2021b utilized the experiment and numerical model to study reactive transport in the single fracture they found that the dispersion coefficient changed with the pe number zang et al 2020 conducted the sorption and desorption breakthrough experiments in a granite fracture transport parameters e g dispersivity and sorption distribution coefficient were obtained by fitting the btc of strontium based on the analytical solution however experiments and models only show that transport parameters are spatiotemporally scale dependent and quantitative characterization of parameter variability with scale is not well understood zheng et al 2021 upscaling transport parameters including dispersion has shown to be an effective way in quantifying the spatiotemporal variability of parameters in fractured media zhang et al 2022a multiple parameters upscaling methods currently exist such as homogenization amanbek et al 2019 method of moments adrover et al 2019 vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 volume averaging yang et al 2020 stochastic averaging dagan 1982 dai et al 2004 2020 deng et al 2013 rubin 2003 soltanian et al 2014 2015a 2015b c 2017 and stochastic fractals metzler et al 2014 in this study we use stochastic averaging specifically we use the lagrangian based transport model lbtm comprehensive reviews of upscaling methods can be found elsewhere zhang et al 2021 the lbtm was introduced as a stochastic modeling framework by dagan 1982 to study solute transport in heterogeneous sedimentary aquifers gelhar and axness 1983 utilized a similar approach to relate transport to spatial variability of log conductivity y ln k they have evaluated the asymptotic and constant values of the dispersion coefficients for large time isotropic and anisotropic media dagan 1984 gelhar and axness 1983 the lbtm has been gradually extended from its origical form that considers unimodal distribution of y into the bimodal rubin 1995 multimodal lu and zhang 2002 and hierarchical multimodal models dai et al 2004 soltanian et al 2015b c note that y is treated as a correlated random variable there is currently no study on the use of lbtm in upscaling dispersivity in fractured media this work will address this gap the prediction results of the fracture network model at field scale could be incorrect when the dispersivity obtained from the core scale results is directly applied to the field scale model this is because the dispersivity is scale dependent dai et al 2004 thus the quantitative characterization of parameter variability with scale is critical the lbtm could solve this problem the model can directly provide a quick estimation of the dispersivity at field scale based on the core scale results the identification process is based on geostatistical data without any additional experimental data in this work we will validate the lbtm for dispersivity upscaling using both the random walk particle tracking rwpt model and transport experiments described below the rwpt has been widely used in transport studies berkowitz et al 2006 dentz and de barros 2013 and as a comparison standard for various analytic solutions goeppert et al 2020 ren et al 2022 tran et al 2016 2019 the rwpt model is the most common lagrangian numerical modeling approach utilizing particles to solves the advection dispersion equation khafagy et al 2022 utilized numerical models based on the time domain random walk and rwpt methods to verify the validity of a computationally efficient analytical model for transport in discrete fracture networks meng and yang 2016 used rwpt under different source conditions to determine the dynamic dispersion coefficients of particle flow experiments are also effective in obtaining transport parameters and exploring transport mechanisms ma et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b experimentally obtained values of transport parameters are usually recognized as accurate and used to validate analytical solutions keller et al 1995 compared results of the stochastic analysis with experimental results they observed that the measured dispersivity from the experiment is 33 larger than the estimated model value they attributed this difference to errors introduced by boundary conditions the first order approximation and heterogeneities that are not sampled by the ct scanner this paper focuses on the following 1 developing a relationship between the fourier transforms of the eulerian velocity covariance and the log aperture covariance in fractured media 2 deriving a lbtm for upscaling dispersivity in fractured media 3 presenting a geostatistical analysis of y and log fracture aperture 4 analyzing differences between the lbtm and the transport experiment and finally 5 future applications lbtm are discussed the overview of the main research methodology in this paper is shown in fig 1 conceptual models were first described for upscaling conservative transport parameters of heterogeneous fracture media accordingly the lagrangian approach was used to derive the upscaled dispersivity for conservative solute transport furthermore lbtm for upscaling dispersivity was verified by the rwpt model and solute transport experiment then the sensitivity analysis of lbtm was presented to determine the qualitative impact of each parameter the remaining part of this manuscript is organized as follows section 2 presents the conceptual model of the upscaling disperisivity in the naturally fractured media section 3 describes the detailed derivation process of dispersivities of conservative solute transport in section 4 we present the verification of the derived lbtm with the rwpt model and the conservative solute transport experiment the validation results and sensitivity analysis are discussed in section 5 finally we deliver the key conclusions of this paper 2 conceptual models naturally occurring fractures are characterized by their rough surfaces they cannot be accurately characterized by smooth parallel plate models fracture apertures vary from point to point within the fracture plane the effects of a spatially varying aperture can be analyzed systematically by treating the aperture variation as a two dimensional 2d correlated random field we assume the aperture variation as a 2d correlated random field to analyze the effect of spatially varying apertures fig 2 we assume laminar flow in a single fracture surrounded by an impermeable matrix if the slope of the fracture surface is not large the classical cubic law cl is valid vogler et al 2018 zhang and chai 2020 zou et al 2017b however the inaccuracy of the cl in real fractures has been well known for decades which has attracted many researchers to improve the prediction of fluid flow in fractures the relevant references can be found at brush and thomson 2003 mallikamas and rajaram 2010 wang et al 2015 2020 in this study the generalized modified cl which encompassed the classical cl and the modified cl was used for the fluid flow at the laminar flow he et al 2021 renshaw 1995 note that the modified cl is only applicable for laminar flow this is because the modified nonlinear lcl is available and can handle considerable inertial effects wang et al 2022 2020 the generalized modified cl can be repressed in a 2d form 1 q i v i b a ρ g b 3 a 3 12 u φ x i a k

the hydraulic gradient k is the modified hydraulic conductivity k ρ g b 2 a 2 12 u and a is the correction factors related to the fracture aperture and surface roughness note that when a 1 the eq 1 is the cl when a 1 σ f b 2 0 5 σ f is the standard deviation of the fracture aperture the eq 1 is the modified cl developed by renshaw 1995 a can be given other values this article is just an example to facilitate understanding for the reader assuming an incompressible flow condition the mass conservation in a rigid fracture requires that 2 q i x i 0 i 1 2 assuming an isotropic condition and a single fracture the head distribution is expressed as 3 x i b 3 ρ g a 3 12 μ φ x i 0 and by differentiating the product and dividing by b 3 ρ g a 3 12 μ eq 3 becomes 4 2 φ x i 2 ln a b 3 ln ρ g 12 μ x i φ x i 0 the variables z z ln ab and φ are regarded as spatially correlated variables with mean and perturbation as follows 5 φ h h e h 0 ln a b ln b g β e β 0 ln b g e ln a b using this decomposition and the corresponding form for the head in eq 3 and taking the expected value the eq 3 can be rewritten as 6 2 h x i 2 3 ln b g ln ρ g 12 μ x i h x i e 3 β x i h x i 0 and after subtracting this from the flow eq 4 the following expression for the head perturbation can be found 7 2 h x i 2 3 β x i h x i 3 ln b g ln ρ g 12 μ x i h x i e 3 β x i h x i 3 β x i h x i 0 it should be noted that because the head perturbations are produced by log fracture aperture perturbations if the z perturbations are small we can expect small head perturbations to result this will result in that the values of terms that involve products of perturbation terms will be very small therefore the eq 7 will be approximated by recognizing that the fracture aperture variations must in some sense be small and setting the right hand side equal to zero for two dimensional flow the first order small perturbation approximation of eq 7 is 8 2 h x i 2 3 j i β x i g i h x i 0 j i h x i g i ln ρ g b g 3 12 μ x i if there is no trend in the mean log modified fracture aperture g i 0 the perturbed 2d flow equation is given by gelhar 1987 9 2 h 2 x i 2 3 j i β x i using the fourier transform eq 9 becomes 10 φ 3 i k j k 2 β where the circumflex denotes the fourier transform operator the flow velocity is evaluated using the generalized modified cl with locally isotropic fracture aperture 11 v k φ x i b g 2 ρ g a 2 12 μ exp 2 β φ x i b g 2 ρ g a 2 12 μ 1 2 β 4 β 2 2 h x i h x i using eq 11 we find the following expression for the first order small perturbation approximation 12 v b g 2 ρ g a 2 12 μ 2 β h x i h x i and by using the fourier transform eq 12 becomes 13 v b g 2 ρ g a 2 12 μ 2 j i β i k j φ where k 2 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 finally combining 10 and 13 produces a relationship between the complex fourier amplitudes of flow velocity and z 14 v k g j i 2 δ i j 3 k j k i k 2 β where k g is the mean value of the modified y by using the representation theorem with eq 14 the spectrum of the velocity covariance in fourier space becomes 15 s v i v j k u 1 2 2 δ 1 i 3 k i k 1 k 2 2 δ 1 j 3 k j k 1 k 2 s β β k i j 1 m where s v 1 v 1 k is the spectrum of the velocity covariance u 1 exp m y j 1 is the mean velocity assuming that the x direction is aligned with the mean velocity direction s f f k is the spectrum of the log aperture covariance δ 1 j is the kronecker delta k is the modulus of the vector k and m denotes space dimensionality it should be noted that the result of the spectrum of the velocity covariance in fourier space is fixed as long as the generalized modified cl is satisfied in deriving eq 15 the following assumptions were made 1 steady state and laminar flow conditions 2 incompressible flow and conservation of mass 3 impermeable matrix 4 unbounded domain 5 the fracture aperture field is weakly stationary and 6 variance of the log aperture σ f 2 is smaller than unity 3 derivation of dispersivity in order to obtain the upscaled dispersivity we consider the governing equation describing transport of a conservative solute in a 2d natural fracture dagan 1988 16 c t v i c x i x i d d i j c x j i j 1 2 where c m l3 is the solute concentration v l t is the velocity and d d i j l2 t is the tensor of pore scale dispersion by using eq 16 the dispersion tensor is expressed in terms of the eulerian velocity covariance function as follows rubin 2003 17 d i j t 0 t u i j u 1 s d s where u i j is the velcocity covariance in real space d i j is the dispersion coefficient and s is the integral variable in lagrangian space the meanings of other parameters are consistent with eq 15 in addition it is important to note that only advection transport and dispersion processes are considered in the derivation of dispersion tensor of the fractured media an exponential function was used to fit the experimental semivariogram of the aperture field to the theoretical semivariogram by keller et al 1995 therefore we consider a 2d exponential function for autocovariance c f f of z that is 18 c f f ζ σ f 2 e ζ ε σ f 2 e ζ 1 ε 1 2 ζ 2 ε 2 2 where ε i is the integral scale σ f 2 is the variance of the z and ε k 2 ε 1 k 1 2 ε 2 k 2 2 the relationship between the spectrum and the covariance function is given by deng et al 2013 19 s f f k 1 2 π 3 e i k ζ c f f ζ d ζ where ζ is the separation vector and k k 1 k 2 t is a 2d wave number vector the spectrum density s f f k of perturbation in z is evaluated by taking the fourier transform of eq 19 combining eqs 18 and 19 then it yields 20 s f f k 1 2 π 3 e i k ζ σ f 2 e ζ ε d ζ integration of eq 20 is implemented in a spherical coordinate system and is of the form 21 s f f k σ f 2 ε 1 ε 2 2 π 1 1 ε k 2 3 2 after substituting eqs 21 and 20 into eq 15 the integral expressions for the longitudinal dispersivity are found as follows for more information about the derivation process see appendix a 22 α 11 d 11 t u 1 σ f 2 λ 4 4 e τ σ f 2 λ 0 12 1 r 2 3 2 j 1 β r d r σ f 2 λ 0 9 r 1 r 2 3 2 j 1 β β 2 2 j 1 β j 0 β

longitudinal and transverse dispersivity and t is time j 0 and j 1 are the zeo and first order bessel functions respectively after integrating eqs 22 and 23 the final expression for the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are 24 α 11 d 11 τ u 1 σ f 2 λ 4 3 2 exp τ τ 3 18 exp τ τ 1 5 exp τ τ 2 4 τ 2 1 exp τ and 25 α 22 d 22 τ u 1 σ f 2 λ 54 1 exp τ τ 18 τ 2 9 exp τ τ 2 2 exp τ τ 3 at the large time limit the transverse dispersivity α 22 approaches 0 this means that the solute does not expand along transverse direction it is mathematically related to the fact that the transverse velocity covariances u 22 are of zero integral scales along lines parallel to the principal axis dagan 1989 at the large time limit the longitudinal dispersivity α 11 has the following simplified expression 26 α 11 d 11 t u 1 4 σ f 2 λ 4 model and experimental validation 4 1 rwpt model the conceptual model was based on a 2d single natural fracture surrounded by an impermeable matrix the synthetic model geometry was 180 cm 50 cm with a unit width along the z axis the simulation domain consisted of 9000 grid blocks each of which is divided into a uniform grid block in the x and y directions with dimensions of x y 1 cm respectively the processes of modeling water flow and solute transport is as follows 1 convert the data of the fracture aperture into the data of the conductivity 2 generate a single peaked random field of log normally distributed conductivity by using the t progs code carle and fogg 1996 dai et al 2007b 2020 and utilize the exponential covariance model to verify the steady state of the generated conductivity field 3 conduct the finite different model modflow 96 harbaugh 1996 weissmann et al 2002 to model the groundwater flow and set parameters such as boundaries hydraulic gradients and so on 4 conduct solute transport model by using rwpt model rwhet labolle et al 1996 which can directly recognize the unit by unit flux and head output generated by modflow ren et al 2022 and set the solute injection point location range the number of solute particles and other parameters 5 analyze the results of the rwpt model the detailed process is as follows tsang 1984 found that the fracture aperture follows a gamma distribution by collating the fracture surface profile measurements on seven cores of a natural fracture in granite however other researches showed that fracture aperture follows lognormal distribution moreno et al 1988 muralidharan et al 2004 in addition previous research shows that the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture also follows log normal distribution in this study we assume that the fracture aperture and conductivity vary in an irregular manner in space and should be characterized by a log normal distribution in this study geostatistical methods are used to characterize the aperture field by the variance and integral scale of the log aperture these statistical indices of the log aperture were transformed into statistical indices of the log conductivity for running the groundwater flow model the derivation of the conversion relation of these statistical indices between log aperture and log conductivity could be found in section 4 3 1 geostatistical methods geostatistical characterization modeling and simulation of the conductivity field were performed using a transition probability geostatistical code t progs furthermore the exponential covariance model was utilized to verify the steady state of the generated conductivity field the exponential covariance model is expressed by 27 c y r σ y 2 e x p r i y where the length i y is scaling length parameter r is the vector of the distance between two points σ y 2 is the variance c y r is the covariance then modflow 96 was conducted to generate a steady flow velocity field in a saturated fractured medium we set the boundary conditions of the left side x 0 cm and right side x 180 cm of the flow model as constant head boundaries to ensure an average flow rate of 1 16 10 3 m day the rest of the boundary was set as a zero flux boundary confining boundary and the average flow direction of groundwater is assumed to be parallel to the x axis direction the lbtm assumes that the x direction is aligned with the mean velocity direction and neglects the effects of vertical velocity field therefore the rwpt also neglects the effects of vertical velocity field by only taking the longitudinal velocity in the modflow table 1 shows the hypothetical parameters and average flow velocity of the model the rwpt model was employed to simulate advection and dispersion processes for the instantaneous release of conservative solutes the total simulation time was 800 days and the release time of particles at the source was 1 day a rectangular contamination source was set in the upstream region of the flow field with dimensions of x 3 2 cm y 6 cm and z 1 0 cm the absorption type boundaries were used at the left side x 0 cm and right side x 180 cm of the model and the particles that entered absorbing boundaries were removed from the simulation the remaining boundaries were set as reflect boundaries and the particles will return to the simulation domain when they reach this boundary a total of one million particles were set in this model a schematic diagram of the hydrogeological conceptual model for the synthetic case is shown in fig 3 4 2 solute transport experiment granite core was collected from 531 95 m to 532 65 m below the surface of xinchang which is an underground research laboratory for the geological disposal of high level radioactive waste in the beishan area northwest china wang et al 2018 the granite core has a single vertical natural fracture with a diameter of 62 mm and a length of 90 mm that running the entire core length x ray diffraction xrd analysis shows a composition of plagioclase 40 quartz 28 potassium feldspar 23 and biotite 9 the porosity of the granite sample was 1 273 used by boyle s law technique and the density was 2 583 g cm3 with the weighting method fracture apertures were measured by creaform 3d laser handyscan black which can capture the texture and topography of the fracture surface during measuring fracture apertures we compacted the separated fracture surfaces to maintain the original fracture aperture and location of the two fracture planes and set the standard x y plane parallel to the fracture surface the coordinates of the scanned fracture surface were described in binary files in x y and z format which represented the length width and relative distance of the standard x y plane respectively the voxel size of the laser scanner was set at 0 2 0 2 mm the fracture aperture can be obtained by subtracting the z values of the corresponding fracture surface these results of fracture apertures are shown in fig 4 the figure is a 3d plan view of the fracture aperture field from these results we can get that the mean aperture was 0 65 mm and the variance of the z was 0 39 the correlation length scale was approximately 4 5 mm by utilizing the exponential covariance mode to fit the z covariance of the sample core it should be noted that the variance and integral scale of the log aperture are used to characterize the aperture field of the core sample the upscaled fracture aperture was calculated using the geometric mean and equivalent hydraulic aperture developed by renshaw 1995 the dispersivity was calculated by the lbtm eq 26 a single phase tracer experiment was conducted to determine the btc of a conservative tracer br in synthetic groundwater the fractured core was sealed on the outside with flexible tubular membranes the entire core was subjected to external pressure to ensure that all fluid flowed only in the fracture surface of the core before the experiment the fracture core was rinsed with ultrapure water for two days to ensure that the ph of the groundwater solution in the effluent was stable then the ultrapure water was replaced by the previously prepared conservative bromide tracer solution after a pulse injection of 300 min the influent solution was replaced with ultrapure water again until the end of the experiment the br bearing groundwater solutions c0 and ultrapure water through the fracture core were controlled by the peristaltic pump at a rate of 6 0 ml h the initial concentration of the influent solution was 400 mg l for br the effluent samples at the outlet were collected every 10 min by an automatic fraction collector sbs 100 filled with 10 100 mm polystyrene tubes effluent br concentration was determined by ion chromatograph the duration of the whole experiment was 15 h the br breakthrough curve was modeled by a solute migration simulator cra2 sudicky and frind 1982 to determine physical parameters related to solute transport in the fracture cra2 is a semi analytical simulator used to model 1d transport in fractures and matrix slabs with an arbitrary time varying influent concentration history a variety of transport mechanisms can be considered in this case including 1 advection transport via fluids 2 molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion along the fracture direction 3 matrix diffusion after constructing the solute transport model we implemented a model independent parameter optimizer dai and samper 2004 to derive optimum estimates of transport parameters and used the least squares criterion along with weighted constraints and prior information as the objective function for the inverse problem the objective function was solved by minimizing a generalized least squares criterion using the gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm 4 3 lbtm 4 3 1 validation processes using models the rwpt model was employed to validate the derived lbtm of the dispersivity the difficulty of validation is that the two methods use different base data we need to establish a geostatistical parameter association between y and z note that the variance of y is four times as large as z and the integral scale of y and z is the same in table 1 their relationship can be derived from the genralized modified cl the detailed steps for converting fracture aperture data to conductivity data are as follows the variance can be expressed as 28 σ y 2 1 n j 1 n z x t m x t 2 where σ y 2 is the variance of the modified y or z n is the number of variables z x t is the data value at point x t m x t is the mean value of data simultaneously taking the logarithm of both sides of eq 1 the modified y can be rewritten as 29 y 2 ln b c where c ln ρ g a 12 μ and c is a constant the mean value m k x t of the modified y can be expressed as the mean value m b x t of the z based on eq 27 and its expression is 30 m k x t 2 m b x t c combining eqs 28 30 we rewrite as 31 σ k 2 1 n j 1 n k x t m k x t 2 1 n j 1 n 2 b x t 2 m b x t 2 4 σ b 2 where σ k 2 is the variance of y σ b 2 is the variance of z k x t and b x t are the y and z through the above derivation we can theoretically verify the relationship between the variance of y and z being four times in the same way it can be shown that their covariance values also satisfy the relationship being 4 times the expression of the global integral scale λ y is 32 λ y 1 σ y 2 0 c y r d r the eq 32 can be rewrite as 33 λ y 1 σ k 2 0 c k r d r 1 σ b 2 0 c b r d r λ b where λ y and λ b are the integral scales of y and z respectively and c k r and c b r are their covariances respectively thus the integral scales of y and z are equal finally the upscaled dispersivity was calculated by lbtm eq 26 based on table 1 the upscaled dispersivity can be compared with the effective dispersivity obtained by the rwpt model 4 3 2 validation processes using experiments the single phase tracer experiment was carried out as part of this paper so that the lbtm s predictability could be further validated using the cra2 and the inverse model a fitting was performed on the btc for the fracture transport experiment involving br after that the lbtm was applied to the problem in order to compute the dispersivity and the geometric mean was utilized in order to compute the upscaled fracture aperture we performed the fitting findings between the experiment and the semi analytical model using cra2 with the upscaled values from the geostatistical study the results were expressed in this study as a relative concentration c c0 where c is the concentration of the effluent solution finally the prediction accuracy of the geostatistical analysis was evaluated by the root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r2 which are defined as 34 r m s e 1 n t e s t i 1 n t e s t y i t e s t n o r m y i m o d e l 2 2 and 35 r 2 1 i 1 n t e s t y i t e s t n o r m y i m o d e l 2 2 i 1 n t e s t y i t e s t n o r m y 2 2

1 n test a lower rmse and a r2 value approaching 1 0 suggest better model prediction ability 5 results and discussion 5 1 model validation the analytical solution of the exponential covariance is used to verify the steady state of the conductivity field generated by the t progs code the fitting results illustrate that the generated conductivity field satisfies the hypothesis of validating the ascending scale equation fig 5 as the rwpt model can only give the results of displacement variance which quantifies solute spreading around the center of mass the dispersivity α 11 and dispersion coefficient d i j can be expressed by the solute displacement variance x i j 36 a 11 d i j u 1 1 2 d x i j d t i j 1 m the solute displacement variance is a covariance tensor which quantifies solute spreading around the center of mass we used the seventh order polynomial to fit the longitudinal displacement variance results to obtain the dispersivity value of the rwpt model the dispersivity of the lbtm is obtained from eq 26 the longitudinal displacement variance fitted results of the rwpt model using the seventh order polynomial are shown in fig 6 a the rate of solute spreading clearly increases with time in the first 200 days and appears relatively constant after approximately 500 or 600 days the trend of displacement variance with time in natural fractures is similar to that in heterogeneous porous media dai et al 2004 the longitudinal dispersivity fitted results between the rwpt model and lbtm are displayed in fig 6 b the longitudinal dispersivity first increases gradually and finally tends to be constant 4 σ f 2 λ this process behaves pre asymptotically and is consistent with the dispersivity in the porous medium ross et al 2019 in general the results show that the derived scale dependent analytical expressions are in excellent agreement with the results of the rwpt model which indicates that the estimation method can effectively predict the dispersivity of the conservative solute transport in the naturally fractured media without considering matrix diffusion 5 2 experimental validation when developing the conservative solute transport model with car2 the following transport mechanisms were taken into consideration advective transport in fractures molecular diffusion mechanical dispersion along the fracture axis and matrix diffusion the inverse model provide estimates of three parameters including velocity longitudinal dispersivity and fracture aperture the preceding parameter intervals are listed in table 2 which was used to determine them the other parameters were determined using empirical data and experimental readings as the basis for the decision table 2 shows estimated values from the inverse modeling in addition the upscaled fracture aperture was calculated to be 0 56 mm by utilizing the geometric mean keller et al 1995 and the equivalent hydraulic aperture was estimated to be 0 47 and the equivalent hydraulic aperture is lower than the upscaled fracture aperture in this study we select the upscaled fracture aperture to present the breakthrough curve coupling model data the lbtm predicted that the dispersivity of the naturally fractured core would be 7 02 mm the final results of the inverse model are compatible with the rest of the lbtm solute transport model s parameters fig 7 a depicts the fitting results between the experiment and the inverse model with cra2 while fig 7 b depicts the fitting results between the experiment and the coupling model of lbtm and car2 note that the dispersivity of the coupled model is derived from lbtm therefore the experiment and the coupling model are consistent regarding the aperture fields the fitting results of the inverse model and coupling model were almost identical and difficult to discriminate visually the rsme and r2 of the inverse model were 5 069 10 3 and 0 9694 and the rsme and r2 of the coupling model of lbtm and car2 were 5 080 10 3 and 0 9693 respectively these indicate that the model fitted data was slightly better than the coupling model in addition the breakthrough time of the inverse model was slightly greater than that of the coupling model the reason for this result may be that the greater longitudinal dispersivity leads to a shorter breakthrough time and a longer process duration jia et al 2022 ma et al 2021 however the greater fracture aperture will lead to a longer breakthrough time note that the longitudinal dispersivity is the main effect relative to the fracture aperture in this case the estimated value of dispersivity based on the lbtm is 10 55 larger than the measured dispersivity from the breakthrough experiments on the other hand the estimated upscaled fracture aperture by using the geometric mean is 22 6 smaller than the measured effective fracture aperture this is despite the fact that the fitting results of the two models are comparable this gap can be traced to the mistakes introduced by the experiments the conceptual assumptions made in generating the equations and the heterogeneities of the fracture apertures that were not thoroughly sampled by measuring tools all of these factors contributed to the discrepancy the experiments led to a number of flaws the most significant of which were measurement errors and problems with the implementation of the in situ environment since the convection dispersion equation served as the basis for deriving the lbtm this model did not take into account the matrix diffusion effect the matrix diffusion effect of solute transport over the fractured medium in the real environment may cause a slow down in the migration of the solute and delay concentration peaks sudicky and frind 1982 have shown that the travel times in a system of parallel fractures with matrix diffusion between the fractures are significantly larger than those where only transport in fractures is taken into account on this basis the estimated value of the dispersivity that was calculated by the lbtm will be lower than the actual value in addition the laser scanning did not capture all of the heterogeneities in the distribution of the fracture apertures this circumstance will result in a disparity between the estimated value produced by the lbtm and the value that was actually measured by the transport experiment 5 3 sensitivity analysis 5 3 1 integral scale λ in this study the sensitivity analysis of lbtm was used to determine the qualitative impact of each parameter firstly we set the integral scale λ as 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 and the variance of the log fracture aperture σ f 2 as 1 0 then according to eqs 24 and 25 we carried out the sensitivity analysis of λ for the dispersivity fig 3 shows the time evolution of both α 11 and α 22 with the change of λ dagan 1989 concluded that the evolution trend of the dispersivity as τ increases in heterogeneous aquifers gelhar 1993 also found that the α 11 in heterogeneous aquifer media increased with τ and reached a constant value after the average migration distance exceeded the critical scale furthermore kumar et al 2008 used numerical modeling and showed that dispersivity in fractured media is time dependent both α 11 and α 22 are sensitive to λ as shown in fig 8 when λ increases the dispersivity also increases it is clear that the dispersivity is a scale dependent parameter and function of the integral scale in addition the α 11 of the fractured media first increases and reaches a gradual value of 4 σ f 2 λ which is consistent with the previous conclusion that the dispersion is time dependent furthermore the findings support the view of preasymtotic behavior for dispersivity in fractured media the α 11 has a strong linear relationship with λ the α 22 being time dependent first increases with τ then decreases and finally approaches 0 this means that the solute does not expand along the transverse direction and the transverse dispersivity is zero it is mathematically related to the transverse velocity covariances u 22 being of zero integral scales along lines parallel to the principal axis 5 3 2 variance of log fracture aperture σ f 2 the σ f 2 was set as 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 in order to test the sensitivity of the dispersivity to changes in σ f 2 the integral scale was set as 1 0 fig 9 shows that as σ f 2 increases α 11 and α 22 also increase this was because the dispersivity is directly proportional to the σ f 2 in eqs 24 and 25 the longitudinal dispersivity is much greater than the transverse dispersivity 6 summary and conclusions this paper developed a lagrangian based transport model lbtm for analyzing conservative solute dispersivity in 2d fractured rocks surrounded by an impermeable matrix the model estimates dispersivity requiring only the acquisition of fractured geostatistical data the efficiency of such a methodology was confirmed for hypothesized and experimental fractures however this model has not yet predicted the solute transport parameters at the site and regional scales this is despite the fact that the model was used to verify the model s accuracy for dispersivity if the necessary statistics can be gathered our subsequent research may use this model to predict conservative solute transports at the site and regional scales in order to improve our understanding of scale dependent solute transport parameters this will only be possible if the model is given the necessary data at the site scale transport simulations in fractures face difficulties in obtaining flow and transport parameters our developed model can directly derive the dispersivity of solute transport in fractures at arbitrary scales and it can provide a quick estimation of the dispersivity in a fracture the identification process is based on geostatistical data without any additional experimental data and geostatistical data can be easily obtained through geophysical surveys the lbtm is potentially applicable for subsurface research related to the solute transport in natural fractures such as shale gas extraction enhanced geothermal systems enhanced oil recovery underground gas storage and field development plans in natural carbonate reservoirs the developed model could be expanded to consider sorption matrix diffusion and radioactive decay in the future the extended model is potentially applicable for the safety assessment of geological disposal of high level waste the nuclide transport parameters are set mainly based on the assumptions of survey data at this stage which have no corresponding theoretical basis for the variations in evolutionary scenarios of uncertainty analysis mallants and beiraghdar 2021 the expanded model could fill the gap in the theoretical basis for the parameter assignment of the radionuclide transport model in terms of scenario uncertainty and parameter uncertainty to be more specific the expanded model could provide radionuclide transport parameter values

14872,physical heterogeneities are prevalent features of fracture systems and significantly impact transport processes in aquifers across different spatiotemporal scales upscaling solute transport parameter is an effective way of quantifying parameter variability in heterogeneous aquifers including fractured media this paper develops conceptual models for upscaling conservative transport parameters in fracture media the focus is on upscaling dispersivity lagrangian based transport model lbtm for dispersivity upscaling are derived for the solute transport in two dimensional fractures surrounded by an impermeable matrix the lbtm is validated against the random walk particle tracking rwpt model which enables highly efficient and accurate predictions of conservative solute transport the results show that the derived scale dependent analytical expressions are in excellent agreement with rwpt model results in addition lbtm results are also compared to experimental results from the observed breakthrough curve of a conservative solute transport through a single natural fracture within a granite core comparing results from the lbtm and transport experiment shows that lbtm based estimated dispersivity is 10 55 higher than the measured value errors introduced by the experiments the conceptual assumptions in deriving models and the heterogeneities of fracture apertures not fully sampled by measuring instruments are main factor for such discrepancy the sensitivity analysis indicates that the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are positively related to the integral scale and the variance of the log fracture aperture the longitudinal dispersivity is strongly contolled by the variance of the log fracture aperture the lbtm may be useful for directly predicting solute transports requiring only the acquisition of fractured geostatistical data this work provides a better understanding of transport processes in fractured media which ultimately

weisbrod et al 2013 wolfsberg et al 2017 increasing our understanding of transport through fractured media is critical for different applications in various subdiscipline of earth and environmental scienses and engineering this includes underground nuclear waste repositories du et al 2022 jia et al 2022 tsang et al 2015 co2 sequestration ershadnia et al 2022 yekta et al 2020 enhanced oil

remediation of contaminated sites lhotsky et al 2021 liu et al 2021a maldaner et al 2021 rice et al 2021 effective parameter estimation and well characterization of transport in naturally fractured systems remain a complex challenge due to fracture surface roughness and aperture distribution dou et al 2019 stoll et al 2019 biased estimation of parameters for developing effective solute transport models in fracture media may result in considerable uncertainty in model predictions chen et al 2021 dai et al 2012 deng et al 2018 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 zou et al 2017a with the current methods the three dimensional 3d solute transport process within fractured media at the field scale is impossible due to the difficulty of embedding complex physical and chemical processes into the fracture network and accurately measuring the geometrical characteristics of the fracture network beaudoin and farhat 2021 therefore effectively utilizing field data to obtain upscaled transport parameters in naturally fractured media is of practical importance dai et al 2007a zhang et al 2022a 2021 dispersion process is created by heterogeneity across scales and strongly affects transport processes this is due to the heterogeneous velocity fields resulting in enhanced mixing and spreading hyman and jiménez martínez 2018 johnson et al 2006 ren et al 2022 soltanian et al 2020 in addition the dispersion process in fracture depends on the domain scale and flow regimes geiger et al 2010 wang et al 2012 yoon and kang 2021 over the past few decades considerable efforts have been made to determine dispersivities of under different conditions ding et al 2020 meng and yang 2016 hyman and jiménez martínez 2018 investigated the relative impact of heterogeneity on transport processes they found that both longitudinal and transverse dispersion increased as the heterogeneity scale is increased yoon and kang 2021 shown that the recirculating flows which intensify or suppress anomalous transport depending on péclet number are influenced by the interplay between the roughness and reynolds number in experiments dispersion coefficients are usually obtained by fitting the breakthrough curve btc using an analytical solution or numerical models ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a for example reno et al 2006 investigated the colloid dispersion in a uniform aperture fracture by changing the colloid size flow rate and fracture length liu et al 2021b utilized the experiment and numerical model to study reactive transport in the single fracture they found that the dispersion coefficient changed with the pe number zang et al 2020 conducted the sorption and desorption breakthrough experiments in a granite fracture transport parameters e g dispersivity and sorption distribution coefficient were obtained by fitting the btc of strontium based on the analytical solution however experiments and models only show that transport parameters are spatiotemporally scale dependent and quantitative characterization of parameter variability with scale is not well understood zheng et al 2021 upscaling transport parameters including dispersion has shown to be an effective way in quantifying the spatiotemporal variability of parameters in fractured media zhang et al 2022a multiple parameters upscaling methods currently exist such as homogenization amanbek et al 2019 method of moments adrover et al 2019 vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 volume averaging yang et al 2020 stochastic averaging dagan 1982 dai et al 2004 2020 deng et al 2013 rubin 2003 soltanian et al 2014 2015a 2015b c 2017 and stochastic fractals metzler et al 2014 in this study we use stochastic averaging specifically we use the lagrangian based transport model lbtm comprehensive reviews of upscaling methods can be found elsewhere zhang et al 2021 the lbtm was introduced as a stochastic modeling framework by dagan 1982 to study solute transport in heterogeneous sedimentary aquifers gelhar and axness 1983 utilized a similar approach to relate transport to spatial variability of log conductivity y ln k they have evaluated the asymptotic and constant values of the dispersion coefficients for large time isotropic and anisotropic media dagan 1984 gelhar and axness 1983 the lbtm has been gradually extended from its origical form that considers unimodal distribution of y into the bimodal rubin 1995 multimodal lu and zhang 2002 and hierarchical multimodal models dai et al 2004 soltanian et al 2015b c note that y is treated as a correlated random variable there is currently no study on the use of lbtm in upscaling dispersivity in fractured media this work will address this gap the prediction results of the fracture network model at field scale could be incorrect when the dispersivity obtained from the core scale results is directly applied to the field scale model this is because the dispersivity is scale dependent dai et al 2004 thus the quantitative characterization of parameter variability with scale is critical the lbtm could solve this problem the model can directly provide a quick estimation of the dispersivity at field scale based on the core scale results the identification process is based on geostatistical data without any additional experimental data in this work we will validate the lbtm for dispersivity upscaling using both the random walk particle tracking rwpt model and transport experiments described below the rwpt has been widely used in transport studies berkowitz et al 2006 dentz and de barros 2013 and as a comparison standard for various analytic solutions goeppert et al 2020 ren et al 2022 tran et al 2016 2019 the rwpt model is the most common lagrangian numerical modeling approach utilizing particles to solves the advection dispersion equation khafagy et al 2022 utilized numerical models based on the time domain random walk and rwpt methods to verify the validity of a computationally efficient analytical model for transport in discrete fracture networks meng and yang 2016 used rwpt under different source conditions to determine the dynamic dispersion coefficients of particle flow experiments are also effective in obtaining transport parameters and exploring transport mechanisms ma et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b experimentally obtained values of transport parameters are usually recognized as accurate and used to validate analytical solutions keller et al 1995 compared results of the stochastic analysis with experimental results they observed that the measured dispersivity from the experiment is 33 larger than the estimated model value they attributed this difference to errors introduced by boundary conditions the first order approximation and heterogeneities that are not sampled by the ct scanner this paper focuses on the following 1 developing a relationship between the fourier transforms of the eulerian velocity covariance and the log aperture covariance in fractured media 2 deriving a lbtm for upscaling dispersivity in fractured media 3 presenting a geostatistical analysis of y and log fracture aperture 4 analyzing differences between the lbtm and the transport experiment and finally 5 future applications lbtm are discussed the overview of the main research methodology in this paper is shown in fig 1 conceptual models were first described for upscaling conservative transport parameters of heterogeneous fracture media accordingly the lagrangian approach was used to derive the upscaled dispersivity for conservative solute transport furthermore lbtm for upscaling dispersivity was verified by the rwpt model and solute transport experiment then the sensitivity analysis of lbtm was presented to determine the qualitative impact of each parameter the remaining part of this manuscript is organized as follows section 2 presents the conceptual model of the upscaling disperisivity in the naturally fractured media section 3 describes the detailed derivation process of dispersivities of conservative solute transport in section 4 we present the verification of the derived lbtm with the rwpt model and the conservative solute transport experiment the validation results and sensitivity analysis are discussed in section 5 finally we deliver the key conclusions of this paper 2 conceptual models naturally occurring fractures are characterized by their rough surfaces they cannot be accurately characterized by smooth parallel plate models fracture apertures vary from point to point within the fracture plane the effects of a spatially varying aperture can be analyzed systematically by treating the aperture variation as a two dimensional 2d correlated random field we assume the aperture variation as a 2d correlated random field to analyze the effect of spatially varying apertures fig 2 we assume laminar flow in a single fracture surrounded by an impermeable matrix if the slope of the fracture surface is not large the classical cubic law cl is valid vogler et al 2018 zhang and chai 2020 zou et al 2017b however the inaccuracy of the cl in real fractures has been well known for decades which has attracted many researchers to improve the prediction of fluid flow in fractures the relevant references can be found at brush and thomson 2003 mallikamas and rajaram 2010 wang et al 2015 2020 in this study the generalized modified cl which encompassed the classical cl and the modified cl was used for the fluid flow at the laminar flow he et al 2021 renshaw 1995 note that the modified cl is only applicable for laminar flow this is because the modified nonlinear lcl is available and can handle considerable inertial effects wang et al 2022 2020 the generalized modified cl can be repressed in a 2d form 1 q i v i b a ρ g b 3 a 3 12 u φ x i a k

facilitate understanding for the reader assuming an incompressible flow condition the mass conservation in a rigid fracture requires that 2 q i x i 0 i 1 2 assuming an isotropic condition and a single

the corresponding form for the head in eq 3 and taking the expected value the eq 3 can be rewritten as 6 2 h x i 2 3 ln b g ln ρ g 12 μ x i h x i e 3 β x i h x i 0 and after subtracting this from the

head perturbations are produced by log fracture aperture perturbations if the z perturbations are small we can expect small head perturbations to result this will result in that the values of terms that involve products of perturbation terms will be very small therefore the eq 7 will be approximated by recognizing that the fracture aperture variations must in some sense be small and setting the

in deriving eq 15 the following assumptions were made 1 steady state and laminar flow conditions 2 incompressible flow and conservation of mass 3 impermeable matrix 4 unbounded domain 5 the fracture aperture field is weakly stationary and 6 variance of the log aperture σ f 2 is smaller than unity 3 derivation of dispersivity in order to obtain the upscaled dispersivity we consider the governing equation describing transport of a conservative solute in a 2d natural fracture dagan 1988 16 c t v i c x i x i d d i j c x j i j 1 2 where c m l3 is the solute concentration v l t is the velocity and d d i j l2 t is the tensor of pore scale dispersion by using eq 16 the dispersion tensor is expressed in terms of the eulerian velocity covariance function as follows rubin 2003 17 d i j t 0 t u i j u 1 s d s where u i j is the velcocity covariance in real space d i j is the dispersion coefficient and s is the integral variable in lagrangian space the meanings of other parameters are consistent with eq 15 in addition it is important to note that only advection transport and dispersion processes are considered in the derivation of dispersion tensor of the fractured media an exponential function was used to fit the experimental semivariogram of the aperture field to the theoretical semivariogram by keller et al 1995 therefore we consider a 2d exponential function for autocovariance c f f of z that is 18 c f f ζ σ f 2 e ζ ε σ f 2 e ζ 1 ε 1 2 ζ 2 ε 2 2 where ε i is the integral scale σ f 2 is the variance of the z and ε k 2 ε 1 k 1 2 ε 2 k 2 2 the relationship between the spectrum and the covariance function is given by deng et al 2013 19 s f f k 1 2 π 3 e i k ζ c f f ζ d ζ where ζ is the separation vector and k k 1 k 2 t is a 2d wave number vector the spectrum density s f f k of perturbation in z is evaluated by taking the fourier transform of eq 19 combining eqs 18 and 19 then it yields 20 s f f k 1 2 π 3 e i k ζ σ f 2 e ζ ε d ζ integration of eq 20 is implemented in a

large time limit the transverse dispersivity α 22 approaches 0 this means that the solute does not expand along transverse direction it is mathematically related to the fact that the transverse velocity covariances u 22 are of zero integral scales along lines parallel to the principal axis dagan 1989 at the large time limit the longitudinal dispersivity α 11 has the following simplified expression 26 α 11 d 11 t u 1 4 σ f 2 λ 4 model and experimental validation 4 1 rwpt model the conceptual model was based on a 2d single natural fracture surrounded by an impermeable matrix the synthetic model geometry was 180 cm 50 cm with a unit width along the z axis the simulation domain consisted of 9000 grid blocks each of which is divided into a uniform grid block in the x and y directions with dimensions of x y 1 cm respectively the processes of modeling water flow and solute transport is as follows 1 convert the data of the fracture aperture into the data of the conductivity 2 generate a single peaked random field of log normally distributed conductivity by using the t progs code carle and fogg 1996 dai et al 2007b 2020 and utilize the exponential covariance model to verify the steady state of the generated conductivity field 3 conduct the finite different model modflow 96 harbaugh 1996 weissmann et al 2002 to model the groundwater flow and set parameters such as boundaries hydraulic gradients and so on 4 conduct solute transport model by using rwpt model rwhet labolle et al 1996 which can directly recognize the unit by unit flux and head output generated by modflow ren et al 2022 and set the solute injection point location range the number of solute particles and other parameters 5 analyze the results of the rwpt model the detailed process is as follows tsang 1984 found that the fracture aperture follows a gamma distribution by collating the fracture surface profile measurements on seven cores of a natural fracture in granite however other researches showed that fracture aperture follows lognormal distribution moreno et al 1988 muralidharan et al 2004 in addition previous research shows that the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture also follows log normal distribution in this study we assume that the fracture aperture and conductivity vary in an irregular manner in space and should be characterized by a log normal distribution in this study geostatistical methods are used to characterize the aperture field by the variance and integral scale of the log aperture these statistical indices of the log aperture were transformed into statistical indices of the log conductivity for running the groundwater flow model the derivation of the conversion relation of these statistical indices between log aperture and log conductivity could be found in section 4 3 1 geostatistical methods geostatistical characterization modeling and simulation of the conductivity field were performed using a transition probability geostatistical code t progs furthermore the exponential covariance model was utilized to verify the steady state of the generated conductivity field the exponential covariance model is expressed by 27 c y r σ y 2 e x p r i y where the length i y is scaling length parameter r is the vector of the distance between two points σ y 2 is the variance c y r is the covariance then modflow 96 was conducted to generate a steady flow velocity field in a saturated fractured medium we set the boundary conditions of the left side x 0 cm and right side x 180 cm of the flow model as constant head boundaries to ensure an average flow rate of 1 16 10 3 m day the rest of the boundary was set as a zero flux boundary confining boundary and the average flow direction of groundwater is assumed to be parallel to the x axis direction the lbtm assumes that the x direction is aligned with the mean velocity direction and neglects the effects of vertical velocity field therefore the rwpt also neglects the effects of vertical velocity field by only taking the longitudinal velocity in the modflow table 1 shows the hypothetical parameters and average flow velocity of the model the rwpt model was employed to simulate advection and dispersion processes for the instantaneous release of conservative solutes the total simulation time was 800 days and the release time of particles at the source was 1 day a rectangular contamination source was set in the upstream region of the flow field with dimensions of x 3 2 cm y 6 cm and z 1 0 cm the absorption type boundaries were used at the left side x 0 cm and right side x 180 cm of the model and the particles that entered absorbing boundaries were removed from the simulation the remaining boundaries were set as reflect boundaries and the particles will return to the simulation domain when they reach this boundary a total of one million particles were set in this model a schematic diagram of the hydrogeological conceptual model for the synthetic case is shown in fig 3 4 2 solute transport experiment granite core was collected from 531 95 m to 532 65 m below the surface of xinchang which is an underground research laboratory for the geological disposal of high level radioactive waste in the beishan area northwest china wang et al 2018 the granite core has a single vertical natural fracture with a diameter of 62 mm and a length of 90 mm that running the entire core length x ray diffraction xrd analysis shows a composition of plagioclase 40 quartz 28 potassium feldspar 23 and biotite 9 the porosity of the granite sample was 1 273 used by boyle s law technique and the density was 2 583 g cm3 with the weighting method fracture apertures were measured by creaform 3d laser handyscan black which can capture the texture and topography of the fracture surface during measuring fracture apertures we compacted the separated fracture surfaces to maintain the original fracture aperture and location of the two fracture planes and set the standard x y plane parallel to the fracture surface the coordinates of the scanned fracture surface were described in binary files in x y and z format which represented the length width and relative distance of the standard x y plane respectively the voxel size of the laser scanner was set at 0 2 0 2 mm the fracture aperture can be obtained by subtracting the z values of the corresponding fracture surface these results of fracture apertures are shown in fig 4 the figure is a 3d plan view of the fracture aperture field from these results we can get that the mean aperture was 0 65 mm and the variance of the z was 0 39 the correlation length scale was approximately 4 5 mm by utilizing the exponential covariance mode to fit the z covariance of the sample core it should be noted that the variance and integral scale of the log aperture are used to characterize the aperture field of the core sample the upscaled fracture aperture was calculated using the geometric mean and equivalent hydraulic aperture developed by renshaw 1995 the dispersivity was calculated by the lbtm eq 26 a single phase tracer experiment was conducted to determine the btc of a conservative tracer br in synthetic groundwater the fractured core was sealed on the outside with flexible tubular membranes the entire core was subjected to external pressure to ensure that all fluid flowed only in the fracture surface of the core before the experiment the fracture core was rinsed with ultrapure water for two days to ensure that the ph of the groundwater solution in the effluent was stable then the ultrapure water was replaced by the previously prepared conservative bromide tracer solution after a pulse injection of 300 min the influent solution was replaced with ultrapure water again until the end of the experiment the br bearing groundwater solutions c0 and ultrapure water through the fracture core were controlled by the peristaltic pump at a rate of 6 0 ml h the initial concentration of the influent solution was 400 mg l for br the effluent samples at the outlet were collected every 10 min by an automatic fraction collector sbs 100 filled with 10 100 mm polystyrene tubes effluent br concentration was determined by ion chromatograph the duration of the whole experiment was 15 h the br breakthrough curve was modeled by a solute migration simulator cra2 sudicky and frind 1982 to determine physical parameters related to solute transport in the fracture cra2 is a semi analytical simulator used to model 1d transport in fractures and matrix slabs with an arbitrary time varying influent concentration history a variety of transport mechanisms can be considered in this case including 1 advection transport via fluids 2 molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion along the fracture direction 3 matrix diffusion after constructing the solute transport model we implemented a model independent parameter optimizer dai and samper 2004 to derive optimum estimates of transport parameters and used the least squares criterion along with weighted constraints and prior information as the objective function for the inverse problem the objective function was solved by minimizing a generalized least squares criterion using the gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm 4 3 lbtm 4 3 1 validation processes using models the rwpt model was employed to validate the derived lbtm of the dispersivity the difficulty of validation is that the two methods use different base data we need to establish a geostatistical parameter association between y and z note that the variance of y is four times as large as z and the integral scale of y and z is the same in table 1 their relationship can be derived from the genralized modified cl the detailed steps for converting fracture aperture data to conductivity data are as follows the variance can be expressed as 28 σ y 2 1 n j 1 n z x t m x t 2 where σ y 2 is the variance of the modified y or z n is the number of variables z x t is the data value at point x t m x t is the mean value of data simultaneously taking the logarithm of both sides of eq 1 the modified y can be rewritten as 29 y 2 ln b c where c ln ρ g a 12 μ and c is a constant the mean value m k x t of the modified y can be expressed as the mean value m b x t of the z based on eq 27 and its expression is 30 m k x t 2 m b x t c combining eqs 28 30 we rewrite as 31 σ k 2 1 n j 1 n k x t m k x t 2 1 n j 1 n 2 b x t 2 m b x t 2 4 σ b 2 where σ k 2 is the variance of y σ b 2 is the variance of z k x t and b x t are the y and z through the above derivation we can theoretically verify the relationship between the variance of y and z being four times in the same way it can be shown that their covariance values also satisfy the relationship being 4 times the expression of the global integral scale λ y is 32 λ y 1 σ y 2 0 c y r d r the eq 32 can be rewrite as 33 λ y 1 σ k 2 0 c k r d r 1 σ b 2 0 c b r d r λ b where λ y and λ b are the integral scales of y and z respectively and c k r and c b r are their covariances respectively thus the integral scales of y and z are equal finally the upscaled dispersivity was calculated by lbtm eq 26 based on table 1 the upscaled dispersivity can be compared with the effective dispersivity obtained by the rwpt model 4 3 2 validation processes using experiments the single phase tracer experiment was carried out as part of this paper so that the lbtm s predictability could be further validated using the cra2 and the inverse model a fitting was performed on the btc for the fracture transport experiment involving br after that the lbtm was applied to the problem in order to compute the dispersivity and the geometric mean was utilized in order to compute the upscaled fracture aperture we performed the fitting findings between the experiment and the semi analytical model using cra2 with the upscaled values from the geostatistical study the results were expressed in this study as a relative concentration c c0 where c is the concentration of the effluent solution finally the prediction accuracy of the geostatistical analysis was evaluated by the root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r2 which are defined as 34 r m s e 1 n t e s t i 1 n t e s t y i t e s t n o r m y i m o d e l 2 2 and 35 r 2 1 i 1 n t e s t y i t e s t n o r m y i m o d e l 2 2 i 1 n t e s t y i t e s t n o r m y 2 2 where y i model and y i test n o r m are respectively ith model result and its corresponding experimental result y 1 n test i 1 n test y i test n o r m is the mean value for all y i t e s t n o r m i 1 n test a lower rmse and a r2 value approaching 1 0 suggest better model prediction ability 5 results and discussion 5 1 model validation the analytical solution of the exponential covariance is used to verify the steady state of the conductivity field generated by the t progs code the fitting results illustrate that the generated conductivity field satisfies the hypothesis of validating the ascending scale equation fig 5 as the rwpt model can only give the results of displacement variance which quantifies solute spreading around the center of mass the dispersivity α 11 and dispersion coefficient d i j can be expressed by the solute displacement variance x i j 36 a 11 d i j u 1 1 2 d x i j d t i j 1 m the solute displacement variance is a covariance tensor which quantifies solute spreading around the center of mass we used the seventh order polynomial to fit the longitudinal displacement variance results to obtain the dispersivity value of the rwpt model the dispersivity of the lbtm is obtained from eq 26 the longitudinal displacement variance fitted results of the rwpt model using the seventh order polynomial are shown in fig 6 a the rate of solute spreading clearly increases with time in the first 200 days and appears relatively constant after approximately 500 or 600 days the trend of displacement variance with time in natural fractures is similar to that in heterogeneous porous media dai et al 2004 the longitudinal dispersivity fitted results between the rwpt model and lbtm are displayed in fig 6 b the longitudinal dispersivity first increases gradually and finally tends to be constant 4 σ f 2 λ this process behaves pre asymptotically and is consistent with the dispersivity in the porous medium ross et al 2019 in general the results show that the derived scale dependent analytical expressions are in excellent agreement with the results of the rwpt model which indicates that the estimation method can effectively predict the dispersivity of the conservative solute transport in the naturally fractured media without considering matrix diffusion 5 2 experimental validation when developing the conservative solute transport model with car2 the following transport mechanisms were taken into consideration advective transport in fractures molecular diffusion mechanical dispersion along the fracture axis and matrix diffusion the inverse model provide estimates of three parameters including velocity longitudinal dispersivity and fracture aperture the preceding parameter intervals are listed in table 2 which was used to determine them the other parameters were determined using empirical data and experimental readings as the basis for the decision table 2 shows estimated values from the inverse modeling in addition the upscaled fracture aperture was calculated to be 0 56 mm by utilizing the geometric mean keller et al 1995 and the equivalent hydraulic aperture was estimated to be 0 47 and the equivalent hydraulic aperture is lower than the upscaled fracture aperture in this study we select the upscaled fracture aperture to present the breakthrough curve coupling model data the lbtm predicted that the dispersivity of the naturally fractured core would be 7 02 mm the final results of the inverse model are compatible with the rest of the lbtm solute transport model s parameters fig 7 a depicts the fitting results between the experiment and the inverse model with cra2 while fig 7 b depicts the fitting results between the experiment and the coupling model of lbtm and car2 note that the dispersivity of the coupled model is derived from lbtm therefore the experiment and the coupling model are consistent regarding the aperture fields the fitting results of the inverse model and coupling model were almost identical and difficult to discriminate visually the rsme and r2 of the inverse model were 5 069 10 3 and 0 9694 and the rsme and r2 of the coupling model of lbtm and car2 were 5 080 10 3 and 0 9693 respectively these indicate that the model fitted data was slightly better than the coupling model in addition the breakthrough time of the inverse model was slightly greater than that of the coupling model the reason for this result may be that the greater longitudinal dispersivity leads to a shorter breakthrough time and a longer process duration jia et al 2022 ma et al 2021 however the greater fracture aperture will lead to a longer breakthrough time note that the longitudinal dispersivity is the main effect relative to the fracture aperture in this case the estimated value of dispersivity based on the lbtm is 10 55 larger than the measured dispersivity from the breakthrough experiments on the other hand the estimated upscaled fracture aperture by using the geometric mean is 22 6 smaller than the measured effective fracture aperture this is despite the fact that the fitting results of the two models are comparable this gap can be traced to the mistakes introduced by the experiments the conceptual assumptions made in generating the equations and the heterogeneities of the fracture apertures that were not thoroughly sampled by measuring tools all of these factors contributed to the discrepancy the experiments led to a number of flaws the most significant of which were measurement errors and problems with the implementation of the in situ environment since the convection dispersion equation served as the basis for deriving the lbtm this model did not take into account the matrix diffusion effect the matrix diffusion effect of solute transport over the fractured medium in the real environment may cause a slow down in the migration of the solute and delay concentration peaks sudicky and frind 1982 have shown that the travel times in a system of parallel fractures with matrix diffusion between the fractures are significantly larger than those where only transport in fractures is taken into account on this basis the estimated value of the dispersivity that was calculated by the lbtm will be lower than the actual value in addition the laser scanning did not capture all of the heterogeneities in the distribution of the fracture apertures this circumstance will result in a disparity between the estimated value produced by the lbtm and the value that was actually measured by the transport experiment 5 3 sensitivity analysis 5 3 1 integral scale λ in this study the sensitivity analysis of lbtm was used to determine the qualitative impact of each parameter firstly we set the integral scale λ as 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 and the variance of the log fracture aperture σ f 2 as 1 0 then according to eqs 24 and 25 we carried out the sensitivity analysis of λ for the dispersivity fig 3 shows the time evolution of both α 11 and α 22 with the change of λ dagan 1989 concluded that the evolution trend of the dispersivity as τ increases in heterogeneous aquifers gelhar 1993 also found that the α 11 in heterogeneous aquifer media increased with τ and reached a constant value after the average migration distance exceeded the critical scale furthermore kumar et al 2008 used numerical modeling and showed that dispersivity in fractured media is time dependent both α 11 and α 22 are sensitive to λ as shown in fig 8 when λ increases the dispersivity also increases it is clear that the dispersivity is a scale dependent parameter and function of the integral scale in addition the α 11 of the fractured media first increases and reaches a gradual value of 4 σ f 2 λ which is consistent with the previous conclusion that the dispersion is time dependent furthermore the findings support the view of preasymtotic behavior for dispersivity in fractured media the α 11 has a strong linear relationship with λ the α 22 being time dependent first increases with τ then decreases and finally approaches 0 this means that the solute does not expand along the transverse direction and the transverse dispersivity is zero it is mathematically related to the transverse velocity covariances u 22 being of zero integral scales along lines parallel to the principal axis 5 3 2 variance of log fracture aperture σ f 2 the σ f 2 was set as 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 in order to test the sensitivity of the dispersivity to changes in σ f 2 the integral scale was set as 1 0 fig 9 shows that as σ f 2 increases α 11 and α 22 also increase this was because the dispersivity is directly proportional to the σ f 2 in eqs 24 and 25 the longitudinal dispersivity is much greater than the transverse dispersivity 6 summary and conclusions this paper developed a lagrangian based transport model lbtm for analyzing conservative solute dispersivity in 2d fractured rocks surrounded by an impermeable matrix the model estimates dispersivity requiring only the acquisition of fractured geostatistical data the efficiency of such a methodology was confirmed for hypothesized and experimental fractures however this model has not yet predicted the solute transport parameters at the site and regional scales this is despite the fact that the model was used to verify the model s accuracy for dispersivity if the necessary statistics can be gathered our subsequent research may use this model to predict conservative solute transports at the site and regional scales in order to improve our understanding of scale dependent solute transport parameters this will only be possible if the model is given the necessary data at the site scale transport simulations in fractures face difficulties in obtaining flow and transport parameters our developed model can directly derive the dispersivity of solute transport in fractures at arbitrary scales and it can provide a quick estimation of the dispersivity in a fracture the identification process is based on geostatistical data without any additional experimental data and geostatistical data can be easily obtained through geophysical surveys the lbtm is potentially applicable for subsurface research related to the solute transport in natural fractures such as shale gas extraction enhanced geothermal systems enhanced oil recovery underground gas storage and field development plans in natural carbonate reservoirs the developed model could be expanded to consider sorption matrix diffusion and radioactive decay in the future the extended model is potentially applicable for the safety assessment of geological disposal of high level waste the nuclide transport parameters are set mainly based on the assumptions of survey data at this stage which have no corresponding theoretical basis for the variations in evolutionary scenarios of uncertainty analysis mallants and beiraghdar 2021 the expanded model could fill the gap in the theoretical basis for the parameter assignment of the radionuclide transport model in terms of scenario uncertainty and parameter uncertainty to be more specific the expanded model could provide radionuclide transport parameter values

ppcps by ammonia chlorine was systematically investigated in this study compared with chlorination ammonia chlorine markedly enhanced ppcp degradation and the degradation efficiencies of most ppcps were greater than 70 tert butanol strongly suppressed ppcp degradation while bicarbonate suppressed it moderately suggesting the importance of clo and co3 in ppcp degradation in neutral conditions

research described in the article 1 introduction pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps are continuously released to the environment from their manufacture use and disposal and they have been frequently detected in various water bodies the physical and chemical properties of ppcps vary and these compounds can have deleterious effects on aquatic environments and biota such as causing carcinogenicity endocrine disruption ecology toxicity and the diffusion of antibiotic resistance genes nguyen et al 2015 rochester 2013 despite their trace concentrations osachoff et al 2014 roberts et al 2016 ppcps are often pseudo persistent bioaccumulative and can pose environmental and health risks brodin et al 2013 paltiel et al 2016 a recent study reported that low to middle income countries have the most severe pharmaceutical pollution wilkinson et al 2022 if this pollution is not treated properly it will cause potential risks to human health and could destroy the aqueous ecology li et al 2022 sun et al 2021 weidhaas et al 2022 chlorine is used worldwide to disinfect drinking water and wastewater kong et al 2021b yang and shang 2004 zhang et al 2015 chlorination is also reported to be effective for the degradation of organic pollutants that contain electron rich moieties such as phenolic and primary amine moieties acero et al 2010 lee and von gunten 2010 negreira et al 2015 wu et al 2020b however chlorination is selectively effective free chlorine or chloramines are unable to break down most pollutants the photolysis of chlorine uv chlorine and solar chlorine can achieve the rapid and effective elimination of ppcps by generating various reactive species including hydroxyl radicals oh and reactive chlorine species fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 hua et al 2019 li et al 2018 among these species oh has the highest standard reduction potential e 0 2 8 v cheng et al 2019 kong et al 2021a reactive chlorine species including cl e 0 2 47 v cl2 e 0 2 0 v and clo e 0 1 5 1 8 v are less oxidative and more selective than oh guo et al 2018 however the photolysis of chlorine is often favored in acidic conditions kong et al 2020 wang et al 2016 and it is limited by the transmittance of light recent studies have reported the degradation of atrazine atz carbamazepine cbz caffeine and n n diethyl 3 toluamide deet by the ammonia chlorine oxidation process wang et al 2018 ye et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 ammonia chlorine oxidation can be easily achieved during the chlorination of effluent after biological treatment because ammonia is inherently present the median ammonia concentrations in wastewater treatment plant influents in china have remained stable since 2007 xu et al 2020 ammonia concentrations ranged from 9 to 39 mg n l in influents and from 0 1 to 1 6 mg n l in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants in china hu 2021 this indicates that ammonia chlorine oxidation could be a potential water treatment for degrading ppcps in reclaimed water furthermore it is a simple rapid and energy efficient technology besides chlorine various reactive species have been proposed to contribute to the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants during ammonia chlorine oxidation such as onooh onoo oh reactive chlorine species reactive nitrogen species and some unknown species lu et al 2023 schreiber and mitch 2007 wang et al 2018 ye et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 however the formation and contribution of reactive species are still unclear because of the complex chain reactions in general hno has been proposed as the primary intermediate formed from nhcl2 reacting with hocl during ammonia chlorine some researches proposed that hno dominantly reacted with dissolved oxygen to form onooh onoo which subsequently decomposed into oh and no2 aghdam et al 2021 wang et al 2018 ye et al 2021 a recent research proposed that hno dominantly proceeded a dimer reaction and subsequently formed oh which process was independent on dissolved oxygen lu et al 2023 the generated oh would further react with chlorine hocl or ocl to form the reactive chlorine species cl cl2 clo thus though there are a few studies focusing on the ammonia chlorine oxidation the main reactive species and their roles for the degradation of various pollutants are still controversial the reactivity between a reactive species and a ppcp depends on the ppcps structures wu et al 2017 hydroxyl radicals oh can non selectively and rapidly react with most ppcps while reactive chlorine species i e cl cl2 clo preferentially react with compounds containing electron rich moieties such as olefins phenols alkoxybenzenes and anilines guo et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 the oxidation performance will be expected to vary in a wide range for the target ppcps consisting of diverse chemical structures during the oxidation dominated by selective reactive species thus the study on the degradation of structurally diverse ppcps can improve the understanding of the ammonia chlorine oxidation process in this study atenolol atn atz benzotriazole btz bezafibrate bzf cbz deet metoprolol mtp and primidone pmd were selected as typical ppcps the second order rate constants between ppcps and oh are in a relatively narrow range of 2 4 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 while those between ppcps and clo are in a relatively wide range of 0 1 24 107 m 1 s 1 table s1 the degradation

collected in different seasons at the same municipal wastewater treatment plant in shenzhen china one in april and the other in december 2 2 experimental procedure ammonia chlorine and chlorination experiments were conducted by spiking a specific amount of free chlorine into 20 ml of reaction solution in a beaker at 25 c the initial ammonia concentration was adjusted to 2 mg n l for ammonia chlorine and 0 mg n l for chlorination the initial concentration of each ppcp was approximately 20 µg l and 20 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs was added to maintain the solution at ph 7 the experiments of this study were conducted at the ppcps concentration higher than those in real wastewater for better operation and analysis however this would not affect the oxidation capability assessment and reactive species mechanism understand of ammonia chlorine tba bicarbonate and nom were added into the beaker separately to explore the role of radicals and matric influence the solution was stirred for 20 min at 300 r min by a magnetic stirrer at specified intervals samples were collected and quenched by adding excess na2s2o3 the role of radicals in ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine was further investigated using a micro injection system following an established method wang et al 2018 in this system free chlorine and ammonia solutions were simultaneously and continuously spiked into the ppcps solution at specific cl2 n molar ratio this operation helps us to observe the ammonia chlorine oxidation at relatively slow speed the reaction solution was 100 ml and the initial concentration of each ppcp was approximately 200 µg l with the addition of 1 µm nb the solution was maintained at ph 7 by 20 mm pbs naclo stock solution 6 55 g cl2 l and nh4cl stock solution 384 6 mg

3 1 ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine and chlorination the degradation of eight typical ppcps by ammonia chlorine and chlorination was compared at different chlorine doses at ph 7 0 as shown in fig 1 the ppcps were all resistant to chlorination while ammonia chlorine greatly enhanced the degradation of the structurally diverse ppcps the ppcps were thought to be degraded by the reactive species generated in the ammonia chlorine process rather than by direct oxidation by chlorine the efficiency of ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine highly depended on the cl2 n molar ratio ppcp degradation slowly increased with the cl2 n molar ratio increasing from 0 to 1 degradation sharply increased thereafter and maximum degradation was reached at a cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 when the cl2 n molar ratio was increased past 1 6 the ppcp degradation efficiency began to decline at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 the degradation efficiencies of the typical ppcps were mostly greater than 70 in the following order cbz 100 mtp 92 0 0 7 atn 85 6 0 5 btz 77 9 1 4 bzf 77 7 1 1 deet 73 0 0 1 pmd 69 1 0 4 and atz 43 0 1 4 cbz degradation was much more efficient than atz degradation cbz was completely degraded within 20 min in contrast only 43 of atz was degraded in this time this difference resulted from the different reactivities of the reactive species and ppcps the eight ppcps could be classified into two groups according to the ratio of ppcp degradation efficiency obtained at cl2 n molar ratio of 4 0 to 1 0 table s4 one group consisted of atz and deet and the other contained the remaining six ppcps no enhancement was found in the degradation efficiency of atz and deet at cl2 n molar ratio of 4 0 compared with that at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 0 while significant enhancements in degradation were found for the other ppcps especially for cbz degradation and bzf degradation with the ratios greater than 1 the ppcps showed the following descending order of the ratio of ppcp degradation efficiency obtained at cl2 n molar ratio of 4 0 to cl2 n molar ratio of 1 0 cbz 5 7 bzf 5 1 mtp 2 6 atn 2 1 btz 1 7 pmd 1 5 deet 1 0 and atz 1 0 a previous study found that the steady state concentration of oh at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 0 was relatively low and close to that at cl2 n molar ratio of 4 0 but a large amount of clo was found at cl2 n molar ratio of 4 0 ye et al 2021 when cl2 n molar ratio was greater than 1 6 free chlorine residual occurred and rapidly reacted with oh and formed clo to relatively high concentrations the concentration of clo increased with increasing cl2 n molar ratios the similar phenomenon was also reported by a recent study lu et al 2023 the second order rate constants of ppcps reacting with radicals are listed in table s1 the discrepancy in the downward trends among the eight ppcps could be attributed to different reactivities between ppcps and clo atz and deet are refractory to clo and their second order rate constants with clo are reported to be less than 1 106 m 1 s 1 kong et al 2020 wu et al 2017 which may explain the sharp decline in their degradation at cl2 n molar ratio greater than 1 6 3 2 role of reactive species in ppcp degradation at the cl2 n molar ratio greater than 1 0 ammonia chlorine proceeds a series of chain reactions table s5 monochloramine reacts with chlorine to form dichloramine dichloramine reacts with chlorine to form hno which can go through either dissolved oxygen dependent or dissolved oxygen independent pathways to rapidly decompose to form oh and oh reacts with chlorine to form clo thus ammonia chlorine was proposed to be a process containing various reactive species including oh reactive chlorine species i e cl and clo and reactive nitrogen species i e no and no2 driss and bouhelassa 2013 lu et al 2023 qiang and adams 2004 schreiber and mitch 2007 to explore the role of reactive species in ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine two radical scavengers tba and bicarbonate were used in the experiments tba rapidly reacts with oh cl and clo however hco3 preferentially reacts with cl compared with other reactive species the second order rate constant of hco3 reacting with oh is two orders of magnitude lower than that of tba and its reaction with clo was neglected table s6 3 2 1 effect of tba as shown in fig 2 tba exhibited a strong scavenging effect on ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 at 1 mm tba the degradation of ppcps was significantly inhibited and the inhibition varied among ppcps from 47 3 to 68 6 the degradation efficiency of atn atz btz bzf cbz deet mtp and pmd was almost half of that obtained at 0 mm tba being 33 0 8 0 23 1 30 2 52 7 21 1 37 4 and 20 9 respectively the scavenging effect grew more dramatical with increasing tba concentration and 10 mm tba was sufficient to suppress nearly all reactive species contributing to ppcp degradation except in cbz and mtp degradation the degradation efficiencies of atn atz btz bzf deet and pmd were similar at 10 mm and 100 mm tba and were less than 5 which indicated that tba completely inhibited the degradation of these ppcps the degradation efficiency of cbz was 19 2 at 10 mm tba and 10 4 at 100 mm tba while the degradation efficiency of mtp was 12 0 at 10 mm tba and 7 1 at 100 mm tba there were still a few degradations of cbz and mtp by ammonia chlorine in the presence of high tba which can be attributed to the reactive species remaining in the system even at a high concentration tba cannot fully scavenge all reactive species 3 2 2 effect of bicarbonate compared with tba bicarbonate had a milder scavenging effect on ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 fig 3 in general the inhibition of hco3 on the ppcps degradation was slight at 1 mm 5 7 17 7 inhibition and increased to a moderate extent 57 5 83 1 at 100 mm the degradation efficiency of atn atz btz bzf cbz deet mtp and pmd was 69 9 31 9 61 4 66 4 94 4 57 3 71 1 and 53 9 respectively which was only slightly lower than that obtained without bicarbonate increasing hco3 to 100 mm the degradation efficiency of atn atz btz bzf cbz deet mtp and pmd decreased to 23 4 10 8 13 3 19 5 26 0 10 0 23 7 and 14 6 respectively which was much lower than that obtained without bicarbonate but still much higher than that obtained at 100 mm tba tba rapidly reacts with oh cl and clo while hco3 only reacts with oh and cl and its reaction with clo was neglected wu et al 2017 according to eqs 1 and 2 hco3 can react with oh and cl to form reactive co3 which can react with ppcps the large difference in the scavenging effect on ppcp degradation between 100 mm tba and 100 mm hco3 was likely owing to the contribution of reactive species of clo and co3 to ppcps degradation the nonnegligible contribution of reactive chlorine species and co3 was also found in the degradation of deet and nalidixic acid by uv chlorine process wu et al 2017 while clo was also found to be important in the degradation of cbz by ammonia chlorine lu et al 2023 1 hco 3 co 3 2 oh co 3 h 2 o o h 2 hco 3 co 3 2 cl co 3 hcl c l the contribution of clo to atz and deet degradation could be neglected because their second order rate constants are less than 1 106 m 1 s 1 kong et al 2020 wu et al 2017 however 10 8 of atz and 10 0 of deet were degraded at 100 mm hco3 at 100 mm tba the degradation efficiencies of atz and deet were 3 3 and 2 0 respectively the second order rate constants for co3 reacting with atz and deet are 3 7 106 m 1 s 1 and 4 8 106 m 1 s 1 respectively canonica et al 2005 wu et al 2017 the enhanced degradation of atz and deet at 100 mm hco3 could be attributed to newly generated co3 3 2 3 contributions of reactive species to ppcp degradation to further investigate the contribution of reactive species to ppcp degradation during the ammonia chlorine process probe nb and radical scavengers tba or bicarbonate were added to the microinjection system at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 and the results are shown in fig s2 the degradation of nb and ppcps followed pseudo first order kinetics after achieving steady state the rate constant f the reaction between nb and oh is 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and reactions between nb and reactive chlorine species can be neglected hua et al 2019 the reactions between nb and other unknown reactive species are unclear in this work nb was assumed to be only degraded through volatilization and oxidation by oh on the basis of this assumption steady state concentrations of oh and its contribution to ppcps degradation may be overestimated fig 4 shows the contribution of reactive species to ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine the observed degradation rates k for all ppcps markedly decreased in the presence of the two scavengers and oh was found to predominate in all ppcp degradations the dominant role of oh in ppcps degradation by ammonia chlorine was also found by previous studies lu et al 2023 patton et al 2022 the contribution of oh to ppcp degradation was in the descending order of atz 100 deet 100 pmd 96 mtp 93 bzf 91 cbz 87 atn 80 and btz 74 for atz and deet the observed degradation rates by other reactive species k others increased at 100 mm hco3 suggesting that co3 contributed to their degradation the k others for pmd bzf mtp and cbz slightly changed in the presence of bicarbonate indicating the participation of clo and co3 in their degradation however the k others for btz and atn markedly declined in the presence of bicarbonate which suggested the contribution of unknown reactive species 3 3 application in reclaimed water 3 3 1 effect of nom nom usually competes with pollutants for various reactive species to investigate the effect of nom on ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine 3 mg c l doc and 5 mg c l doc were achieved with the addition of nom as shown in fig 5 ppcps degradation was moderately suppressed by nom the inhibition rates of ppcps degradation in different conditions during the ammonia chlorine oxidation process are listed in table s7 the ratios of the inhibition rates of ppcp degradation at different nom concentrations were calculated through simple division atz and pmd degradation were the most suppressed by nom whereas cbz atn and mtp degradation were affected the least the inhibition rates of ppcp degradation increased with increasing nom concentration especially in the degradation of cbz mtp and bzf the ratios of inhibition rates of the ppcps differed widely from 1 0 to 13 1 suggesting that nom had a selective effect on ppcp degradation the ratio of atz was 1 0 indicating that 3 mg c l doc completely inhibited atz degradation the ratios of cbz mtp and bzf 13 1 6 6 and 4 3 respectively were far greater than those of the other ppcps suggesting that the degradation of these ppcps was suppressed more at higher nom concentrations the second order rate constants for nom reacting with oh and clo are reportedly 2 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 and 4 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 wu et al 2017 indicating a stronger quenching effect of nom on clo than oh the greater reduction of clo at higher nom concentrations may have induced the sharp decrease in the degradation of ppcps that are highly reactive with clo which may explain the enhanced inhibitory effect on the degradation of cbz mtp and bzf with increasing nom concentration 3 3 2 ppcp degradation in reclaimed water the ammonia chlorine oxidation process was applied to degrade ppcps in reclaimed water two reclaimed water samples were collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in december and april the doc values were 3 0 and 3 3 mg c l and the inorganic carbon concentrations were 12 1 and 13 1 mg c l respectively the degradation results of the eight ppcps in the reclaimed water by ammonia chlorine at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 are shown in fig 6 and fig s3 the ppcp degradations in the reclaimed water was suppressed to varying degrees atz and pmd degradation were suppressed the most while cbz atn and mtp degradation were affected the least which was consistent with the effect of nom the reclaimed water showed a strong inhibitory effect on ppcp degradation the degradation efficiencies of the eight ppcps in the reclaimed water were much lower than those obtained even at 5 mg c l doc the enhanced inhibitory effect on ppcp degradation could have resulted from the discrepancy in the organic composition of nom and dissolved organic matter in the reclaimed water or from the influence of complex inorganic ions present in the reclaimed water the degradation efficiencies of cbz mtp and atn were greater than 60 in the two reclaimed water samples suggesting the feasibility of the ammonia chlorine oxidation process in reclaimed water 3 4 formation of volatile halogenated byproducts the formation of volatile halogenated byproducts in reclaimed water 3 0 mg c l doc with eight ppcps spiked was determined for the processes of ammonia chlorine and chlorination and the results are shown in fig 7 among the sixteen selected volatile halogenated byproducts eight were detected after treatment being chloroform tcm chloral hydrate ch 1 1 1 trichloropropanone tcp dichloroacetonitrile dcan bromodichloromethane bdcm bromochloroacetonitrile bcan trichloroacetamide tcacam and dibromoacetonitrile dban the amount of volatile halogenated byproducts formed by chlorination varied greatly from 0 3 to 19 4 µg l the main byproducts were tcm and ch a result that was also reported in a previous study ye et al 2021 by changing from chlorination to ammonia chlorine the byproducts decreased to less than 10 µg l free chlorine reacts with ammonia and transforms into chloramines which have lower reactivity with dom than with free chlorine this reduces the formation of chlorinated byproducts in reclaimed water bromide is oxidized to bromine by chlorine brominated byproducts are usually formed through electrophilic substitutions of dom chlorinated dom by bromine or chlorine substitution of chlorinated dom by bromine langsa et al 2017 compared with direct chlorination the large consumption of chlorine by ammonia reduced the formation of bromine thus fewer brominated byproducts were formed however the formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts was highly concerned for the ammonia chlorine oxidation shang et al 2000 yang et al 2005 it is necessitated to raise the further investigations on the formation efficiency mechanism and control of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts 4 conclusions the degradation of eight structurally diverse ppcps was considerably increased by ammonia chlorine treatment the degradation was maximal at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 in neutral conditions reaching greater than 70 degradation for most ppcps the contribution of reactive species to degrading the different ppcps widely varied tba strongly suppressed ppcp degradation whereas bicarbonate moderately suppressed degradation these results suggest the importance of clo and co3 for ppcp degradation although oh dominated ppcp degradation with contributions ranging from 74 to 100 regarding the effect of nom atz and pmd degradation were the most inhibited whereas cbz atn and mtp degradation were the least affected ppcp degradation was suppressed in reclaimed water but the findings suggest the feasibility of using ammonia chlorine oxidation to degrade ppcps in reclaimed water compared with chlorination fewer volatile halogenated byproducts were formed after ammonia chlorine the formation of each byproduct was less than 10 µg l and tcm was the predominant byproduct

limited by the transmittance of light recent studies have reported the degradation of atrazine atz carbamazepine cbz caffeine and n n diethyl 3 toluamide deet by the ammonia chlorine oxidation process wang et al 2018 ye et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 ammonia chlorine oxidation can be easily achieved during the chlorination of effluent after biological treatment because ammonia is inherently present the median ammonia concentrations in wastewater treatment plant influents in china have remained stable since 2007 xu et al 2020 ammonia concentrations ranged from 9 to 39 mg n l in influents and from 0 1 to 1 6 mg n l in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants in china hu 2021 this indicates that ammonia chlorine oxidation could be a potential water treatment for degrading ppcps in reclaimed water furthermore it is a simple rapid and energy efficient technology besides chlorine various reactive species have been proposed to contribute to the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants during ammonia chlorine oxidation such as onooh onoo oh reactive chlorine species reactive nitrogen species and some unknown species lu et al 2023 schreiber and mitch 2007 wang et al 2018 ye et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 however the formation and contribution of reactive species are still unclear because of the complex chain reactions in general hno has been proposed as the primary intermediate formed from nhcl2 reacting with hocl during ammonia chlorine some researches proposed that hno dominantly reacted with dissolved oxygen to form onooh onoo which subsequently decomposed into oh and no2 aghdam et al 2021 wang et al 2018 ye et al 2021 a recent research proposed that hno dominantly proceeded a dimer reaction and subsequently formed oh which process was independent on dissolved oxygen lu et al 2023 the generated oh would further react with chlorine hocl or ocl to form the reactive chlorine species cl cl2 clo thus though there are a few studies focusing on the ammonia chlorine oxidation the main reactive species and their roles for the degradation of various pollutants are still controversial the reactivity between a reactive species and a ppcp depends on the ppcps structures wu et al 2017 hydroxyl radicals oh can non selectively and rapidly react with most ppcps while reactive chlorine species i e cl cl2 clo preferentially react with compounds containing electron rich moieties such as olefins phenols alkoxybenzenes and anilines guo et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 the oxidation performance will be expected to vary in a wide range for the target ppcps consisting of diverse chemical structures during the oxidation dominated by selective reactive species thus the study on the degradation of structurally diverse ppcps can improve the understanding of the ammonia chlorine oxidation process in this study atenolol atn atz benzotriazole btz bezafibrate bzf cbz deet metoprolol mtp and primidone pmd were selected as typical ppcps the second order rate constants between ppcps and oh are in a relatively narrow range of 2 4 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 while those between ppcps and clo are in a relatively wide range of 0 1 24 107 m 1 s 1 table s1 the degradation of theses typical ppcps by ammonia chlorine was studied and compared with degradation by chlorination the effects of tert butanol tba bicarbonate and natural organic matter nom on ppcp degradation

collected in different seasons at the same municipal wastewater treatment plant in shenzhen china one in april and the other in december 2 2 experimental procedure ammonia chlorine and chlorination experiments were conducted by spiking a specific amount of free chlorine into 20 ml of reaction solution in a beaker at 25 c the initial ammonia concentration was adjusted to 2 mg n l for ammonia chlorine and 0 mg n l for chlorination the initial concentration of each ppcp was approximately 20 µg l and 20 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs was added to maintain the solution at ph 7 the experiments of this study were conducted at the ppcps concentration higher than those in real wastewater for better operation and analysis however this would not affect the oxidation capability assessment and reactive species mechanism understand of ammonia chlorine tba bicarbonate and nom were added into the beaker separately to explore the role of radicals and matric influence the solution was stirred for 20 min at 300 r min by a magnetic stirrer at specified intervals samples were collected and quenched by adding excess na2s2o3 the role of radicals in ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine was further investigated using a micro injection system following an established method wang et al 2018 in this system free chlorine and ammonia solutions were simultaneously and continuously spiked into the ppcps solution at specific cl2 n molar ratio this operation helps us to observe the ammonia chlorine oxidation at relatively slow speed the reaction solution was 100 ml and the initial concentration of each ppcp was approximately 200 µg l with the addition of 1 µm nb the solution was maintained at ph 7 by 20 mm pbs naclo stock solution 6 55 g cl2 l and nh4cl stock solution 384 6 mg

detected by a gas chromatography system equipped with an electron capture detector following an established method wu et al 2020a detailed information is provided in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine and chlorination the degradation of eight typical ppcps by ammonia chlorine and chlorination was compared at different chlorine doses at ph 7 0 as shown in fig 1 the ppcps were all resistant to chlorination while ammonia chlorine greatly enhanced the degradation of the structurally diverse ppcps the ppcps were thought to be degraded by the reactive species generated in the ammonia chlorine process rather than by direct oxidation by chlorine the efficiency of ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine highly depended on the cl2 n molar ratio ppcp degradation slowly increased with the cl2 n molar ratio increasing from 0 to 1 degradation sharply increased thereafter and maximum degradation was reached at a cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 when the cl2 n molar ratio was increased past 1 6 the ppcp degradation efficiency began to decline at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 the degradation efficiencies of the typical ppcps were mostly greater than 70 in the following order cbz 100 mtp 92 0 0 7 atn 85 6 0 5 btz 77 9 1 4 bzf 77 7 1 1 deet 73 0 0 1 pmd 69 1 0 4 and atz 43 0 1 4 cbz degradation was much more efficient than atz degradation cbz was completely degraded within 20 min in contrast only 43 of atz was degraded in this time this difference resulted from the different reactivities of the reactive species and ppcps the eight ppcps could be classified into two groups according to the ratio of ppcp degradation efficiency obtained at cl2 n molar ratio of 4 0 to 1 0 table s4 one group consisted of atz and deet and the other contained the remaining six ppcps no enhancement was found in the degradation efficiency of atz and deet at cl2 n molar ratio of 4 0 compared with that at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 0 while significant enhancements in degradation were found for the other ppcps especially for cbz degradation and bzf degradation with the ratios greater than 1 the ppcps showed the following descending order of the ratio of ppcp degradation efficiency obtained at cl2 n molar ratio of 4 0 to cl2 n molar ratio of 1 0 cbz 5 7 bzf 5 1 mtp 2 6 atn 2 1 btz 1 7 pmd 1 5 deet 1 0 and atz 1 0 a previous study found that the steady state concentration of oh at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 0 was relatively low and close to that at cl2 n molar ratio of 4 0 but a large amount of clo was found at cl2 n molar ratio of 4 0 ye et al 2021 when cl2 n molar ratio was greater than 1 6 free chlorine residual occurred and rapidly reacted with oh and formed clo to relatively high concentrations the concentration of clo increased with increasing cl2 n molar ratios the similar phenomenon was also reported by a recent study lu et al 2023 the second order rate constants of ppcps reacting with radicals are listed in table s1 the discrepancy in the downward trends among the eight ppcps could be attributed to different reactivities between ppcps and clo atz and deet are refractory to clo and their second order rate constants with clo are reported to be less than 1 106 m 1 s 1 kong et al 2020 wu et al 2017 which may explain the sharp decline in their degradation at cl2 n molar ratio greater than 1 6 3 2 role of reactive species in ppcp degradation at the cl2 n molar ratio greater than 1 0 ammonia chlorine proceeds a series of chain reactions table s5 monochloramine reacts with chlorine to form dichloramine dichloramine reacts with chlorine to form hno which can go through either dissolved oxygen dependent or dissolved oxygen independent pathways to rapidly decompose to form oh and oh reacts with chlorine to form clo thus ammonia chlorine was proposed to be a process containing various reactive species including oh reactive chlorine species i e cl and clo and reactive nitrogen species i e no and no2 driss and bouhelassa 2013 lu et al 2023 qiang and adams 2004 schreiber and mitch 2007 to explore the role of reactive species in ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine two radical scavengers tba and bicarbonate were used in the experiments tba rapidly reacts with oh cl and clo however hco3 preferentially reacts with cl compared with other reactive species the second order rate constant of hco3 reacting with oh is two orders of magnitude lower than that of tba and its reaction with clo was neglected table s6 3 2 1 effect of tba as shown in fig 2 tba exhibited a strong scavenging effect on ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 at 1 mm tba the degradation of ppcps was significantly inhibited and the inhibition varied among ppcps from 47 3 to 68 6 the degradation efficiency of atn atz btz bzf cbz deet mtp and pmd was almost half of that obtained at 0 mm tba being 33 0 8 0 23 1 30 2 52 7 21 1 37 4 and 20 9 respectively the scavenging effect grew more dramatical with increasing tba concentration and 10 mm tba was sufficient to suppress nearly all reactive species contributing to ppcp degradation except in cbz and mtp degradation the degradation efficiencies of atn atz btz bzf deet and pmd were similar at 10 mm and 100 mm tba and were less than 5 which indicated that tba completely inhibited the degradation of these ppcps the degradation efficiency of cbz was 19 2 at 10 mm tba and 10 4 at 100 mm tba while the degradation efficiency of mtp was 12 0 at 10 mm tba and 7 1 at 100 mm tba there were still a few degradations of cbz and mtp by ammonia chlorine in the presence of high tba which can be attributed to the reactive species remaining in the system even at a high concentration tba cannot fully scavenge all reactive species 3 2 2 effect of bicarbonate compared with tba bicarbonate had a milder scavenging effect on ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 fig 3 in general the inhibition of hco3 on the ppcps degradation was slight at 1 mm 5 7 17 7 inhibition and increased to a moderate extent 57 5 83 1 at 100 mm the degradation efficiency of atn atz btz bzf cbz deet mtp and pmd was 69 9 31 9 61 4 66 4 94 4 57 3 71 1 and 53 9 respectively which was only slightly lower than that obtained without bicarbonate increasing hco3 to 100 mm the degradation efficiency of atn atz btz bzf cbz deet mtp and pmd decreased to 23 4 10 8 13 3 19 5 26 0 10 0 23 7 and 14 6 respectively which was much lower than that obtained without bicarbonate but still much higher than that obtained at 100 mm tba tba rapidly reacts with oh cl and clo while hco3 only reacts with oh and cl and its reaction with clo was neglected wu et al 2017 according to eqs 1 and 2 hco3 can react with oh and cl to form reactive co3 which can react with ppcps the large difference in the scavenging effect on ppcp degradation between 100 mm tba and 100 mm hco3 was likely owing to the contribution of reactive species of clo and co3 to ppcps degradation the nonnegligible contribution of reactive chlorine species and co3 was also found in the degradation of deet and nalidixic acid by uv chlorine process wu et al 2017 while clo was also found to be important in the degradation of cbz by ammonia chlorine lu et al 2023 1 hco 3 co 3 2 oh co 3 h 2 o o h 2 hco 3 co 3 2 cl co 3 hcl c l the contribution of clo to atz and deet degradation could be neglected because their second order rate constants are less than 1 106 m 1 s 1 kong et al 2020 wu et al 2017 however 10 8 of atz and 10 0 of deet were degraded at 100 mm hco3 at 100 mm tba the degradation efficiencies of atz and deet were 3 3 and 2 0 respectively the second order rate constants for co3 reacting with atz and deet are 3 7 106 m 1 s 1 and 4 8 106 m 1 s 1 respectively canonica et al 2005 wu et al 2017 the enhanced degradation of atz and deet at 100 mm hco3 could be attributed to newly generated co3 3 2 3 contributions of reactive species to ppcp degradation to further investigate the contribution of reactive species to ppcp degradation during the ammonia chlorine process probe nb and radical scavengers tba or bicarbonate were added to the microinjection system at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 and the results are shown in fig s2 the degradation of nb and ppcps followed pseudo first order kinetics after achieving steady state the rate constant f the reaction between nb and oh is 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and reactions between nb and reactive chlorine species can be neglected hua et al 2019 the reactions between nb and other unknown reactive species are unclear in this work nb was assumed to be only degraded through volatilization and oxidation by oh on the basis of this assumption steady state concentrations of oh and its contribution to ppcps degradation may be overestimated fig 4 shows the contribution of reactive species to ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine the observed degradation rates k for all ppcps markedly decreased in the presence of the two scavengers and oh was found to predominate in all ppcp degradations the dominant role of oh in ppcps degradation by ammonia chlorine was also found by previous studies lu et al 2023 patton et al 2022 the contribution of oh to ppcp degradation was in the descending order of atz 100 deet 100 pmd 96 mtp 93 bzf 91 cbz 87 atn 80 and btz 74 for atz and deet the observed degradation rates by other reactive species k others increased at 100 mm hco3 suggesting that co3 contributed to their degradation the k others for pmd bzf mtp and cbz slightly changed in the presence of bicarbonate indicating the participation of clo and co3 in their degradation however the k others for btz and atn markedly declined in the presence of bicarbonate which suggested the contribution of unknown reactive species 3 3 application in reclaimed water 3 3 1 effect of nom nom usually competes with pollutants for various reactive species to investigate the effect of nom on ppcp degradation by ammonia chlorine 3 mg c l doc and 5 mg c l doc were achieved with the addition of nom as shown in fig 5 ppcps degradation was moderately suppressed by nom the inhibition rates of ppcps degradation in different conditions during the ammonia chlorine oxidation process are listed in table s7 the ratios of the inhibition rates of ppcp degradation at different nom concentrations were calculated through simple division atz and pmd degradation were the most suppressed by nom whereas cbz atn and mtp degradation were affected the least the inhibition rates of ppcp degradation increased with increasing nom concentration especially in the degradation of cbz mtp and bzf the ratios of inhibition rates of the ppcps differed widely from 1 0 to 13 1 suggesting that nom had a selective effect on ppcp degradation the ratio of atz was 1 0 indicating that 3 mg c l doc completely inhibited atz degradation the ratios of cbz mtp and bzf 13 1 6 6 and 4 3 respectively were far greater than those of the other ppcps suggesting that the degradation of these ppcps was suppressed more at higher nom concentrations the second order rate constants for nom reacting with oh and clo are reportedly 2 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 and 4 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 wu et al 2017 indicating a stronger quenching effect of nom on clo than oh the greater reduction of clo at higher nom concentrations may have induced the sharp decrease in the degradation of ppcps that are highly reactive with clo which may explain the enhanced inhibitory effect on the degradation of cbz mtp and bzf with increasing nom concentration 3 3 2 ppcp degradation in reclaimed water the ammonia chlorine oxidation process was applied to degrade ppcps in reclaimed water two reclaimed water samples were collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in december and april the doc values were 3 0 and 3 3 mg c l and the inorganic carbon concentrations were 12 1 and 13 1 mg c l respectively the degradation results of the eight ppcps in the reclaimed water by ammonia chlorine at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 are shown in fig 6 and fig s3 the ppcp degradations in the reclaimed water was suppressed to varying degrees atz and pmd degradation were suppressed the most while cbz atn and mtp degradation were affected the least which was consistent with the effect of nom the reclaimed water showed a strong inhibitory effect on ppcp degradation the degradation efficiencies of the eight ppcps in the reclaimed water were much lower than those obtained even at 5 mg c l doc the enhanced inhibitory effect on ppcp degradation could have resulted from the discrepancy in the organic composition of nom and dissolved organic matter in the reclaimed water or from the influence of complex inorganic ions present in the reclaimed water the degradation efficiencies of cbz mtp and atn were greater than 60 in the two reclaimed water samples suggesting the feasibility of the ammonia chlorine oxidation process in reclaimed water 3 4 formation of volatile halogenated byproducts the formation of volatile halogenated byproducts in reclaimed water 3 0 mg c l doc with eight ppcps spiked was determined for the processes of ammonia chlorine and chlorination and the results are shown in fig 7 among the sixteen selected volatile halogenated byproducts eight were detected after treatment being chloroform tcm chloral hydrate ch 1 1 1 trichloropropanone tcp dichloroacetonitrile dcan bromodichloromethane bdcm bromochloroacetonitrile bcan trichloroacetamide tcacam and dibromoacetonitrile dban the amount of volatile halogenated byproducts formed by chlorination varied greatly from 0 3 to 19 4 µg l the main byproducts were tcm and ch a result that was also reported in a previous study ye et al 2021 by changing from chlorination to ammonia chlorine the byproducts decreased to less than 10 µg l free chlorine reacts with ammonia and transforms into chloramines which have lower reactivity with dom than with free chlorine this reduces the formation of chlorinated byproducts in reclaimed water bromide is oxidized to bromine by chlorine brominated byproducts are usually formed through electrophilic substitutions of dom chlorinated dom by bromine or chlorine substitution of chlorinated dom by bromine langsa et al 2017 compared with direct chlorination the large consumption of chlorine by ammonia reduced the formation of bromine thus fewer brominated byproducts were formed however the formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts was highly concerned for the ammonia chlorine oxidation shang et al 2000 yang et al 2005 it is necessitated to raise the further investigations on the formation efficiency mechanism and control of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts 4 conclusions the degradation of eight structurally diverse ppcps was considerably increased by ammonia chlorine treatment the degradation was maximal at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 6 in neutral conditions reaching greater than 70 degradation for most ppcps the contribution of reactive species to degrading the different ppcps widely varied tba strongly suppressed ppcp degradation whereas bicarbonate moderately suppressed degradation these results suggest the importance of clo and co3 for ppcp degradation although oh dominated ppcp degradation with contributions ranging from 74 to 100 regarding the effect of nom atz and pmd degradation were the most inhibited whereas cbz atn and mtp degradation were the least affected ppcp degradation was suppressed in reclaimed water but the findings suggest the feasibility of using ammonia chlorine oxidation to degrade ppcps in reclaimed water compared with chlorination fewer volatile halogenated byproducts were formed after ammonia chlorine the formation of each byproduct was less than 10 µg l and tcm was the predominant byproduct

14874,it is generally accepted that eutrophic lakes significantly contribute to nitrous oxide n2o emissions however how these emissions are affected by the formation disappearance and mechanisms of algal blooms in these lakes has not been systematically investigated this study examined and determined the relative contribution of spatiotemporal n2o production pathways in hypereutrophic lake taihu synchronously the multi impacts of algae on n2o production and release potential were measured in the field and in microcosms using isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and bulk nitrogen δ15n to n2o and to intramolecular 15n site preference sp results showed that n2o production in lake taihu was derived from microbial effects nitrification and incomplete denitrification and water air exchanges n2o production was also affected by the n2o reduction process the mean dissolved n2o concentrations in the water column during the pre outbreak outbreak and decay stages of algae accumulation were almost the same 0 05 μmol l 1 which was 2 10 times higher than in lake areas algae was not accumulating however except for the central lake area all surveyed areas with and without accumulated algae displayed strong release potential and acted as the emission source because of dissolved n2o supersaturation in the water column the mean n2o release fluxes during the pre outbreak outbreak and decay stages of algae accumulation areas were 17 95 26 36 and 79 32 μmol m 2 d 1 respectively which were 2 0 7 5 times higher than the values in the non algae accumulation areas in addition the decay and decomposition of algae released large amounts of nutrients and changed the physiochemical properties of the water column additionally the increased algae biomass promoted n2o release and improved the proportion of n2o produced via denitrification process to being 9 8 20 4 microbial derived n2o this proportion became higher when the n2o consumption during denitrification was considered as evidenced by isotopic data however when the algae biomass was excessive in hypereutrophic state the algae decomposition also consumed a large amount of oxygen thus limiting the n2o production due to complete denitrification as well as due to the limited substrate supply of nitrate by nitrification in hypoxic or anoxic conditions further the excessive algae accumulation on the water surface reduced n2o release fluxes via hindering the migration of the dissolved n2o into the atmosphere these findings provide a new perspective and understanding for accurately evaluating n2o release fluxes driven by algae processes in eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide production pathway release flux isotopic composition site preference 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o represents 8 of global greenhouse gas emissions although it is a trace gas in the atmosphere harter et al 2014 the total amount of n2o emissions released from freshwater ecosystems such as lakes rivers and reservoirs accounts for 10 of the global anthropogenic n2o emissions beaulieu et al 2011 these freshwater ecosystems are important to the nutrient cycle and sensitive to excessive nutrient enrichment especially nitrogen and phosphorous which can lead to water eutrophication that may result in frequent algal outbreaks soued et al 2016 yan et al 2017 delsontro et al 2018 it has been reported that more than 60 of the world s lakes are eutrophic and 8 8 of the world s lakes have algal blooms wang et al al 2018 hou et al 2022 the change of the physical and chemical properties of the water column and sediments caused by the decay and decomposition of algal blooms may change the mode of n2o production and the rate of n2o release and thus affect the total release flux the formation and disappearance of algae blooms can dramatically affect the physiochemical properties of the surrounding water column and the pathway of n2o production and its contribution to n2o emission may therefore be changed resulting in variation of n2o emission fluxes li et al 2019 however the currently reported data for n2o emission fluxes are insufficient to reliably estimate the total amount of n2o from lakes experiencing variations in algae growth cole and caraco 2001 snider et al 2015 therefore quantifying the multi impacts of algae on n2o emissions from eutrophic lakes is crucial to accurately assess the global n2o budget in shallow lakes n2o mainly produced in the sedimentary redox region and the water column pauer and auer 2000 is a product of the biochemical transformation of different forms of nitrogen during microbial processes mainly nitrification denitrification and nitrifier denitrification and the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra huttunen et al 2003 rütting et al 2008 quick et al 2019 although the production mechanisms of these pathways have been intensively studied gödde and conrad 2000 kool et al 2011 morse and bernhardt 2013 the quantification of their relative contributions remains a challenge previously the acetylene inhibition technique and stable nitrogen isotope labeling have been widely used in the quantification of n2o production pathways groffman et al 2006 ostrom and ostrom 2011 however the former is limited by changes in microbial activity incomplete inhibition and the influence of system conditions groffman et al 2006 and the latter is generally used in simulation experiments due to the difficulty of isotope labeling in the field ostrom and ostrom 2011 recently a technique using natural isotope abundance and allogeneic isotopes has been proposed to accurately quantify the n2o production pathway via the determination of stable nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios δ18o and δ15n and intramolecular 15n site preferences sp sutka et al 2006 compared with variable δ18o and δ15n the sp value is constant with reference values and only related to the production processes duan et al 2017 this isotope technique is powerful and widely applied in soils estuaries and ocean ecosystems well et al 2006 zhu et al 2008 su et al 2022 whereas the information from freshwater lakes especially eutrophic shallow lakes is still not prevalent liang et al 2022 the multiple production pathways via microbial processes determine the n2o emissions from lakes however the migration process from sediments to the water column and then to the atmosphere will undergo the influence of biotic and abiotic factors quick et al 2019 abiotic factors include dissolved oxygen do temperature ph redox potential nutrients available organic carbon etc zhu and chen 2001 kim et al 2006 costa et al 2018 while biotic factors mainly include aquatic plants and algae li et al 2019 although n2o emission fluxes are regulated by numerous environmental factors in the same deep lake it is generally believed that n2o emission fluxes from the upper water and central zone are smaller than those from the lower water wang et al 2014 and littoral zone wang et al 2006 respectively in contrast in shallow lakes n2o concentrations in vertical profiles may remain essentially unchanged where upper and lower water layers are constantly exchanged it has been shown that the worldwide eutrophication caused by the passive input of a great amount of nitrogen in freshwater lakes not only supports the nutrient demand of algae blooms in large areas but also potentially improves the nitrogen turnover rate of lakes because the growth cycle of algae generally 30 days is shorter than that of large aquatic plants generally for annuals or for perennials zhang et al 2008 specifically during the growth stage algae absorb and utilize numerous nutrients such as nitrogen for individual reproduction forming algal blooms while during the decay stage algae gradually settle from the surface water to the surface of sediments yan et al 2017 nitrogen containing organic matter from algae residues decomposes into ammonium nitrogen and during further decay becomes nitrate or nitrite nitrogen via nitrifying bacteria zhou et al 2021 with oxygen intensively being consumed the algae derived organic substrates will reduce the nitrate and nitrite to n2o or n2 via denitrifying bacteria algal accumulation and decomposition alter the redox conditions favoring denitrification however hypoxic conditions limit nitrification by converting ammonium nitrogen into nitrate nitrogen eventually in turn suppressing the ensuing denitrification zhu et al 2020 during these complex processes the algae impact caused by the algae themselves and the induced environmental changes on the n2o production pathway and release potential remains unclear particularly the quantitative discrimination of the relative contribution of n2o production pathways and the potential mechanisms need further study lake taihu one of the typical eutrophic lakes in the world was selected to monitor the δ18o δ15n and sp values as well as the n2o release fluxes during the algae pre outbreak outbreak and decay stages simultaneously in situ sediments and algae in lake taihu were collected for microcosm construction to simulate the effect of the formation and disappearance of algal blooms with different accumulation thicknesses on n2o emission fluxes in this study the field observation and microcosm simulation were synchronously performed to co track the n2o production pathway and release potential under the influence of algae variations in eutrophic lakes we hypothesized that algae have multiple impacts on the n2o production pathway and release potential by altering microbial processes and environmental conditions these findings can improve the accuracy of the n2o emission factor provide insight into algae impact mechanisms and accurately assess the n2o release flux in eutrophic lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and field sampling lake taihu is the third largest freshwater lake in china with an area of approximately 2338 km2 and an average water depth of 1 9 m the lake is characterized by more than 100 major inflows with a water storage capacity of about 5 77 109 m3 and a water exchange cycle of about 300 days xu et al 2014 it is acknowledged that algae blooms mainly cyanobacteria in lake taihu break out from april to september and last until about december kong et al 2009 in this study the time periods april to june july to september and october to december in 2019 were divided into the pre outbreak outbreak and decay stages of the algae bloom respectively the sample collection was conducted from four different areas including the northwest littoral zone zhushan bay xukou bay and the lake s central area in each area three replicates were randomly selected at a distance of about 3 km between sampling locations fig 1 among these areas the northwest littoral zone zone a and zhushan bay zone b are typical algal dominated zones abbrev caa particularly zone b is characterized by the long duration and acceleration frequency of algal bloom outbreaks while zone a accumulates extremely heavy algae blooms on the water surface owing to the downwind direction of the prevailing wind in summer and being trapped by the emergent plants in the nearshore zhou et al 2022 xukou bay zone c and the lake center zone d are non algae accumulation areas abbrev ncaa and zone c is macrophyte dominated wang et al 2021 in each sampling site the n2o emission flux was collected between 11 00 and 14 00 using three floating static chambers 38 5 cm length 30 5 cm width 18 5 cm height at 10 min intervals for 1 h zhou et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 in order to balance the pressure a short tube connected to the chamber was placed below the water surface the gas was homogenized via a syringe in the headspace for at least 2 min before sampling the atmospheric gas samples were collected in 200 ml aluminum foil airbags with their permeability being tested before sampling using helium to measure the dissolved n2o concentration a mixed water sample from a layered water collector 10 cm below the water surface half of the water depth and 10 cm above the lake bottom was slowly drained from the bottom and transferred to a sample vial 43 ml via a silicone tube with minimal turbulence the silicone tube was placed in the bottom of the vial to avoid the ingress of atmospheric n2o in addition the water sample was also collected to determine the nutrient contents and isotopic analyses the microbial activity of water samples was inhibited by adding 60 μl of saturated hgcl2 solution 0 5 v v final concentration water temperature and do were determined at the underwater depth of 20 cm hq3d hach usa the water and gas samples were transported to the laboratory as soon as possible in an ice cooler at 4 c the water samples for isotopic analyses were filtered using 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes and stored in centrifuge tubes and sealed with parafilm m then total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total phosphorus tp and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations of water samples were further measured 2 2 setup of microcosm systems a mass of 100 g of homogenized surface sediments followed by 200 ml of particulate free lake water from the same place of lake taihu were separately placed into each perspex column d 9 cm h 50 cm and then they were pre incubated at 25 c for one week after that 0 g control 60 g l 120 g m and 180 g h of fresh algae biomass collected from lake taihu was added to four the different treatments based on the field observation during algae breakout seasons during the incubation the fresh algae grew initially and then began to decay for the lower layer of algae on the water surface since the second sampling and finally were decomposed at the end of the experiment each destructive sampling collection was conducted at a time series of 1 4 7 10 15 20 25 35 and 45 days therefore a total of 108 columns 4 treatments 9 sampling times 3 replicates were open to simulate the actual algae growth and decay processes in lakes when sampling the column was sealed tightly with a silica gel plug and the upper gas was homogenized and then collected through a syringe and injected into the pre vacuumized gas sample bag for testing the gas samples were collected every 10 min for a total of six times to measure gas fluxes then the ec do ph and orp of the overlying water were measured with a portable water quality tester and then the overlying water was taken out to measure tn nh4 n no3 n and tp 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 analysis of physicochemical properties the tn nh4 n no3 n tp and chl a concentrations were measured according to previously described procedures zhou et al 2021 after digestion with a k2s2o8 solution the tn and tp concentrations were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry and the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method respectively the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were determined using a water flow analyzer autoanalyzer

emission fluxes and partition n2o production the n2o concentration was extracted by a syringe and measured by gas chromatograph aglient 7890b equipped with ecd electron capture detector and a nickel catalyst mechanizer detailly described by shaaban et al 2018 the n2o emissions fluxes f μmol m 2 d 1 estimated by the static chamber method were calculated as follows 1 f k v a d c d t where v is the

samples were analyzed using the headspace method zhou et al 2021 briefly 20 ml of high purity nitrogen was injected into the sample vial filled with collected water to replace the water sample the vial was heated in a water bath at 25 c and then shaken violently for 5 min finally 5 ml of gas was extracted by a syringe for n2o concentration analysis the calculation method of dissolved n2o

in this study ai are constants the values of a1 a4 are 165 8810 222 8743 92 0920 and 1 4842 respectively the n2o saturation in the overlying water is calculated according to formula 4 weiss and price

the measured in situ water temperature the ratio of light and heavy isotopes was expressed by relative deviation 5 δ x r s a m p l e r s tan d a r d r s tan d a r d where x is 15nα 15nβ or 18o and r is the sample and standard 14n15n16o 14n14n16o 15n14n16o 14n14n16o or 14n14n18o 14n14n16o superscripts α and β are the n2o molecular center and terminal n atoms respectively the δ value usually represents the thousandth deviation of nitrogen and oxygen from atmospheric n2 and vienna standard average marine water vsmow in addition the δ15nbulk and 15n site preference sp are also important tools to identify n2o production pathway 6 δ 15 n b u l k δ 15 n α δ 15 n β 2 7 s p δ 15 n α δ 15 n β where δ15nbulk is the average isotope ratio i e δ15n furthermore δ15nα is the 15n isotope abundance in the middle δ15nβ is the 15n isotope abundance at the end position the sources of dissolved n2o in the lake were divided into two parts 1 water air exchange and 2 authigenic primarily through microbial processes in the lake in this study it is assumed that the authigenic n2o in the lake was mainly produced from nitrification denitrification and nitrifier denitrification via microbial processes the isotopic abundance was calculated by the following formula 8 δ c a l δ s u b ε where δcal is the calculated isotopic ratio of the production δsub refers to the isotope ratio of substrates during microbial processes and ε represents the isotope effect during each microbial process the sum of n and o stable isotopes of no3 in previous studies and their corresponding theoretical denitrification isotope effects 15ε 18ε was used as reference values of isotope abundance for the denitrification process by comparing the 18δ values from measured and current studies the amount of o entering n2o from the water body was determined it was also necessary to consider the increase of δ15 nn2o δ18o n2o and sp induced by the impact of n2o consumption during denitrification during the denitrification processes the δ15n n2o δ18o n2o and sp values were 34 4 3 46 45 9 5 16 and 0 5 respectively if the influence of isotopic fractionation during n2o reduction was considered their values were increased to 1 6 3 46 120 5 16 and 8 5 respectively during the nitrification processes the δ15n n2o δ18o n2o and sp values were 14 8 1 40 20 6 and 33 5 respectively the detailed isotopic composition of reference points was determined following the previously described method li et al 2019 because the values of δ15n n2o and δ18o n2o are affected by the source of reaction substrates and reaction processes the n2o production pathway cannot be directly determined by these values while the sp value is only related to the fractionation effect during the n2o production processes instead of the reaction substrates the n2o production pathway during the microbial processes can be determined by sp values the proportion of each microbial pathway during the n2o production processes and the proportion of microbial processes to the whole process including water gas exchanges was calculated by the following formula wrage mönnig et al 2018 9 s p m i c r o f n s p n f d s p

accepted significance level of α 0 05 one way anova followed by tukey s hsd was used to determine the differences of the characteristics among three algae stages in each zone and four zones in each stage the characteristics included dissolved n2o concentrations n2o saturations n2o fluxes do tn tp nh4 n no3 n and chl a concentrations in the field investigation pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine the correlations between n2o fluxes and dissolved n2o concentrations and the correlation of the two with tn nh4 n and no3 n chl a concentrations in the microcosm monitoring pearson correlation coefficients were also used to examine the correlations between n2o fluxes with tn nh4 n no3 n tp ec do ph and orp 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of water physiochemical characteristics the do concentration was significantly different among the three stages and the four zones fig s1 particularly it was the lowest in zone a of 0 10 0 09 mg l 1 in and in all the zones during the outbreak stage p 0 05 the difference of other water physiochemical characteristics including tn nh4 n no3 n tp and chl a concentrations among the three stages was less obvious than that of the four zones table 1 only chl a concentrations of the outbreak stage in zones a and d were significantly higher than those of the decay stage p 0 05 among the four zones all characteristics in zone a reached the maximum values while the reverse was true for zone d p 0 05 in terms of the presence or absence of algae in the areas the characteristic values of caa were significantly higher than those of ncaa p 0 05 specifically the tn nh4 n no3 n tp and chl a concentrations of caa were 3 4 9 7 4 9 9 2 and 14 6 times more than those of ncaa respectively 3 2 dissolved n2o concentrations and their saturations in situ although dissolved n2o concentrations and their saturations fluctuated each month fig s2 dissolved n2o concentrations in each zone had no significant difference among the three stages fig 2 p 0 05 and only dissolved n2o saturations of the decay stage in xukou bay was significantly higher than the pre outbreak and outbreak stages p 0 05 reaching 642 71 the mean dissolved n2o concentration of the three stages in caa was 0 05 μmol l 1 which was 2 10 times that of ncaa moreover the dissolved n2o concentration had a positive relationship with tn nh4 n no3 n and chl a concentrations fig 3 p 0 05 3 3 n2o emission fluxes in situ in lake taihu n2o emission fluxes had a significant spatiotemporal discrepancy fig 2 although there was no significant difference from ncaa among the three stages p 0 05 n2o emission fluxes from caa had a significant increase during the decay stage p 0 05 among the four zones n2o emission fluxes during the pre outbreak and outbreak stages had no significant difference p 0 05 while they were significantly higher in zhushan bay than in the other three zones p 0 05 with the mean of 118 μmol m 2 d 1 during the decay stage in addition n2o emission fluxes from lake taihu had a neutral relationship with tn and no3 n concentrations fig 3a and c p 0 05 while they had a positive relationship with nh4 n and chl a concentrations fig 3b and d p 0 01 3 4 water physiochemical characteristics during algae decomposition in microcosms algae decomposition released a great number of nutrients in the water column and their concentrations were increased with the accumulation thickness of algae fig 4 the tn no3 n nh4 n and tp concentrations of treatment h were 1 4 77 4 1 4 4 8 1 4 157 6 2 0 69 1 times of those in the other three treatments respectively in addition algae decomposition changed the ec do ph and orp of the water column fig s3 although the variation of the physiochemical properties was different during incubation the trends among the four treatments were similar after 25 days of incubation among them the do of the algae treatments was lower than 0 2 mg l 1 after 15 days of incubation and the water column could be described as an anaerobic environment 3 5 n2o emission fluxes during algae decomposition in microcosms the n2o emission fluxes of algae treatments were different from treatment c during incubation treatment c showed a peak on day 7 49 39 5 22 μg m 2 h 1 and then decreased until day 20 while treatments h m and l exhibited two peaks the first peaks occurred on day 7 10 with their values of 8 81 0 86 7 45 0 81 and 3 15 0 05 μg m 2 h 1 respectively and the second peaks were 6 14 0 47 4 47 0 12 and 3 24 0 03 μg m 2 h 1 on day 25 moreover the n2o emission fluxes had a positive correlation with nutrient conditions including tn tp no3 n and nh4 n p 0 05 but had a negative correlation with do and ec p 0 05 3 6 the n2o production pathways in the field and in microcosms to explore the influence of the formation and disappearance of algae blooms on the n2o production processes the mixed endmember values of all n2o producing pathways in the field and in microcosms were determined and the single endmember value of each n2o producing pathway noted in other studies was also referred to for δ18o n2o and δ15n n2o respectively li et al 2019 fig 5 in this study the δ18o n2o δ15n n2o and sp values of dissolved n2o concentrations in lake taihu were close to the reference values for denitrification and nitrification after water gas exchanges or n2o reduction these results indicated that the main n2o production process of lake taihu was microbial derived and due to water gas exchange processes the quantitative discrimination of the proportion of n2o production pathways further demonstrated that the microbial derived effect of caa was bigger than that of ncaa and its proportion was as high as 78 35 table s1 thereinto the proportion of n2o produced via the nitrification pathway fluctuated from 43 0 the outbreak stage to 53 5 the decay stage in caa while the proportion in ncaa was as high as 63 3 the δ18o n2o δ15n n2o and sp values of dissolved n2o in microcosms were close to the reference values of denitrification and nitrification processes indicating the main pathway of n2o production was microbial derived the quantitative discrimination of the proportion of n2o produced via the denitrification pathway to dissolved n2o was the dominate pathway in the algae treatments 63 1 and was almost in the same proportion with that of the nitrification pathway in treatment c 51 4 4 discussion globally n2o emissions from different aquatic ecosystems are comprehensively affected by climate change and human activities beaulieu et al 2011 inland waters are an important source of atmospheric n2o and n2o emissions from different inland aquatic ecosystems vary zhou et al 2021 recent studies have pointed out that the global n2o emissions from lakes and reservoirs are 0 36 0 45 tg yr 1 but there is uncertainty with estimates zheng et al 2022 first since most studies have not measured or evaluated the n2o emissions from small aquatic ecosystems distributed widely around the world such as ponds and marshes this proportion may be overestimated second the mechanism of the influence of algal blooms in eutrophic lakes on n2o release flux such as the contribution of different n2o production pathways and their contribution ratio is not clear in this study the microcosm simulation and field observations confirmed that algae blooms promoted the increase of n2o emission fluxes chl a concentration was as high as 818 82 53 74 μg l 1 in lake taihu indicating that the estimate by zheng et al 2022 for n2o release flux and its proportion may be too low therefore the lack of n2o emission flux assessment in small aquatic ecosystems and frequent algal bloom in lakes leads to the evaluation uncertainty of dynamic n2o emission proportions in lake ecosystems the production and release of n2o are jointly regulated by multiple environmental factors such as do and inorganic nitrogen peng et al 2014 yang et al 2020 it has been reported that the dissolved n2o concentration is positively correlated with the dissolved nitrogen concentration xiao et al 2018 however if the concentration of dissolved no3 n is lower than 0 5 mg l 1 in anaerobic conditions the dissolved n2o is easily consumed as an electron acceptor during the denitrification process baulch et al 2011 in addition when nitrogen concentration in the water is sufficient do is the key factor to control n2o production silvennoinen et al 2008 contrarily when nitrogen concentration in the water is insufficient nitrification and denitrification via microorganisms are at a disadvantage in competing for nitrogen compared with the assimilation and absorption of algae hampel et al 2018 in this study although the no3 n concentration was mostly lower than 0 5 mg l 1 in the four zones table 1 the dissolved n2o concentrations had a significant correlation with tn nh4 n no3 n and chl a concentrations fig 3 this might be because large amounts of no3 n released by decaying algae was rapidly transformed by denitrifying microorganisms thus n2o production could be promoted at a low no3 n concentration zhang et al 2008 the relatively weaker correlations between n2o emission fluxes and tn nh4 n no3 n and chl a concentrations were probably affected by multiple impact factors such as air pressure wind speed etc at the water air interface fig 3 compared with ncaa caa had higher nutrient and chl a concentrations table 1 it can be inferred that the decomposition of algae during the decay stage causes a higher dissolved n2o concentration n2o emission flux and release potential in caa than those in ncaa the significant correlation between the dissolved n2o concentration and n2o emission flux also verified this speculation fig s4 and was similar to other studies zhou et al 2021 it is worth noting that although there was a positive correlation between the dissolved n2o concentration and chl a concentration fig 3d the sharp increase of algae biomass during their outbreak stage in zone a did not significantly increase the corresponding dissolved n2o concentration fig 2c this may be due to the heavy algae accumulation on the water surface in zone a accumulation thickness 2 cm field investigation inhibiting the nitrification and thus reducing the supply of no3 n for denitrification well et al 2006 moreover the upper layer of accumulated algae had little impact on n2o production due to the small contact area with the water column therefore there was no significant difference in the dissolved n2o concentration of caa among stages and zones fig 2a the excessive accumulation of algae blooms on the water surface in zone a may not only hinder water gas exchanges but also cause the high dissolved n2o to diffuse to the surrounding water column herein the potential impact of algal toxins produced by high algal biomass on nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria is excluded since the extracellular concentration of algal toxins is far lower than 100 ug l even in zone a su et al 2015 xue et al 2023 therefore the n2o emission flux in zone a was significantly lower than that in zone b fig 2c this prediction can be verified by the fact that the proportion of the n2o production pathway via the water gas exchange in caa was higher than that in nacc table s1 to clarify the impact of algae accumulation thickness on n2o emission fluxes a series of microcosms were synchronously constructed similar to field observations the simulated results also confirmed the significant positive correlation between n2o emission fluxes and nutrients in the water column and further showed that they were significantly negatively correlated with the do in the water p 0 05 fig 3 and table s2 in microcosms algae treatments including treatments l m and h had higher nutrient concentrations lower do concentrations and lower n2o emission fluxes than treatment c figs 4 6 s3 which was consistent with other studies yan et al 2017 as the intermediate product n2o is mainly consumed through the n2o reduction process and the key enzyme n2o reductase of the process is inhibited by do horn et al 2006 morse et al 2013 wang et al 2014 therefore we speculated that the lower do concentration of algae treatments than treatment c made the electron donors of denitrification insufficient and the inhibition of n2o reductase weak gong et al 2012 moreover the microcosm simulated the situation without wind and wave disturbance in the littoral zones which made the resistance of the algae accumulation layer stronger than that in the open zone thus treatment c with the higher do concentration had a lower n2o consumption rate morse et al 2013 and its n2o emission flux was higher than that of algae treatments fig 6 interestingly the n2o emission fluxes of algae treatments appeared with two peaks and stabilized at a low level at the end of incubation fig 6 the phenomenon is probably because the accumulated algae layer hindered water reoxygenation and its decomposition consumed a large amount of do yan et al 2017 which promoted the utilization of no3 n during the denitrification process with subsequently increasing n2o emission fluxes park et al 2002 with the shortage of no3 n although denitrifying bacteria would consume dissolved n2o as an electron acceptor under the anaerobic condition the production rate and emission flux of n2o still decreased baulch et al 2011 in this study the values of δ15n n2o and sp indicated that dissolved n2o was mainly produced via nitrification and incomplete denitrification processes and was influenced by n2o reduction the δ18o n2o values demonstrated that the denitrification process involved oxygen isotopes from h2o to n2o fig 5 in addition these three values were close to the reference values of atmospheric n2o snider et al 2015 this clarified that the isotopic composition of n2o was not only affected by the nitrification and denitrification processes but also by the water air exchange in lakes different from microcosms the water air exchange was the third pathway of n2o production in situ fig 5 this may be caused by the more frequent water air exchange under wind and wave disturbance in shallow lakes than that in semi closed areas zhou et al 2019 in the microcosms the lower proportion of nitrification than denitrification table s1 suggested that n2o was more likely to be derived from sediments or the hypoxic condition in the water column was more favorable for n2o production from denitrification in addition the simulated results showed that the do concentration of treatment c was higher than that of algae treatments and the proportion of n2o produced via the nitrification process to microbial derived n2o was also 11 7 higher than that of algae treatments table s1 indicating that high do concentrations supported higher nitrification wrage et al 2018 the algae accumulation can hinder the reoxygenation of water by affecting the water air exchange it is speculated that the proportion of n2o produced via the nitrification process in the caa may account for a higher proportion of microbial derived n2o than that in the ncaa as evidenced by the analysis of the n2o production pathway in lake taihu fig 5 and table s1 thereinto the proportion of n2o produced via the nitrification process to microbial derived n2o increased from 43 0 the outbreak stage to 53 5 the decay stage table s1 and the n2o release fluxes during the decay stage were higher than that during the outbreak period fig 2 the reason is that the breakdown of algal cells increases the nutrients in the water column and surface sediments during the algae decay processes and the sedimentation of algae debris reduces the inhibition of algae aggregation on water reoxygenation thus promotes the nitrification of microorganisms in the water column and denitrification in the sediments furthermore the ratio of the nitrification in the overall microbial production process was higher or closer to denitrification suggesting that n2o in this study was more likely to derive from waters as the anaerobic environment in the sediment was more favorable for n2o production by the denitrification therefore algal blooms promote the transformation of the dominant n2o production pathway from the nitrification process to the denitrification process and their decay and decomposition can slightly increase the proportion of nitrification process to n2o production in fact a considerable amount of produced n2o is consumed before it is emitted into the atmosphere since the n2o reduction plays an important role in regulating the spatial and temporal variations of n2o emissions of lakes in this study the effect of n2o reduction on the sp value was not considered the reduction of n2o to n2 during the complete denitrification process is the only known way to consume n2o pauleta et al 2019 therefore the proportion of n2o produced via the denitrification process to microbial derived n2o may be underestimated the n2o reductase which controls the n2o reduction process is encoded by the nosz gene horn et al 2006 thus the combination of stable isotope technology and molecular biological methods will help to further explore the n2o production pathway in lakes 5 implications lake taihu was found to be an n2o source during the formation and disappearance stages of algae blooms the decomposition of algae blooms not only significantly affected the water properties and aggravated the eutrophic degree of the lake but also improved the proportion of n2o produced via the denitrification process to microbial derived n2o thus changing the importance of different n2o production pathways to the production and emission of n2o fig 7 although the dissolved n2o concentration significantly correlated with n2o emission flux and chl a concentration the excessive accumulation of algae blooms on the water surface decreased n2o production and emission fluxes by limiting the substrate supply of nitrate by nitrification in hypoxic or anoxic conditions for the denitrification process and hindering the release of the dissolved n2o to atmosphere during the accumulation of algae on the water surface there may be a threshold for algal bloom accumulation thickness which needs further study to accurately assess the n2o emission flux in eutrophic lakes moreover the littoral zone in eutrophic lakes easily accumulates extremely heavy algae blooms on the water surface owing to the wind and wave disturbance and being trapped by the emergent aquatic plants in the nearshore which generally occurs in most of the eutrophic lakes worldwide as a costly but immediate and useful emergency measure algae salvage has been widely used in the improvement of eutrophic lakes for instance dozens of salvage stations around lake taihu can pull up 2900 tons a day during the outbreak stage of algae blooms based on our findings restoring the vegetation zone along the shore preferentially salvaging the accumulated algae between vegetation zones and avoiding violent disturbances to reduce water reoxygenation could greatly reduce the n2o emissions given a large number of lakes show the transformation trend from a macrophyte dominated state to an algae dominated state because of eutrophication the multiple impact and mechanism of algal blooms to the production and emission of n2o in our study is of practical significance to control greenhouse gasses emission of freshwater ecosystems 6 conclusion the mean dissolved n2o concentrations in the water column of algae accumulation areas were almost the same 0 05 μmol l 1 while the n2o emission had a significant difference among three stages of an algae bloom specifically the mean n2o emissions of the pre outbreak outbreak and decay stages were 17 95 26 36 and 79 32 μmol m 2 d 1 respectively which were 2 0 7 5 times higher than those in the non algae accumulation areas the dissolved n2o was originated from microbial derived nitrification and incomplete denitrification 74 24 and the water air exchange processes 25 76 the algae multi impacts on n2o emissions in this eutrophic lake can be attributed to three aspects first algae decomposition consumed a great amount of do and transformed the dominant n2o production pathway from the nitrification process 45 33 to the denitrification process 39 74 second the increased nitrogen turnover rate by algae growth and the numerous nutrients released by algae decay increased n2o emissions third the excessive algae accumulation on the water surface reduced the n2o produced by water air exchanges and caused water hypoxia to limit the substrate supply of nitrate by nitrification for the denitrification process thus further decreasing the n2o emissions however more evidence is necessary for insights into these complex processes e g the functional microbial diversity these findings provide a new perspective and understanding for accurately evaluating n2o release fluxes driven by algae processes in eutrophic lakes and are of practical significance to control greenhouse gasses emissions by freshwater ecosystems credit authorship

14874,it is generally accepted that eutrophic lakes significantly contribute to nitrous oxide n2o emissions however how these emissions are affected by the formation disappearance and mechanisms of algal blooms in these lakes has not been systematically investigated this study examined and determined the relative contribution of spatiotemporal n2o production pathways in hypereutrophic lake taihu synchronously the multi impacts of algae on n2o production and release potential were measured in the field and in microcosms using isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and bulk nitrogen δ15n to n2o and to intramolecular 15n site preference sp results showed that n2o production in lake taihu was derived from microbial effects nitrification and incomplete denitrification and water air exchanges n2o production was also affected by the n2o reduction process the mean dissolved n2o concentrations in the water column during the pre outbreak outbreak and decay stages of algae accumulation were almost the same 0 05 μmol l 1 which was 2 10 times higher than in lake areas algae was not accumulating however except for the central lake area all surveyed areas with and without accumulated algae displayed strong release potential and acted as the emission source because of dissolved n2o supersaturation in the water column the mean n2o release fluxes during the pre outbreak outbreak and decay stages of algae accumulation areas were 17 95 26 36 and 79 32 μmol m 2 d 1 respectively which were 2 0 7 5 times higher than the values in the non algae accumulation areas in addition the decay and decomposition of algae released large amounts of nutrients and changed the physiochemical properties of the water column additionally the increased algae biomass promoted n2o release and improved the proportion of n2o produced via denitrification process to being 9 8 20 4 microbial derived n2o this proportion became higher when the n2o consumption during denitrification was considered as evidenced by isotopic data however when the algae biomass was excessive in hypereutrophic state the algae decomposition also consumed a large amount of oxygen thus limiting the n2o production due to complete denitrification as well as due to the limited substrate supply of nitrate by nitrification in hypoxic or anoxic conditions further the excessive algae accumulation on the water surface reduced n2o release fluxes via hindering the migration of the dissolved n2o into the atmosphere these findings provide a new perspective and understanding for accurately evaluating n2o release fluxes driven by algae processes in eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide production pathway release flux isotopic composition site preference 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o represents 8 of global greenhouse gas emissions although it is a trace gas in the atmosphere harter et al 2014 the total amount of n2o emissions released from freshwater ecosystems such as lakes rivers and reservoirs accounts for 10 of the global anthropogenic n2o emissions beaulieu et al 2011 these freshwater ecosystems are important to the nutrient cycle and sensitive to excessive nutrient enrichment especially nitrogen and phosphorous which can lead to water eutrophication that may result in frequent algal outbreaks soued et al 2016 yan et al 2017 delsontro et al 2018 it has been reported that more than 60 of the world s lakes are eutrophic and 8 8 of the world s lakes have algal blooms wang et al al 2018 hou et al 2022 the change of the physical and chemical properties of the water column and sediments caused by the decay and decomposition of algal blooms may change the mode of n2o production and the rate of n2o release and thus affect the total release flux the formation and disappearance of algae blooms can dramatically affect the physiochemical properties of the surrounding water column and the pathway of n2o production and its contribution to n2o emission may therefore be changed resulting in variation of n2o emission fluxes li et al 2019 however the currently reported data for n2o emission fluxes are insufficient to reliably estimate the total amount of n2o from lakes experiencing variations in algae growth cole and caraco 2001 snider et al 2015 therefore quantifying the multi impacts of algae on n2o emissions from eutrophic lakes is crucial to accurately assess the global n2o budget in shallow lakes n2o mainly produced in the sedimentary redox region and the water column pauer and auer 2000 is a product of the biochemical transformation of different forms of nitrogen during microbial processes mainly nitrification denitrification and nitrifier denitrification and the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra huttunen et al 2003 rütting et al 2008 quick et al 2019 although the production mechanisms of these pathways have been intensively studied gödde and conrad 2000 kool et al 2011 morse and bernhardt 2013 the quantification of their relative contributions remains a challenge previously the acetylene inhibition technique and stable nitrogen isotope labeling have been widely used in the quantification of n2o production pathways groffman et al 2006 ostrom and ostrom 2011 however the former is limited by changes in microbial activity incomplete inhibition and the influence of system conditions groffman et al 2006 and the latter is generally used in simulation experiments due to the difficulty of isotope labeling in the field ostrom and ostrom 2011 recently a technique using natural isotope abundance and allogeneic isotopes has been proposed to accurately quantify the n2o production pathway via the determination of stable nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios δ18o and δ15n and intramolecular 15n site preferences sp sutka et al 2006 compared with variable δ18o and δ15n the sp value is constant with reference values and only related to the production processes duan et al 2017 this isotope technique is powerful and widely applied in soils estuaries and ocean ecosystems well et al 2006 zhu et al 2008 su et al 2022 whereas the information from freshwater lakes especially eutrophic shallow lakes is still not prevalent liang et al 2022 the multiple production pathways via microbial processes determine the n2o emissions from lakes however the migration process from sediments to the water column and then to the atmosphere will undergo the influence of biotic and abiotic factors quick et al 2019 abiotic factors include dissolved oxygen do temperature ph redox potential nutrients available organic carbon etc zhu and chen 2001 kim et al 2006 costa et al 2018 while biotic factors mainly include aquatic plants and algae li et al 2019 although n2o emission fluxes are regulated by numerous environmental factors in the same deep lake it is generally believed that n2o emission fluxes from the upper water and central zone are smaller than those from the lower water wang et al 2014 and littoral zone wang et al 2006 respectively in contrast in shallow lakes n2o concentrations in vertical profiles may remain essentially unchanged where upper and lower water layers are constantly exchanged it has been shown that the worldwide eutrophication caused by the passive input of a great amount of nitrogen in freshwater lakes not only supports the nutrient demand of algae blooms in large areas but also potentially improves the nitrogen turnover rate of lakes because the growth cycle of algae generally 30 days is shorter than that of large aquatic plants generally for annuals or for perennials zhang et al 2008 specifically during the growth stage algae absorb and utilize numerous nutrients such as nitrogen for individual reproduction forming algal blooms while during the decay stage algae gradually settle from the surface water to the surface of sediments yan et al 2017 nitrogen containing organic matter from algae residues decomposes into ammonium nitrogen and during further decay becomes nitrate or nitrite nitrogen via nitrifying bacteria zhou et al 2021 with oxygen intensively being consumed the algae derived organic substrates will reduce the nitrate and nitrite to n2o or n2 via denitrifying bacteria algal accumulation and decomposition alter the redox conditions favoring denitrification however hypoxic conditions limit nitrification by converting ammonium nitrogen into nitrate nitrogen eventually in turn suppressing the ensuing denitrification zhu et al 2020 during these complex processes the algae impact caused by the algae themselves and the induced environmental changes on the n2o production pathway and release potential remains unclear particularly the quantitative discrimination of the relative contribution of n2o production pathways and the potential mechanisms need further study lake taihu one of the typical eutrophic lakes in the world was selected to monitor the δ18o δ15n and sp values as well as the n2o release fluxes during the algae pre outbreak outbreak and decay stages simultaneously in situ sediments and algae in lake taihu were collected for microcosm construction to simulate the effect of the formation and disappearance of algal blooms with different accumulation thicknesses on n2o emission fluxes in this study the field observation and microcosm simulation were synchronously performed to co track the n2o production pathway and release potential under the influence of algae variations in eutrophic lakes we hypothesized that algae have multiple impacts on the n2o production pathway and release potential by altering microbial processes and environmental conditions these findings can improve the accuracy of the n2o emission factor provide insight into algae impact mechanisms and accurately assess the n2o release flux in eutrophic lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and field sampling lake taihu is the third largest freshwater lake in china with an area of approximately 2338 km2 and an average water depth of 1 9 m the lake is characterized by more than 100 major inflows with a water storage capacity of about 5 77 109 m3 and a water exchange cycle of about 300 days xu et al 2014 it is acknowledged that algae blooms mainly cyanobacteria in lake taihu break out from april to september and last until about december kong et al 2009 in this study the time periods april to june july to september and october to december in 2019 were divided into the pre outbreak outbreak and decay stages of the algae bloom respectively the sample collection was conducted from four different areas including the northwest littoral zone zhushan bay xukou bay and the lake s central area in each area three replicates were randomly selected at a distance of about 3 km between sampling locations fig 1 among these areas the northwest littoral zone zone a and zhushan bay zone b are typical algal dominated zones abbrev caa particularly zone b is characterized by the long duration and acceleration frequency of algal bloom outbreaks while zone a accumulates extremely heavy algae blooms on the water surface owing to the downwind direction of the prevailing wind in summer and being trapped by the emergent plants in the nearshore zhou et al 2022 xukou bay zone c and the lake center zone d are non algae accumulation areas abbrev ncaa and zone c is macrophyte dominated wang et al 2021 in each sampling site the n2o emission flux was collected between 11 00 and 14 00 using three floating static chambers 38 5 cm length 30 5 cm width 18 5 cm height at 10 min intervals for 1 h zhou et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 in order to balance the pressure a short tube connected to the chamber was placed below the water surface the gas was homogenized via a syringe in the headspace for at least 2 min before sampling the atmospheric gas samples were collected in 200 ml aluminum foil airbags with their permeability being tested before sampling using helium to measure the dissolved n2o concentration a mixed water sample from a layered water collector 10 cm below the water surface half of the water depth and 10 cm above the lake bottom was slowly drained from the bottom and transferred to a sample vial 43 ml via a silicone tube with minimal turbulence the silicone tube was placed in the bottom of the vial to avoid the ingress of atmospheric n2o in addition the water sample was also collected to determine the nutrient contents and isotopic analyses the microbial activity of water samples was inhibited by adding 60 μl of saturated hgcl2 solution 0 5 v v final concentration water temperature and do were determined at the underwater depth of 20 cm hq3d hach usa the water and gas samples were transported to the laboratory as soon as possible in an ice cooler at 4 c the water samples for isotopic analyses were filtered using 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes and stored in centrifuge tubes and sealed with parafilm m then total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total phosphorus tp and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations of water samples were further measured 2 2 setup of microcosm systems a mass of 100 g of homogenized surface sediments followed by 200 ml of particulate free lake water from the same place of lake taihu were separately placed into each perspex column d 9 cm h 50 cm and then they were pre incubated at 25 c for one week after that 0 g control 60 g l 120 g m and 180 g h of fresh algae biomass collected from lake taihu was added to four the different treatments based on the field observation during algae breakout seasons during the incubation the fresh algae grew initially and then began to decay for the lower layer of algae on the water surface since the second sampling and finally were decomposed at the end of the experiment each destructive sampling collection was conducted at a time series of 1 4 7 10 15 20 25 35 and 45 days therefore a total of 108 columns 4 treatments 9 sampling times 3 replicates were open to simulate the actual algae growth and decay processes in lakes when sampling the column was sealed tightly with a silica gel plug and the upper gas was homogenized and then collected through a syringe and injected into the pre vacuumized gas sample bag for testing the gas samples were collected every 10 min for a total of six times to measure gas fluxes then the ec do ph and orp of the overlying water were measured with a portable water quality tester and then the overlying water was taken out to measure tn nh4 n no3 n and tp 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 analysis of physicochemical properties the tn nh4 n no3 n tp and chl a concentrations were measured according to previously described procedures zhou et al 2021 after digestion with a k2s2o8 solution the tn and tp concentrations were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry and the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method respectively the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were determined using a water flow analyzer autoanalyzer 3 seal germany chl a was determined by extraction in 95 ethanol and absorbance was measured at 630 645 663 and 750 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 6100 mapada china 2 3 2 analysis of n2o emission fluxes and partition n2o production the n2o concentration was extracted by a syringe and measured by gas chromatograph aglient 7890b equipped with ecd electron capture detector and a nickel catalyst mechanizer detailly described by shaaban et al 2018 the n2o emissions fluxes f μmol m 2 d 1 estimated by the static chamber method were calculated as follows 1 f k v a d c d t where v is the

samples were analyzed using the headspace method zhou et al 2021 briefly 20 ml of high purity nitrogen was injected into the sample vial filled with collected water to replace the water sample the vial was heated in a water bath at 25 c and then shaken violently for 5 min finally 5 ml of gas was extracted by a syringe for n2o concentration analysis the calculation method of dissolved n2o concentrations in the water was calculated as follows weiss and price 1980 2 c w f g f 3 ln f a 1 a 2 100 t a 3 ln t 100 a 4 t 100 2 the cw is the n2o concentration in the overlying water μmol l 1 fg

in this study ai are constants the values of a1 a4 are 165 8810 222 8743 92 0920 and 1 4842 respectively the n2o saturation in the overlying water is calculated according to formula 4 weiss and price

the measured in situ water temperature the ratio of light and heavy isotopes was expressed by relative deviation 5 δ x r s a m p l e r s tan d a r d r s tan d a r d where x is 15nα 15nβ or 18o and r is the sample and standard 14n15n16o 14n14n16o 15n14n16o 14n14n16o or 14n14n18o 14n14n16o superscripts α and β are the n2o molecular center and terminal n atoms respectively the δ value usually represents the thousandth deviation of nitrogen and oxygen from atmospheric n2 and vienna standard average marine water vsmow in addition the δ15nbulk and 15n site preference sp are also important tools to identify n2o production pathway 6 δ 15 n b u l k δ 15 n α δ 15 n β 2 7 s p δ 15 n α δ 15 n β where δ15nbulk is the average isotope ratio i e δ15n furthermore δ15nα is the 15n isotope abundance in the middle δ15nβ is the 15n isotope abundance at the end position the sources of dissolved n2o in the lake were divided into two parts 1 water air exchange and 2 authigenic primarily through microbial processes in the lake in this study it is assumed that the authigenic n2o in the lake was mainly produced from nitrification denitrification and nitrifier denitrification via microbial processes the isotopic abundance was calculated by the following formula 8 δ c a l δ s u b ε where δcal is the calculated isotopic ratio of the production δsub refers to the isotope ratio of substrates during microbial processes and ε represents the isotope effect during each microbial process the sum of n and o stable isotopes of no3 in previous studies and their corresponding theoretical denitrification isotope effects 15ε 18ε was used as reference values of isotope abundance for the denitrification process by comparing the 18δ values from measured and current studies the amount of o entering n2o from the water body was determined it was also necessary to consider the increase of δ15 nn2o δ18o n2o and sp induced by the impact of n2o consumption during denitrification during the denitrification processes the δ15n n2o δ18o n2o and sp values were 34 4 3 46 45 9 5 16 and 0 5 respectively if the influence of isotopic fractionation during n2o reduction was considered their values were increased to 1 6 3 46 120 5 16 and 8 5 respectively during the nitrification processes the δ15n n2o δ18o n2o and sp values were 14 8 1 40 20 6 and 33 5 respectively the detailed isotopic composition of reference points was determined following the previously described method li et al 2019 because the values of δ15n n2o and δ18o n2o are affected by the source of reaction substrates and reaction processes the n2o production pathway cannot be directly determined by these values while the sp value is only related to the fractionation effect during the n2o production processes instead of the reaction substrates the n2o production pathway during the microbial processes can be determined by sp values the proportion of each microbial pathway during the n2o production processes and the proportion of microbial processes to the whole process including water gas exchanges was calculated by the following formula wrage mönnig et al 2018 9 s p m i c r o f n s p n f d s p

accepted significance level of α 0 05 one way anova followed by tukey s hsd was used to determine the differences of the characteristics among three algae stages in each zone and four zones in each stage the characteristics included dissolved n2o concentrations n2o saturations n2o fluxes do tn tp nh4 n no3 n and chl a concentrations in the field investigation pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine the correlations between n2o fluxes and dissolved n2o concentrations and the correlation of the two with tn nh4 n and no3 n chl a concentrations in the microcosm monitoring pearson correlation coefficients were also used to examine the correlations between n2o fluxes with tn nh4 n no3 n tp ec do ph and orp 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of water physiochemical characteristics the do concentration was significantly different among the three stages and the four zones fig s1 particularly it was the lowest in zone a of 0 10 0 09 mg l 1 in and in all the zones during the outbreak stage p 0 05 the difference of other water physiochemical characteristics including tn nh4 n no3 n tp and chl a concentrations among the three stages was less obvious than that of the four zones table 1 only chl a concentrations of the outbreak stage in zones a and d were significantly higher than those of the decay stage p 0 05 among the four zones all characteristics in zone a reached the maximum values while the reverse was true for zone d p 0 05 in terms of the presence or absence of algae in the areas the characteristic values of caa were significantly higher than those of ncaa p 0 05 specifically the tn nh4 n no3 n tp and chl a concentrations of caa were 3 4 9 7 4 9 9 2 and 14 6 times more than those of ncaa respectively 3 2 dissolved n2o concentrations and their saturations in situ although dissolved n2o concentrations and their saturations fluctuated each month fig s2 dissolved n2o concentrations in each zone had no significant difference among the three stages fig 2 p 0 05 and only dissolved n2o saturations of the decay stage in xukou bay was significantly higher than the pre outbreak and outbreak stages p 0 05 reaching 642 71 the mean dissolved n2o concentration of the three stages in caa was 0 05 μmol l 1 which was 2 10 times that of ncaa moreover the dissolved n2o concentration had a positive relationship with tn nh4 n no3 n and chl a concentrations fig 3 p 0 05 3 3 n2o emission fluxes in situ in lake taihu n2o emission fluxes had a significant spatiotemporal discrepancy fig 2 although there was no significant difference from ncaa among the three stages p 0 05 n2o emission fluxes from caa had a significant increase during the decay stage p 0 05 among the four zones n2o emission fluxes during the pre outbreak and outbreak stages had no significant difference p 0 05 while they were significantly higher in zhushan bay than in the other three zones p 0 05 with the mean of 118 μmol m 2 d 1 during the decay stage in addition n2o emission fluxes from lake taihu had a neutral relationship with tn and no3 n concentrations fig 3a and c p 0 05 while they had a positive relationship with nh4 n and chl a concentrations fig 3b and d p 0 01 3 4 water physiochemical characteristics during algae decomposition in microcosms algae decomposition released a great number of nutrients in the water column and their concentrations were increased with the accumulation thickness of algae fig 4 the tn no3 n nh4 n and tp concentrations of treatment h were 1 4 77 4 1 4 4 8 1 4 157 6 2 0 69 1 times of those in the other three treatments respectively in addition algae decomposition changed the ec do ph and orp of the water column fig s3 although the variation of the physiochemical properties was different during incubation the trends among the four treatments were similar after 25 days of incubation among them the do of the algae treatments was lower than 0 2 mg l 1 after 15 days of incubation and the water column could be described as an anaerobic environment 3 5 n2o emission fluxes during algae decomposition in microcosms the n2o emission fluxes of algae treatments were different from treatment c during incubation treatment c showed a peak on day 7 49 39 5 22 μg m 2 h 1 and then decreased until day 20 while treatments h m and l exhibited two peaks the first peaks occurred on day 7 10 with their values of 8 81 0 86 7 45 0 81 and 3 15 0 05 μg m 2 h 1 respectively and the second peaks were 6 14 0 47 4 47 0 12 and 3 24 0 03 μg m 2 h 1 on day 25 moreover the n2o emission fluxes had a positive correlation with nutrient conditions including tn tp no3 n and nh4 n p 0 05 but had a negative correlation with do and ec p 0 05 3 6 the n2o production pathways in the field and in microcosms to explore the influence of the formation and disappearance of algae blooms on the n2o production processes the mixed endmember values of all n2o producing pathways in the field and in microcosms were determined and the single endmember value of each n2o producing pathway noted in other studies was also referred to for δ18o n2o and δ15n n2o respectively li et al 2019 fig 5 in this study the δ18o n2o δ15n n2o and sp values of dissolved n2o concentrations in lake taihu were close to the reference values for denitrification and nitrification after water gas exchanges or n2o reduction these results indicated that the main n2o production process of lake taihu was microbial derived and due to water gas exchange processes the quantitative discrimination of the proportion of n2o production pathways further demonstrated that the microbial derived effect of caa was bigger than that of ncaa and its proportion was as high as 78 35 table s1 thereinto the proportion of n2o produced via the nitrification pathway fluctuated from 43 0 the outbreak stage to 53 5 the decay stage in caa while the proportion in ncaa was as high as 63 3 the δ18o n2o δ15n n2o and sp values of dissolved n2o in microcosms were close to the reference values of denitrification and nitrification processes indicating the main pathway of n2o production was microbial derived the quantitative discrimination of the proportion of n2o produced via the denitrification pathway to dissolved n2o was the dominate pathway in the algae treatments 63 1 and was almost in the same proportion with that of the nitrification pathway in treatment c 51 4 4 discussion globally n2o emissions from different aquatic ecosystems are comprehensively affected by climate change and human activities beaulieu et al 2011 inland waters are an important source of atmospheric n2o and n2o emissions from different inland aquatic ecosystems vary zhou et al 2021 recent studies have pointed out that the global n2o emissions from lakes and reservoirs are 0 36 0 45 tg yr 1 but there is uncertainty with estimates zheng et al 2022 first since most studies have not measured or evaluated the n2o emissions from small aquatic ecosystems distributed widely around the world such as ponds and marshes this proportion may be overestimated second the mechanism of the influence of algal blooms in eutrophic lakes on n2o release flux such as the contribution of different n2o production pathways and their contribution ratio is not clear in this study the microcosm simulation and field observations confirmed that algae blooms promoted the increase of n2o emission fluxes chl a concentration was as high as 818 82 53 74 μg l 1 in lake taihu indicating that the estimate by zheng et al 2022 for n2o release flux and its proportion may be too low therefore the lack of n2o emission flux assessment in small aquatic ecosystems and frequent algal bloom in lakes leads to the evaluation uncertainty of dynamic n2o emission proportions in lake ecosystems the production and release of n2o are jointly regulated by multiple environmental factors such as do and inorganic nitrogen peng et al 2014 yang et al 2020 it has been reported that the dissolved n2o concentration is positively correlated with the dissolved nitrogen concentration xiao et al 2018 however if the concentration of dissolved no3 n is lower than 0 5 mg l 1 in anaerobic conditions the dissolved n2o is easily consumed as an electron acceptor during the denitrification process baulch et al 2011 in addition when nitrogen concentration in the water is sufficient do is the key factor to control n2o production silvennoinen et al 2008 contrarily when nitrogen concentration in the water is insufficient nitrification and denitrification via microorganisms are at a disadvantage in competing for nitrogen compared with the assimilation and absorption of algae hampel et al 2018 in this study although the no3 n concentration was mostly lower than 0 5 mg l 1 in the four zones table 1 the dissolved n2o concentrations had a significant correlation with tn nh4 n no3 n and chl a concentrations fig 3 this might be because large amounts of no3 n released by decaying algae was rapidly transformed by denitrifying microorganisms thus n2o production could be promoted at a low no3 n concentration zhang et al 2008 the relatively weaker correlations between n2o emission fluxes and tn nh4 n no3 n and chl a concentrations were probably affected by multiple impact factors such as air pressure wind speed etc at the water air interface fig 3 compared with ncaa caa had higher nutrient and chl a concentrations table 1 it can be inferred that the decomposition of algae during the decay stage causes a higher dissolved n2o concentration n2o emission flux and release potential in caa than those in ncaa the significant correlation between the dissolved n2o concentration and n2o emission flux also verified this speculation fig s4 and was similar to other studies zhou et al 2021 it is worth noting that although there was a positive correlation between the dissolved n2o concentration and chl a concentration fig 3d the sharp increase of algae biomass during their outbreak stage in zone a did not significantly increase the corresponding dissolved n2o concentration fig 2c this may be due to the heavy algae accumulation on the water surface in zone a accumulation thickness 2 cm field investigation inhibiting the nitrification and thus reducing the supply of no3 n for denitrification well et al 2006 moreover the upper layer of accumulated algae had little impact on n2o production due to the small contact area with the water column therefore there was no significant difference in the dissolved n2o concentration of caa among stages and zones fig 2a the excessive accumulation of algae blooms on the water surface in zone a may not only hinder water gas exchanges but also cause the high dissolved n2o to diffuse to the surrounding water column herein the potential impact of algal toxins produced by high algal biomass on nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria is excluded since the extracellular concentration of algal toxins is far lower than 100 ug l even in zone a su et al 2015 xue et al 2023 therefore the n2o emission flux in zone a was significantly lower than that in zone b fig 2c this prediction can be verified by the fact that the proportion of the n2o production pathway via the water gas exchange in caa was higher than that in nacc table s1 to clarify the impact of algae accumulation thickness on n2o emission fluxes a series of microcosms were synchronously constructed similar to field observations the simulated results also confirmed the significant positive correlation between n2o emission fluxes and nutrients in the water column and further showed that they were significantly negatively correlated with the do in the water p 0 05 fig 3 and table s2 in microcosms algae treatments including treatments l m and h had higher nutrient concentrations lower do concentrations and lower n2o emission fluxes than treatment c figs 4 6 s3 which was consistent with other studies yan et al 2017 as the intermediate product n2o is mainly consumed through the n2o reduction process and the key enzyme n2o reductase of the process is inhibited by do horn et al 2006 morse et al 2013 wang et al 2014 therefore we speculated that the lower do concentration of algae treatments than treatment c made the electron donors of denitrification insufficient and the inhibition of n2o reductase weak gong et al 2012 moreover the microcosm simulated the situation without wind and wave disturbance in the littoral zones which made the resistance of the algae accumulation layer stronger than that in the open zone thus treatment c with the higher do concentration had a lower n2o consumption rate morse et al 2013 and its n2o emission flux was higher than that of algae treatments fig 6 interestingly the n2o emission fluxes of algae treatments appeared with two peaks and stabilized at a low level at the end of incubation fig 6 the phenomenon is probably because the accumulated algae layer hindered water reoxygenation and its decomposition consumed a large amount of do yan et al 2017 which promoted the utilization of no3 n during the denitrification process with subsequently increasing n2o emission fluxes park et al 2002 with the shortage of no3 n although denitrifying bacteria would consume dissolved n2o as an electron acceptor under the anaerobic condition the production rate and emission flux of n2o still decreased baulch et al 2011 in this study the values of δ15n n2o and sp indicated that dissolved n2o was mainly produced via nitrification and incomplete denitrification processes and was influenced by n2o reduction the δ18o n2o values demonstrated that the denitrification process involved oxygen isotopes from h2o to n2o fig 5 in addition these three values were close to the reference values of atmospheric n2o snider et al 2015 this clarified that the isotopic composition of n2o was not only affected by the nitrification and denitrification processes but also by the water air exchange in lakes different from microcosms the water air exchange was the third pathway of n2o production in situ fig 5 this may be caused by the more frequent water air exchange under wind and wave disturbance in shallow lakes than that in semi closed areas zhou et al 2019 in the microcosms the lower proportion of nitrification than denitrification table s1 suggested that n2o was more likely to be derived from sediments or the hypoxic condition in the water column was more favorable for n2o production from denitrification in addition the simulated results showed that the do concentration of treatment c was higher than that of algae treatments and the proportion of n2o produced via the nitrification process to microbial derived n2o was also 11 7 higher than that of algae treatments table s1 indicating that high do concentrations supported higher nitrification wrage et al 2018 the algae accumulation can hinder the reoxygenation of water by affecting the water air exchange it is speculated that the proportion of n2o produced via the nitrification process in the caa may account for a higher proportion of microbial derived n2o than that in the ncaa as evidenced by the analysis of the n2o production pathway in lake taihu fig 5 and table s1 thereinto the proportion of n2o produced via the nitrification process to microbial derived n2o increased from 43 0 the outbreak stage to 53 5 the decay stage table s1 and the n2o release fluxes during the decay stage were higher than that during the outbreak period fig 2 the reason is that the breakdown of algal cells increases the nutrients in the water column and surface sediments during the algae decay processes and the sedimentation of algae debris reduces the inhibition of algae aggregation on water reoxygenation thus promotes the nitrification of microorganisms in the water column and denitrification in the sediments furthermore the ratio of the nitrification in the overall microbial production process was higher or closer to denitrification suggesting that n2o in this study was more likely to derive from waters as the anaerobic environment in the sediment was more favorable for n2o production by the denitrification therefore algal blooms promote the transformation of the dominant n2o production pathway from the nitrification process to the denitrification process and their decay and decomposition can slightly increase the proportion of nitrification process to n2o production in fact a considerable amount of produced n2o is consumed before it is emitted into the atmosphere since the n2o reduction plays an important role in regulating the spatial and temporal variations of n2o emissions of lakes in this study the effect of n2o reduction on the sp value was not considered the reduction of n2o to n2 during the complete denitrification process is the only known way to consume n2o pauleta et al 2019 therefore the proportion of n2o produced via the denitrification process to microbial derived n2o may be underestimated the n2o reductase which controls the n2o reduction process is encoded by the nosz gene horn et al 2006 thus the combination of stable isotope technology and molecular biological methods will help to further explore the n2o production pathway in lakes 5 implications lake taihu was found to be an n2o source during the formation and disappearance stages of algae blooms the decomposition of algae blooms not only significantly affected the water properties and aggravated the eutrophic degree of the lake but also improved the proportion of n2o produced via the denitrification process to microbial derived n2o thus changing the importance of different n2o production pathways to the production and emission of n2o fig 7 although the dissolved n2o concentration significantly correlated with n2o emission flux and chl a concentration the excessive accumulation of algae blooms on the water surface decreased n2o production and emission fluxes by limiting the substrate supply of nitrate by nitrification in hypoxic or anoxic conditions for the denitrification process and hindering the release of the dissolved n2o to atmosphere during the accumulation of algae on the water surface there may be a threshold for algal bloom accumulation thickness which needs further study to accurately assess the n2o emission flux in eutrophic lakes moreover the littoral zone in eutrophic lakes easily accumulates extremely heavy algae blooms on the water surface owing to the wind and wave disturbance and being trapped by the emergent aquatic plants in the nearshore which generally occurs in most of the eutrophic lakes worldwide as a costly but immediate and useful emergency measure algae salvage has been widely used in the improvement of eutrophic lakes for instance dozens of salvage stations around lake taihu can pull up 2900 tons a day during the outbreak stage of algae blooms based on our findings restoring the vegetation zone along the shore preferentially salvaging the accumulated algae between vegetation zones and avoiding violent disturbances to reduce water reoxygenation could greatly reduce the n2o emissions given a large number of lakes show the transformation trend from a macrophyte dominated state to an algae dominated state because of eutrophication the multiple impact and mechanism of algal blooms to the production and emission of n2o in our study is of practical significance to control greenhouse gasses emission of freshwater ecosystems 6 conclusion the mean dissolved n2o concentrations in the water column of algae accumulation areas were almost the same 0 05 μmol l 1 while the n2o emission had a significant difference among three stages of an algae bloom specifically the mean n2o emissions of the pre outbreak outbreak and decay stages were 17 95 26 36 and 79 32 μmol m 2 d 1 respectively which were 2 0 7 5 times higher than those in the non algae accumulation areas the dissolved n2o was originated from microbial derived nitrification and incomplete denitrification 74 24 and the water air exchange processes 25 76 the algae multi impacts on n2o emissions in this eutrophic lake can be attributed to three aspects first algae decomposition consumed a great amount of do and transformed the dominant n2o production pathway from the nitrification process 45 33 to the denitrification process 39 74 second the increased nitrogen turnover rate by algae growth and the numerous nutrients released by algae decay increased n2o emissions third the excessive algae accumulation on the water surface reduced the n2o produced by water air exchanges and caused water hypoxia to limit the substrate supply of nitrate by nitrification for the denitrification process thus further decreasing the n2o emissions however more evidence is necessary for insights into these complex processes e g the functional microbial diversity these findings provide a new perspective and understanding for accurately evaluating n2o release fluxes driven by algae processes in eutrophic lakes and are of practical significance to control greenhouse gasses emissions by freshwater ecosystems credit authorship
