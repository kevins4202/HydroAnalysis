25005,our goal is to assess consequences of the introduction of alien north american castor сanadensis cc beaver into the nature reserves inhabited by eurasian beaver castor fiber cf in european russia using a mathematical model for this reason we have developed a two species model of population dynamics long term 1934 2015 monitoring data on cf population dynamics in six nature reserves are used in computer modelling of competitive interactions between native cf and alien cc the reserves are located in the european part of russia in the north south and central part of cf range we have simulated the dynamics of both species populations after the introduction of cc into the habitats occupied by cf the model demonstrates that cf is displaced by cc in all the reserves after the introduction of 2 24 individuals of cc however the duration of exclusion of one species by the other varies as a function of ecological conditions initial number of individuals and fecundities our model shows that in case of introduction of 12 cc beavers the size of cf population starts to decrease after 31 146 years as a result of competition we study the conditions providing the coexistence of both species and find that cc population dynamics after cf exclusion can be described by four patterns irruptive lapland reserve single stage prioksko terrasny reserve multi stage darwin central forest and khoper reserves and logistic population growth oka reserve species biology in terms of the fecundity family size rate of individual development until sexual maturity life span and the age structure of populations are compared between species to detect the mechanisms providing the competitive advantage of cc over cf keywords competition population dynamics native species invasion nature reserves introduction by the end of the 19th century there were approximately 1 500 eurasian beavers castor fiber l 1758 cf in 11 isolated populations in eurasia portenko 1926 grave 1931 lavrov 1981 nolet rosell 1998 table 1 fig 1 subsequently those mainly european populations served as a source for cf reintroduction and restoration of its range besides the north american beavers castor canadensis kuhl 1820 cc were brought and released in the north eastern parts of poland in 1926 masuria into the river goryn former poland territory and now ukraine in 1933 1934 and in finland in 1937 lathi helminen 1974 ermala et al 1989 the purpose of those introductions was to restore beaver s populations in europe because at that time many zoologists considered the beavers of the old and new worlds as the same species only in 1973 lavrov and orlov 1973 showed that eurasian beaver c fiber had 48 chromosomes whereas north american beaver c canadensis 40 chromosomes lavrov orlov 1973 so cc turned out an alien species for eurasia in ukraine cс became extinct in 1957 and in poland in 1979 zurowski 1980 parker et al 2012 in finland it has spread throughout its southern part of the country concentrating near the eastern boundaries while it was rarely met in the north west near the borders with norway kauhala turkia 2013 in the 50 s of the 20th century cс crossed the russian finland border and invaded habitats in karelia republic and karelian isthmus zaikin 1959 segal orlova 1961 ivanov 1975 monitoring and conservation 2010 in russia alien cс beavers were repeatedly caught and introduced to beaver free areas in karelia and the russian far east from the middle of 1960s to the end of 1980s several cases of unintentional cc introduction in western europe are known in france in 1977 three cc beavers escaped from a private zoo and reached the bourdon reservoir on the yonna river according to dewas et al 2012 in 1984 the local cс population consisted of 15 20 beavers from the initial sites of introduction the beavers were spreading and creating settlements in the basin of the loire river because of the simultaneous presence of cf and cс in the loire it was decided to eradicate cс in 1984 1985 24 north american beavers were captured and exterminated in austria 1978 1979 and 1986 and in hungary 1990s cс also escaped from captivity the beavers in austria did likely not reproduce and soon became extinct sieber bauer 2001 the outcome of introduction in hungary remained unclear parker et al 2012 cс was introduced to germany several times and at different locations in 1981 and 1989 cс beavers were released in the north rhine westphalia nrw which served as a source for further cс distribution dewas et al 2012 in 1994 cс was released in rheinland palatinate rlp which is located in the south west of germany near the border with france luxemburg and belgium in that region the cc population was represented both by reproductive beavers and by sterilized ones which had been released to restrict the total population size dewas et al 2012 parker et al 2012 a more tangled situation emerged on the territory of bavaria germany where beavers were introduced from poland beaver farm in popel no in 1966 parker et al 2012 and finland in 1972 lathi helminen 1974 i e before cf and cc were recognized as different species parker et al 2012 indicated that cс beavers could also be among those brought from the polish beaver nursery though the identification of 1 500 beavers did not reveal any another introduction of cс from finland was little discussed in literature sources though there are data confirming the capture of naturalized cс individuals in finland and their transportation in 1972 for introduction in bavaria lathi helminen 1974 anonymous 1972 this fact is very important for understanding the species and subspecies structure of beaver populations in bavaria where since 1970 individuals of different origins were repeatedly released c f albicus fiber belorussicus galliae orientoeuropaeus later on the beavers from bavaria were regularly captured for distribution to the european countries hungary 2000 2002 belgium 1998 croatia 1996 2001 and bulgaria 2001 2002 halley rosell 2002 our analysis shows that bavaria could be a hidden source of cс in central and western europe the availability of the sources for cc distribution in three european countries namely germany luxemburg and belgium was affirmed in 2006 when a dead cc beaver was found at the border of luxemburg and germany dewas et al 2012 afterwards cc was met in four locations of luxemburg herr schley 2009 dewas et al 2012 during 2009 2010 winter studies 13 cc beavers were removed from six locations in luxemburg and belgium while eight beavers were withdrawn from three habitats in germany rlp dewas et al 2012 currently the largest populations of cc in eurasia are found in karelia russia and finland the cc population in karelia consists of 13 000 beavers monitoring and conservation 2010 in finland there were 6 100 settlements i e over 24 000 animals in 2013 brommer et al 2017 the population size of cf based on monitoring counts in the autumn of 2017 was estimated at 3 300 4 500 animals and cc at 10 300 19 100 beaver as a renewable resource 2019 at present the two species are partly sympatric in pirkanmaa and close to each other in etelä pohjanmaa regions in finland the cf is considered as near threatened in the 2015 finnish red book liukko et al 2016 the issues of coexistence and competitive relations between these two species arise with regard to the recent findings of cc in central and western europe dewas et al 2012 in karelia and finland the creation of sympatric zones took from 67 to 80 years after the cc introduction the processes of mutual penetration and exclusion of one beaver species by another continue in karelian isthmus leningrad region and in the north of arkhangelsk region monitoring and conservation 2010 according to the monitoring studies in karelia some regions occupied by cc over 20 years ago are currently inhabited by cf and vice versa danilov fedorov 2015 data on ecology and behavior of cc and cf in south karelia showed that in identical orographic edaphic and hydrologic conditions cc and cf beavers build lodges and dams with the same frequency danilov fedorov 2015 parker et al 2012 also indicated that differences in the life history ecology and behavior were insignificant and suggested that ecological niches of the two species completely overlap however the fecundity and family sizes are significantly greater in cc than in cf rosell parker 1995 parker et al 2012 thus there is no unified view on the competitive interactions between the two species although they are in the focus of scientific attention monitoring and conservation 2010 parker et al 2012 danilov fedorov 2015 dewas et al 2012 frosch et al 2014 for example parker et al 2012 analyzed the history of species restoration their biology and ecology then suggested a strategic plan of cc eradication from eurasia however these publications do not give any specific estimates of the rate of competitive exclusion of one species by the other some researchers considered cf as inferior relative to cc müller schwarze sun 2003 but according to the monitoring data in karelia cf has an advantage over cc at the initial stages of competition danilov et al 2007 p 54 cc was long believed to be a superior competitor as it achieves sexual maturity faster has greater fecundity and its building activity is more intense müller schwarze sun 2003 however data on ecology and behavior of two beaver species in the same conditions of the south karelia showed that cc and cf built the lodges and dams with the same frequency danilov fedorov 2015 consequently the rate of population growth is the only competitive advantage of cc so it is not clear whether two beaver species would coexist on the same territory or one of them would be eventually excluded by the competitor therefore our goal is to assess the consequences of the cc introduction into nature reserves inhabited by cf in the european russia by means of a mathematical model based on long term monitoring data on beaver population dynamics for this reason we have developed a population dynamics model of the resource consumer type with two species of competing consumers this model has originated from the previously developed single species model petrosyan et al 2013 which was highly efficient for prediction of cf population dynamics in nature reserves in the european part of russia petrosyan et al 2016 materials and methods long term monitoring data to establish demographic and resource parameters characterizing the state of beaver populations we use the long term monitoring data on cf population dynamics in six nature reserves lapland nature reserve lnr darwin nature reserve dnr central forest nature reserve cfnr prioksko terrasny nature reserve ptnr oka nature reserve onr and khoper nature reserve knr petrosyan et al 2016 these nature reserves are located in european russia in the northern southern and central parts of the cf range fig 2 table 2 cf was introduced twice in the lnr in 1934 and 1937 14 beavers in total kataev 2015 in the dnr in 1976 zavyalov et al 2005 in cfnr in 1936 and 1937 four couples korablev et al 2011 in 1948 after an almost 400 year absence from the territory of the ptnr albov khlyap 2015 two couples of cf beavers were released into the tadenka river in 1937 1940 23 beavers of cf were released in the onr kudryashov 1975 in 1937 1939 23 cf beavers were released in knr d yakov 1975 demographic and resource parameters of the model were derived from the long term monitoring data on the beaver population dynamics for lnr from 1934 to 1985 for dnr from 1980 to 2001 for cfnr from 1936 to 2010 for ptnr from 1948 to 2015 for onr from 1949 to 2010 and for knr from 1957 to 2012 petrosyan et al 2016 the model the two species model is built on the following assumptions assumption 1 during the study period the common resource r k does not change with time k i e the favorable common resource of two species is limited and characterized by r r k r c o n s t it means that potential changes of common resources caused by other reasons are significantly less than the impact of beavers assumption 2 according to published data gurney lawton 1996 wright et al 2004 petrosyan et al 2013 the common resource comprises three components r k a r k p and r k d it can be represented as follows r r k a r k p r k d where r k a r k p and r k d are active potential and degraded resources respectively active resource is a resource available for consumption potential resource is a resource that can be restored from degraded resource and turn into the active form degraded resource cannot be used by beavers it is a product of consumption process by beavers in nature the state of these resources is dependent on the habitat conditions interchanges of periods with beavers and those without them logofet et al 2015 zavyalov et al 2016 assumption 3 in the model the rate f x of beaver population increase depends on the amount x of active resource available for one individual x r k a p k where p k p k 1 p k 2 p k is the total of two beaver population sizes and p k 1 p k 2 are population sizes of species 1 native and species 2 alien at time k respectively the rate f x is constrained in such a way that the function 1 f x the population growth rate is bounded continuous and monotone increasing for all x 0 guaranteeing zero or positive values fig 3 shows a qualitative pattern of the beaver population increase coefficient f x as a function of x assumption 4 since the absolute values of resources are commonly difficult to obtain in the field the proposed model uses the relative values measured as fractions of the total resource it means that r 1 ensuing from assumptions 1 4 the parametric discrete time model describing the development of competitive relations between two beaver species takes on the following form 1 p k 1 1 p k 1 f r k a p k q 1 p k 1 p k 1 2 p k 2 f r k a p k q 2 p k 2 r k 1 a r k a q 6 1 p k 1 q 6 2 p k 2 q 5 r k p r k 1 p r k p q 5 r k p q 7 r k d r k d 1 r k a r k p k 0 1 2 f x q q 2 q 1 q 2 x q 3 q 4 2 x q 3 2 q 1 q 1 1 q 2 1 q 3 1 q 4 1 q 2 q 1 2 q 2 2 q 3 2 q 4 2 q q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 here p k 1 p k 2 r k a r k p and r k d are the numbers of beavers of the 1 st cf and 2nd cc species the levels of active potential and degraded resources at the kth year respectively f x q f x q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 is a parametric model of the rate of population increase depending on the level of the active resource per beaver where x r k a p k q is a vector of model parameters q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 petrosyan et al 2013 model 1 includes the following parameters q 1 is the maximal value of the population increase rate when the relative active resource tends to 1 q 2 is the population increase rate when the level of active resource per individual coincides with the optimal level under particular environmental conditions where always q 2 q 1 q 3 is the threshold of per capita active resources at which the pattern of population increase rate alters q 4 is the parameter determining the steepness of function f x q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 at the inflection point the value of the derivative w r t x which is reached at x q 3 the value of the derivative at this point equals q 1 q 2 q 4 q 5 is the fraction of the potential resource that transforms into the active form for a year i е the intensity of resource restoration q 6 is the fraction of the active resource utilized by an individual and thus transformed into the degraded recourse q 7 is the fraction of the degraded resource transforming into the potential resource for a year all the above parameters of the model can take only positive values except for the parameter q 4 due to their physical meanings further we can assume that the parameters q 4 i i 1 2 take nonnegative values since function f x q 1 i q 2 i q 3 i q 4 i depends on them however parameter q 4 i cannot be equal to 0 indeed according to assumption 3 function f x q 1 i q 2 i q 3 i q 4 i should be continuous for all x while it displays a jump discontinuity at x q 3 i when q 4 i 0 thus we can consider all the parameters of system 1 to take positive values also parameters q 5 q 6 q 7 of the beaver environment should not exceed 1 as fractions to have f x q 1 i q 2 i q 3 i q 4 i monotone increasing it is necessary and sufficient to meet the following condition q 1 i q 2 i according to assumption 3 the following conditions should be met 2 q 2 i q 1 i q 3 i q 3 i q 3 i 2 q 4 i 2 q 2 i q 3 i 2 q 4 i 2 q 3 i q 3 i 2 q 4 i 2 i 1 2 analysis of competitive interactions we analyze the population dynamics of competing cc and cf species via stationary solutions of system 1 stationary solutions are obtained in the traditional way i e by looking for the solutions that are constant over time then investigating their asymptotic stability by the lyapunov method in the first approximation additionally the two species model 1 is used to carry out computer experiments the population q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 and resource q 5 q 6 q 7 parameters for cf are taken from the single species model based on the long term monitoring data on cf population dynamics in 6 nature reserves petrosyan et al 2016 the parameters for cc are determined from conditions 2 and a 11 see appendix parameters q 1 and q 2 for cc are calculated from the fecundity ratio f rat of cc to cf averaged to 1 67 2sd 0 346 lavrov 1960 lathi helminen 1974 kanshiev 1983 rosell parker 1995 danilov 2009 danilov et al 2011 parker et al 2012 the other parameters of the model q 3 q 4 q 5 q 6 q 7 do not differ between cf and cc in our computer experiments in all the computer experiments the initial abundance of cf is equal to the equilibrium level cf obtained in a single species model petrosyan et al 2016 or to the maximum value of the population size cf during the monitoring period if cf cf such an approach is necessary to simulate conditions for the introduction of alien cc into the habitats of cf cc beavers are introduced by groups varying from 2 to 24 beavers at a step of two individuals 2 4 6 24 for each scenario of introduction we determine the duration from the moment of cc introduction until the phase of competitive cf exclusion by cc for the odd numbers of 3 5 7 23 of introduced cс beavers the duration of the coexistence phase for all reserves are established based on nonlinear regression models rm using the estimates for even cc numbers we evaluate the suitability of these models using residual analysis it means that the fitted curves are considered acceptable if we cannot reject the following statistical hypotheses 1 that the average values equal zero and 2 that the residuals obey a normal distribution according to the kolmogorov smirnov shapiro wilk and watson tests these curves adequately describe the relationships between the number of introduced cc beavers and the duration of the two species coexistence in nature reserves results the analysis has revealed that the system of eq 1 has a stationary time independent solution p c 1 p c 2 r c a r c p r d d 1 r c a r c p this solution must be consistent with the following system of algebraic equations 3 q 2 1 q 1 1 q 2 1 r c a q 3 1 p c q 4 1 p c 2 r c a q 3 1 p c 2 p c 1 0 q 2 2 q 1 2 q 2 2 r c a q 3 2 p c q 4 2 p c 2 r c a q 3 2 p c 2 p c 2 0 q 6 1 p c 1 q 6 2 p c 2 q 5 r c p 0 q 5 r c p q 7 r c d 0 r c d 1 r c a r c p p c p c 1 p c 2 the existence and stability analysis of stationary solution is presented in appendix the characteristics of all possible stationary solutions of system 1 are given below case 1 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 such a stationary solution is unstable it means that the populations of two beaver species of cannot go extinct simultaneously case 2 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 in order that stationary population sizes exist for both species it is necessary that all the q parameters be equal between the species which is practically improbable see appendix case 3 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 if the two species have identical death rates but their fecundities are different the positive equilibrium population size cannot be realized for the species cf with lesser fecundity case 4 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 the zero equilibrium population size of the first species cf is asymptotically stable for all studied reserves see appendix i e if the two beavers species have similar death rates then the positive stationary population size of the species cc with higher growth rate fecundity can be realized sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the unique stationary solution in the above form are presented in the appendix the analysis of stationary solutions has shown that in general for any values of demographic and resource parameters that meet condition 2 the competitive exclusion does occur which illustrates the gause 1934 exclusion principle in other words if two species use the same food resources and occupy the same habitat the cc population grows faster thus constraining the cf population growth therefore if environmental conditions are stable the cf population may get extinct however the duration of coexistence and the rate of cf exclusion depend on the initial abundances of both species their demographic parameters and resource parameters the rates of cf exclusion have been established under various environmental conditions in the computer experiments the initial numbers of introduced cc individuals vary from 2 to 24 for each reserve fig 4 shows the duration of species coexistence phase until the onset of the cf exclusion phase in 6 reserves at different initial abundances of beaver populations model parameters for different reserves are presented in table 3 they have been used in all the subsequent computer experiments the analysis has shown that there are no causes for rejecting the hypotheses about the normal distribution of residuals with zero arithmetic average for all models of regression table 4 i e these curves accurately illustrate the coexistence duration depending on the number of introduced cc individuals in different reserves the dynamics of beaver population sizes for the case when cc 12 is given in fig 5 in lnr as shown in fig 4a the duration of cf exclusion depends on the initial abundance and varies within a wide range from 5 to 63 years in particular at the initial abundance of cf equal to 25 ind and that of cc equal to 12 ind the populations of both species increase at first following the irruptive pattern of development fig 5а in this case cc begins to suppress cf after 31 years such a pattern of both species development of has been observed at all tested initial population sizes in the computer experiments i e cf 25 cc 2 4 24 ind and for the set of q parameters see table 3 therefore the pattern of the alien cс population development in lnr does not significantly differ from that of cf in the single species case petrosyan et al 2016 when the initial cc population consists of 24 ind carrying capacity level cf is excluded faster for 5 years the habitat capacity measured by the q parameters can support 26 cc ind on the average with insignificant fluctuations from 23 to 31 individuals hereafter the carrying capacity equals the equilibrium number of beavers which has been determined from a single species model petrosyan et al 2016 in dnr the duration of cf exclusion phase depends on the initial abundance of both species as a nonlinear function r2 99 2 fig 4b when the initial number of cf beavers equals 250 of cc beavers equals 2 4 24 the duration of coexistence phase until the beginning of exclusion phase equals 133 116 66 years respectively if the initial number of cf 250 ind and that of cc 12 ind the coexistence phase duration until the beginning of exclusion phase equals 83 years fig 5b petrosyan et al 2016 indicated that the cf population growth rate in the dnr exhibits a multistep pattern with quasi periodic oscillations fig 5b illustrates the growth pattern of the cc population that pertains for all the tested initial cc population sizes the habitat capacity measured by the q parameters for cf can support on average 713 22 cc ind at the end of the computer experiment in cfnr how the duration of coexistence phase depends on the initial population sizes is also described by a nonlinear function r2 99 9 fig 4c yet in this reserve cf is displaced markedly slower fig 4c if in particular the initial cf population size is 350 ind fig 5c that of cc equals 2 4 24 ind then the eurasian beaver extinction will begin after 152 133 80 years respectively fig 5c shows that the cc population dynamics starting with 350 ind of cf and 12 ind of cc is following a multistep pattern petrosyan et al 2016 indicated that cf population dynamics was similar in a single species case for this reserve the capacity of this reserve habitat measured by the q parameters can support 316 120 beavers in ptnr if the cf initial population size equals 45 ind fig 5d and that of cс equals 2 4 24 then the duration of coexistence phase depends on the cc initial population size as a nonlinear function r2 99 7 fig 4d cf would be excluded after 389 300 70 years in accordance with the introduced numbers of cc beavers if 12 cc individuals are introduced the cf exclusion will start after 146 years fig 5d petrosyan et al 2013 2016 showed that cf population dynamics in ptnr followed a one step pattern with quasi periodic oscillations and the capacity of its habitat measured by the q parameters table 3 can support 42 3 cc ind in this reserve in onr the dependence of the coexistence duration on the initial beaver population sizes is also nonlinear r2 98 9 fig 4e if the initial population sizes are 300 ind for cf and 2 4 24 ind for cc the exclusion phase will begin after 132 115 68 years respectively in contrast to the other reserves the cc population growth in onr is properly approximated by a logistic curve fig 5e the pattern at the other initial population sizes being similar the onr habitat capacity measured by the q parameters for cf population can support 474 127 beavers the knr data also give evidences of a nonlinear dependence of the coexistence phase duration on the initial beaver abundances r2 99 3 fig 4f if the initial cf population size equals 350 ind the initial cc population size equals 2 4 24 the exclusion phase will begin after 108 92 60 years in accordance with cc initial numbers respectively fig 5f demonstrates that the phase of two species coexistence lasts about 70 years besides the dynamics of cc population growth rate follows a multistep pattern at the other initial population sizes too the knr carrying capacity measured by the q parameters can reach 781 124 beavers we have analyzed the stationary solutions cases 3 4 see appendix assuming that the death rates of both species are equal unfortunately there is little published data for comparison the annual death rate in a sustainable cc population is 26 30 the death rate of adults above 2 5 years is 30 32 during the first year of life the death rate is the least owing to the protection of young individuals in the parental colony during the second year of life it is about 40 since the yearlings begin to disperse leaving the parental colony during the following 2 years when the beavers spread along new habitats and their individual mass continuously increases the death rate also amounts to about 40 when the individual growth ceases at the age of 4 5 10 5 years the death rate decreases down to about 20 the annual death rate is similar for males and females the main causes of natural death for cc are wolf predation tularemia shortage of food and intraspecific fights payne 1989 there are few data on the cf death rates in voronezh reserve during the period of 1937 1963 the age composition of dead beavers n 192 distributed as follows 57 of adults 26 of yearlings and two year old beavers and 17 of under yearlings in knr for the same period n 55 these estimates constituted 38 42 and 20 respectively d yakov 1975 during the same period in voronezh reserve approximately 2 of the average annual number of beavers died barabash nikiforov et al 1961 the main causes of beaver death in voronezh reserve were beaver bites during their fights predator attacks and natural disasters in knr they were natural disasters poaching predators and beaver bites d yakov 1975 in onr 47 deaths of beavers were recorded in 1967 1972 the main natural causes of those deaths were beaver bites natural disasters asphyxiation under ice hunger and predator attacks kudryashov 1975 the main difference in death rates between the two species is likely their different resistances to tularemia while the high cf resistance to tularemia was shown both in field studies borodina 1966 and in experimental research barabash nikiforov et al 1961 cc is on the contrary known to be vulnerable to this disease cases of its mass death were recorded repeatedly novak et al 1987 if the death rates of the species are different the higher fecundity of cc can be counter balanced by its greater death rate providing a long term coexistence of two species model prediction of this case is shown in fig 6 figs 6a f indicate that the introduction of 12 cc individuals in lnr dnr ptnr cfnr onr and knr provides eventually the equilibrium population size of cf equal to 10 36 17 14 25 and 16 ind respectively our computer experiments show that cc can long survive in all the reserves if the death rate is sufficiently high discussion the long term data on cf population dynamics in lapland darwin central forest prioksko terrasny oka and khoper reserves located in the northern central and southern parts of this species range in european russia were used earlier in a single species population model for the eurasian beaver zavyalov et al 2015 european beaver 2012 petrosyan et al 2016 the single species model revealed four patterns of the beaver population dynamics namely irruptive lnr single step with quasi periodic oscillations ptnr multistep with quasi periodic oscillations dnr cfnr knr and periodic oscillations around a logistic growth curve single species model could predict the main patterns of cf populations dynamics in different habitats we have modified it to analyze the competitive interactions between two beaver species during their coexistence the advantages of the two species model are the following 1 this model involves interactions of both species with environmental conditions including the intensity of exploitation usage degradation and regeneration resources 2 our long term monitoring data 50 70 years on the beaver populations in six natural reserves and the parameters of the single and two species models allow us to describe the main patterns of cf and cc population dynamics under competitive interactions between two species 3 while our single species model can assess the demographic q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 and environmental q 5 q 6 q 7 parameters on the basis of the long term monitoring data on the cf populations the two species model can assess these parameters for cf and cc the parameters q 1 q 2 and q 1 q 2 are measured by means of available data on the fecundity and family sizes of both species for example the average family size of cf is 3 8 se 1 0 n 13 studies range 2 4 5 5 ind and that of cс is 5 2 se 1 4 n 51 studies range 2 7 9 2 ind rosell parker 1995 parker et al 2012 parker et al 2012 concluded in their review that the mean foetus number was less for cf 2 5 than for cc 4 0 and it was supported by pyotr i danilov s data danilov 1995 ruusila et al 2000 who found that the litter size of cf 1 9 and that of cc 3 2 the average size of cc kit was reported 4 7 n 9 in finland lathi helminen 1974 and 3 3 n 87 in karelia danilov 2009 the analysis of a large set of data on the fecundity of beavers cf n 896 cc n 1080 evidenced that the cc fecundity on average 3 27 min max 1 12 embryos per female is higher than that in cf on average 2 92 min max 1 9 kanshiev 1983 danilov 2009 in addition danilov et al 2011 showed that fecundity is one of the greatest distinctions in the reproductive biology of the cc it is much higher in cc than in cf the fecundity of cc 4 0 maximum foetuses 12 the fecundity of cf 2 2 maximum foetuses 6 the higher fecundity of cс 2 86 kits per female than that of cf 1 93 kits per female was also documented for beavers in captivity of voronezh nature reserve lavrov 1960 4 in the model two species have identical environmental parameters q 5 q 6 q 7 in accordance with published data reserchers formerly argued that the cc builder activity is more effective and that cc is better adapted to critical environmental conditions and more often feeds on grey alder alnus incana ruusila 1997 danilov kan shiev 1983 however the current data demonstrate no differences in their building activity and diet both species likely occupy the same ecological niche danilov et al 2011 danilov fedorov 2015 we divide population dynamics into two phases after cc introduction into habitats occupied by cf during the first phase the cc population size increases while the number cf beavers decreases the abundance of cc is less than that of cf throughout the first phase hence this stage can be called the species coexistence phase after this phase the cc population size becomes equal to that of cf afterwards cc begins to suppress cf while cf is dying out the population size of cc is tending to a level in accordance with habitat capacity measured by the q parameters by the end of the second stage cc excludes cf completely cf suffers extinction while the abundance of the other species establishes at the maximal level determined by the habitat carrying capacity that is described by the q parameters we call the second period as competitive exclusion phase in simulation experiments the number of introduced cc individuals has varied from 2 to 24 such a size of the introduced beaver group corresponds to the number of beavers reintroduced in eurasia last century in particular 14 kataev 2015 8 korablev et al 2011 4 zavyalov et al 2010 23 kudryashov 1975 and 22 d yakov 1975 cf ind were released into lnr cfnr ptnr onr and knr respectively seven cc beavers and 19 cf ones lathi helminen 1974 were introduced in finland in 1935 1937 in 1998 and 1999 40 and 12 cf ind were released in belgium respectively halley rosell 2002 in france cf were introduced in groups including 3 to 21 beavers totally 273 cf ind between 1957 and 1988 dewas et al 2012 the population dynamics predicted by our model in lnr which is characterized by extreme environmental conditions demonstrates that after the introduction of 2 24 cc individuals the phase of coexistence lasts from 63 to 5 years the maximum number of cc individuals during the phase of competitive exclusion does not exceed 30 ind fig 5a these estimates confirm the results of repeated cc introductions into similar ecological conditions in the north west of finland where the current population of cc did not exceed 50 ind lathi helminen 1974 parker et al 2012 the outcome of our computational experiments shows that for different initial numbers of cc the predicted population growth is always irruptive similar patterns of population dynamics were observed for cf in two regions of sweden hartman 2003 and in lnr petrosyan et al 2016 noteworthy is that when 24 ind of cc were introduced the phase of coexistence lasted 5 years i e this phase involved 2 3 generations published data indicate that cс more frequently develop to maturity at the end of their second year of life as compared to cf henry bookhout 1969 danilov 2009 since environmental conditions in ptnr are unfavorable the duration of cf exclusion phase should last longer than in the other study reserves fig 4d in this reserve the model predicts that cf population dynamics for single species community tends to equilibrium state with quasi periodic oscillations with periods of 14 26 years petrosyan et al 2013 fig 5d shows that after the introduction of 12 cc individuals the cf population size decreases according to quasi periodical oscillations in this case cc can exclude cf for 400 years the population of cc on the contrary grows with a linear trend and small oscillations yet the quasi periodicity in cc population dynamics is not well expressed the relations between two species during their coexistence phase depend on the q parameters that describe the habitat carrying capacity in the suboptimal habitats of dnr two species coexisted for 136 66 years after the introduction of 2 to 24 of cс individuals fig 4b the model shows that cf gets extinct when cc reaches the first step of its population growth a multistep pattern of population dynamics was first found for cf in this reserve petrosyan et al 2016 yet this pattern is better expressed in cc population dynamics in cfnr and knr suboptimal habitats cf is displaced by cc at all the tested initial numbers of introduced cc individuals fig 4с f much faster than in ptnr fig 4d due to the high rate of food resource renewal in particular when 12 ind of cc are introduced the two beaver species coexist for 100 years in cfnr and 71 years in knr in cfnr and knr the model also predicts the multistep population dynamics similar to that in dnr fig 5c f in knr the multistep growth of cc population is very distict the population reaches the first step for 25 years after the introduction while in cfnr it takes 150 years noteworthy is that the multistep pattern of cc population dynamics is more expressed than that of cf in favorable conditions of onr cf is displaced fairly quickly too at all initial numbers of cc individuals varying from 2 to 24 fig 4e in this reserve cc population dynamics in contrast to other studied reserves demonstrates logistic oscillatory growth see fig 5e logistic curve and the pattern is similar for other initial population sizes the phase of coexistence lasts about 85 years in onr at 12 initial cc individuals the model shows fig 5 that if 12 beavers of cc are introduced the phase of cf and cc coexistence would take 31 71 83 85 100 and 146 years in lnr knr dnr onr cfnr and ptnr respectively we relate the high rate of competitive exclusion in lnr to its extremely low carrying capacity for beavers because of the long regeneration time of trees and shrubs in the far north the moderate rates of competitive exclusion in the last four reserves are provided by sufficient availability of food resources however in ptnr the food resources for beavers are rather scarce zavyalov et al 2010 yet the predicted rate of the competitive exclusion is quite low about 146 years there may be several reasons for this phenomenon first beaver food resources restore faster in ptnr compared to lnr and previously abandoned habitats are repopulated after four years zavyalov et al 2016 in contrast the restoration of woody vegetation in lnr lasts at least 50 years kataev 2011 second beavers in ptnr frequently change their habitats sometimes several times a year zavyalov et al 2016 therefore there will be hard for cc to settle if all suitable habitats are already occupied third the beavers demonstrate high building activity in ptnr they continuously create new dams and repair old ones numerous dams remain long after beavers abandon the habitat goryainova et al 2014 zavyalov et al 2016 it is known that all these factors can ultimately enlarge carrying capacity for beavers logofet et al 2015 thus even under the current scarcity of food resources owing to long term exploitation by beavers the carrying capacity in ptnr is higher than in lnr and the environmental conditions for beaver development are much better the model results indicate that cc would penetrate the cf range diffusively the rate of cc penetration into the central part of the cf range is still unknown the rate of dispersal among vacant habitats is similar in both species danilov et al 2007 the following patterns of beaver migrations are distinguished short term migrations of yearlings dispersals of animals at the age of 2 creating new colonies migrations of the whole colonies to the other water bodies within their ranges individual migrations of adults that lost their partners the distance of beaver migrations varies greatly and it frequently depends on the availability of favorable and free habitats the direction of migration can be either upstream or downstream beavers are also able to overcome watersheds overland the distances of migrations in uninhabited areas are commonly greater than within habitats with established populations saveliev et al 2010 since the cc dispersals were analyzed in inhabited areas their pattern can differ from that among free habitats thefore cc would likely migrate from the north to the south of european russia in general we suggest that vacant habitats are the most vulnerable to cc colonization while favourable areas are more resistent cf populations might remain as a number of isolated populations within the current range of this species the model predicts that cc would displace cf in all the study reserves located in different ecological conditions in the northern central and southern parts of the cf current range however if the cc death rate is high enough to counter balance the high cc birth rate then a long term coexistence of both species is likely nevertheless the equality of death rate and birth rate may not be sufficient for their coexistence in some cases since cc mature earlier than cf which gives another advantage of cc over cf although cf sexually matures at the end of the second year of life only a small share of young animals participate in reproduction in voronezh reserve this share did not exceed 8 10 lavrov 1956 1981 it is 12 in knr d yakov 1975 7 in onr kudryashov 1975 6 6 in the leningrad oblast and the south of karelia kanshiev 1983 on the contrary osborn 1953 indicated that 21 2 of cc females start reproduction at the age of 1 5 2 years to conclude complex models are very useful to predict the consequences of alien species invasions under different environmental conditions and at various initial numbers of individuals the suggested two species model can predict population dynamics of the two beaver species if we know environmental conditions the initial population sizes and the duration of their coexistence for example 2 8 ind of cc from finland were introduced into the vacant habitats in bavaria in 1972 see introduction then by 1997 cc population could have reached 266 34 ind if the ecological conditions for beavers in bavaria had been suboptimal i e similar to those in dnr cfnr and knr if the conditions had been optimal the population size could be 577 87 ind if the minimum cc population growth rate in bavaria had been equal to that in finland known from the real monitoring data lathi helminen 1974 for 25 years then cc population size could reach 550 50 individuals these estimates enable us to predict a likely secondary source of cc invasion that could have formed in bavaria by 1997 it was likely that the beavers from such a source were removed and introduced into other european countries in 1998 2002 the 66 cc individuals that were detected removed sterilized or transferred to zoos in germany rlp nrw france belgium and luxembourg dewas et al 2012 frosch et al 2014 constituted about 12 of the population size predicted by the model our model predicts that if strategic plans for the eradication of the north american beaver including recommendations of parker et al 2012 are not accepted the eurasian beaver will likely get extinct in a significant part of its restored range in the 21 st century the history of biological invasions has well demonstrated that in spite of certain success in reintroduction and restoration of some species there can be serious negative consequences for native species especially those that are ecologically close to invaders for example the american mink neovison vison schreber 1777 intentionally introduced into various regions of western europe in 1920 1930 and russia in 1928 was successfully naturalized currently its range extends across eurasia from the atlantic to the pacific and nearly reaches the maximum possible frontiers khlyap et al 2011 bonesi tom 2012 the american mink has replaced the european mink mustela lutreola l 1761 almost everywhere maran henttonen 1995 tumanov 2009 its further population growth in the north west of russia might negatively affect the state of small populations of the native european mink bobrov et al 2008 there are some more alien species that have caused similar negative effects in europe in particular the eastern grey squirrel sciurus carolinensis gmelin 1788 has gradually excluded the native red squirrel s vulgaris l 1758 in the uk and italy wauters et al 2002 martinoli et al 2010 conclusions ecological and biological similarities between the two beaver species can result in the competitive exclusion of one of them since cc was shown to have higher fecundity larger family size and early sexual maturation it is likely to be superior over cf and to exclude cf when they compete despite the similarities in the life span and population age structure one of the top priorities for the conservation of the eurasian beaver at the continental national and regional levels is to develop an international program for monitoring the status of cc populations in eurasia such a program should comprise the strategies developed by the international scientific communities such as aichi biodiversity target 9 convention on biological diversity 2001 and eu biodiversity strategy 2020 target 5 european commission 2011 including the measures to constrain population sizes of the north american beaver to reduce its ranges and at the slightest threat to completely eradicate it the necessity of such a program is dictated by the obligations arisen from the international treaties on biodiversity conservation and especially from the aichi biodiversity target 9 by 2020 invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized priority species are controlled or eradicated and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment convention on biological diversity 2001 acknowledgements we are thankful to all the staff of nature reserves for their assistance in creating the databases

analysis of stationary solutions asymptotic stability of the stationary solutions is studied by the lyapunov method in the first approximation stability theory of finite difference equations e g romanko 2012 states that for stability of a stationary solution it is necessary that the eigenvalues of the jacobi matrix derived for the stationary solution do not exceed 1 in absolute value moreover if all the eigenvalues are strictly less than one the stationary solution is asymptotically stable if at least one eigenvalue is strictly greater than one the stationary solution is unstable case 1 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 since q 5 0 and q 7 0 using eq 3 we can derive that r c a 1 r c p r c d 0 with respect to the system of eq 1 the jacobi matrix derived for the stationary solution can be written as follows a 1 a φ p 1 p 1 φ p 1 p 2 φ p 1 r a φ p 1 r p φ p 2 p 1 φ p 2 p 2 φ p 2 r a φ p 2 r p φ r a p 1 φ r a p 2 φ r a r a φ r a r p φ r p p 1 φ r p p 2 φ r p r a φ r p r p c 1 q 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 q 1 2 0 0 q 6 1 q 6 2 1 q 5 0 0 q 7 1 q 5 q 7 where φ p 1 φ p 2 φ r a φ r p are the right hand sides of the first second third and fourth equations of system 1 respectively c means that the partial derivatives of the right hand sides w r t its variables are calculated at the stationary solution the characteristic equation to determine the eigenvalues of matrix a 1 takes on the following form a 2 det a λ e 1 q 1 1 λ 1 q 1 2 λ 1 λ 1 q 5 q 7 λ q 5 q 7 0 the eigenvalues are found as follows a 3 λ 1 1 q 1 1 λ 2 1 q 1 2 λ 3 1 q 5 λ 4 1 q 7 hence it follows from q 1 1 0 and q 1 2 0 see model that λ 1 1 and λ 2 1 and consequently the stationary solution is unstable it means that the populations of two species cannot get extinct simultaneously case 2 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 in this case system 3 reduces to a 4 q 2 1 q 1 1 q 2 1 x c q 3 1 q 4 1 2 x c q 3 1 2 0 q 2 2 q 1 2 q 2 2 x c q 3 2 q 4 2 2 x c q 3 2 2 0 q 6 1 p c 1 q 6 2 p c 2 q 5 r c p 0 q 5 r c p q 7 r c d 0 r c d 1 r c a r c p p c p c 1 p c 2 x c r c a p c it follows from a 4 that the first two equations depend only on the value of x c r c a p c 1 p c 2 to be found it means that x c must simultaneously obey the first two equations differing from each other only by the set of q parameters for different beaver species after solving the first and second equations of a 4 we obtain a 5 x c q 3 1 q 2 1 q 4 1 q 1 1 q 1 1 2 q 2 1 q 3 2 q 2 2 q 4 2 q 1 2 q 1 2 2 q 2 2 according to a 5 the existence of stationary solution p c 1 0 p c 2 0 implies the following condition equality for the q parameters of beaver species 1 and 2 a 6 q 3 1 q 2 1 q 4 1 q 1 1 q 1 1 2 q 2 1 q 3 2 q 2 2 q 4 2 q 1 2 q 1 2 2 q 2 2 since the restriction on the parameters of the model in the form of equality a 6 for arbitrary parameters of the two beaver species is unlikely in nature the stationary solution p c 1 0 p c 2 0 can hardly be realized case 3 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 it is necessary and sufficient for the stationary solution to exist if the following condition is satisfied petrosyan et al 2013 a 7 q 3 1 q 6 1 q 5 q 6 1 q 7 q 1 1 q 1 1 2 q 2 1 q 2 1 q 4 1 0 moreover petrosyan et al 2013 showed that there is only one stationary solution p c 1 0 if condition a 7 is satisfied the stationary values of the beaver population sizes and resources are found as follows a 8 p c 1 q 1 1 q 1 1 2 q 2 1 q 3 1 q 6 1 q 5 q 6 1 q 7 q 1 1 q 1 1 2 q 2 1 q 2 1 q 4

matrix since rearranging rows and columns does not change the eigenvalues a 9 a 1 f r c a p c 1 q 2 0 0 0 f q 1 r c a p c 1 1 f q 1 r c a p c 1 f q 1 0 q 6 2 q 6 1 1 q 5 0 0 q 7 1 q 5 q 7 q 1 q 1 1 q

c 1 q 2 1 q 2 2 q 1 2 q 2 2 x c q 3 2 q 4 2 2 x c q 3 2 2 x c r c a p c 1 here as before and further we assume that the death rates of both beaver species are identical and their fecundity rates do not change with time this means that the q parameters of model 1 are related as a 11 q 3 2 q 3 1 q 4 2 q 4 1 q 1 2 q 1 1 δ b q 2 2 q 2 1 δ b since we have p c p c 1 0 p c 2 0 it follows from 3 and a 10 that a 12 λ 1 1 δ b q 2 1 q 1 1 q 2 1 x c q 3 1 q 4 1 2 x c q 3 1 2 1 δ b x c r c a p c 1 since δ b 0 here as the fecundity of cc is greater than cf q 1 2 q 1 1 q 2 2 q 2 1 matrix a 9 has one real eigenvalue strictly greater than 1 consequently the stationary solution is asymptotically unstable according to lyapunov s theorem romanko 2012 in other words if two species have similar death rates the positive stationary population size of the species with lower growth rate fecundity cannot be realized case 4 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 in this case all the assumptions and restrictions are the same as in case 3 therefore all the formulas and results obtained in case 3 are applicable in this case with only small change i e the upper scripts 1 and 2 must be permuted in these formulas and results the jacobi matrix derived for the stationary solution the q parameters of model 1 and the eigenvalue are determined as follows see a 13 a 14 a 15 a 13 a 1 f r c a p c 2 q 1 0 0 0 f q 2 r c a p c 2 1 f q 2 r c a p c 2 f q 2 0 q 6 1 q 6 2 1 q 5 0 0 q 7 1 q 5 q 7 q 1 q 1 1 q 2 1 q 3 1 q 4 1 q 2 q 1 2 q 2 2 q 3 2 q 4 2 q q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 f x q q 2 q 1 q 2 x q 3 q 4 2 x q 3 2 f q q 1 q 1 2 q 2 3 2 q 4 q 1 q

cf is lower than cc q 1 1 q 1 2 q 2 1 q 2 2 the eigenvalue is strictly less than 1 it means that the stationary solution with p c 1 0 may be asymptotically stable the stationary solution p c 2 0 according to petrosyan et al 2013 does exist if and only if the following condition holds true a 16 q 3 2 q 6 2 q 5 q 6 2 q 7 q 1 2 q 1 2 2 q 2 2 q 2 2 q 4 2 0 if condition a 16 is satisfied the stationary values of the beaver population sizes and resources are found as follows a 17 p c 2 q 1 2 q 1 2 2 q 2 2 q 3 2 q 6 2 q 5 q 6 2 q 7 2 q 1 2 q 1 2 2 q 2 2 q 2 2 q 4 2 p c 1 0 r c a 1 q 6 2 q 5 q 6 2 q 7 p c 2 r c p q 6 2 q 5 p c 2 r c d q 6 2 q 7 p c 2 in general if condition a 16 is not met then the stationary solution does not exist it means that the number of cс beavers would change with time without tending to a nonzero stationary value the same would happen if a stationary solution exists but is not stable since condition a 16 is actually satisfied for all reserves we use computational experiments to illustrate the conditions under which all the eigenvalues of matrix a 13 are less than 1 by module outcome of the analysis has shown that in the case when the death rates of both species are not different the fecundity of cc is greater than that of cf and the condition a 16 is satisfied then the stationary population sizes of the both species can be represented by means of a 17 for the asymptotical stability analysis the eigenvalues λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ 4 of matrix a 13 have been calculated these values characterize the steady states of system 1 and they are presented in table a1 for each of the reserves table a1 shows that the eigenvalues λ 1 have real positive values for all the reserves and the eigenvalues that are expressed by complexly conjugated numbers are found for the lnr dnr cfnr and pntr for the other reserves onr and knr all the eigenvalues are less than 1 so the steady solution is stable and the periodic component is absent the solution of the equations of population dynamics for the lnr dnr cfnr and pntr has a periodic component and steady solutions are also stable the maximum absolute values of the eigenvalues are less than 1 table a1 outcomes show that for the stationary solution to be asymptotically stable asss in dnr onr and knr it is necessary that the values of f rat be equal or over 1 57 1 31 and 1 22 respectively table a1 for the three remaining reserves lnr cfnr and ptnr the asss is realized for the following values of f rat 1 17 1 16 and 1 15 respectively it means that for lnr cfnr and ptr which feature the smallest forage resources the minimal difference in f rat is enough for asss in contrast for dnr onr and knr reserves with maximum feed resources the greatest value of f rat difference is needed for asss 
25005,our goal is to assess consequences of the introduction of alien north american castor сanadensis cc beaver into the nature reserves inhabited by eurasian beaver castor fiber cf in european russia using a mathematical model for this reason we have developed a two species model of population dynamics long term 1934 2015 monitoring data on cf population dynamics in six nature reserves are used in computer modelling of competitive interactions between native cf and alien cc the reserves are located in the european part of russia in the north south and central part of cf range we have simulated the dynamics of both species populations after the introduction of cc into the habitats occupied by cf the model demonstrates that cf is displaced by cc in all the reserves after the introduction of 2 24 individuals of cc however the duration of exclusion of one species by the other varies as a function of ecological conditions initial number of individuals and fecundities our model shows that in case of introduction of 12 cc beavers the size of cf population starts to decrease after 31 146 years as a result of competition we study the conditions providing the coexistence of both species and find that cc population dynamics after cf exclusion can be described by four patterns irruptive lapland reserve single stage prioksko terrasny reserve multi stage darwin central forest and khoper reserves and logistic population growth oka reserve species biology in terms of the fecundity family size rate of individual development until sexual maturity life span and the age structure of populations are compared between species to detect the mechanisms providing the competitive advantage of cc over cf keywords competition population dynamics native species invasion nature reserves introduction by the end of the 19th century there were approximately 1 500 eurasian beavers castor fiber l 1758 cf in 11 isolated populations in eurasia portenko 1926 grave 1931 lavrov 1981 nolet rosell 1998 table 1 fig 1 subsequently those mainly european populations served as a source for cf reintroduction and restoration of its range besides the north american beavers castor canadensis kuhl 1820 cc were brought and released in the north eastern parts of poland in 1926 masuria into the river goryn former poland territory and now ukraine in 1933 1934 and in finland in 1937 lathi helminen 1974 ermala et al 1989 the purpose of those introductions was to restore beaver s populations in europe because at that time many zoologists considered the beavers of the old and new worlds as the same species only in 1973 lavrov and orlov 1973 showed that eurasian beaver c fiber had 48 chromosomes whereas north american beaver c canadensis 40 chromosomes lavrov orlov 1973 so cc turned out an alien species for eurasia in ukraine cс became extinct in 1957 and in poland in 1979 zurowski 1980 parker et al 2012 in finland it has spread throughout its southern part of the country concentrating near the eastern boundaries while it was rarely met in the north west near the borders with norway kauhala turkia 2013 in the 50 s of the 20th century cс crossed the russian finland border and invaded habitats in karelia republic and karelian isthmus zaikin 1959 segal orlova 1961 ivanov 1975 monitoring and conservation 2010 in russia alien cс beavers were repeatedly caught and introduced to beaver free areas in karelia and the russian far east from the middle of 1960s to the end of 1980s several cases of unintentional cc introduction in western europe are known in france in 1977 three cc beavers escaped from a private zoo and reached the bourdon reservoir on the yonna river according to dewas et al 2012 in 1984 the local cс population consisted of 15 20 beavers from the initial sites of introduction the beavers were spreading and creating settlements in the basin of the loire river because of the simultaneous presence of cf and cс in the loire it was decided to eradicate cс in 1984 1985 24 north american beavers were captured and exterminated in austria 1978 1979 and 1986 and in hungary 1990s cс also escaped from captivity the beavers in austria did likely not reproduce and soon became extinct sieber bauer 2001 the outcome of introduction in hungary remained unclear parker et al 2012 cс was introduced to germany several times and at different locations in 1981 and 1989 cс beavers were released in the north rhine westphalia nrw which served as a source for further cс distribution dewas et al 2012 in 1994 cс was released in rheinland palatinate rlp which is located in the south west of germany near the border with france luxemburg and belgium in that region the cc population was represented both by reproductive beavers and by sterilized ones which had been released to restrict the total population size dewas et al 2012 parker et al 2012 a more tangled situation emerged on the territory of bavaria germany where beavers were introduced from poland beaver farm in popel no in 1966 parker et al 2012 and finland in 1972 lathi helminen 1974 i e before cf and cc were recognized as different species parker et al 2012 indicated that cс beavers could also be among those brought from the polish beaver nursery though the identification of 1 500 beavers did not reveal any another introduction of cс from finland was little discussed in literature sources though there are data confirming the capture of naturalized cс individuals in finland and their transportation in 1972 for introduction in bavaria lathi helminen 1974 anonymous 1972 this fact is very important for understanding the species and subspecies structure of beaver populations in bavaria where since 1970 individuals of different origins were repeatedly released c f albicus fiber belorussicus galliae orientoeuropaeus later on the beavers from bavaria were regularly captured for distribution to the european countries hungary 2000 2002 belgium 1998 croatia 1996 2001 and bulgaria 2001 2002 halley rosell 2002 our analysis shows that bavaria could be a hidden source of cс in central and western europe the availability of the sources for cc distribution in three european countries namely germany luxemburg and belgium was affirmed in 2006 when a dead cc beaver was found at the border of luxemburg and germany dewas et al 2012 afterwards cc was met in four locations of luxemburg herr schley 2009 dewas et al 2012 during 2009 2010 winter studies 13 cc beavers were removed from six locations in luxemburg and belgium while eight beavers were withdrawn from three habitats in germany rlp dewas et al 2012 currently the largest populations of cc in eurasia are found in karelia russia and finland the cc population in karelia consists of 13 000 beavers monitoring and conservation 2010 in finland there were 6 100 settlements i e over 24 000 animals in 2013 brommer et al 2017 the population size of cf based on monitoring counts in the autumn of 2017 was estimated at 3 300 4 500 animals and cc at 10 300 19 100 beaver as a renewable resource 2019 at present the two species are partly sympatric in pirkanmaa and close to each other in etelä pohjanmaa regions in finland the cf is considered as near threatened in the 2015 finnish red book liukko et al 2016 the issues of coexistence and competitive relations between these two species arise with regard to the recent findings of cc in central and western europe dewas et al 2012 in karelia and finland the creation of sympatric zones took from 67 to 80 years after the cc introduction the processes of mutual penetration and exclusion of one beaver species by another continue in karelian isthmus leningrad region and in the north of arkhangelsk region monitoring and conservation 2010 according to the monitoring studies in karelia some regions occupied by cc over 20 years ago are currently inhabited by cf and vice versa danilov fedorov 2015 data on ecology and behavior of cc and cf in south karelia showed that in identical orographic edaphic and hydrologic conditions cc and cf beavers build lodges and dams with the same frequency danilov fedorov 2015 parker et al 2012 also indicated that differences in the life history ecology and behavior were insignificant and suggested that ecological niches of the two species completely overlap however the fecundity and family sizes are significantly greater in cc than in cf rosell parker 1995 parker et al 2012 thus there is no unified view on the competitive interactions between the two species although they are in the focus of scientific attention monitoring and conservation 2010 parker et al 2012 danilov fedorov 2015 dewas et al 2012 frosch et al 2014 for example parker et al 2012 analyzed the history of species restoration their biology and ecology then suggested a strategic plan of cc eradication from eurasia however these publications do not give any specific estimates of the rate of competitive exclusion of one species by the other some researchers considered cf as inferior relative to cc müller schwarze sun 2003 but according to the monitoring data in karelia cf has an advantage over cc at the initial stages of competition danilov et al 2007 p 54 cc was long believed to be a superior competitor as it achieves sexual maturity faster has greater fecundity and its building activity is more intense müller schwarze sun 2003 however data on ecology and behavior of two beaver species in the same conditions of the south karelia showed that cc and cf built the lodges and dams with the same frequency danilov fedorov 2015 consequently the rate of population growth is the only competitive advantage of cc so it is not clear whether two beaver species would coexist on the same territory or one of them would be eventually excluded by the competitor therefore our goal is to assess the consequences of the cc introduction into nature reserves inhabited by cf in the european russia by means of a mathematical model based on long term monitoring data on beaver population dynamics for this reason we have developed a population dynamics model of the resource consumer type with two species of competing consumers this model has originated from the previously developed single species model petrosyan et al 2013 which was highly efficient for prediction of cf population dynamics in nature reserves in the european part of russia petrosyan et al 2016 materials and methods long term monitoring data to establish demographic and resource parameters characterizing the state of beaver populations we use the long term monitoring data on cf population dynamics in six nature reserves lapland nature reserve lnr darwin nature reserve dnr central forest nature reserve cfnr prioksko terrasny nature reserve ptnr oka nature reserve onr and khoper nature reserve knr petrosyan et al 2016 these nature reserves are located in european russia in the northern southern and central parts of the cf range fig 2 table 2 cf was introduced twice in the lnr in 1934 and 1937 14 beavers in total kataev 2015 in the dnr in 1976 zavyalov et al 2005 in cfnr in 1936 and 1937 four couples korablev et al 2011 in 1948 after an almost 400 year absence from the territory of the ptnr albov khlyap 2015 two couples of cf beavers were released into the tadenka river in 1937 1940 23 beavers of cf were released in the onr kudryashov 1975 in 1937 1939 23 cf beavers were released in knr d yakov 1975 demographic and resource parameters of the model were derived from the long term monitoring data on the beaver population dynamics for lnr from 1934 to 1985 for dnr from 1980 to 2001 for cfnr from 1936 to 2010 for ptnr from 1948 to 2015 for onr from 1949 to 2010 and for knr from 1957 to 2012 petrosyan et al 2016 the model the two species model is built on the following assumptions assumption 1 during the study period the common resource r k does not change with time k i e the favorable common resource of two species is limited and characterized by r r k r c o n s t it means that potential changes of common resources caused by other reasons are significantly less than the impact of beavers assumption 2 according to published data gurney lawton 1996 wright et al 2004 petrosyan et al 2013 the common resource comprises three components r k a r k p and r k d it can be represented as follows r r k a r k p r k d where r k a r k p and r k d are active potential and degraded resources respectively active resource is a resource available for consumption potential resource is a resource that can be restored from degraded resource and turn into the active form degraded resource cannot be used by beavers it is a product of consumption process by beavers in nature the state of these resources is dependent on the habitat conditions interchanges of periods with beavers and those without them logofet et al 2015 zavyalov et al 2016 assumption 3 in the model the rate f x of beaver population increase depends on the amount x of active resource available for one individual x r k a p k where p k p k 1 p k 2 p k is the total of two beaver population sizes and p k 1 p k 2 are population sizes of species 1 native and species 2 alien at time k respectively the rate f x is constrained in such a way that the function 1 f x the population growth rate is bounded continuous and monotone increasing for all x 0 guaranteeing zero or positive values fig 3 shows a qualitative pattern of the beaver population increase coefficient f x as a function of x assumption 4 since the absolute values of resources are commonly difficult to obtain in the field the proposed model uses the relative values measured as fractions of the total resource it means that r 1 ensuing from assumptions 1 4 the parametric discrete time model describing the development of competitive relations between two beaver species takes on the following form 1 p k 1 1 p k 1 f r k a p k q 1 p k 1 p k 1 2 p k 2 f r k a p k q 2 p k 2 r k 1 a r k a q 6 1 p k 1 q 6 2 p k 2 q 5 r k p r k 1 p r k p q 5 r k p q 7 r k d r k d 1 r k a r k p k 0 1 2 f x q q 2 q 1 q 2 x q 3 q 4 2 x q 3 2 q 1 q 1 1 q 2 1 q 3 1 q 4 1 q 2 q 1 2 q 2 2 q 3 2 q 4 2 q q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 here p k 1 p k 2 r k a r k p and r k d are the numbers of beavers of the 1 st cf and 2nd cc species the levels of active potential and degraded resources at the kth year respectively f x q f x q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 is a parametric model of the rate of population increase depending on the level of the active resource per beaver where x r k a p k q is a vector of model parameters q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 petrosyan et al 2013 model 1 includes the following parameters q 1 is the maximal value of the population increase rate when the relative active resource tends to 1 q 2 is the population increase rate when the level of active resource per individual coincides with the optimal level under particular environmental conditions where always q 2 q 1 q 3 is the threshold of per capita active resources at which the pattern of population increase rate alters q 4 is the parameter determining the steepness of function f x q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 at the inflection point the value of the derivative w r t x which is reached at x q 3 the value of the derivative at this point equals q 1 q 2 q 4 q 5 is the fraction of the potential resource that transforms into the active form for a year i е the intensity of resource restoration q 6 is the fraction of the active resource utilized by an individual and thus transformed into the degraded recourse q 7 is the fraction of the degraded resource transforming into the potential resource for a year all the above parameters of the model can take only positive values except for the parameter q 4 due to their physical meanings further we can assume that the parameters q 4 i i 1 2 take nonnegative values since function f x q 1 i q 2 i q 3 i q 4 i depends on them however parameter q 4 i cannot be equal to 0 indeed according to assumption 3 function f x q 1 i q 2 i q 3 i q 4 i should be continuous for all x while it displays a jump discontinuity at x q 3 i when q 4 i 0 thus we can consider all the parameters of system 1 to take positive values also parameters q 5 q 6 q 7 of the beaver environment should not exceed 1 as fractions to have f x q 1 i q 2 i q 3 i q 4 i monotone increasing it is necessary and sufficient to meet the following condition q 1 i q 2 i according to assumption 3 the following conditions should be met 2 q 2 i q 1 i q 3 i q 3 i q 3 i 2 q 4 i 2 q 2 i q 3 i 2 q 4 i 2 q 3 i q 3 i 2 q 4 i 2 i 1 2 analysis of competitive interactions we analyze the population dynamics of competing cc and cf species via stationary solutions of system 1 stationary solutions are obtained in the traditional way i e by looking for the solutions that are constant over time then investigating their asymptotic stability by the lyapunov method in the first approximation additionally the two species model 1 is used to carry out computer experiments the population q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 and resource q 5 q 6 q 7 parameters for cf are taken from the single species model based on the long term monitoring data on cf population dynamics in 6 nature reserves petrosyan et al 2016 the parameters for cc are determined from conditions 2 and a 11 see appendix parameters q 1 and q 2 for cc are calculated from the fecundity ratio f rat of cc to cf averaged to 1 67 2sd 0 346 lavrov 1960 lathi helminen 1974 kanshiev 1983 rosell parker 1995 danilov 2009 danilov et al 2011 parker et al 2012 the other parameters of the model q 3 q 4 q 5 q 6 q 7 do not differ between cf and cc in our computer experiments in all the computer experiments the initial abundance of cf is equal to the equilibrium level cf obtained in a single species model petrosyan et al 2016 or to the maximum value of the population size cf during the monitoring period if cf cf such an approach is necessary to simulate conditions for the introduction of alien cc into the habitats of cf cc beavers are introduced by groups varying from 2 to 24 beavers at a step of two individuals 2 4 6 24 for each scenario of introduction we determine the duration from the moment of cc introduction until the phase of competitive cf exclusion by cc for the odd numbers of 3 5 7 23 of introduced cс beavers the duration of the coexistence phase for all reserves are established based on nonlinear regression models rm using the estimates for even cc numbers we evaluate the suitability of these models using residual analysis it means that the fitted curves are considered acceptable if we cannot reject the following statistical hypotheses 1 that the average values equal zero and 2 that the residuals obey a normal distribution according to the kolmogorov smirnov shapiro wilk and watson tests these curves adequately describe the relationships between the number of introduced cc beavers and the duration of the two species coexistence in nature reserves results the analysis has revealed that the system of eq 1 has a stationary time independent solution p c 1 p c 2 r c a r c p r d d 1 r c a r c p this solution must be consistent with the following system of algebraic equations 3 q 2 1 q 1 1 q 2 1 r c a q 3 1 p c q 4 1 p c 2 r c a q 3 1 p c 2 p c 1 0 q 2 2 q 1 2 q 2 2 r c a q 3 2 p c q 4 2 p c 2 r c

the characteristics of all possible stationary solutions of system 1 are given below case 1 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 such a stationary solution is unstable it means that the populations of two beaver species of cannot go extinct simultaneously case 2 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 in order that stationary population sizes exist for both species it is necessary that all the q parameters be equal between the species which is practically improbable see appendix case 3 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 if the two species have identical death rates but their fecundities are different the positive equilibrium population size cannot be realized for the species cf with lesser fecundity case 4 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 the zero equilibrium population size of the first species cf is asymptotically stable for all studied reserves see appendix i e if the two beavers species have similar death rates then the positive stationary population size of the species cc with higher growth rate fecundity can be realized sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the unique stationary solution in the above form are presented in the appendix the analysis of stationary solutions has shown that in general for any values of demographic and resource parameters that meet condition 2 the competitive exclusion does occur which illustrates the gause 1934 exclusion principle in other words if two species use the same food resources and occupy the same habitat the cc population grows faster thus constraining the cf population growth therefore if environmental conditions are stable the cf population may get extinct however the duration of coexistence and the rate of cf exclusion depend on the initial abundances of both species their demographic parameters and resource parameters the rates of cf exclusion have been established under various environmental conditions in the computer experiments the initial numbers of introduced cc individuals vary from 2 to 24 for each reserve fig 4 shows the duration of species coexistence phase until the onset of the cf exclusion phase in 6 reserves at different initial abundances of beaver populations model parameters for different reserves are presented in table 3 they have been used in all the subsequent computer experiments the analysis has shown that there are no causes for rejecting the hypotheses about the normal distribution of residuals with zero arithmetic average for all models of regression table 4 i e these curves accurately illustrate the coexistence duration depending on the number of introduced cc individuals in different reserves the dynamics of beaver population sizes for the case when cc 12 is given in fig 5 in lnr as shown in fig 4a the duration of cf exclusion depends on the initial abundance and varies within a wide range from 5 to 63 years in particular at the initial abundance of cf equal to 25 ind and that of cc equal to 12 ind the populations of both species increase at first following the irruptive pattern of development fig 5а in this case cc begins to suppress cf after 31 years such a pattern of both species development of has been observed at all tested initial population sizes in the computer experiments i e cf 25 cc 2 4 24 ind and for the set of q parameters see table 3 therefore the pattern of the alien cс population development in lnr does not significantly differ from that of cf in the single species case petrosyan et al 2016 when the initial cc population consists of 24 ind carrying capacity level cf is excluded faster for 5 years the habitat capacity measured by the q parameters can support 26 cc ind on the average with insignificant fluctuations from 23 to 31 individuals hereafter the carrying capacity equals the equilibrium number of beavers which has been determined from a single species model petrosyan et al 2016 in dnr the duration of cf exclusion phase depends on the initial abundance of both species as a nonlinear function r2 99 2 fig 4b when the initial number of cf beavers equals 250 of cc beavers equals 2 4 24 the duration of coexistence phase until the beginning of exclusion phase equals 133 116 66 years respectively if the initial number of cf 250 ind and that of cc 12 ind the coexistence phase duration until the beginning of exclusion phase equals 83 years fig 5b petrosyan et al 2016 indicated that the cf population growth rate in the dnr exhibits a multistep pattern with quasi periodic oscillations fig 5b illustrates the growth pattern of the cc population that pertains for all the tested initial cc population sizes the habitat capacity measured by the q parameters for cf can support on average 713 22 cc ind at the end of the computer experiment in cfnr how the duration of coexistence phase depends on the initial population sizes is also described by a nonlinear function r2 99 9 fig 4c yet in this reserve cf is displaced markedly slower fig 4c if in particular the initial cf population size is 350 ind fig 5c that of cc equals 2 4 24 ind then the eurasian beaver extinction will begin after 152 133 80 years respectively fig 5c shows that the cc population dynamics starting with 350 ind of cf and 12 ind of cc is following a multistep pattern petrosyan et al 2016 indicated that cf population dynamics was similar in a single species case for this reserve the capacity of this reserve habitat measured by the q parameters can support 316 120 beavers in ptnr if the cf initial population size equals 45 ind fig 5d and that of cс equals 2 4 24 then the duration of coexistence phase depends on the cc initial population size as a nonlinear function r2 99 7 fig 4d cf would be excluded after 389 300 70 years in accordance with the introduced numbers of cc beavers if 12 cc individuals are introduced the cf exclusion will start after 146 years fig 5d petrosyan et al 2013 2016 showed that cf population dynamics in ptnr followed a one step pattern with quasi periodic oscillations and the capacity of its habitat measured by the q parameters table 3 can support 42 3 cc ind in this reserve in onr the dependence of the coexistence duration on the initial beaver population sizes is also nonlinear r2 98 9 fig 4e if the initial population sizes are 300 ind for cf and 2 4 24 ind for cc the exclusion phase will begin after 132 115 68 years respectively in contrast to the other reserves the cc population growth in onr is properly approximated by a logistic curve fig 5e the pattern at the other initial population sizes being similar the onr habitat capacity measured by the q parameters for cf population can support 474 127 beavers the knr data also give evidences of a nonlinear dependence of the coexistence phase duration on the initial beaver abundances r2 99 3 fig 4f if the initial cf population size equals 350 ind the initial cc population size equals 2 4 24 the exclusion phase will begin after 108 92 60 years in accordance with cc initial numbers respectively fig 5f demonstrates that the phase of two species coexistence lasts about 70 years besides the dynamics of cc population growth rate follows a multistep pattern at the other initial population sizes too the knr carrying capacity measured by the q parameters can reach 781 124 beavers we have analyzed the stationary solutions cases 3 4 see appendix assuming that the death rates of both species are equal unfortunately there is little published data for comparison the annual death rate in a sustainable cc population is 26 30 the death rate of adults above 2 5 years is 30 32 during the first year of life the death rate is the least owing to the protection of young individuals in the parental colony during the second year of life it is about 40 since the yearlings begin to disperse leaving the parental colony during the following 2 years when the beavers spread along new habitats and their individual mass continuously increases the death rate also amounts to about 40 when the individual growth ceases at the age of 4 5 10 5 years the death rate decreases down to about 20 the annual death rate is similar for males and females the main causes of natural death for cc are wolf predation tularemia shortage of food and intraspecific fights payne 1989 there are few data on the cf death rates in voronezh reserve during the period of 1937 1963 the age composition of dead beavers n 192 distributed as follows 57 of adults 26 of yearlings and two year old beavers and 17 of under yearlings in knr for the same period n 55 these estimates constituted 38 42 and 20 respectively d yakov 1975 during the same period in voronezh reserve approximately 2 of the average annual number of beavers died barabash nikiforov et al 1961 the main causes of beaver death in voronezh reserve were beaver bites during their fights predator attacks and natural disasters in knr they were natural disasters poaching predators and beaver bites d yakov 1975 in onr 47 deaths of beavers were recorded in 1967 1972 the main natural causes of those deaths were beaver bites natural disasters asphyxiation under ice hunger and predator attacks kudryashov 1975 the main difference in death rates between the two species is likely their different resistances to tularemia while the high cf resistance to tularemia was shown both in field studies borodina 1966 and in experimental research barabash nikiforov et al 1961 cc is on the contrary known to be vulnerable to this disease cases of its mass death were recorded repeatedly novak et al 1987 if the death rates of the species are different the higher fecundity of cc can be counter balanced by its greater death rate providing a long term coexistence of two species model prediction of this case is shown in fig 6 figs 6a f indicate that the introduction of 12 cc individuals in lnr dnr ptnr cfnr onr and knr provides eventually the equilibrium population size of cf equal to 10 36 17 14 25 and 16 ind respectively our computer experiments show that cc can long survive in all the reserves if the death rate is sufficiently high discussion the long term data on cf population dynamics in lapland darwin central forest prioksko terrasny oka and khoper reserves located in the northern central and southern parts of this species range in european russia were used earlier in a single species population model for the eurasian beaver zavyalov et al 2015 european beaver 2012 petrosyan et al 2016 the single species model revealed four patterns of the beaver population dynamics namely irruptive lnr single step with quasi periodic oscillations ptnr multistep with quasi periodic oscillations dnr cfnr knr and periodic oscillations around a logistic growth curve single species model could predict the main patterns of cf populations dynamics in different habitats we have modified it to analyze the competitive interactions between two beaver species during their coexistence the advantages of the two species model are the following 1 this model involves interactions of both species with environmental conditions including the intensity of exploitation usage degradation and regeneration resources 2 our long term monitoring data 50 70 years on the beaver populations in six natural reserves and the parameters of the single and two species models allow us to describe the main patterns of cf and cc population dynamics under competitive interactions between two species 3 while our single species model can assess the demographic q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 and environmental q 5 q 6 q 7 parameters on the basis of the long term monitoring data on the cf populations the two species model can assess these parameters for cf and cc the parameters q 1 q 2 and q 1 q 2 are measured by means of available data on the fecundity and family sizes of both species for example the average family size of cf is 3 8 se 1 0 n 13 studies range 2 4 5 5 ind and that of cс is 5 2 se 1 4 n 51 studies range 2 7 9 2 ind rosell parker 1995 parker et al 2012 parker et al 2012 concluded in their review that the mean foetus number was less for cf 2 5 than for cc 4 0 and it was supported by pyotr i danilov s data danilov 1995 ruusila et al 2000 who found that the litter size of cf 1 9 and that of cc 3 2 the average size of cc kit was reported 4 7 n 9 in finland lathi helminen 1974 and 3 3 n 87 in karelia danilov 2009 the analysis of a large set of data on the fecundity of beavers cf n 896 cc n 1080 evidenced that the cc fecundity on average 3 27 min max 1 12 embryos per female is higher than that in cf on average 2 92 min max 1 9 kanshiev 1983 danilov 2009 in addition danilov et al 2011 showed that fecundity is one of the greatest distinctions in the reproductive biology of the cc it is much higher in cc than in cf the fecundity of cc 4 0 maximum foetuses 12 the fecundity of cf 2 2 maximum foetuses 6 the higher fecundity of cс 2 86 kits per female than that of cf 1 93 kits per female was also documented for beavers in captivity of voronezh nature reserve lavrov 1960 4 in the model two species have identical environmental parameters q 5 q 6 q 7 in accordance with published data reserchers formerly argued that the cc builder activity is more effective and that cc is better adapted to critical environmental conditions and more often feeds on grey alder alnus incana ruusila 1997 danilov kan shiev 1983 however the current data demonstrate no differences in their building activity and diet both species likely occupy the same ecological niche danilov et al 2011 danilov fedorov 2015 we divide population dynamics into two phases after cc introduction into habitats occupied by cf during the first phase the cc population size increases while the number cf beavers decreases the abundance of cc is less than that of cf throughout the first phase hence this stage can be called the species coexistence phase after this phase the cc population size becomes equal to that of cf afterwards cc begins to suppress cf while cf is dying out the population size of cc is tending to a level in accordance with habitat capacity measured by the q parameters by the end of the second stage cc excludes cf completely cf suffers extinction while the abundance of the other species establishes at the maximal level determined by the habitat carrying capacity that is described by the q parameters we call the second period as competitive exclusion phase in simulation experiments the number of introduced cc individuals has varied from 2 to 24 such a size of the introduced beaver group corresponds to the number of beavers reintroduced in eurasia last century in particular 14 kataev 2015 8 korablev et al 2011 4 zavyalov et al 2010 23 kudryashov 1975 and 22 d yakov 1975 cf ind were released into lnr cfnr ptnr onr and knr respectively seven cc beavers and 19 cf ones lathi helminen 1974 were introduced in finland in 1935 1937 in 1998 and 1999 40 and 12 cf ind were released in belgium respectively halley rosell 2002 in france cf were introduced in groups including 3 to 21 beavers totally 273 cf ind between 1957 and 1988 dewas et al 2012 the population dynamics predicted by our model in lnr which is characterized by extreme environmental conditions demonstrates that after the introduction of 2 24 cc individuals the phase of coexistence lasts from 63 to 5 years the maximum number of cc individuals during the phase of competitive exclusion does not exceed 30 ind fig 5a these estimates confirm the results of repeated cc introductions into similar ecological conditions in the north west of finland where the current population of cc did not exceed 50 ind lathi helminen 1974 parker et al 2012 the outcome of our computational experiments shows that for different initial numbers of cc the predicted population growth is always irruptive similar patterns of population dynamics were observed for cf in two regions of sweden hartman 2003 and in lnr petrosyan et al 2016 noteworthy is that when 24 ind of cc were introduced the phase of coexistence lasted 5 years i e this phase involved 2 3 generations published data indicate that cс more frequently develop to maturity at the end of their second year of life as compared to cf henry bookhout 1969 danilov 2009 since environmental conditions in ptnr are unfavorable the duration of cf exclusion phase should last longer than in the other study reserves fig 4d in this reserve the model predicts that cf population dynamics for single species community tends to equilibrium state with quasi periodic oscillations with periods of 14 26 years petrosyan et al 2013 fig 5d shows that after the introduction of 12 cc individuals the cf population size decreases according to quasi periodical oscillations in this case cc can exclude cf for 400 years the population of cc on the contrary grows with a linear trend and small oscillations yet the quasi periodicity in cc population dynamics is not well expressed the relations between two species during their coexistence phase depend on the q parameters that describe the habitat carrying capacity in the suboptimal habitats of dnr two species coexisted for 136 66 years after the introduction of 2 to 24 of cс individuals fig 4b the model shows that cf gets extinct when cc reaches the first step of its population growth a multistep pattern of population dynamics was first found for cf in this reserve petrosyan et al 2016 yet this pattern is better expressed in cc population dynamics in cfnr and knr suboptimal habitats cf is displaced by cc at all the tested initial numbers of introduced cc individuals fig 4с f much faster than in ptnr fig 4d due to the high rate of food resource renewal in particular when 12 ind of cc are introduced the two beaver species coexist for 100 years in cfnr and 71 years in knr in cfnr and knr the model also predicts the multistep population dynamics similar to that in dnr fig 5c f in knr the multistep growth of cc population is very distict the population reaches the first step for 25 years after the introduction while in cfnr it takes 150 years noteworthy is that the multistep pattern of cc population dynamics is more expressed than that of cf in favorable conditions of onr cf is displaced fairly quickly too at all initial numbers of cc individuals varying from 2 to 24 fig 4e in this reserve cc population dynamics in contrast to other studied reserves demonstrates logistic oscillatory growth see fig 5e logistic curve and the pattern is similar for other initial population sizes the phase of coexistence lasts about 85 years in onr at 12 initial cc individuals the model shows fig 5 that if 12 beavers of cc are introduced the phase of cf and cc coexistence would take 31 71 83 85 100 and 146 years in lnr knr dnr onr cfnr and ptnr respectively we relate the high rate of competitive exclusion in lnr to its extremely low carrying capacity for beavers because of the long regeneration time of trees and shrubs in the far north the moderate rates of competitive exclusion in the last four reserves are provided by sufficient availability of food resources however in ptnr the food resources for beavers are rather scarce zavyalov et al 2010 yet the predicted rate of the competitive exclusion is quite low about 146 years there may be several reasons for this phenomenon first beaver food resources restore faster in ptnr compared to lnr and previously abandoned habitats are repopulated after four years zavyalov et al 2016 in contrast the restoration of woody vegetation in lnr lasts at least 50 years kataev 2011 second beavers in ptnr frequently change their habitats sometimes several times a year zavyalov et al 2016 therefore there will be hard for cc to settle if all suitable habitats are already occupied third the beavers demonstrate high building activity in ptnr they continuously create new dams and repair old ones numerous dams remain long after beavers abandon the habitat goryainova et al 2014 zavyalov et al 2016 it is known that all these factors can ultimately enlarge carrying capacity for beavers logofet et al 2015 thus even under the current scarcity of food resources owing to long term exploitation by beavers the carrying capacity in ptnr is higher than in lnr and the environmental conditions for beaver development are much better the model results indicate that cc would penetrate the cf range diffusively the rate of cc penetration into the central part of the cf range is still unknown the rate of dispersal among vacant habitats is similar in both species danilov et al 2007 the following patterns of beaver migrations are distinguished short term migrations of yearlings dispersals of animals at the age of 2 creating new colonies migrations of the whole colonies to the other water bodies within their ranges individual migrations of adults that lost their partners the distance of beaver migrations varies greatly and it frequently depends on the availability of favorable and free habitats the direction of migration can be either upstream or downstream beavers are also able to overcome watersheds overland the distances of migrations in uninhabited areas are commonly greater than within habitats with established populations saveliev et al 2010 since the cc dispersals were analyzed in inhabited areas their pattern can differ from that among free habitats thefore cc would likely migrate from the north to the south of european russia in general we suggest that vacant habitats are the most vulnerable to cc colonization while favourable areas are more resistent cf populations might remain as a number of isolated populations within the current range of this species the model predicts that cc would displace cf in all the study reserves located in different ecological conditions in the northern central and southern parts of the cf current range however if the cc death rate is high enough to counter balance the high cc birth rate then a long term coexistence of both species is likely nevertheless the equality of death rate and birth rate may not be sufficient for their coexistence in some cases since cc mature earlier than cf which gives another advantage of cc over cf although cf sexually matures at the end of the second year of life only a small share of young animals participate in reproduction in voronezh reserve this share did not exceed 8 10 lavrov 1956 1981 it is 12 in knr d yakov 1975 7 in onr kudryashov 1975 6 6 in the leningrad oblast and the south of karelia kanshiev 1983 on the contrary osborn 1953 indicated that 21 2 of cc females start reproduction at the age of 1 5 2 years to conclude complex models are very useful to predict the consequences of alien species invasions under different environmental conditions and at various initial numbers of individuals the suggested two species model can predict population dynamics of the two beaver species if we know environmental conditions the initial population sizes and the duration of their coexistence for example 2 8 ind of cc from finland were introduced into the vacant habitats in bavaria in 1972 see introduction then by 1997 cc population could have reached 266 34 ind if the ecological conditions for beavers in bavaria had been suboptimal i e similar to those in dnr cfnr and knr if the conditions had been optimal the population size could be 577 87 ind if the minimum cc population growth rate in bavaria had been equal to that in finland known from the real monitoring data lathi helminen 1974 for 25 years then cc population size could reach 550 50 individuals these estimates enable us to predict a likely secondary source of cc invasion that could have formed in bavaria by 1997 it was likely that the beavers from such a source were removed and introduced into other european countries in 1998 2002 the 66 cc individuals that were detected removed sterilized or transferred to zoos in germany rlp nrw france belgium and luxembourg dewas et al 2012 frosch et al 2014 constituted about 12 of the population size predicted by the model our model predicts that if strategic plans for the eradication of the north american beaver including recommendations of parker et al 2012 are not accepted the eurasian beaver will likely get extinct in a significant part of its restored range in the 21 st century the history of biological invasions has well demonstrated that in spite of certain success in reintroduction and restoration of some species there can be serious negative consequences for native species especially those that are ecologically close to invaders for example the american mink neovison vison schreber 1777 intentionally introduced into various regions of western europe in 1920 1930 and russia in 1928 was successfully naturalized currently its range extends across eurasia from the atlantic to the pacific and nearly reaches the maximum possible frontiers khlyap et al 2011 bonesi tom 2012 the american mink has replaced the european mink mustela lutreola l 1761 almost everywhere maran henttonen 1995 tumanov 2009 its further population growth in the north west of russia might negatively affect the state of small populations of the native european mink bobrov et al 2008 there are some more alien species that have caused similar negative effects in europe in particular the eastern grey squirrel sciurus carolinensis gmelin 1788 has gradually excluded the native red squirrel s vulgaris l 1758 in the uk and italy wauters et al 2002 martinoli et al 2010 conclusions ecological and biological similarities between the two beaver species can result in the competitive exclusion of one of them since cc was shown to have higher fecundity larger family size and early sexual maturation it is likely to be superior over cf and to exclude cf when they compete despite the similarities in the life span and population age structure one of the top priorities for the conservation of the eurasian beaver at the continental national and regional levels is to develop an international program for monitoring the status of cc populations in eurasia such a program should comprise the strategies developed by the international scientific communities such as aichi biodiversity target 9 convention on biological diversity 2001 and eu biodiversity strategy 2020 target 5 european commission 2011 including the measures to constrain population sizes of the north american beaver to reduce its ranges and at the slightest threat to completely eradicate it the necessity of such a program is dictated by the obligations arisen from the international treaties on biodiversity conservation and especially from the aichi biodiversity target 9 by 2020 invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized priority species are controlled or eradicated and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment convention on biological diversity 2001 acknowledgements we are thankful to all the staff of nature reserves for their assistance in creating the databases

analysis of stationary solutions asymptotic stability of the stationary solutions is studied by the lyapunov method in the first approximation stability theory of finite difference equations e g romanko 2012 states that for stability of a stationary solution it is necessary that the eigenvalues of the jacobi matrix derived for the stationary solution do not exceed 1 in absolute value moreover if all the eigenvalues are strictly less than one the stationary solution is asymptotically stable if at least one eigenvalue is strictly greater than one the stationary solution is unstable case 1 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 since q 5 0 and q 7 0 using eq 3 we can derive that r c a 1 r c p r c d 0 with respect to the system of eq 1 the jacobi matrix derived for the stationary solution can be written as follows a 1 a φ p 1 p 1 φ p 1 p 2 φ p 1 r a φ p 1 r p φ p 2 p 1 φ p 2 p 2 φ p 2 r a φ p 2 r p φ r a p 1 φ r a p 2 φ r a r a φ r a r p φ r p p 1 φ r p p 2 φ r p r a φ r p r p c 1 q 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 q 1 2 0 0 q 6 1 q 6 2 1 q 5 0 0 q 7 1 q 5 q 7 where φ p 1 φ p 2 φ r a φ r p are the right hand sides of the first second third and fourth equations of system 1 respectively c means that the partial derivatives of the right hand sides w r t its variables are calculated at the stationary solution the characteristic equation to determine the eigenvalues of matrix a 1 takes on the following form a 2 det a λ e 1 q 1 1 λ 1 q 1 2 λ 1 λ 1 q 5 q 7 λ q 5 q 7 0 the eigenvalues are found as follows a 3 λ 1 1 q 1 1 λ 2 1 q 1 2 λ 3 1 q 5 λ 4 1 q 7 hence it follows from q 1 1 0 and q 1 2 0 see model that λ 1 1 and λ 2 1 and consequently the stationary solution is unstable it means that the populations of two species cannot get extinct simultaneously case 2 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 in this case system 3 reduces to a 4 q 2 1 q 1 1 q 2 1 x c q 3 1 q 4 1 2 x c q 3 1 2 0 q 2 2 q 1 2 q 2 2 x c q 3 2 q 4 2 2 x c q 3 2 2 0 q 6 1 p c 1 q 6 2 p c 2 q 5 r c p 0 q 5 r c p q 7 r c d 0 r c d 1 r c a r c p p c p c 1 p c 2 x c r c a p c it follows from a 4 that the first two equations depend only on the value of x c r c a p c 1 p c 2 to be found it means that x c must simultaneously obey the first two equations differing from each other only by the set of q parameters for different beaver species after solving the first and second equations of a 4 we obtain a 5 x c q 3 1 q 2 1 q 4 1 q 1 1 q 1 1 2 q 2 1 q 3 2 q 2 2 q 4 2 q 1 2 q 1 2 2 q 2 2 according to a 5 the existence of stationary solution p c 1 0 p c 2 0 implies the following condition equality for the q parameters of beaver species 1 and 2 a 6 q 3 1 q 2 1 q 4 1 q 1 1 q 1 1 2 q 2 1 q 3 2 q 2 2 q 4 2 q 1 2 q 1 2 2 q 2 2 since the restriction on the parameters of the model in the form of equality a 6 for arbitrary parameters of the two beaver species is unlikely in nature the stationary solution p c 1 0 p c 2 0 can hardly be realized case 3 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 it is necessary and sufficient for the stationary solution to exist if the following condition is satisfied petrosyan et al 2013 a 7 q 3 1 q 6 1 q 5 q 6 1 q 7 q 1 1 q 1 1 2 q 2 1 q 2 1 q 4 1 0 moreover petrosyan et al 2013 showed that there is only one stationary solution p c 1 0 if condition a 7 is satisfied the stationary values of the beaver population sizes and resources are found as follows a 8 p c 1 q 1 1 q 1 1 2 q 2 1 q 3 1 q 6 1 q 5 q 6 1 q 7 q 1 1 q 1 1 2 q 2 1 q 2 1 q 4 1 r c a 1 q 6 1 q 5 q 6 1 q 7 p c 1 r c p q 6 1 q 5 p c 1 r c d q 6 1 q 7 p c 1 in this case see case 1 the following matrix can be obtained by rearranging the two first rows and columns of the jacobi matrix since rearranging rows and columns does not change the eigenvalues a 9 a 1 f r c a p c 1 q 2 0 0 0 f q 1 r c a p c 1 1 f q 1 r c a p c 1 f q 1 0 q 6 2 q 6 1 1 q 5 0 0 q 7 1 q 5 q 7 q 1 q 1 1 q 2 1 q 3 1 q 4 1 q 2 q 1 2 q 2 2 q 3 2 q 4 2 q q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 f x q q 2 q 1 q 2 x q 3 q 4 2 x q 3 2 f q q 1 q 1 2 q 2 3 2 q 4 q 1 q 2 2 matrix a 9 has one real eigenvalue equal to a 10 λ 1 1 f r c a p c 1 q 2 1 q 2 2 q 1 2 q 2 2 x c q 3 2 q 4 2 2 x c q 3 2 2 x c r c a p c 1 here as before and further we assume that the death rates of both beaver species are identical and their fecundity rates do not change with time this means that the q parameters of model 1 are related as a 11 q 3 2 q 3 1 q 4 2 q 4 1 q 1 2 q 1 1 δ b q 2 2 q 2 1 δ b since we have p c p c 1 0 p c 2 0 it follows from 3 and a 10 that a 12 λ 1 1 δ b q 2 1 q 1 1 q 2 1 x c q 3 1 q 4 1 2 x c q 3 1 2 1 δ b x c r c a p c 1 since δ b 0 here as the fecundity of cc is greater than cf q 1 2 q 1 1 q 2 2 q 2 1 matrix a 9 has one real eigenvalue strictly greater than 1 consequently the stationary solution is asymptotically unstable according to lyapunov s theorem romanko 2012 in other words if two species have similar death rates the positive stationary population size of the species with lower growth rate fecundity cannot be realized case 4 p c 1 0 p c 2 0 in this case all the assumptions and restrictions are the same as in case 3 therefore all the formulas and results obtained in case 3 are applicable in this case with only small change i e the upper scripts 1 and 2 must be permuted in these formulas and results the jacobi matrix derived for the stationary solution the q parameters of model 1 and the eigenvalue are determined as follows see a 13 a 14 a 15 a 13 a 1 f r c a p c 2 q 1 0 0 0 f q 2 r c a p c 2 1 f q 2 r c a p c 2 f q 2 0 q 6 1 q 6 2 1 q 5 0 0 q 7 1 q 5 q 7 q 1 q 1 1 q 2 1 q 3 1 q 4 1 q 2 q 1 2 q 2 2 q 3 2 q 4 2 q q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 f x q q 2 q 1 q 2 x q 3 q 4 2 x q 3 2 f q q 1 q 1 2 q 2 3 2 q 4 q 1 q 2 2 a 14 q 3 1 q 3 2 q 4 1 q 4 2 q 1 1 q 1 2 δ b q 2 1 q 2 2 δ b a 15 λ 1 1 δ b q 2 2 q 1 2 q 2 2 x c q 3 2 q 4 2 2 x c q 3 2 2 1 δ b x c r c a p c 2 since δ b 0 here as the growth rate fecundity of cf is lower than cc q 1 1 q 1 2 q 2 1 q 2 2 the eigenvalue is strictly less than 1 it means that the stationary solution with p c 1 0 may be asymptotically stable the stationary solution p c 2 0 according to petrosyan et al 2013 does exist if and only if the following condition holds true a 16 q 3 2 q 6 2 q 5 q 6 2 q 7 q 1 2 q 1 2 2 q 2 2 q 2 2 q 4 2 0 if condition a 16 is satisfied the stationary values of the beaver population sizes and resources are found as follows a 17 p c 2 q 1 2 q 1 2 2 q 2 2 q 3 2 q 6 2 q 5 q 6 2 q 7 2 q 1 2 q 1 2 2 q 2 2 q 2 2 q 4 2 p c 1 0 r c a 1 q 6 2 q 5 q 6 2 q 7 p c 2 r c p q 6 2 q 5 p c 2 r c d q 6 2 q 7 p c 2 in general if condition a 16 is not met then the stationary solution does not exist it means that the number of cс beavers would change with time without tending to a nonzero stationary value the same would happen if a stationary solution exists but is not stable since condition a 16 is actually satisfied for all reserves we use computational experiments to illustrate the conditions under which all the eigenvalues of matrix a 13 are less than 1 by module outcome of the analysis has shown that in the case when the death rates of both species are not different the fecundity of cc is greater than that of cf and the condition a 16 is satisfied then the stationary population sizes of the both species can be represented by means of a 17 for the asymptotical stability analysis the eigenvalues λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ 4 of matrix a 13 have been calculated these values characterize the steady states of system 1 and they are presented in table a1 for each of the reserves table a1 shows that the eigenvalues λ 1 have real positive values for all the reserves and the eigenvalues that are expressed by complexly conjugated numbers are found for the lnr dnr cfnr and pntr for the other reserves onr and knr all the eigenvalues are less than 1 so the steady solution is stable and the periodic component is absent the solution of the equations of population dynamics for the lnr dnr cfnr and pntr has a periodic component and steady solutions are also stable the maximum absolute values of the eigenvalues are less than 1 table a1 outcomes show that for the stationary solution to be asymptotically stable asss in dnr onr and knr it is necessary that the values of f rat be equal or over 1 57 1 31 and 1 22 respectively table a1 for the three remaining reserves lnr cfnr and ptnr the asss is realized for the following values of f rat 1 17 1 16 and 1 15 respectively it means that for lnr cfnr and ptr which feature the smallest forage resources the minimal difference in f rat is enough for asss in contrast for dnr onr and knr reserves with maximum feed resources the greatest value of f rat difference is needed for asss 
25006,dryland in xinjiang china has been threatened in recent decades by rapid climate change however due to large uncertainties in spatial climate datasets the impacts of climate change and rising co2 on net primary productivity npp in xinjiang have remained unclear these uncertainties in climate will inevitably lead to uncertainties in model estimated npp in xinjiang the uncertainties can be assessed by running an arid ecosystem model aem using multiple climate datasets such an approach allows to disentangle the relative contributions of individual climate factors on npp change using numerical simulations and factorial analysis the average annual npp for xinjiang from 2000 to 2014 was 155 90 2 74 g c m2 year 189 99 1 80 g c m2 year 213 04 8 93 g c m2 year by using the merra era interim and cfsr datasets respectively to drive aem our multiple simulations show a consistent temporal pattern of the regional npp during 2000 2014 that increased during 2008 2011 and decreased during 2005 2006 and 2013 2014 however we found large uncertainties in the spatial pattern of npp change during this time particularly in the taklimakan desert and northern xinjiang except for the tacheng where npp increased all simulations indicated that areas surrounding the taklamakan desert and ecosystems at high latitude 47 and northwestern xinjiang were dominated by precipitation change however there are large uncertainties in the dominant climate driver in other areas to assess uncertainties in ecosystem npp assessment efforts should be made to improve the confidence in climate data in the northern xinjiang this can be achieved by establishing more rain gauges keywords multiple datasets arid ecosystem model aem net primary productivity npp climate dominating factors 1 introduction arid ecosystems are threatened by global change shen et al 2009 fang et al 2017 the unique temperate desert ecosystems in the xinjiang province of china located between mongolia and kazakhstan in central asia laurent charvet et al 2002 have been particularly sensitive to the rapid climate change in recent decades zhang and ren 2017 the region s mean temperature increased by more than 0 33 c decade during 1961 2008 zhang et al 2010a much higher than the global land mean warming rate 0 27 c decade ipcc 2007 annual precipitation increased by 9 mm decade a remarkable change for an arid region zhang et al 2010a remote sensing studies indicated that the increased precipitation could have positive effects on biomass and ecosystem productivity in this arid region zhang et al 2016 zhang and ren 2017 it is important to evaluate the stability of xinjiang s dryland in response to the rapid climate change as a useful indicator of ecosystem function net primary productivity npp is a key component of energy and matter transformation in terrestrial ecosystems zhang et al 2007b chen and zhang 2017 local and regional changes in npp caused by climate change are critical in studying relationships between climate and vegetation zhang et al 2010b field experiments have been conducted to investigate ecosystem responses to climate and co2 factors mikkelsen et al 2008 but assessing effects of climate change on npp variability across a large area based on site level findings is difficult because of the spatial heterogeneity of environmental variables and non linear responses of ecosystems zhang et al 2013a yan et al 2015 remote sensing model like casa is a useful tool to detect changes in npp over large areas but it can only reflect overall effects of environmental factors as opposed to isolating effects of individual factors yan et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 fang et al 2017 in comparison process based ecosystem models are useful to understand and predict the ecological processes at local regional continental and global scales zhang et al 2008 piao et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 by conducting numerical experiments model simulation provides an effective approach to isolate the impact of individual factors on npp zhang et al 2014 fang et al 2017 in this study the arid ecosystem model aem which has been developed to capture characteristic dryland processes in northwestern china zhang et al 2013b and has been extensively validated was applied to xinjiang china to investigate the climate change effects on dryland npp li et al 2015 fang et al 2017 based on knowledge gained from field researches on the northern temperate dryland the aem is a process based ecosystem model that couples biophysical processes energy balance and biogeochemical processes carbon and water processes it is a spatial explicit model that uses a daily time step to simulate the impacts of climate change on ecosystem processes specially the aem addresses the structure of dryland vegetation and their energy carbon and water processes by including an improved vertical root distribution module a mechanistic module for water movement along the groundwater soil root canopy continuum and a plant form module that dynamically updates a plant s aboveground structure tree height crown size stem etc on a daily basis it is noteworthy that the accuracies of model outputs are closely related to inputs without high quality climate driver data it is impossible to assess npp dynamics using a modelling approach compared with other regions however ecological studies in xinjiang are challenged by large uncertainties in climate datasets hu et al 2013 in a land area of 1 6 106 km2 there are only 51 qualified i e by the national standard climate stations most of which are concentrated in the low mountain areas or peri desert oases hu et al 2014 2016 as a result there are large uncertainties in the spatiotemporal patterns of climate change and its impacts on ecosystem npp in this region qiu et al 2017 to address the climate uncertainty we used three climate reanalysis datasets to populate the aem model in this study the climate reanalysis data were developed by assimilating the information from ground observations sounding measurements model simulations and satellite observations to synthesize a coherent set of surface and upper air circulation data poccard et al 2000 because these datasets originate from different data sources models deviation correction methods and assimilation systems the reanalysis schemes have different predictions for the same region cheng et al 2013a b hu et al 2016 found that there were significant differences between the three reanalysis datasets in predicting precipitation in central asia the uncertainties in climate will inevitably lead to uncertainties in model estimated npp in xinjiang unfortunately it is difficult to decide which one of the climate datasets performs the best due to the lack of observational data from meteorological stations in the study area lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 in addition it seems that some reanalysis datasets has higher accuracy in predicting air temperature while other datasets has higher accuracy in predicting precipitation in the region hu et al 2014 2016 to assess the impact of climate uncertainty on ecosystem npp we need to identify the relative contributions of each climate factor therefore the objectives of this study were to analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of xinjiang npp over the past 15 years in response to climate change quantify the relative contributions of different climate factors and analyze the uncertainties of the ecosystem productivity in related to uncertainties in climate drivers by comparing the outputs from multiple climate driven model simulations we identified ecologically vulnerable areas with noticeable decline of npp based on the consensus from simulations driven by the three climate datasets and discussed uncertainties in xinjiang s npp dynamics due to uncertainties in climate data by analyzing the differences among the model estimates driven by three different climate datasets 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area xinjiang province is located in northwest china 34 3 49 5 n 73 5 96 3 e it is approximately 1 600 000 km2 accounting for about 1 6 of the area of china fig 1 xinjiang is located in the geographical center of eurasia with mountains bordering xinjiang on three sides the altay to the north the kunlun to the south and the pamir to the west and southwest the tianshan mountain cuts across northern xinjiang between the vast junggar and tarim basins xinjiang is a typical arid and semiarid area it has a continental monsoon climate and is sensitive to global climate change li et al 2011 the annual mean temperature ranges between 9 and 12 and the annual precipitation is 210 mm in northern xinjiang and less than 100 mm in southern xinjiang li et al 2011 the spatial distribution of precipitation is uneven the tianshan mountain has higher precipitation while southern xinjiang has higher water stress the major plant functional types pft and their spatial

capable of making use of groundwater non phreatophytic shrubs nps represented by haloxylon grassland grs cropland crp and alpine meadow mew water and mobile desert areas such as those without vegetation are excluded 2 2 arid ecosystem model aem the aem arid ecosystem model a process based ecosystem model has been used to model plant and canopy structure as well as their effects on coupled carbon c and water processes in dryland ecosystems it is an effective tool for studying the effects of climate change on the carbon cycle in arid and semi arid zones zhang et al 2013b the aem simulates above and below ground plant structures as well as water movement along the groundwater soil plant continuum in the dryland ecosystem yet it retains its general applicability and efficiency to study climate change at regional and global scales the model couples the carbon nitrogen water cycles including biophysical modules vegetation physiological modules soil physics biogeochemistry etc to simulate a variety of environmental factors climate co2 nitrogen deposition groundwater depth detailed description of the model can be found in the appendix 2 3 data sources the meteorological data

concentration data from the us mauna loa observing carbon site http co2now org vegetation in the study area was divided into seven ecosystem types evergreen needleleaf forest deciduous broadleaf

set of parameter according to the 1 1 000 000 chinese vegetation map zhang et al 2007a b c each 50 km 50 km spatial simulation unit grid is composed of various vegetation ecosystem types in different proportions each ecosystem in a grid is simulated independently and their simulation outputs are area weighted and summed up to derive the grid level ecosystem functions npp observations from the literature table 2 were used to evaluate the simulated results of npp in xinjiang the standard npp measurement method as described by whittaker and marks 1975 was used in the field studies first above ground npp was estimated based on the sum of 1 measured or estimated fine litter fall accumulation 2 measured or estimated aboveground biomass increment and 3 estimated losses of biomass to consumers then belowground npp was estimated based on root shoot ratios of the plant functional types studied detailed information of the parameters could be found in su et al 2005 and wang 2015 zhao et al 2009 s data were downloaded from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center daac ornl gov finally the aboveground and belowground npp were added up to derive the total npp 2 4 methods the model simulations were conducted under a spatial resolution of 0 5 for 1980 2014 a spin up run of 1500 years 150 spins 10 year spins was created to prevent any abnormal fluctuation due to the sudden switch from the equilibration state to the transient state to isolate the effects of individual factors precipitation temperature co2 concentration on the npp change in xinjiang five quantitative experiments or scenarios were designed table 3 the temp scenario is a single factor control experiment in which only temperature was allowed to change from year to year with the other climate factors remaining constant the output of the temp scenario indicated the impacts of temperature change from 2000 to 2014 on npp in xinjiang similarly the co2 scenario and prec scenarios are single factor control experiments for the impacts of co2 change and precipitation change respectively the clim scenario simulated the combined effect of temperature and precipitation the overall scenario stands for the combined effects of climate and co2 changes we treated the mean npp under the current climate normal 1981 2010 as the baseline shrestha et al 2012 and compared the mean npp of

the relative humidity and shortwave radiation were among the climate drivers in the clim and overall simulation their effects were not analyzed because previous studies and our preliminary research indicated that the interannual changes in relative humidity and shortwave radiation were small and had relatively weak influences on the dynamics of npp and carbon stock in the study area li et al 2013 zhang and ren 2017 the item in the subscript of npp denotes the period e g mean npp from 2000 to 2014 fang et al 2017 3 results 3 1 evaluation of climate uncertainty on model predicted npp at site level we first evaluated the uncertainties in model simulated npp in response to climate uncertainties as revealed by the three reanalysis climate datasets at the site level there were 21 npp sampling sites for the evaluation table 2 simulations driven by different climate datasets yields different npp results when comparing against field observations the simulations driven by merra and era interim datasets performed well with high r2 values between 0 71 and 0 74 and low rmse values between 88 14 and 93 40 fig 2 a b the simulations driven by cfsr however performed relatively poorly r2 0 60 and rmse 109 79 but were still acceptable in another word there are relatively larger uncertainties in the simulated npp due to the uncertainties in the cfsr dataset 3 2 inter annual variation in npp the average annual npp for xinjiang from 2000 to 2014 was 155 90 2 74 g c m2 year 189 99 1 80 g c m2 year 213 04 8 93 g c m2 year by using the merra era interim and cfsr datasets respectively to drive aem anova showed the estimates based on the cfsr data was significantly higher p value 0 05 than the estimates based on the merra data in response to changes in climate and co2 concentration during 2000 2014 xinjiang s npp was estimated to have decreased by 0 05 tg c year according to the era interim simulation overall scenario but increased by 0 78 tg c year according to the cfsr simulation overall scenario with an averaged npp change of 0 24 0 47 tg c year according to the three overall simulations driven by the three climate datasets simulations driven by all three datasets show npp increased from 2008 to 2011 and decreased from 2005 to 2006 as well as during 2013 2014 yet there is high uncertainty during 2000 2004 when the cfsr simulation shows the npp first decreased then increased while the era interim simulation shows a reverse pattern and the merra simulation shows a stable increase in npp in general the simulations driven by the merra and era interim climate data with similar precipitation patterns fig 3 b predict similar npp dynamics fig 3a although the cfsr has a very similar temperature pattern with the era interim fig 3c their impacts on npp are quite different 3 3 spatial patterns of the npp change in this study 5 g c m2 year to 5 g c m2 year are set as the change thresholds and those that exceed the threshold are counted as change grids fig 4 on average npp increased in more than 41 93 of the study area and decreased by more than 5 g c m2 year in 35 43 of the study area during 2000 2014 fig 4a all three climate datasets predicted an increase of npp over the tacheng and eastern tianshan mountains fig 4a however large uncertainties exist in other regions while the merra and era interim driven simulations indicate no change in the altay region in the northern xinjiang fig 4b c the cfsr simulation shows increased npp in most of these regions fig 4d furthermore the simulations of cfsr and merra do not agree with each other in the surrounding the taklimakan desert in the southern xinjiang the former indicates an npp reduction of more than 25 g c m2 year while the latter indicates that the npp change did not significant increase in most of the area in general npp changes in the southern region have less uncertainty and are either growing or stable during 2000 2014 while large uncertainties exist in the npp dynamics of the northern xinjiang except for the tacheng 3 4 contributions from individual factors and the spatial pattern of dominant climate control over the npp dynamic in xinjiang during 2000 2014 we could isolate the contributions of individual climate or co2 factors using single factor experiments or scenarios fig 5 at the regional scale the simulation results using the three datasets indicated that the atmospheric co2 concentration has been continually increasing this increased npp by about 13 38 29 2 tg c year in xinjiang under the co2 scenario prec experiment results suggests that the npp increased by 16 59 tg c year according to the simulation driven by merra data and decreased 13 33 tg c year and 42 66 tg c year according to the simulations driven by the era interim and cfsr data respectively on average the climate and co2 changes during 2000 2014 have increased npp in xinjiang mainly due to co2 fertilization fig 5 mean results it should be noted that different pft responded very differently to climate change fig 6 the effects of precipitation on forests npp were most significant but can be hardly observed in medow although the atmospheric co2 is assumed to be well mixed different pfts had different sensitivities to elevated co2 in the study period with the most significant fertilization effect found in croplands and the least found in the nps by comparing the effects of different factors we identified dominant factors with the largest impact on npp i e by comparing the changes in npp under the influence of each factor in each 50 km 50 km grid of the study area this allowed us to develop maps that plot dominant climate controls over npp in xinjiang fig 7 using the three meteorological datasets we analyzed the dominant climate controls over npp in xinjiang fig 7 the simulation results from the three datasets show that npp dynamics in the plains were dominated by precipitation especially in southern xinjiang while co2 control was more prominent in mountains area precipitation control was mainly distributed in southern xinjiang especially in aksu area cfsr showed large areas in the northern xinjiang that was dominated by others effect while the other two datasets not found 4 discussion in previous studies we used the aem to assess the responses of ecosystem npp to climate change in arid and semi arid areas of china fang et al 2017 however these studies used a single climate dataset merra to drive the model because china s meteorological stations are relatively sparse in comparison with other regions like europe and north america large uncertainties exist in the accuracy of spatial climatology datasets like merra particularly in arid areas hu et al 2014 these uncertainties in the underlying data could have significant impacts on the predicted ecosystem productivity indeed our study driven by three different climate reanalysis datasets revealed uncertainties in npp we found a generally consistent temporal pattern in simulated npp driven by three climate datasets particularly after 2005 fig 3a however the cfsr simulation predicted a very strong increase in npp after 2008 that was not found in the other two simulations this is due to the overestimation of cfsr s precipitation and the other two datasets which is 170 higher than merra and 76 higher than era interim fig 3b hu et al 2016 found that cfsr may significantly overestimate precipitation in the mountainous central asia drylands which includes our study area particularly after 2003 in fact hu et al 2016 s study showed that precipitation data from cfsr has the lowest accuracy followed by era interim data our evaluation also showed that the npp predicted by cfsr simulations has the smallest correlation with the field observations fig 2 although the cfsr datasets may have slightly higher accuracy than the other two climate datasets in predicting air temperature hu et al 2014 this advantage seemed to have a low impact on the simulated npp in this dryland region however the spatial pattern of npp as predicted by the cfsr simulation seemed to match the satellite retrieved vegetation growth pattern better than the other two datasets the cfsr simulation predicted a significant increase in npp in most areas of northern xinjiang similarly several remote sensing studies observed significant vegetation regrowth in the northern xinjiang in recent decades li et al 2015 in contrast the merra simulation predicted large scale npp decline in northern xinjiang therefore it is difficult to judge which climate dataset is more appropriate for vegetation modelling purposes our study indicated that there were large uncertainties in xinjiang s npp during some periods like 2000 2004 and 2008 2014 fig 3a and in some sub regions like northern xinjiang except for the tacheng fig 4 although the cfsr has a very similar temperature pattern with the era interim fig 3c their impacts on npp are quite different this indicates that the uncertainties in the inter annual dynamics of xinjiang s npp was mainly caused by the uncertainties in the precipitation data rather than the temperature data this finding was also confirmed by the factorial analysis fig 5 the density of rain gauges in xinjiang one of the most remote areas in china is extremely sparse as a result spatially interpolated precipitation datasets like cru are unreliable hu et al 2016 climate reanalysis products like cfsr perform poorly in the mountains because of their coarse spatial resolution these uncertainties in climate datasets limit our ability to assess the climate change effects on the ecosystem dynamics in xinjiang it is therefore extremely important to increase the number of rain gauge stations particularly in the high mountain areas of xinjiang another way is to make use of satellite retrieved precipitation datasets like trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission kummerow et al 2000 and gpm global precipitation measurement huffman and skofronick jackson 2017 which both have high spatio temporal resolution most of the satellite retrieved precipitation datasets however have not been adequately evaluated in xinjiang province the model simulation results revealed the diverse responses of different pfts to climate change in the xinjiang dryland fig 6 1 although the atmospheric co2 was well mixed different pft had different sensitivities to the elevated co2 with the most significant fertilization effect found in croplands and the least found in the non phreatophyte shrublands this pattern agreed well with field observations zhang and ren 2017 2 the npp of arid ecosystem types such as the grassland and non phreatophtyic shrubs responded positively to temperature decrease which reduced evapotranspiration and water deficit while the mesic ecosystems such as irrigated croplands and meadows responded negatively to temperataure decrease possibly due to shortened growth season 3 while the npp of most pfts was dominated by the precipitation the effects of precipitation on meadow cropland and phreatophtyic shrubs were much lower than the other ecosystem types because these pfts were either less limited by water deficit meadow or can obtain extra water supply from irrigation cropland or groundwater phreatophyte this findings highlights the importance of considering the detailed water movements along the groundwater soil root canopy continuum the water compensation process and the characteristic deep root structure of the desert plants when modelling dryland ecosystem zhang et al 2013b because many popular ecological models oversimplified the soil water processes and overlooked the deep root plant they are not suitalbe for dryland ecosystem it is interesting to find a positive interactive effect between co2 increase and climate change in the arid ecosystems like non phreatophtyic shrubs and grassland fig 6 both field experiments naumburg et al 2003 and model simulations shen et al 2008 indicated that severe water stress could suppress the sensitivities of arid ecosystems to co2 fertilizaiton due to drought induced leaf abscission and suppressed photosynthesis zhang and ren 2017 as water stress was reliefed by increased precipitation and lower evapotranspiration the sensitivity of arid ecosystems in xinjiang to co2 recovered ipcc climate projections indicated increase of precipitation in the northern xinjiang but a strong temperature increase 5 6 c and minor precipitation change in southern xinjiang mannig et al 2013 huang et al 2014 the ecosystem responses to elevated co2 could be quite different between northern and southern xinjiang due to the interative effects between co2 and climate changes due to the lack of observational data from meteorological stations in xinjiang so we use multidatasets to assess the impact of climate uncertainty on ecosystem npp in this study we first evaluted uncertainty of climate co2 change on net primary productivity in xinjiang china 2000 2014 then discussed uncertainties in xinjiang s npp dynamics due to uncertainties in climate data by analyzing the differences among the model estimates driven by three different climate datasets finally quantified the relative contributions of different climate factors 5 conclusions dryland ecosystems are sensitive to climate change and the dryland in xinjiang china experienced dramatic changes in climate and co2 in the recent decreases there are large uncertainties in the spatiotemporal pattern of the regional npp in xinjiang because of the uncertainties in the climate data model simulations driven by multiple climate datasets helped us estimate the related uncertainties we had relatively high confidence that the npp increased in the tacheng during 2000 2014 because of the consensus among the multiple simulations numeric experiments and factorial analysis further indicated that the npp dynamics in these two regions particularly the areas surrounding the taklamakan desert were mainly controlled by precipitation change efficient water resource management therefore is important for maintaining ecosystem productivity in face of climate stresses in these areas there were still large uncertainties in the climate change pattern in other areas in the xinjiang china in addition our study showed that different ecosystem types could have very different responses to climate changes and there were complex interactive effects among the environmental factors for example increase of precipitation could release the desert shrublands from drought stresses that suppressed the co2 fertilization effect therefore the uncertainties climate pattern could result in even larger uncertainties in ecosystem npp in most areas of xinjiang china to assess the uncertainties we need to use ecosystem models that reflect the characteristic bio physical processes in arid ecosystems and the models should be driven by high quality climate datasets that are based on extensive field observations and accurate and high resolution climate simulations in this study we answer the question of 1 quantify the relative contributions of different climate factors 2 identify ecologically vulnerable areas with significant climate variability and noticeable decline of npp based on the consensus from simulations driven by the three climate datasets and 3 discuss

25006,dryland in xinjiang china has been threatened in recent decades by rapid climate change however due to large uncertainties in spatial climate datasets the impacts of climate change and rising co2 on net primary productivity npp in xinjiang have remained unclear these uncertainties in climate will inevitably lead to uncertainties in model estimated npp in xinjiang the uncertainties can be assessed by running an arid ecosystem model aem using multiple climate datasets such an approach allows to disentangle the relative contributions of individual climate factors on npp change using numerical simulations and factorial analysis the average annual npp for xinjiang from 2000 to 2014 was 155 90 2 74 g c m2 year 189 99 1 80 g c m2 year 213 04 8 93 g c m2 year by using the merra era interim and cfsr datasets respectively to drive aem our multiple simulations show a consistent temporal pattern of the regional npp during 2000 2014 that increased during 2008 2011 and decreased during 2005 2006 and 2013 2014 however we found large uncertainties in the spatial pattern of npp change during this time particularly in the taklimakan desert and northern xinjiang except for the tacheng where npp increased all simulations indicated that areas surrounding the taklamakan desert and ecosystems at high latitude 47 and northwestern xinjiang were dominated by precipitation change however there are large uncertainties in the dominant climate driver in other areas to assess uncertainties in ecosystem npp assessment efforts should be made to improve the confidence in climate data in the northern xinjiang this can be achieved by establishing more rain gauges keywords multiple datasets arid ecosystem model aem net primary productivity npp climate dominating factors 1 introduction arid ecosystems are threatened by global change shen et al 2009 fang et al 2017 the unique temperate desert ecosystems in the xinjiang province of china located between mongolia and kazakhstan in central asia laurent charvet et al 2002 have been particularly sensitive to the rapid climate change in recent decades zhang and ren 2017 the region s mean temperature increased by more than 0 33 c decade during 1961 2008 zhang et al 2010a much higher than the global land mean warming rate 0 27 c decade ipcc 2007 annual precipitation increased by 9 mm decade a remarkable change for an arid region zhang et al 2010a remote sensing studies indicated that the increased precipitation could have positive effects on biomass and ecosystem productivity in this arid region zhang et al 2016 zhang and ren 2017 it is important to evaluate the stability of xinjiang s dryland in response to the rapid climate change as a useful indicator of ecosystem function net primary productivity npp is a key component of energy and matter transformation in terrestrial ecosystems zhang et al 2007b chen and zhang 2017 local and regional changes in npp caused by climate change are critical in studying relationships between climate and vegetation zhang et al 2010b field experiments have been conducted to investigate ecosystem responses to climate and co2 factors mikkelsen et al 2008 but assessing effects of climate change on npp variability across a large area based on site level findings is difficult because of the spatial heterogeneity of environmental variables and non linear responses of ecosystems zhang et al 2013a yan et al 2015 remote sensing model like casa is a useful tool to detect changes in npp over large areas but it can only reflect overall effects of environmental factors as opposed to isolating effects of individual factors yan et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 fang et al 2017 in comparison process based ecosystem models are useful to understand and predict the ecological processes at local regional continental and global scales zhang et al 2008 piao et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 by conducting numerical experiments model simulation provides an effective approach to isolate the impact of individual factors on npp zhang et al 2014 fang et al 2017 in this study the arid ecosystem model aem which has been developed to capture characteristic dryland processes in northwestern china zhang et al 2013b and has been extensively validated was applied to xinjiang china to investigate the climate change effects on dryland npp li et al 2015 fang et al 2017 based on knowledge gained from field researches on the northern temperate dryland the aem is a process based ecosystem model that couples biophysical processes energy balance and biogeochemical processes carbon and water processes it is a spatial explicit model that uses a daily time step to simulate the impacts of climate change on ecosystem processes specially the aem addresses the structure of dryland vegetation and their energy carbon and water processes by including an improved vertical root distribution module a mechanistic module for water movement along the groundwater soil root canopy continuum and a plant form module that dynamically updates a plant s aboveground structure tree height crown size stem etc on a daily basis it is noteworthy that the accuracies of model outputs are closely related to inputs without high quality climate driver data it is impossible to assess npp dynamics using a modelling approach compared with other regions however ecological studies in xinjiang are challenged by large uncertainties in climate datasets hu et al 2013 in a land area of 1 6 106 km2 there are only 51 qualified i e by the national standard climate stations most of which are concentrated in the low mountain areas or peri desert oases hu et al 2014 2016 as a result there are large uncertainties in the spatiotemporal patterns of climate change and its impacts on ecosystem npp in this region qiu et al 2017 to address the climate uncertainty we used three climate reanalysis datasets to populate the aem model in this study the climate reanalysis data were developed by assimilating the information from ground observations sounding measurements model simulations and satellite observations to synthesize a coherent set of surface and upper air circulation data poccard et al 2000 because these datasets originate from different data sources models deviation correction methods and assimilation systems the reanalysis schemes have different predictions for the same region cheng et al 2013a b hu et al 2016 found that there were significant differences between the three reanalysis datasets in predicting precipitation in central asia the uncertainties in climate will inevitably lead to uncertainties in model estimated npp in xinjiang unfortunately it is difficult to decide which one of the climate datasets performs the best due to the lack of observational data from meteorological stations in the study area lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 in addition it seems that some reanalysis datasets has higher accuracy in predicting air temperature while other datasets has higher accuracy in predicting precipitation in the region hu et al 2014 2016 to assess the impact of climate uncertainty on ecosystem npp we need to identify the relative contributions of each climate factor therefore the objectives of this study were to analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of xinjiang npp over the past 15 years in response to climate change quantify the relative contributions of different climate factors and analyze the uncertainties of the ecosystem productivity in related to uncertainties in climate drivers by comparing the outputs from multiple climate driven model simulations we identified ecologically vulnerable areas with noticeable decline of npp based on the consensus from simulations driven by the three climate datasets and discussed uncertainties in xinjiang s npp dynamics due to uncertainties in climate data by analyzing the differences among the model estimates driven by three different climate datasets 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area xinjiang province is located in northwest china 34 3 49 5 n 73 5 96 3 e it is approximately 1 600 000 km2 accounting for about 1 6 of the area of china fig 1 xinjiang is located in the geographical center of eurasia with mountains bordering xinjiang on three sides the altay to the north the kunlun to the south and the pamir to the west and southwest the tianshan mountain cuts across northern xinjiang between the vast junggar and tarim basins xinjiang is a typical arid and semiarid area it has a continental monsoon climate and is sensitive to global climate change li et al 2011 the annual mean temperature ranges between 9 and 12 and the annual precipitation is 210 mm in northern xinjiang and less than 100 mm in southern xinjiang li et al 2011 the spatial distribution of precipitation is uneven the tianshan mountain has higher precipitation while southern xinjiang has higher water stress the major plant functional types pft and their spatial distribution in the study area can be found in fig 1 the seven types are evergreen needleleaf forest enf deciduous broadleaf forest bdf phreatophytic shrubs ps deep root plant like tamarix that is capable of making use of groundwater non phreatophytic shrubs nps represented by haloxylon grassland grs cropland crp and alpine meadow mew water and mobile desert areas such as those without vegetation are excluded 2 2 arid ecosystem model aem the aem arid ecosystem model a process based ecosystem model has been used to model plant and canopy structure as well as their effects on coupled carbon c and water processes in dryland ecosystems it is an effective tool for studying the effects of climate change on the carbon cycle in arid and semi arid zones zhang et al 2013b the aem simulates above and below ground plant structures as well as water movement along the groundwater soil plant continuum in the dryland ecosystem yet it retains its general applicability and efficiency to study climate change at regional and global scales the model couples the carbon nitrogen water cycles including biophysical modules vegetation physiological modules soil physics biogeochemistry etc to simulate a variety of environmental factors climate co2 nitrogen deposition groundwater depth detailed description of the model can be found in the appendix 2 3 data sources the meteorological data

elevation slope aspect vegetation type data soil data clay silt and sand content bulk density ph value and groundwater level the co2 dataset is mainly derived from the global annual average concentration data from the us mauna loa observing carbon site http co2now org vegetation in the study area was divided into seven ecosystem types evergreen needleleaf forest deciduous broadleaf

set of parameter according to the 1 1 000 000 chinese vegetation map zhang et al 2007a b c each 50 km 50 km spatial simulation unit grid is composed of various vegetation ecosystem types in different proportions each ecosystem in a grid is simulated independently and their simulation outputs are area weighted and summed up to derive the grid level ecosystem functions npp observations from the literature table 2 were used to evaluate the simulated results of npp in xinjiang the standard npp measurement method as described by whittaker and marks 1975 was used in the field studies first above ground npp was estimated based on the sum of 1 measured or estimated fine litter fall accumulation 2 measured or estimated aboveground biomass increment and 3 estimated losses of biomass to consumers then belowground npp was estimated based on root shoot ratios of the plant functional types studied detailed information of the parameters could be found in su et al 2005 and wang 2015 zhao et al 2009 s data were downloaded from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center daac ornl gov finally the aboveground and belowground npp were added up to derive the total npp 2 4 methods the model simulations were conducted under a spatial resolution of 0 5 for 1980 2014 a spin up run of 1500 years 150 spins 10 year spins was created to prevent any abnormal fluctuation due to the sudden switch from the equilibration state to the transient state to isolate the effects of individual factors precipitation temperature co2 concentration on the npp change in xinjiang five quantitative experiments or scenarios were designed table 3 the temp scenario is a single factor control experiment in which only temperature was allowed to change from year to year with the other climate factors remaining constant the output of the temp scenario indicated the impacts of temperature change from 2000 to 2014 on npp in xinjiang similarly the co2 scenario and prec scenarios are single factor control experiments for the impacts of co2 change and precipitation change respectively the clim scenario simulated the combined effect of temperature and precipitation the overall scenario stands for the combined effects of climate and co2 changes we treated the mean npp under the current climate normal 1981 2010 as the baseline shrestha et al 2012 and compared the mean npp of 2000 2014 against the baseline npp to estimate the climate change effect during the study period therefore we designed the following factorial analyses to quantify the individual effects of co2

the relative humidity and shortwave radiation were among the climate drivers in the clim and overall simulation their effects were not analyzed because previous studies and our preliminary research indicated that the interannual changes in relative humidity and shortwave radiation were small and had relatively weak influences on the dynamics of npp and carbon stock in the study area li et al 2013 zhang and ren 2017 the item in the subscript of npp denotes the period e g mean npp from 2000 to 2014 fang et al 2017 3 results 3 1 evaluation of climate uncertainty on model predicted npp at site level we first evaluated the uncertainties in model simulated npp in response to climate uncertainties as revealed by the three reanalysis climate datasets at the site level there were 21 npp sampling sites for the evaluation table 2 simulations driven by different climate datasets yields different npp results when comparing against field observations the simulations driven by merra and era interim datasets performed well with high r2 values between 0 71 and 0 74 and low rmse values between 88 14 and 93 40 fig 2 a b the simulations driven by cfsr however performed relatively poorly r2 0 60 and rmse 109 79 but were still acceptable in another word there are relatively larger uncertainties in the simulated npp due to the uncertainties in the cfsr dataset 3 2 inter annual variation in npp the average annual npp for xinjiang from 2000 to 2014 was 155 90 2 74 g c m2 year 189 99 1 80 g c m2 year 213 04 8 93 g c m2 year by using the merra era interim and cfsr datasets respectively to drive aem anova showed the estimates based on the cfsr data was significantly higher p value 0 05 than the estimates based on the merra data in response to changes in climate and co2 concentration during 2000 2014 xinjiang s npp was estimated to have decreased by 0 05 tg c year according to the era interim simulation overall scenario but increased by 0 78 tg c year according to the cfsr simulation overall scenario with an averaged npp change of 0 24 0 47 tg c year according to the three overall simulations driven by the three climate datasets simulations driven by all three datasets show npp increased from 2008 to 2011 and decreased from 2005 to 2006 as well as during 2013 2014 yet there is high uncertainty during 2000 2004 when the cfsr simulation shows the npp first decreased then increased while the era interim simulation shows a reverse pattern and the merra simulation shows a stable increase in npp in general the simulations driven by the merra and era interim climate data with similar precipitation patterns fig 3 b predict similar npp dynamics fig 3a although the cfsr has a very similar temperature pattern with the era interim fig 3c their impacts on npp are quite different 3 3 spatial patterns of the npp change in this study 5 g c m2 year to 5 g c m2 year are set as the change thresholds and those that exceed the threshold are counted as change grids fig 4 on average npp increased in more than 41 93 of the study area and decreased by more than 5 g c m2 year in 35 43 of the study area during 2000 2014 fig 4a all three climate datasets predicted an increase of npp over the tacheng and eastern tianshan mountains fig 4a however large uncertainties exist in other regions while the merra and era interim driven simulations indicate no change in the altay region in the northern xinjiang fig 4b c the cfsr simulation shows increased npp in most of these regions fig 4d furthermore the simulations of cfsr and merra do not agree with each other in the surrounding the taklimakan desert in the southern xinjiang the former indicates an npp reduction of more than 25 g c m2 year while the latter indicates that the npp change did not significant increase in most of the area in general npp changes in the southern region have less uncertainty and are either growing or stable during 2000 2014 while large uncertainties exist in the npp dynamics of the northern xinjiang except for the tacheng 3 4 contributions from individual factors and the spatial pattern of dominant climate control over the npp dynamic in xinjiang during 2000 2014 we could isolate the contributions of individual climate or co2 factors using single factor experiments or scenarios fig 5 at the regional scale the simulation results using the three datasets indicated that the atmospheric co2 concentration has been continually increasing this increased npp by about 13 38 29 2 tg c year in xinjiang under the co2 scenario prec experiment results suggests that the npp increased by 16 59 tg c year according to the simulation driven by merra data and decreased 13 33 tg c year and 42 66 tg c year according to the simulations driven by the era interim and cfsr data respectively on average the climate and co2 changes during 2000 2014 have increased npp in xinjiang mainly due to co2 fertilization fig 5 mean results it should be noted that different pft responded very differently to climate change fig 6 the effects of precipitation on forests npp were most significant but can be hardly observed in medow although the atmospheric co2 is assumed to be well mixed different pfts had different sensitivities to elevated co2 in the study period with the most significant fertilization effect found in croplands and the least found in the nps by comparing the effects of different factors we identified dominant factors with the largest impact on npp i e by comparing the changes in npp under the influence of each factor in each 50 km 50 km grid of the study area this allowed us to develop maps that plot dominant climate controls over npp in xinjiang fig 7 using the three meteorological datasets we analyzed the dominant climate controls over npp in xinjiang fig 7 the simulation results from the three datasets show that npp dynamics in the plains were dominated by precipitation especially in southern xinjiang while co2 control was more prominent in mountains area precipitation control was mainly distributed in southern xinjiang especially in aksu area cfsr showed large areas in the northern xinjiang that was dominated by others effect while the other two datasets not found 4 discussion in previous studies we used the aem to assess the responses of ecosystem npp to climate change in arid and semi arid areas of china fang et al 2017 however these studies used a single climate dataset merra to drive the model because china s meteorological stations are relatively sparse in comparison with other regions like europe and north america large uncertainties exist in the accuracy of spatial climatology datasets like merra particularly in arid areas hu et al 2014 these uncertainties in the underlying data could have significant impacts on the predicted ecosystem productivity indeed our study driven by three different climate reanalysis datasets revealed uncertainties in npp we found a generally consistent temporal pattern in simulated npp driven by three climate datasets particularly after 2005 fig 3a however the cfsr simulation predicted a very strong increase in npp after 2008 that was not found in the other two simulations this is due to the overestimation of cfsr s precipitation and the other two datasets which is 170 higher than merra and 76 higher than era interim fig 3b hu et al 2016 found that cfsr may significantly overestimate precipitation in the mountainous central asia drylands which includes our study area particularly after 2003 in fact hu et al 2016 s study showed that precipitation data from cfsr has the lowest accuracy followed by era interim data our evaluation also showed that the npp predicted by cfsr simulations has the smallest correlation with the field observations fig 2 although the cfsr datasets may have slightly higher accuracy than the other two climate datasets in predicting air temperature hu et al 2014 this advantage seemed to have a low impact on the simulated npp in this dryland region however the spatial pattern of npp as predicted by the cfsr simulation seemed to match the satellite retrieved vegetation growth pattern better than the other two datasets the cfsr simulation predicted a significant increase in npp in most areas of northern xinjiang similarly several remote sensing studies observed significant vegetation regrowth in the northern xinjiang in recent decades li et al 2015 in contrast the merra simulation predicted large scale npp decline in northern xinjiang therefore it is difficult to judge which climate dataset is more appropriate for vegetation modelling purposes our study indicated that there were large uncertainties in xinjiang s npp during some periods like 2000 2004 and 2008 2014 fig 3a and in some sub regions like northern xinjiang except for the tacheng fig 4 although the cfsr has a very similar temperature pattern with the era interim fig 3c their impacts on npp are quite different this indicates that the uncertainties in the inter annual dynamics of xinjiang s npp was mainly caused by the uncertainties in the precipitation data rather than the temperature data this finding was also confirmed by the factorial analysis fig 5 the density of rain gauges in xinjiang one of the most remote areas in china is extremely sparse as a result spatially interpolated precipitation datasets like cru are unreliable hu et al 2016 climate reanalysis products like cfsr perform poorly in the mountains because of their coarse spatial resolution these uncertainties in climate datasets limit our ability to assess the climate change effects on the ecosystem dynamics in xinjiang it is therefore extremely important to increase the number of rain gauge stations particularly in the high mountain areas of xinjiang another way is to make use of satellite retrieved precipitation datasets like trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission kummerow et al 2000 and gpm global precipitation measurement huffman and skofronick jackson 2017 which both have high spatio temporal resolution most of the satellite retrieved precipitation datasets however have not been adequately evaluated in xinjiang province the model simulation results revealed the diverse responses of different pfts to climate change in the xinjiang dryland fig 6 1 although the atmospheric co2 was well mixed different pft had different sensitivities to the elevated co2 with the most significant fertilization effect found in croplands and the least found in the non phreatophyte shrublands this pattern agreed well with field observations zhang and ren 2017 2 the npp of arid ecosystem types such as the grassland and non phreatophtyic shrubs responded positively to temperature decrease which reduced evapotranspiration and water deficit while the mesic ecosystems such as irrigated croplands and meadows responded negatively to temperataure decrease possibly due to shortened growth season 3 while the npp of most pfts was dominated by the precipitation the effects of precipitation on meadow cropland and phreatophtyic shrubs were much lower than the other ecosystem types because these pfts were either less limited by water deficit meadow or can obtain extra water supply from irrigation cropland or groundwater phreatophyte this findings highlights the importance of considering the detailed water movements along the groundwater soil root canopy continuum the water compensation process and the characteristic deep root structure of the desert plants when modelling dryland ecosystem zhang et al 2013b because many popular ecological models oversimplified the soil water processes and overlooked the deep root plant they are not suitalbe for dryland ecosystem it is interesting to find a positive interactive effect between co2 increase and climate change in the arid ecosystems like non phreatophtyic shrubs and grassland fig 6 both field experiments naumburg et al 2003 and model simulations shen et al 2008 indicated that severe water stress could suppress the sensitivities of arid ecosystems to co2 fertilizaiton due to drought induced leaf abscission and suppressed photosynthesis zhang and ren 2017 as water stress was reliefed by increased precipitation and lower evapotranspiration the sensitivity of arid ecosystems in xinjiang to co2 recovered ipcc climate projections indicated increase of precipitation in the northern xinjiang but a strong temperature increase 5 6 c and minor precipitation change in southern xinjiang mannig et al 2013 huang et al 2014 the ecosystem responses to elevated co2 could be quite different between northern and southern xinjiang due to the interative effects between co2 and climate changes due to the lack of observational data from meteorological stations in xinjiang so we use multidatasets to assess the impact of climate uncertainty on ecosystem npp in this study we first evaluted uncertainty of climate co2 change on net primary productivity in xinjiang china 2000 2014 then discussed uncertainties in xinjiang s npp dynamics due to uncertainties in climate data by analyzing the differences among the model estimates driven by three different climate datasets finally quantified the relative contributions of different climate factors 5 conclusions dryland ecosystems are sensitive to climate change and the dryland in xinjiang china experienced dramatic changes in climate and co2 in the recent decreases there are large uncertainties in the spatiotemporal pattern of the regional npp in xinjiang because of the uncertainties in the climate data model simulations driven by multiple climate datasets helped us estimate the related uncertainties we had relatively high confidence that the npp increased in the tacheng during 2000 2014 because of the consensus among the multiple simulations numeric experiments and factorial analysis further indicated that the npp dynamics in these two regions particularly the areas surrounding the taklamakan desert were mainly controlled by precipitation change efficient water resource management therefore is important for maintaining ecosystem productivity in face of climate stresses in these areas there were still large uncertainties in the climate change pattern in other areas in the xinjiang china in addition our study showed that different ecosystem types could have very different responses to climate changes and there were complex interactive effects among the environmental factors for example increase of precipitation could release the desert shrublands from drought stresses that suppressed the co2 fertilization effect therefore the uncertainties climate pattern could result in even larger uncertainties in ecosystem npp in most areas of xinjiang china to assess the uncertainties we need to use ecosystem models that reflect the characteristic bio physical processes in arid ecosystems and the models should be driven by high quality climate datasets that are based on extensive field observations and accurate and high resolution climate simulations in this study we answer the question of 1 quantify the relative contributions of different climate factors 2 identify ecologically vulnerable areas with significant climate variability and noticeable decline of npp based on the consensus from simulations driven by the three climate datasets and 3 discuss

25007,policy making to protect threatened species implies dealing with uncertainty and ignorance conservation management of the eastern gray whale eschrichtius robustus population through the regulation of whale watching in the lagoon ojo de liebre mexico is a useful example of policy making challenged by lack of scientific knowledge regarding the negative long term effects of whale watching we present a pragmatic approach to provide mexican authorities the technical information they need to justify the establishment of a maximum number of boats under conditions of deep uncertainty operationally our approach combines system dynamics modelling to simulate the boats impact on the breeding habitat with ecological risk assessment to determine the probability of crossing a critical ecological threshold which is associated to a risk of severely reducing the gray whale abundance in the lagoon thus our approach addresses the issue of establishing a legal maximum number of boats to protect threatened species keywords whale watching deep uncertainty system dynamics modelling conservation planning 1 introduction crafting environmental regulations under conditions of deep uncertainty is one of the greatest challenges for the protection of threatened wildlife species from human impacts deep uncertainties faced by policy makers cannot by eliminated at least over the short term due to the complex or random behavior of socio ecological systems hallegatte et al 2012 also increasing interactions between wildlife populations and human activities means that wildlife is especially vulnerable to human s disturbances pirotta et al 2014 in such conditions decision making cannot be taken based solely on past experiences because decisions may affect socio ecological systems in ways not previously experienced e g blanco 2013 kwakkel et al 2010 walker 2000 moreover in light of rapid change and greater environmental variability past management strategies might need to be revised to avoid strategies that can actually contribute to the vulnerability of wildlife populations even with the paucity of information available and often with limited knowledge about the extent of human s disturbances public policies to protect threatened species require information about the consequences that would follow when a certain management strategy is adopted walker 2000 therefore we argue that there is a need for pragmatic approaches that provide a better basis for policy choices despite conditions of uncertainty and ignorance the case of the eastern north pacific population of gray whale eschrichtius robustus watching in the biosphere reserve of ojo de liebre lagoon complex mexico ojo de liebre hereafter epitomizes the challenges of crafting governmental regulations to harmonize ecotourism and conservation under deep uncertainty mexico is legally bound by international agreements and its environmental laws to protect the eastern north pacific population of gray whales eastern gray whales hereafter in particular mexico s bylaw of the general law of wildlife establishes in article 134 that authorizations for wildlife non extractive uses will include information regarding the activity s carrying capacity d o f 2014 nonetheless the protection of the eastern gray whales has been hampered by deep uncertainties around the whale watching impacts in ojo de liebre uncertainties arise mainly due to the complexities involved on determining the long term consequences of whale watching the natural variability of socio ecological systems and the existence of multiple views about whale watching impacts that is experts disagree on the mechanisms and functional relationships underlying the association between ecotourism and conservation of the eastern gray whales as well as on the variables and models that best predict whale watching impacts hence it is safe to assert that this context corresponds to hallegatte s et al 2012 definition of deep uncertainty i e lack of quantifiable knowledge divergent positions values and criteria of success amongst the stakeholders and accelerated change that shapes decision processes despite this uncertain future in mexico government officials from conanp national commission on natural protected areas have to harmonize the management strategy of whale watching in ojo de liebre with the protection of the eastern gray whale the eastern gray whale is a threatened species enlisted as a least concern species in the iucn red list of threatened species reilly et al 2008 as in other parts of the world one elusive task in ojo de liebre has been determining the maximum number of whale watching boats or carrying capacity to prevent negative effects on whales abundance calls for science based adaptive management for whale watching in general have emphasized the consideration of long term population level consequences of these activities higham et al 2016 new et al 2015 senigaglia et al 2016 it has been shown that whales change aspects of their behavior including increased swim speed decreased dive times and direction of travel with respect to the presence and distance of boats argüelles et al 2016 parsons 2012 richter et al 2006 wright et al 2007 nevertheless determining long term consequences of whale watching is challenging because whales responses to whale watching differ between species and locations lusseau and bejder 2007 senigaglia et al 2016 moreover experts disagree whether whale watching has sublethal effects parsons et al 2015 or whether its long term effects are negligible or acute even equivalent to whaling new et al 2015 thus decision making is carried out without sufficient scientific information to ensure that whale watching is properly managed senigaglia et al 2016 in this paper we address the challenges posed by deep uncertainty concerning the elicitation of the maximum number of whale watching boats in ojo de liebre our approach entailed carrying out computational experiments through exploratory modelling a technique to depict how a system would behave if a set of formal conjectures were correct bankes 1993 exploratory models are practical for dealing with uncertain situations where multiple plausible futures and different interpretations arise from the various stakeholders values and interests walker and haasnoot 2011 specifically we contrasted two management strategies a laissez faire where the market places the limit of whale watching boats versus a government intervention where the government regulates the number of whale watching boats we compared the outcomes of each management strategy in relation to a threshold that highlighted the potential biological consequences of whale watching activities on the eastern gray whale abundance in ojo de liebre hence we combined system dynamics modelling acevedo 2013 and ecological risk assessment suter 2006 to addresses the issue of establishing the maximum number of whale watching boats that could be allowed to operate without severely affecting the whales abundance in ojo de liebre 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area was the biosphere reserve of ojo de liebre lagoon complex mexico a coastal lagoon which covers an area of 36600 ha conanp 2018 fig 1 ojo de liebre is a primary winter breeding habitat of the gray whale eschrichtius robustus lilljeborg eastern north pacific population salvadeo et al 2015 2013 in mexico ojo de liebre is the lagoon with the greatest abundance of eastern gray whales pérez cortés et al 2004 which varies greatly from year to year based on official data from the monitoring program of the eastern gray whales in el vizcaíno biosphere reserve appendix b whale watching activities in ojo de liebre are an important source of income for many inhabitants around the lagoon brenner et al 2016 salvadeo et al 2013 whale watching activities in mexico are regulated by a norm nom 131 semarnat 2010 d o f 2011 that establishes guidelines and specifications to carry out these activities in the norm s section 4 5 it is stated that the secretariat of the environment and natural resources semarnat should establish the observation areas regions with potential for whale watching determined by the concurrence and distribution of whales d o f 2011 for each region in ojo de liebre there are two official observation areas decreed in the nom em 074 ecol 1996 d o f 1996 and a de facto one an area proposed in 2004 by the secretariat of the environment natural resources and fisheries semarnap as a temporary observation area but that has never been decreed fig 1 2 2 system dynamics model the system dynamics model had two subsystems that interacted dynamically socio economic and environmental fig 2 appendix a the socio economic subsystem simulated the relationship between tourist investment measured by the number of rooms available and the number of whale watching boats environmental subsystem simulated the boats impacts on the suitable breeding habitat for gray whales and its effect on the whale abundance in the lagoon the socio economic subsystem affected the environmental subsystem through the sublethal effect of whale watching sublethal effects are changes in behavior acute stress responses or long term effects e g delayed growth disease development that weaken the physical state of individuals and might have negative effects at the population level wilson et al 2014 the environmental subsystem interacted with the socio economic subsystem through the tourists satisfaction which was a relation between the number of boats and the whale abundance the two interacting subsystems were implemented as a stock and flow model regarding the environmental subsystem fig 3 gray whale abundance was simulated using a standard logistic growth model with harvesting hilborn and walters 1992 schaefer 1991 1 d w d t r b w t 1 w t k l h t where w is gray whale abundance r b is the intrinsic growth rate k l is the lagoon s carrying capacity h t is the harvesting factor and b l and t are indexes of whales lagoon and time respectively the harvesting factor in eq 1 deserves further explanation evidently this factor simulates the biomass extracted by an activity in our case harvesting was conceptualized as the reduction in whale abundance caused by the sublethal effect of whale watching the ecological foundation for this conceptualization comes from the concern about the long term effects of boats noise on whales and the chronic stress induced by exposure to whale watching parsons 2012 parsons et al 2015 which on the long term might diminish the whales physical condition lusseau and bejder 2007 wright et al 2007 this sublethal effect was assumed to be proportional to a permanent loss in the quality of reproductive habitat hence this effect was represented as the area surrounding each individual whale watching boat fig 4 this implied that the sublethal effect was sensitive to the size of the initial suitable habitat accordingly the harvesting factor was calculated by 2 d h d t s 0 φ t ρ t where s 0 is the initial suitable habitat φ is the remaining suitable habitat ρ t is the gray whale s density in the lagoon and 0 is an index for the initial simulation time the initial suitable habitat s 0 corresponded to the sum of the three observation areas for whale watching activities in ojo de liebre fig 1 in this way the model minimizes the chance of underestimating the impact of whale watching by depicting the maximum possible effect in the areas where these activities are legally allowed the remaining suitable habitat a state variable in our model was given by 3 φ t s d t s 0 where s is the suitable habitat loss rate due to whale watching this remaining suitable habitat φ indicates how much habitat is still available for gray whales then to calculate the gray whale s density in the lagoon ρ we related the gray whale abundance with that remaining suitable habitat fig 3 thus eq 2 is a transfer function that relates the cumulative loss of suitable habitat s 0 φ t with the gray whale s population in a given time that is the reduction in whale abundance caused by the sublethal effect of whale watching i e whale survival in fig 3 which was assumed to be proportional to a permanent loss of the initial gray whale s suitable habitat the rate of suitable habitat loss was given by 4 d s d t π μ 2 β t f where π is a circle s circumference divided by its diameter approximately 3 14 μ is the boats radius of influence β t is the number of whale watching boats f is the intensity of whale watching impact and t is the index of time the socio economic subsystem simulated the relationship between tourist offer and the number of whale watching boats fig 5 the growth of the tourist offer θ measured as the annual increase in the number of hotel hostel rooms was calculated using a logistic growth model 5 d θ d t r θ θ t 1 θ t k θ where θ is the tourist offer k θ is the carrying capacity for tourism and r θ is the tourism intrinsic growth rate we assumed that tourist demand was the driver for additional whale watching permits thus we used a logistic growth model to calculate the growth of tourist offer θ to be able to explore the increase and reduction in the number of tourists related to the change in the number of whale watching boats a simplified stock and flow representation of the socio economic subsystem shows how we modeled the change in whale watching boats in response to tourism fig 5 the tourism intrinsic growth rate r θ was given by 6 r θ r 0 γ ϱ where r 0 is the initial tourism growth rate γ is the real occupancy rate and ϱ is the standard occupancy the tourist offer θ t a state variable in our model was given by 7 θ t θ d t θ 0 where θ 0 is the initial tourist offer incoming tourists τ was calculated by converting tourist offer growth into the number of new tourists that arrive to the lagoon each season incoming tourists was given by 8 d τ d t θ t γ ε α where ε is the number of tourist per room and α is the tourists satisfaction figs 2 and 5 hence the incoming tourists were not only affected by the number of rooms available i e the tourist offer but it was also affected by the whale watching experience i e the tourists satisfaction the total number of tourists ζ doing whale watching in ojo de liebre each season was given by 9 ζ t τ t η t where η is the number of non returning tourists non returning tourists represents those tourists that would not return to the lagoon and was given by 10 d η d t ζ t γ where γ is a proportion of non returning tourists a constant in our model the real occupancy rate γ related the total number of tourists to the tourists offer and the number of tourist per room and was given by 11 γ t ζ t ε θ tourists satisfaction was based on the boat crowding concept which states that tourist satisfaction is more influenced by the number of boats around a whale than by the number of whales that the tourist is able to see during the whale watching activity avila foucat et al 2017 2013 thus the change in tourists satisfaction α was given by 12 d α d t β t w t where β t is the number of whale watching boats and w t is the whale abundance eqs 4 and 1 respectively note that the tourists satisfaction did not directly affect the number of boats instead it only influenced the incoming tourists eq 8 in other words if the whale watching experience was satisfactory the number of tourists increased otherwise the incoming tourists did not increase regardless of the touristic offer consequently the number of whale watching boats increased in relation to the number of tourists arriving each season to the lagoon fig 2 in this sense new permits and hence new boats were only added if there was enough touristic demand to capture this relationship we used a variable called tourism factor v that represented the minimum increase in the number of tourists that was needed to enlarge the number of whale watching boats hence the change in the number of whale watching boats β was given by 13 d β d t β 0 ψ i f τ t v t t h e n 1 ψ 3 o t h e r w i s e ψ 0 where β 0 is the initial number of permits ψ is the additional number of permits the number of boats added to the existing fleet and v is the tourism factor this tourism factor was meant to simulate the authority s ease to give new permits the smaller the value of v the easier that new permits would be granted thus the authority responded to the minimum increase in the number of tourists i e τ t v t by increasing the number of vessels i e β 0 ψ in addition the authority s willingness to react to the tourist pressure was simulated i e when ψ 3 it simulated that the authority was very willing to increase the number of permits whereas when ψ 1 it simulated a more restrictive authority 2 3 ecological risk assessment we justify our model on the exploratory modeling grounds proposed by bankes 1993 accordingly our model was not a precise image of the ojo de liebre socio ecological system instead it was a tool for performing computational experiments to identify the legal whale watching carrying capacity under conditions of insufficient knowledge and unresolvable uncertainties of the long term effects on the gray whale abundance thus we first added stochasticity to our model then we did a variance analysis to identify the critical ecological threshold and finally we carried out a risk analysis 2 3 1 stochastic simulation to deal with the paucity of data available and uncertainty on model s parameters we added stochasticity to our system dynamics model thus to allow for random variation in the parameters of our model we carried out monte carlo simulations these simulations were built by varying the boats radius of influence μ from 50 to 250 m in combination with different ranges and distribution functions for the model s parameters table 1 using a simulation time of 100 years we iterated the model 50000 times to make sure that we explored sufficiently representative combinations of the parameters values we used three types of probability distributions triangular uniform and discrete uniform a triangular probability distribution typically used in contexts of limited data and uncertainty requires the specification of the minimum maximum and most likely values back et al 2000 uniform distribution is a continuous symmetric probability distribution were all the values between the minimum and maximum are equally probable discrete uniform distribution is also a symmetric probability distribution but with only a finite number of values that are equally likely to be observed for the justification of all the parameters range estimates and its distribution functions see appendix b to explore the outcomes of a laissez faire strategy we ran the model with no restrictions on the maximum number of whale watching boats whereas to simulate a government intervention strategy we constrained the maximum number of whale watching boats that could be reached in the model 2 3 2 variance analysis based on well established methods e g carpenter and brock 2006 dakos et al 2015 dakos and bascompte 2014 scheffer et al 2012 we identified a critical ecological threshold by comparing the variance in gray whale abundance the state variable with the variance of the rate of habitat loss the forcing variable the critical ecological threshold therefore refers to a point where the gray whale abundance is very sensitive to a small change in the rate of habitat loss which is caused by the number of whale watching boats thus we obtained the coefficient of variation for the rate of habitat loss s and the gray whale abundance w every 25 years we use the coefficient of variation to be able to compare the state and forcing variables that had different units then we examined the relationship between the coefficients of variation c v w h a l e a b u n d a n c e c v r a t e o f h a b i t a t l o s s so that the critical ecological threshold corresponded to the highest value of the quotient between the state and the forcing variables in addition to corroborate our determination of the critical ecological threshold we fitted the results of the simulations for whale abundance and rate of habitat loss using a generalized additive model package ggpmisc aphalo 2016 rstudio version 1 1 419 once we had the fitted polynomial equations from the regression analysis to find the highest rate of change every 25 years we identified the highest quotient between the slope of the fitted curves at consecutive times s l o p e t 1 s l o p e t we did not carry out the variance analysis for the government intervention strategy because we had to constrain our system dynamics model to a maximum number of whale watching boats hence the feedbacks between the socio economic and the environmental subsystem were altered and tourism was not the main driver influencing the increase in the number of boats anymore 2 3 3 risk analysis determining the critical ecological threshold allowed us to identify the number of whale watching boats just before and after crossing the threshold nonetheless we needed to link this number of boats to a risk so that the critical ecological threshold was meaningful for policy makers in fact risk assessments seek to generate information that is useful to aid decision makers suter 2006 hence we defined risk as the combination of the severity and the probability of negative effects originated from the increase in whale watching boats we established the level of unacceptable risk as a 5 probability of reducing the whale s initial mean abundance to 1000 individuals or less the whale s initial mean abundance at the lagoon based on official data from the monitoring program of the eastern gray whales in el vizcaíno biosphere reserve was 1240 individuals appendix b thus reaching an abundance of 1000 individuals meant a 20 decrease on the whale abundance i e losing in average a fifth of the initial whale abundance we considered that a 20 decrease of the eastern gray whale abundance was equivalent to severely reducing the eastern gray whale abundance in the lagoon therefore we established that a 5 probability of decreasing the eastern gray whale abundance to 1000 individuals i e a 20 decrease should be considered as an unacceptable risk because eastern gray whales are a threatened species 3 results overall under a laissez faire strategy the stochastic simulation results suggested a decreasing trend in the eastern gray whale abundance with increasing whale watching boats simulation results showed that after 25 years the whale abundance suffered a sharp decrease moreover there was an increase in the number of cases 5 of the cases in simulation year 75 and 18 of the cases at the end of the simulation reaching a zero abundance i e meaning that eastern gray whales do not return to ojo de liebre lagoon fig 6 based on our simulations we determined that the critical ecological threshold was between years 25 and 50 the coefficient of variation analysis revealed that the highest value 2 48 corresponded to the quotient between simulation years 50 and 25 table 2 this was consistent with the analysis of the fitted values obtained in the regression analysis fig 7 shows that the slope of the fitted curve at year 50 was steeper than the slope of the fitted curve at year 25 the highest difference in steepness between contiguous slopes 2 3 was found between simulation years 50 and 25 table 3 simulation results showed that just before crossing the critical ecological threshold the number of whale watching boats corresponded to 60 boats fig 8 b once the critical ecological threshold was crossed the average whale abundance diminished fig 8 a however as there were no government interventions on average the whale watching boats kept increasing until reaching its maximum 72 boats at simulation year 45 fig 8 b we also ran the model with a constrain on the maximum number of boats that could be reached to explore the outcomes of a simulated government intervention thus we restrained the carrying capacity to 30 boats which was half the number of the boats before crossing the threshold under the laissez faire strategy overall when compared to the previous strategy fig 6 results suggested a smoother decreasing trend in the whale abundance fig 9 simulation results for the government intervention strategy showed that after 25 years the whale abundance suffered a less sharp decrease moreover only at the end of the simulation there were cases 3 of the cases that reached a zero abundance fig 9 under a laissez faire strategy the level of unacceptable risk was reached within 25 years table 4 which corresponded to an average of 60 whale watching boats also the risk analysis results demonstrated how crossing the critical ecological threshold increased the probability by six times at simulation year 50 of severely reducing the whale abundance table 4 conversely under the government intervention strategy at year 25 the level of unacceptable risk was not reached and the probability of severely reducing the whale abundance was almost half the probability reached under the laissez faire strategy nonetheless in the government intervention strategy the risk also augmented by five times from simulation year 25 to 50 table 4 4 discussion and conclusions it has been widely acknowledged that policy making is an activity carried out under conditions of deep uncertainty e g haasnoot et al 2013 polasky et al 2011 walker et al 2003 regulating whale watching activities is no exception research is still needed in relation to eastern gray whales population size and trends cooke 2018 and there are divergent opinions about the policy choices to manage whale watching activities higham et al 2016 new et al 2015 also to date the literature on modelling under deep uncertainty has not widely addressed the use of exploratory modelling to protect endangered species from impacts of human activities thus in our approach we modeled and compared two management strategies that represented opposing views in terms of the importance of whale watching long term impacts as well as in relation to the need of establishing a legal maximum number of whale watching boats in this way the elicitation of the critical ecological threshold fitted the information needs required by conanp to properly manage whale watching activities while protecting the threatened eastern gray whale population in ojo de liebre in our modelling approach we applied a pragmatic epistemology it was problem centered contextually relevant and focused on the consequences of actions creswell 2009 harper and stein 2006 thus we deemed risk as an inter subjective modeled quantitative concept aven et al 2011 that helped establishing a legal maximum number of whale watching boats specifically in our approach we use the ecological risk assessment to generate an early warning signal by eliciting both the severity and the probability of reducing the eastern gray whale abundance in ojo de liebre at which conanp would be compelled by law to protect the long term viability of the eastern gray whale population in ojo de liebre bojórquez tapia et al 2016 simulation results showed that under a laissez faire strategy where the market places the limit of whale watching boats regardless of the consequences for gray whales whale abundance was severely affected before the self regulated maximum number of boats was reached thus having a carrying capacity of 72 whale watching boats meant that policy makers would have to accept at least a 30 probability of reducing the whale abundance in the lagoon to a 1000 individuals or less which we considered as severely decreasing the whale abundance furthermore even if the carrying capacity was set to the number of whale watching boats just before crossing the critical ecological threshold i e 60 boats there would be a 5 probability of severely reducing the whale abundance in ojo de liebre we argue that this level of risk should be unacceptable because ojo de liebre is a protected area and gray whales are a threatened species also results showed that under the government intervention strategy where the government limits the number of whale watching boats there was a smoother decreasing trend in the whale abundance under a laissez faire strategy at the end of the simulation almost a fifth of the simulation results reached a zero abundance whereas under a government intervention strategy only 3 of the cases reached a zero abundance therefore our recommendation was to establish the legal maximum number of boats well below 60 permits to prevent crossing the critical ecological threshold we acknowledge however that one limitation of our approach was its focus on identifying the critical ecological threshold for whale watching activities our results show that the number of boats remained constant after the critical ecological threshold had been surpassed this behaviour was a consequence of two assumptions 1 that tourist demand was the driver for additional whale watching permits and 2 that the economic costs of a decreasing tourist demand was negligible these assumptions allowed us to address the policy making issue while avoiding the inherent complexity and uncertainty of modeling additional socio economic variables also system dynamics modeling allowed us to represent how different parts of the socio ecological system affect each other but it lacks the individual level picture of the problem hence we considered the total abundance of whales without distinguishing single adult or juvenile whales from mother calf pairs nonetheless stochastic simulations allowed us to deal with the uncertainty on the available data for instance instead of using a single abundance value for eastern gray whales we used the official data to incorporate the population variability in ojo de liebre disturbance was also considered to be homogenous in all the suitable habitat although there is evidence that boats can have local consequences which then cause spatial rearrangements pirotta and lusseau 2015 we argue that these assumptions are nevertheless acceptable because our analysis was focused on the long term effect of whale watching on the suitable habitat in relation to the abundance of the eastern gray whale population in ojo de liebre future work could incorporate the effect of each boat on individual whales using hybrid models that combine system dynamics modelling with agent based modelling martin and schlüter 2015 in our approach we explored two whale watching management strategies to indicate what could happen in the future with each policy option in doing so we addressed the issue of establishing a legal maximum number of whale watching boats and provided key technical information for the management of whale watching in ojo de liebre furthermore results underscore the essential role of the notion of critical ecological thresholds for justifying the regulations regarding the carrying capacity of whale watching boats the relevance of our approach is thus twofold while it has important implications for the eastern gray whale s population in ojo de liebre our approach helps policy makers justify regulations aimed to protect this threatened species despite a context of deep uncertainty model availability

on that usually mating occurs in groups of three whales a female and two males retrieved from http marinebio net marinescience 05nekton gwlagoons htm also it seems that they usually are in groups of two or three whales according to this webpage http www ballenaswiki com ballena gris appendix b parameter range estimates the simulations were built by varying the boats radius of influence μ from 50 to 250 m in combination with different ranges and distribution functions for the model s parameters table b1 for the boats radius of influence μ we used as a reference the minimum distance 60 m and the waiting distance 240 m for whale watching boats established on the mexican official norm nom 131 semarnat 2010 that determines the guidelines and specifications for whale watching activities in mexico we used a discrete uniform random distribution to explore five different values of μ 50 100 150 200 and 250 m using a discrete uniform distribution we could explore these five different values of μ but in a way that each one of these values were equally likely to be observed the whales initial abundance w 0 comes from empirical data of 14 years from 1996 to 2010 these abundance numbers are the total of the maximum counts of mother calf pairs and single adult or juvenile whales observed in the censuses done each year as part of the monitoring program of the eastern gray whales in el vizcaíno biosphere reserve conanp 2018 from these data we knew the minimum abundance 573 individuals and the maximum abundance 2107 individuals in the lagoon a triangular probability distribution typically used in contexts of limited data and uncertainty requires the specification of the minimum maximum and most likely values back et al 2000 thus we used our data s minimum and maximum values and considered the mean 1237 confidence intervals at 95 951 1524 rounded to 1240 individuals as the most likely value for the whales intrinsic growth rate r b we use data from bradford et al 2008 that estimated that the growth rate for the western population of gray whales varies between 2 5 and 3 2 in this case we used a continuous uniform random distribution because all the values between 2 5 and 3 2 had to be equally likely to be observed there is a study by punt and wade 2012 that estimates a growth rate ranging from 5 7 to 6 8 for eastern gray whales using bayesian methods however the authors acknowledge that their theoretical estimates are higher than the observed population growth rate in fact there is uncertainty about eastern gray whales population size and trends and more research is still needed cooke 2018 the range values for the whales carrying capacity in the lagoon k l were derived from the maximum abundance of gray whales registered in the lagoon thus in the triangular distribution the minimum value was assigned to the maximum abundance registered 2100 individuals the maximum value based on non official estimates of the maximum abundance in the lagoon around 2700 individuals was established at 3000 individuals and the most likely value corresponded to the mean value 2550 individuals the additional number of permits ψ for whale watching represented the quantity of new permits that were granted every year it was a constant value that varied between one to three permits per year through trial and error simulations we determined that with three permits the results were already quite different from simulations when only one permit was granted because all three values 1 2 or 3 permits should be equally likely to be observed we used a discrete uniform distribution the initial number of tourists comes from a time series of 18 years from 1996 to 2014 reported by brenner et al 2016 in this case we had the minimum 6700 tourists and the maximum 10800 tourists number of tourists for the 1996 2014 period hence we used a triangular distribution with the mean 9547 tourists as the most likely value for the tourism s carrying capacity we assumed that the current capacity is 100 rooms because base on official data from denue at inegi org mx we know there are 16 hotels hostels around the lagoon we assumed 6 rooms per hotel hostels thus we supposed that roughly there are 100 rooms in the lagoon however for the tourism s carrying capacity we considered the minimum value as if there were 10 rooms per hotel hostels which means that the minimum carrying capacity would be 160 rooms for the maximum value we considered five times the minimum number of rooms 800 rooms in this case we used a triangular distribution with the mean 500 rooms as the most likely value for the tourism s carrying capacity the additional impact of tourism f is a black box that represents other impacts of tourism development such as wastewater discharges a 0 1 value corresponds to a scenario where there are no effects from tourism through trial and error simulations we determined that with an additional impact of 5 the results were already quite different from simulations when 0 1 was considered in this case we explored through a uniform distribution all the values between 0 1 to 5 we varied the tourism intrinsic growth rate between 1 to 10 a 1 growth rate means that if we assumed that there are currently 100 rooms the rooms available will only grow by one room each year whereas a 10 growth will mean 10 new rooms every year in this case we used a triangular distribution with the mean 5 growth as the most likely value for the tourism intrinsic growth rate lastly the tourism factor is the required minimum increase in the number of tourists to give new permits for whale watching in other words if there is no growth in the number of tourists there is no reason to grant new permits thus we used a triangular distribution with a minimum value corresponding to an increase of 100 tourists the maximum corresponding to an increase of 500 tourists and the mean 300 tourists as the most likely value for the tourism factor 
25007,policy making to protect threatened species implies dealing with uncertainty and ignorance conservation management of the eastern gray whale eschrichtius robustus population through the regulation of whale watching in the lagoon ojo de liebre mexico is a useful example of policy making challenged by lack of scientific knowledge regarding the negative long term effects of whale watching we present a pragmatic approach to provide mexican authorities the technical information they need to justify the establishment of a maximum number of boats under conditions of deep uncertainty operationally our approach combines system dynamics modelling to simulate the boats impact on the breeding habitat with ecological risk assessment to determine the probability of crossing a critical ecological threshold which is associated to a risk of severely reducing the gray whale abundance in the lagoon thus our approach addresses the issue of establishing a legal maximum number of boats to protect threatened species keywords whale watching deep uncertainty system dynamics modelling conservation planning 1 introduction crafting environmental regulations under conditions of deep uncertainty is one of the greatest challenges for the protection of threatened wildlife species from human impacts deep uncertainties faced by policy makers cannot by eliminated at least over the short term due to the complex or random behavior of socio ecological systems hallegatte et al 2012 also increasing interactions between wildlife populations and human activities means that wildlife is especially vulnerable to human s disturbances pirotta et al 2014 in such conditions decision making cannot be taken based solely on past experiences because decisions may affect socio ecological systems in ways not previously experienced e g blanco 2013 kwakkel et al 2010 walker 2000 moreover in light of rapid change and greater environmental variability past management strategies might need to be revised to avoid strategies that can actually contribute to the vulnerability of wildlife populations even with the paucity of information available and often with limited knowledge about the extent of human s disturbances public policies to protect threatened species require information about the consequences that would follow when a certain management strategy is adopted walker 2000 therefore we argue that there is a need for pragmatic approaches that provide a better basis for policy choices despite conditions of uncertainty and ignorance the case of the eastern north pacific population of gray whale eschrichtius robustus watching in the biosphere reserve of ojo de liebre lagoon complex mexico ojo de liebre hereafter epitomizes the challenges of crafting governmental regulations to harmonize ecotourism and conservation under deep uncertainty mexico is legally bound by international agreements and its environmental laws to protect the eastern north pacific population of gray whales eastern gray whales hereafter in particular mexico s bylaw of the general law of wildlife establishes in article 134 that authorizations for wildlife non extractive uses will include information regarding the activity s carrying capacity d o f 2014 nonetheless the protection of the eastern gray whales has been hampered by deep uncertainties around the whale watching impacts in ojo de liebre uncertainties arise mainly due to the complexities involved on determining the long term consequences of whale watching the natural variability of socio ecological systems and the existence of multiple views about whale watching impacts that is experts disagree on the mechanisms and functional relationships underlying the association between ecotourism and conservation of the eastern gray whales as well as on the variables and models that best predict whale watching impacts hence it is safe to assert that this context corresponds to hallegatte s et al 2012 definition of deep uncertainty i e lack of quantifiable knowledge divergent positions values and criteria of success amongst the stakeholders and accelerated change that shapes decision processes despite this uncertain future in mexico government officials from conanp national commission on natural protected areas have to harmonize the management strategy of whale watching in ojo de liebre with the protection of the eastern gray whale the eastern gray whale is a threatened species enlisted as a least concern species in the iucn red list of threatened species reilly et al 2008 as in other parts of the world one elusive task in ojo de liebre has been determining the maximum number of whale watching boats or carrying capacity to prevent negative effects on whales abundance calls for science based adaptive management for whale watching in general have emphasized the consideration of long term population level consequences of these activities higham et al 2016 new et al 2015 senigaglia et al 2016 it has been shown that whales change aspects of their behavior including increased swim speed decreased dive times and direction of travel with respect to the presence and distance of boats argüelles et al 2016 parsons 2012 richter et al 2006 wright et al 2007 nevertheless determining long term consequences of whale watching is challenging because whales responses to whale watching differ between species and locations lusseau and bejder 2007 senigaglia et al 2016 moreover experts disagree whether whale watching has sublethal effects parsons et al 2015 or whether its long term effects are negligible or acute even equivalent to whaling new et al 2015 thus decision making is carried out without sufficient scientific information to ensure that whale watching is properly managed senigaglia et al 2016 in this paper we address the challenges posed by deep uncertainty concerning the elicitation of the maximum number of whale watching boats in ojo de liebre our approach entailed carrying out computational experiments through exploratory modelling a technique to depict how a system would behave if a set of formal conjectures were correct bankes 1993 exploratory models are practical for dealing with uncertain situations where multiple plausible futures and different interpretations arise from the various stakeholders values and interests walker and haasnoot 2011 specifically we contrasted two management strategies a laissez faire where the market places the limit of whale watching boats versus a government intervention where the government regulates the number of whale watching boats we compared the outcomes of each management strategy in relation to a threshold that highlighted the potential biological consequences of whale watching activities on the eastern gray whale abundance in ojo de liebre hence we combined system dynamics modelling acevedo 2013 and ecological risk assessment suter 2006 to addresses the issue of establishing the maximum number of whale watching boats that could be allowed to operate without severely affecting the whales abundance in ojo de liebre 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area was the biosphere reserve of ojo de liebre lagoon complex mexico a coastal lagoon which covers an area of 36600 ha conanp 2018 fig 1 ojo de liebre is a primary winter breeding habitat of the gray whale eschrichtius robustus lilljeborg eastern north pacific population salvadeo et al 2015 2013 in mexico ojo de liebre is the lagoon with the greatest abundance of eastern gray whales pérez cortés et al 2004 which varies greatly from year to year based on official data from the monitoring program of the eastern gray whales in el vizcaíno biosphere reserve appendix b whale watching activities in ojo de liebre are an important source of income for many inhabitants around the lagoon brenner et al 2016 salvadeo et al 2013 whale watching activities in mexico are regulated by a norm nom 131 semarnat 2010 d o f 2011 that establishes guidelines and specifications to carry out these activities in the norm s section 4 5 it is stated that the secretariat of the environment and natural resources semarnat should establish the observation areas regions with potential for whale watching determined by the concurrence and distribution of whales d o f 2011 for each region in ojo de liebre there are two official observation areas decreed in the nom em 074 ecol 1996 d o f 1996 and a de facto one an area proposed in 2004 by the secretariat of the environment natural resources and fisheries semarnap as a temporary observation area but that has never been decreed fig 1 2 2 system dynamics model the system dynamics model had two subsystems that interacted dynamically socio economic and environmental fig 2 appendix a the socio economic subsystem simulated the relationship between tourist investment measured by the number of rooms available and the number of whale watching boats environmental subsystem simulated the boats impacts on the suitable breeding habitat for gray whales and its effect on the whale abundance in the lagoon the socio economic subsystem affected the environmental subsystem through the sublethal effect of whale watching sublethal effects are changes in behavior acute stress responses or long term effects e g delayed growth disease development that weaken the physical state of individuals and might have negative effects at the population level wilson et al 2014 the environmental subsystem interacted with the socio economic subsystem through the tourists satisfaction which was a relation between the number of boats and the whale abundance the two interacting subsystems were implemented as a stock and flow model regarding the environmental subsystem fig 3 gray whale abundance was simulated using a standard logistic growth model with harvesting hilborn and walters 1992 schaefer 1991 1 d w d t r b w t 1 w t k l h t where w is gray whale abundance r b is the intrinsic growth rate k l is the lagoon s carrying capacity h t is the harvesting factor and b l and t are indexes of whales lagoon and time respectively the harvesting factor in eq 1 deserves further explanation evidently this factor simulates the biomass extracted by an activity in our case harvesting was conceptualized as the reduction in whale abundance caused by the sublethal effect of whale watching the ecological foundation for this conceptualization comes from the concern about the long term effects of boats noise on whales and the chronic stress induced by exposure to whale watching parsons 2012 parsons et al 2015 which on the long term might diminish the whales physical condition lusseau and bejder 2007 wright et al 2007 this sublethal effect was assumed to be proportional to a permanent loss in the quality of reproductive habitat hence this effect was represented as the area surrounding each individual whale watching boat fig 4 this implied that the sublethal effect was sensitive to the size of the initial suitable habitat accordingly the harvesting factor was calculated by 2 d h d t s 0 φ t ρ t where s 0 is the initial suitable habitat φ is the remaining suitable habitat ρ t is the gray whale s density in the lagoon and 0 is an index for the initial simulation time the initial suitable habitat s 0 corresponded to the sum of the three observation areas for whale watching activities in ojo de liebre fig 1 in this way the model minimizes the chance of underestimating the impact of whale watching by depicting the maximum possible effect in the areas where these activities are legally allowed the remaining suitable habitat a state variable in our model was given by 3 φ t s d t s 0 where s is the suitable habitat loss rate due to whale watching this remaining suitable habitat φ indicates how much habitat is still available for gray whales then to calculate the gray whale s density in the lagoon ρ we related the gray whale abundance with that remaining suitable habitat fig 3 thus eq 2 is a transfer function that relates the cumulative loss of suitable habitat s 0 φ t with the gray whale s population in a given time that is the reduction in whale abundance caused by the sublethal effect of whale watching i e whale survival in fig 3 which was assumed to be proportional to a permanent loss of the initial gray whale s suitable habitat the rate of suitable habitat loss was given by 4 d s d t π μ 2 β t f where π is a circle s circumference divided by its diameter approximately 3 14 μ is the boats radius of influence β t is the number of whale watching boats f is the intensity of whale watching impact and t is the index of time the socio economic subsystem simulated the relationship between tourist offer and the number of whale watching boats fig 5 the growth of the tourist offer θ measured as the annual increase in the number of hotel hostel rooms was calculated using a logistic growth model 5 d θ d t r θ θ t 1 θ t k θ where θ is the tourist offer k θ is the carrying capacity for tourism and r θ is the tourism intrinsic growth rate we assumed that tourist demand was the driver for additional whale watching permits thus we used a logistic growth model to calculate the growth of tourist offer θ to be able to explore the increase and reduction in the number of tourists related to the change in the number of whale watching boats a simplified stock and flow representation of the socio economic subsystem shows how we modeled the change in whale watching boats in response to tourism fig 5 the tourism intrinsic growth rate r θ was given by 6 r θ r 0 γ ϱ where r 0 is the initial tourism growth rate γ is the real occupancy rate and ϱ is the standard occupancy the tourist offer θ t a state variable in our model was given by 7 θ t θ d t θ 0 where θ 0 is the initial tourist offer incoming tourists τ was calculated by converting tourist offer growth into the number of new tourists that arrive to the lagoon each season incoming tourists was given by 8 d τ d t θ t γ ε α where ε is the number of tourist per room and α is the tourists satisfaction figs 2 and 5 hence the incoming tourists were not only affected by the number of rooms available i e the tourist offer but it was also affected by the whale watching experience i e the tourists satisfaction the total number of tourists ζ doing whale watching in ojo de liebre each season was given by 9 ζ t τ t η t where η is the number of non returning tourists non returning tourists represents those tourists that would not return to the lagoon and was given by 10 d η d t ζ t γ where γ is a proportion of non returning tourists a constant in our model the real occupancy rate γ related the total number of tourists to the tourists offer and the number of tourist per room and was given by 11 γ t ζ t ε θ tourists satisfaction was based on the boat crowding concept which states that tourist satisfaction is more influenced by the number of boats around a whale than by the number of whales that the tourist is able to see during the whale watching activity avila foucat et al 2017 2013 thus the change in tourists satisfaction α was given by 12 d α d t β t w t where β t is the number of whale watching boats and w t is the whale abundance eqs 4 and 1 respectively note that the tourists satisfaction did not directly affect the number of boats instead it only influenced the incoming tourists eq 8 in other words if the whale watching experience was satisfactory the number of tourists increased otherwise the incoming tourists did not increase regardless of the touristic offer consequently the number of whale watching boats increased in relation to the number of tourists arriving each season to the lagoon fig 2 in this sense new permits and hence new boats were only added if there was enough touristic demand to capture this relationship we used a variable called tourism factor v that represented the minimum increase in the number of tourists that was needed to enlarge the number of whale watching boats hence the change in the number of whale watching boats β was given by 13 d β d t β 0 ψ i f τ t v t t h e n 1 ψ 3 o t h e r w i s e ψ 0 where β 0 is the initial number of permits ψ is the additional number of permits the number of boats added to the existing fleet and v is the tourism factor this tourism factor was meant to simulate the authority s ease to give new permits the smaller the value of v the easier that new permits would be granted thus the authority responded to the minimum increase in the number of tourists i e τ t v t by increasing the number of vessels i e β 0 ψ in addition the authority s willingness to react to the tourist pressure was simulated i e when ψ 3 it simulated that the authority was very willing to increase the number of permits whereas when ψ 1 it simulated a more restrictive authority 2 3 ecological risk assessment we justify our model on the exploratory modeling grounds proposed by bankes 1993 accordingly our model was not a precise image of the ojo de liebre socio ecological system instead it was a tool for performing computational experiments to identify the legal whale watching carrying capacity under conditions of insufficient knowledge and unresolvable uncertainties of the long term effects on the gray whale abundance thus we first added stochasticity to our model then we did a variance analysis to identify the critical ecological threshold and finally we carried out a risk analysis 2 3 1 stochastic simulation to deal with the paucity of data available and uncertainty on model s parameters we added stochasticity to our system dynamics model thus to allow for random variation in the parameters of our model we carried out monte carlo simulations these simulations were built by varying the boats radius of influence μ from 50 to 250 m in combination with different ranges and distribution functions for the model s parameters table 1 using a simulation time of 100 years we iterated the model 50000 times to make sure that we explored sufficiently representative combinations of the parameters values we used three types of probability distributions triangular uniform and discrete uniform a triangular probability distribution typically used in contexts of limited data and uncertainty requires the specification of the minimum maximum and most likely values back et al 2000 uniform distribution is a continuous symmetric probability distribution were all the values between the minimum and maximum are equally probable discrete uniform distribution is also a symmetric probability distribution but with only a finite number of values that are equally likely to be observed for the justification of all the parameters range estimates and its distribution functions see appendix b to explore the outcomes of a laissez faire strategy we ran the model with no restrictions on the maximum number of whale watching boats whereas to simulate a government intervention strategy we constrained the maximum number of whale watching boats that could be reached in the model 2 3 2 variance analysis based on well established methods e g carpenter and brock 2006 dakos et al 2015 dakos and bascompte 2014 scheffer et al 2012 we identified a critical ecological threshold by comparing the variance in gray whale abundance the state variable with the variance of the rate of habitat loss the forcing variable the critical ecological threshold therefore refers to a point where the gray whale abundance is very sensitive to a small change in the rate of habitat loss which is caused by the number of whale watching boats thus we obtained the coefficient of variation for the rate of habitat loss s and the gray whale abundance w every 25 years we use the coefficient of variation to be able to compare the state and forcing variables that had different units then we examined the relationship between the coefficients of variation c v w h a l e a b u n d a n c e c v r a t e o f h a b i t a t l o s s so that the critical ecological threshold corresponded to the highest value of the quotient between the state and the forcing variables in addition to corroborate our determination of the critical ecological threshold we fitted the results of the simulations for whale abundance and rate of habitat loss using a generalized additive model package ggpmisc aphalo 2016 rstudio version 1 1 419 once we had the fitted polynomial equations from the regression analysis to find the highest rate of change every 25 years we identified the highest quotient between the slope of the fitted curves at consecutive times s l o p e t 1 s l o p e t we did not carry out the variance analysis for the government intervention strategy because we had to constrain our system dynamics model to a maximum number of whale watching boats hence the feedbacks between the socio economic and the environmental subsystem were altered and tourism was not the main driver influencing the increase in the number of boats anymore 2 3 3 risk analysis determining the critical ecological threshold allowed us to identify the number of whale watching boats just before and after crossing the threshold nonetheless we needed to link this number of boats to a risk so that the critical ecological threshold was meaningful for policy makers in fact risk assessments seek to generate information that is useful to aid decision makers suter 2006 hence we defined risk as the combination of the severity and the probability of negative effects originated from the increase in whale watching boats we established the level of unacceptable risk as a 5 probability of reducing the whale s initial mean abundance to 1000 individuals or less the whale s initial mean abundance at the lagoon based on official data from the monitoring program of the eastern gray whales in el vizcaíno biosphere reserve was 1240 individuals appendix b thus reaching an abundance of 1000 individuals meant a 20 decrease on the whale abundance i e losing in average a fifth of the initial whale abundance we considered that a 20 decrease of the eastern gray whale abundance was equivalent to severely reducing the eastern gray whale abundance in the lagoon therefore we established that a 5 probability of decreasing the eastern gray whale abundance to 1000 individuals i e a 20 decrease should be considered as an unacceptable risk because eastern gray whales are a threatened species 3 results overall under a laissez faire strategy the stochastic simulation results suggested a decreasing trend in the eastern gray whale abundance with increasing whale watching boats simulation results showed that after 25 years the whale abundance suffered a sharp decrease moreover there was an increase in the number of cases 5 of the cases in simulation year 75 and 18 of the cases at the end of the simulation reaching a zero abundance i e meaning that eastern gray whales do not return to ojo de liebre lagoon fig 6 based on our simulations we determined that the critical ecological threshold was between years 25 and 50 the coefficient of variation analysis revealed that the highest value 2 48 corresponded to the quotient between simulation years 50 and 25 table 2 this was consistent with the analysis of the fitted values obtained in the regression analysis fig 7 shows that the slope of the fitted curve at year 50 was steeper than the slope of the fitted curve at year 25 the highest difference in steepness between contiguous slopes 2 3 was found between simulation years 50 and 25 table 3 simulation results showed that just before crossing the critical ecological threshold the number of whale watching boats corresponded to 60 boats fig 8 b once the critical ecological threshold was crossed the average whale abundance diminished fig 8 a however as there were no government interventions on average the whale watching boats kept increasing until reaching its maximum 72 boats at simulation year 45 fig 8 b we also ran the model with a constrain on the maximum number of boats that could be reached to explore the outcomes of a simulated government intervention thus we restrained the carrying capacity to 30 boats which was half the number of the boats before crossing the threshold under the laissez faire strategy overall when compared to the previous strategy fig 6 results suggested a smoother decreasing trend in the whale abundance fig 9 simulation results for the government intervention strategy showed that after 25 years the whale abundance suffered a less sharp decrease moreover only at the end of the simulation there were cases 3 of the cases that reached a zero abundance fig 9 under a laissez faire strategy the level of unacceptable risk was reached within 25 years table 4 which corresponded to an average of 60 whale watching boats also the risk analysis results demonstrated how crossing the critical ecological threshold increased the probability by six times at simulation year 50 of severely reducing the whale abundance table 4 conversely under the government intervention strategy at year 25 the level of unacceptable risk was not reached and the probability of severely reducing the whale abundance was almost half the probability reached under the laissez faire strategy nonetheless in the government intervention strategy the risk also augmented by five times from simulation year 25 to 50 table 4 4 discussion and conclusions it has been widely acknowledged that policy making is an activity carried out under conditions of deep uncertainty e g haasnoot et al 2013 polasky et al 2011 walker et al 2003 regulating whale watching activities is no exception research is still needed in relation to eastern gray whales population size and trends cooke 2018 and there are divergent opinions about the policy choices to manage whale watching activities higham et al 2016 new et al 2015 also to date the literature on modelling under deep uncertainty has not widely addressed the use of exploratory modelling to protect endangered species from impacts of human activities thus in our approach we modeled and compared two management strategies that represented opposing views in terms of the importance of whale watching long term impacts as well as in relation to the need of establishing a legal maximum number of whale watching boats in this way the elicitation of the critical ecological threshold fitted the information needs required by conanp to properly manage whale watching activities while protecting the threatened eastern gray whale population in ojo de liebre in our modelling approach we applied a pragmatic epistemology it was problem centered contextually relevant and focused on the consequences of actions creswell 2009 harper and stein 2006 thus we deemed risk as an inter subjective modeled quantitative concept aven et al 2011 that helped establishing a legal maximum number of whale watching boats specifically in our approach we use the ecological risk assessment to generate an early warning signal by eliciting both the severity and the probability of reducing the eastern gray whale abundance in ojo de liebre at which conanp would be compelled by law to protect the long term viability of the eastern gray whale population in ojo de liebre bojórquez tapia et al 2016 simulation results showed that under a laissez faire strategy where the market places the limit of whale watching boats regardless of the consequences for gray whales whale abundance was severely affected before the self regulated maximum number of boats was reached thus having a carrying capacity of 72 whale watching boats meant that policy makers would have to accept at least a 30 probability of reducing the whale abundance in the lagoon to a 1000 individuals or less which we considered as severely decreasing the whale abundance furthermore even if the carrying capacity was set to the number of whale watching boats just before crossing the critical ecological threshold i e 60 boats there would be a 5 probability of severely reducing the whale abundance in ojo de liebre we argue that this level of risk should be unacceptable because ojo de liebre is a protected area and gray whales are a threatened species also results showed that under the government intervention strategy where the government limits the number of whale watching boats there was a smoother decreasing trend in the whale abundance under a laissez faire strategy at the end of the simulation almost a fifth of the simulation results reached a zero abundance whereas under a government intervention strategy only 3 of the cases reached a zero abundance therefore our recommendation was to establish the legal maximum number of boats well below 60 permits to prevent crossing the critical ecological threshold we acknowledge however that one limitation of our approach was its focus on identifying the critical ecological threshold for whale watching activities our results show that the number of boats remained constant after the critical ecological threshold had been surpassed this behaviour was a consequence of two assumptions 1 that tourist demand was the driver for additional whale watching permits and 2 that the economic costs of a decreasing tourist demand was negligible these assumptions allowed us to address the policy making issue while avoiding the inherent complexity and uncertainty of modeling additional socio economic variables also system dynamics modeling allowed us to represent how different parts of the socio ecological system affect each other but it lacks the individual level picture of the problem hence we considered the total abundance of whales without distinguishing single adult or juvenile whales from mother calf pairs nonetheless stochastic simulations allowed us to deal with the uncertainty on the available data for instance instead of using a single abundance value for eastern gray whales we used the official data to incorporate the population variability in ojo de liebre disturbance was also considered to be homogenous in all the suitable habitat although there is evidence that boats can have local consequences which then cause spatial rearrangements pirotta and lusseau 2015 we argue that these assumptions are nevertheless acceptable because our analysis was focused on the long term effect of whale watching on the suitable habitat in relation to the abundance of the eastern gray whale population in ojo de liebre future work could incorporate the effect of each boat on individual whales using hybrid models that combine system dynamics modelling with agent based modelling martin and schlüter 2015 in our approach we explored two whale watching management strategies to indicate what could happen in the future with each policy option in doing so we addressed the issue of establishing a legal maximum number of whale watching boats and provided key technical information for the management of whale watching in ojo de liebre furthermore results underscore the essential role of the notion of critical ecological thresholds for justifying the regulations regarding the carrying capacity of whale watching boats the relevance of our approach is thus twofold while it has important implications for the eastern gray whale s population in ojo de liebre our approach helps policy makers justify regulations aimed to protect this threatened species despite a context of deep uncertainty model availability

two or three whales according to this webpage http www ballenaswiki com ballena gris appendix b parameter range estimates the simulations were built by varying the boats radius of influence μ from 50 to 250 m in combination with different ranges and distribution functions for the model s parameters table b1 for the boats radius of influence μ we used as a reference the minimum distance 60 m and the waiting distance 240 m for whale watching boats established on the mexican official norm nom 131 semarnat 2010 that determines the guidelines and specifications for whale watching activities in mexico we used a discrete uniform random distribution to explore five different values of μ 50 100 150 200 and 250 m using a discrete uniform distribution we could explore these five different values of μ but in a way that each one of these values were equally likely to be observed the whales initial abundance w 0 comes from empirical data of 14 years from 1996 to 2010 these abundance numbers are the total of the maximum counts of mother calf pairs and single adult or juvenile whales observed in the censuses done each year as part of the monitoring program of the eastern gray whales in el vizcaíno biosphere reserve conanp 2018 from these data we knew the minimum abundance 573 individuals and the maximum abundance 2107 individuals in the lagoon a triangular probability distribution typically used in contexts of limited data and uncertainty requires the specification of the minimum maximum and most likely values back et al 2000 thus we used our data s minimum and maximum values and considered the mean 1237 confidence intervals at 95 951 1524 rounded to 1240 individuals as the most likely value for the whales intrinsic growth rate r b we use data from bradford et al 2008 that estimated that the growth rate for the western population of gray whales varies between 2 5 and 3 2 in this case we used a continuous uniform random distribution because all the values between 2 5 and 3 2 had to be equally likely to be observed there is a study by punt and wade 2012 that estimates a growth rate ranging from 5 7 to 6 8 for eastern gray whales using bayesian methods however the authors acknowledge that their theoretical estimates are higher than the observed population growth rate in fact there is uncertainty about eastern gray whales population size and trends and more research is still needed cooke 2018 the range values for the whales carrying capacity in the lagoon k l were derived from the maximum abundance of gray whales registered in the lagoon thus in the triangular distribution the minimum value was assigned to the maximum abundance registered 2100 individuals the maximum value based on non official estimates of the maximum abundance in the lagoon around 2700 individuals was established at 3000 individuals and the most likely value corresponded to the mean value 2550 individuals the additional number of permits ψ for whale watching represented the quantity of new permits that were granted every year it was a constant value that varied between one to three permits per year through trial and error simulations we determined that with three permits the results were already quite different from simulations when only one permit was granted because all three values 1 2 or 3 permits should be equally likely to be observed we used a discrete uniform distribution the initial number of tourists comes from a time series of 18 years from 1996 to 2014 reported by brenner et al 2016 in this case we had the minimum 6700 tourists and the maximum 10800 tourists number of tourists for the 1996 2014 period hence we used a triangular distribution with the mean 9547 tourists as the most likely value for the tourism s carrying capacity we assumed that the current capacity is 100 rooms because base on official data from denue at inegi org mx we know there are 16 hotels hostels around the lagoon we assumed 6 rooms per hotel hostels thus we supposed that roughly there are 100 rooms in the lagoon however for the tourism s carrying capacity we considered the minimum value as if there were 10 rooms per hotel hostels which means that the minimum carrying capacity would be 160 rooms for the maximum value we considered five times the minimum number of rooms 800 rooms in this case we used a triangular distribution with the mean 500 rooms as the most likely value for the tourism s carrying capacity the additional impact of tourism f is a black box that represents other impacts of tourism development such as wastewater discharges a 0 1 value corresponds to a scenario where there are no effects from tourism through trial and error simulations we determined that with an additional impact of 5 the results were already quite different from simulations when 0 1 was considered in this case we explored through a uniform distribution all the values between 0 1 to 5 we varied the tourism intrinsic growth rate between 1 to 10 a 1 growth rate means that if we assumed that there are currently 100 rooms the rooms available will only grow by one room each year whereas a 10 growth will mean 10 new rooms every year in this case we used a triangular distribution with the mean 5 growth as the most likely value for the tourism intrinsic growth rate lastly the tourism factor is the required minimum increase in the number of tourists to give new permits for whale watching in other words if there is no growth in the number of tourists there is no reason to grant new permits thus we used a triangular distribution with a minimum value corresponding to an increase of 100 tourists the maximum corresponding to an increase of 500 tourists and the mean 300 tourists as the most likely value for the tourism factor 
25008,universal features of ecological processes have mathematical properties that are naturally nonlinear and intricate hitherto oftentimes approximated only by mathematical equations we aimed to evaluate via mathematical modeling different scenarios of productivity and frugivory of acca sellowiana feijoa by vertebrates in the highlands of the subtropical atlantic forest in doing so based on an empirical baseline of mutualistic interactions we simulated defaunation species reintroduction and variations in resource production to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of interactions within the network we utilized empirical data of interactions obtained via camera traps from 2015 to 2016 we performed frugivory simulations based on the use of predator prey models with the addition of exponential logistical and structured growth we evaluated 13 deterministic and stochastic models of frugivory and numerically compared the fruits removal rates among the models and empirical data we conducted a weighted network formality analysis evaluating the general topology of networks and a niche overlaps analysis of each scenario to understand the variation in resource sharing dynamics our results showed that vertebrates underexploited the potential of feijoa as a subjacent resource showing that the available fruits exceed the demand of local biota the network robustness can be significantly changed by species loss or by rewilding however in all scenarios resource sharing is less than expected the hypothetical removal by frugivores promote non random negative effects in the potential seed dispersal process whereas the increase of frugivores that may improve the reproductive success of feijoa our insights allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of different scenarios of frugivory and to provide contributions to increase understanding of the relationship between fruit eating and fleshy fruited plants our results can be used as a proxy for conservation and management

for mathematical simulations mutualistic network and niche overlapping analysis we utilized the data of feijoa frugivory from 2015 to 2016 obtained in bogoni et al 2018b performed via camera trapping along four sites in protected areas of the subtropical atlantic forest highlands são joaquim national park site 1 and site 2 surroundings of the private protected area rppn grande floresta das araucárias site 3 and within rppn leão da montanha site 4 fig 1 supplementary material 1 empirical data were obtained from the southern hemisphere starting at autumn in the beginning of 2015 until autumn in the beginning of 2016 utilizing 28 focal individuals of feijoa with a total of 4470 camera traps day we performed the simulations in an executable built in fortran 90 american national standards institute 1980 supplementary material 2 and 3 and in r r core team 2016 based on bipartite dormann et al 2008 and ecosim packages gotelli et al 2015 supplementary material 4 we made deterministic and stochastic models in which we compared numerically the removal rates with the best removal rate and with the empirical values based on averages from 2015 to 2016 bolker 2008 we evaluated 15 different scenarios table 1 the basaline scenarios sc were real data of feijoa frugivory obtained from 2015 to 2016 according to bogoni et al 2018b sc1 to sc3 six simulations sc4 to sc9 were based on a theoretical decrease or an increase of potential frugivores richness i e not stricto sensu frugivores based on a dietary classification and consequently on the initial removal rate number of independent interactions and species body size four scenarios sc10 to sc13 were based on a stochastic approach simulating arbitrary random defaunation of 25 50 and 75 and a species richness increase by 25 we based the scenario sc14 on a mixed approach of defaunation removing the largest mammal and the largest bird of the database and rewilding simulating species reintroduction in the frugivory system the scenario sc15 was based on the baseline data averages observed from 2015 to 2016 including intrinsic values of feijoa s tree mortality and natality moreover the sc15 scenario was designed to include a variation on frugivores mortality and natality such as intrinsic variations in feijoa s productivity and intrinsic variations in frugivory rates for all these stochastic scenarios in time zero t0 we kept the production values and initial removal rates equal to those observed in loco during 2015 2016 bogoni et al 2018b we executed the models up to five times with intervals of 0 1 simulating 51 feijoa harvests one per year of interactions between feijoa fruits and vertebrate fauna supporting information 4 and 5 simulations based on the decrease of frugivore fauna were justified by reference to empirical evidence of perturbations in the real world scenario for example in the study region the defaunation index ranges between 0 2 low and 0 8 high bogoni et al 2016 simulations based on the decrease of frugivore fauna reflected a hypothetical scenario of the reintroduction of large bodied vertebrates as has occurred in some places in southern brazil e g brusius 2009 2 2 mathematical model description we utilized an approach based on the lotka volterra predator prey model lotka 1925 volterra 1926 on the hastings powell tritrophic chaotic model hastings and powell 1991 and on the rosenzweig macarthur predation model rosenzweig and macarthur 1963 containing features of exponential logistical and structured growth gotelli 2007 despite the fact that these equations were developed from the 1920s to the 1990s all of them remain classics in particular the oldest equation i e lotka volterra is currently often used for quantitative ecology providing a framework to understand species interactions species coexistence and community assembly e g bunin 2017 liu and fan 2017 o dwyer 2018 lotka volterra equations are nonlinear differential equations of first order encoding interspecies interactions carrying capacity and continuous time lotka 1925 volterra 1926 however here we adapted this approach to frugivory including in the equation i the number of individuals trees producing fruits i e not only the initial value of prey in this case the feijoa fruits ii an intrinsic variation in productivity beyond the intrinsic natality and mortality and iii the ecological implication of the frugivores body size thus we self adapted a mathematical model to predict the productivity independent of and dependent evolutionarily on removal rates availability balance and removal of feijoa fruits in interaction with mammals and birds in order to do this we constructed the model based on equations 01 to 05 detailed as follow equation 01 resource dependent productivity p p 0 exp k d t v p a d t m p p 0 v p a n p p 0 v p a k d t where p dependent productivity p0 initial or observed productivity k support capacity usually assumed 0 75 dt time intervals usually 0 1 vp intrinsic variation in productivity ratio a number of producers number of trees mp intrinsic mortality of producers ratio and np intrinsic natality of producers ratio for all simulations except scenario sc15 we used intrinsic variation in productivity ratio mp intrinsic mortality of producers ratio and np intrinsic natality of producers ratio equal to zero because we were interested in extrinsic variation in productivity dependent on removal new simulations with variation in these intrinsic parameters can be performed using the fortran executable contained in

intrinsic mortality of frugivores and nr intrinsic natality of frugivores based on observations in the absolute variation of empirical data from 2015 to 2016 we choose to use a division by 1000 in part of this equation because the multiplication of species richness s by abundance ab derived from independent records that inflated the final removal values we assumed that this mathematical artifice would best represent the possible future reality of fruit removal i e it was used to obtain a reduction in the order of numerical magnitude without losing the interaction between richness and abundance of species provided in the equation equation 05 removal r d b where d availability obtained in equation 03 and b balance obtained in equation 04 calibration of mathematical models involves the use of experimental or field data to estimate the unknown parameters of the model gu 2018 as our model was a physically motivated simulation model that aimed to generate predictions that are at least consistent with physical laws and with previous behavior oliver and alfonzo 2018 we assume that our calibration can be considered as a product of the use of empirical data field data and simulations experiments of defaunation and rewilding which respects values of the previous time to generate values for future times nevertheless as a form of evaluation of the modeling results we used the values of removal in order to create a probability matrix per time intervals in doing so we first obtained the division of removal value by time from time 1 51 followed by the division of removal sum by total time i e 51 thereby we summed both values and applied a division by 2 obtaining a value of removal per time probability matrix containing absolute values of expected removal we then applied the paired samples wilcoxon test to compare the data obtaining a significance value between observed removal rates and expected removal rates 2 3 network and niche overlapping approach we applied a mutualistic network approach newman 2004 analyzing the general topology of networks per site under each aforementioned scenario supplementary material 6 all frugivory records and supplementary material 7 data summarization utilized in analysis for each scenario we obtained four metrics i average degree ii modularity iii connectivity and iv nestedness olesen et al 2007 pires et al 2011 the mean degree describes the number of interactions by animals and sites of feijoa presence connectance represents the ratio between the number of interactions observed in relation to the number of possible interactions ranging from 0 to 1 pires et al 2011 modularity m quantifies the tendency of the nodes to cluster into cohesive groups olesen et al 2007 and nestedness n indicates a hierarchical pattern of interactions in which the interactions of the less connected assemblages sites of frugivory form a subset of the interactions of the most connected representing a structural fitting almeida neto et al 2008 for modularity we used newman s approach newman 2004 and compared the obtained m with 1000 null models created a priori with a species degree ranging between 0 and the mean of the degree of real network observed for the original data bogoni et al 2018b significance p 0 05 was based on the ratio at which larger or equal to the observed m value occurs in the null models m bascompte et al 2003 for nestedness we used the nodf criteria almeida neto et al 2008 nodf ranges from 0 when the matrix is non nested to 100 when the matrix is perfectly nested almeida neto et al 2008 pires et al 2014 we also compared the n value of the network with the value generated by 1000 null models adopting the same criteria aforementioned for modularity significance bascompte et al 2003 our approach of niche overlapping and respective analysis is based on the competitive exclusion principle and coexistence gause 1934 hardin 2009 ideas which were expanded into mathematical theories regarding limiting similarity and treatments of the ecological niche chase and leibold 2003 macarthur and levins 1967 the basic metrics for niche overlap are either the pianka index or the czekanowski index the pianka index is similar to the competition coefficient α in lotka volterra equations and the czekanowski index is the area of intersection of two resource utilization histograms both based on randomization algorithm gotelli et al 2015 we performed the analysis for each scenario based on the pianka metric and on the algorithm ra3 which reshuffles the row values the algorithms retain the observed niche breadth of each species that is the relative degree of specialization but they randomly alter which particular resource categories are used gotelli et al 2015 the pianka index ranges from 0 0 to 1 0 indicating a gradient of none niche overlap to full niche overlap respectively lopes et al 2015 the data are randomized based on the algorithm ra3 in 5000 null assemblages and we then created a histogram of simulated niche overlap values and estimated the tail probability two tailed of the observed data under the null hypothesis p observed niche overlap h0 lopes et al 2015 for network and niche overlap analysis we used the adjacency matrixes by species per site with the values of removal rates per species i e species degree in percent supplementary material 6 and supplementary material 7 3 results 3 1 removal rates on average our mathematical simulations showed an average removal of 16 3 7 2 sd ranging from 2 6 to 24 9 table 1 the best removal scenario was the deterministic model simulating the tapirus terrestris and tayassu pecari reintroduction in all sites sc7 totaling a richness of 22 species of potential frugivores with maximum removal ratio of 24 9 an increase of 73 in comparison with empirical data from 2015 to 2016 sc3 the worst case of removal rates was the stochastic scenario with a random defaunation of 75 sc12 16 5 less than the real removal rate sc3 and 22 3 less than the best removal scenario sc7 in which removal values were often close to zero chaos table 1 fig 2 supplementary material 8 the evaluation of removal data per time obtained from modeling compared with a probability matrix via a paired samples wilcoxon test showed that the vast majority of deterministic scenarios of feijoa fruit removal were statistically different from those expected per time intervals table 1 3 2 network metrics comparing the empirical data from 2015 to 2016 with the deterministic and stochastic models we obtained considerable variation with respect to network topology and their respective metrics species and sites degree had a variation ranging from 1 1 to 2 5 and 9 2 to 5 6 respectively in relation to empirical data from 2015 to 2016 sc3 the networks connectance ranged from 0 38 to 0 60 a variating in relation to the real data csc3 0 46 of from 17 to 30 modularity decreased in all scenarios except in the sc8 removing eira barbara and sc2 empirical data from 2016 scenarios when paired with sc3 results baseline however all modularity values except in sc6 sc12 and sc13 were statistically larger than obtained in null models mnull 0 14 in regard to the nestedness metric we found an inverse pattern of modularity generally increasing in relation to the empirical data sc3 among the scenarios only sc2 nsc2 37 5 sc6 sc7 sc10 and sc13 nmodels 50 were statistically different p 0 05 from the null models nnull 47 3 fig 3 3 3 niche overlapping the metrics of niche overlapping showed that on average our scenarios had 36 7 6 5 less niche overlapping when compared with the confidence intervals of the null models indicating no great competition for feijoa fruits typically showing that the offer exceeds the demand the best scenario was the sc13 i e increasing the richness and removal rates at 25 showing an observed overlap of 0 466 significantly lower 24 7 than the expected value 0 753 simulating defaunation and reducing the feijoa fruit removal our results of niche overlapping showed a decrease of apparent competition for all scenarios the niche overlap is significative lower than expected in the null models p 0 01 table 2 4 discussion mathematical modeling is an important tool for understanding the exploitation of biological resources the equations involve process exposing discrepancies able to reveal important and nontrivial features of systems kar et al 2010 the fruit removal rate and abundance of frugivores are indicators of how well seed dispersal is currently working carlo and morales 2008 kelly et al 2004 however the loss of seed dispersers can disrupt this important ecological process hitherto this has not been widely studied mcconkey and o farrill 2016 our stochastic scenarios with high defaunation simulations from five to 15 species showed that interactions decrease by about 13 in relation to the best scenario obtained this issue arises alongside chaos disrupting the ecological interaction between feijoa and vertebrates beyond the numerical loss in removal rates and consequently in feijoa recruitment the results of removal rates are related to forest richness composition regeneration and expansion robertson et al 2006 despite fruit removal rates not being directly related to seed germination the decline in this ecological process is related to disturbed environments with low regeneration potential kirika et al 2008 our main results under a deterministic simulation of reintroducing only two large fruit eating species t terrestris and t pecari within a real mutualistic network of frugivory showed that the final fruit removal rate would increase by about 73 i e circa of 2200 seeds per harvest enabling a contribution to phytodemographic dynamics frugivores substantially affect seed dispersal through the number of fruits they remove and by the pattern of seed deposition jordano and schupp 2000 wenny 2000 this mutualistic network and their robustness are highly dependent for instance on the structure abundance and composition of the frugivores and plants array albert et al 2000 functional loss of dispersers is addressed at the species level with recruitment patterns documented in ecosystems both with and without the disperser species levi and peres 2013 pérez méndez et al 2015 or through mutualistic networks which are modeled under disperser loss and their consequences for network metrics mello et al 2011 vidal et al 2014 of the metrics used in this study nestedness leads to an increase in network robustness as a result of many ecological interactions nielsen and bascompte 2007 piazzon et al 2011 our results showed a higher nestedness in scenarios with species increase e g with t terrestris and t pecari reintroduction and with a stochastic increase of 25 in species richness increasing not only the removal rates sites degrees and species degrees but also the network robustness however in scenarios with defaunation the nestedness also had an increase in comparison with the real data due to the removal of species that are not pan distributed along our spatial gradient in contrast the modularity of network a propriety of the network clusters cohesion olesen et al 2007 decreased in all simulations except in real data from 2016 and where the main fruit eating mammal e barbara was removed when compared with the basaline scenario real data from 2015 to 2016 this pattern of reduction in modularity shows that the real pattern although intermediary of weakly interlinked sites that are internally strongly connected by frugivores can be compromised if the situation simulated in our simulations actually occurs additionally modular networks are more stable because they can retain the impacts of a perturbation e g defaunation within a module and minimize the impacts on other modules krause et al 2003 teng and mccann 2004 modularity quantifies the tendency of the nodes to cluster into cohesive groups that are more connected among themselves than with the rest of the network olesen et al 2007 in the real world scenario cumulative local extinctions that can escalate into wholesale defaunation are more likely to occur at landscape to regional scales when nearby source populations and their rescue effect are missing further the modularity of feijoa network frugivory was higher than expected at random indicating weak groups of sites linked by some species in common bogoni et al 2018b and thus showing that site 1 and site 4 can act as a source of species for the other sites the intermediary connectance of networks was the metric with the least variation in relation to the real data highlighting the real data from 2016 with a decrease of 0 08 and stochastic scenarios of high defaunation sc12 and richness increase sc13 each of these results shows that the interaction potential can be greater than observed although connectance decreases with increasing network size jordano 1987 moreover all of these variations may be the result of chance especially in stochastic scenarios thus controlling the simulations in deterministic scenarios we can keep the greatest robustness of the network based on the result of the network metrics the best case scenario was the deterministic hypothetical reintroduction of t terrestris and t pecari which can ensure many ecosystem services both species are under threat in brazilian territory play several ecological functions and occur currently only in certain large fragments within the atlantic forest gatti et al 2011 jorge et al 2013 keuroghlian et al 2014 o farrill et al 2013 the random increase of frugivores richness will depend on the ecological traits of species introduced within the network abrams et al 1996 albert et al 2015 but generally this introduction can increase the complexity of mutualistic networks enhancing ecosystem function in the atlantic forest silva et al 2015 by contrast to the best case scenario the worst case scenario of the simulation of defaunation could predict an alarming situation in regard to the seed dispersal process this aspect is particularly relevant considering that areas of the subtropical atlantic forest are constantly experiencing defaunation bogoni et al 2016 2018a leading to a shift in several ecological patterns and processes from small to large spatiotemporal scales dirzo et al 2014 galetti et al 2013 feijoa acts as an attractor and resource provision for native fauna and allochtone animals e g cattle in the scarce season structuring mammal and bird communities spatiotemporally bogoni et al 2018b however the available fruits are greater than the demand in this case resource sharing and expected competition by fauna to obtain fruits seems to be absent as our niche overlapping analysis revealed it makes sense that in places with high productivity of fruits and a biota that is a pale shadow of its former self the offer exceeds many times over the demand for this seasonal resource resource sharing is one of the determinant processes of increased diversity of coexisting species within an ecological community pianka 1974 it has been shown that a community with more resource sharing or greater niche overlap can support more species than one with less niche overlap pianka 1974 and both processes depend on environmental variability may and macarthur 1972 furthermore the frugivory in feijoa may not generate competition because fruit productivity is greater than the removal rates even though the distribution of food resources in rainforests varies widely both in time and space mourthé 2014 however this tenuous competition for feijoa fruits may have been different in the past due to the contemporary absence of megafauna considering that a large number of mammals that make up the megafauna body size 44 kg of south america were extinct at the end of the late pleistocene and early holocene circa 50 genera many of them potentially fed on feijoa fruits it would be reasonable to suggest that past existence of megafauna probably produced a significant increase in demand for and consequently in consumption and dispersion of feijoa for example in south america the largest frugivore was the gomphothere 7580 kg currently it is the tapir 300 kg 96 lighter than the gomphothere hansen and galetti 2009 this issue should be stretched beyond an absolute animal size to be context dependent hansen and galetti 2009 these events of downsizing determining loss of or changes in numerous ecological functions including knowing the legacy of extinct mutualistic interactions are important to assess the roles and success of megafauna in seed dispersal hansen and galetti 2009 pires et al 2017 for instance simulations suggest that extinct large bodied frugivores would often disperse large seeds over larger distances pires et al 2017 our results show a similarity with these aforementioned defaunation and downsizing effects on the ecological process for instance it seems that feijoa has become evolutionarily equipped to providing many and large fruits to the fauna even when including the local absent megafauna in the system t terrestris and t pecari our modeling showed that the limits of removal reach only 1 3 of available fruit but represent an increase of 73 in observed average frugivory baseline scenario sc3 in the mixed scenario sc14 removing the largest mammal and the largest bird present in the system the best removal rate increases by 36 in relation to the observed thus in evolutionary terms it is preferable for feijoa to have large bodied species at the expense of smaller ones which is evident by fruit weight 130 g the array of frugivores can influence productivity fruit and seed size and demographic variations at both short and long term evolutionary scales galetti et al 2013 all these evolutionary changes are underway for some plant species at sites without large fruit eating species galetti et al 2013 in fact we emphasize that feijoa is an attractor for the relictual biota contained in the atlantic forest highlands mainly acting as a temporary alternative resource during the austral summer autumn a time when resources are scarce we acknowledge that among sites and considering both temporal replicas the productivity of feijoa fruits is expressively variable site 1 9602 7 fruits ha 1 site 2 922 6 fruits ha 1 site 3 3105 5 fruits ha 1 and site 4 2852 7 fruits ha 1 however the frugivory among sites was proportional to the fruits productivity when both temporal replicas were combined the removal proportion was 3 35 for site 1 27 84 for site 2 13 70 for site 3 and 12 77 for site 4 these rates of removal represent considering the fruits ha 1 produced 341 9 73 0 fruits site 1 326 4 site 2 251 1 site 3 425 4 and site 4 364 8 feijoa fruits and the distance among studied sites did not exercise a significant influence on frugivory bogoni et al 2018b the challenging novelty and significance of this study established a connection between population dynamics described by the generalized lotka volterra equations and an ecological process at community level scale i e frugivory in doing so innovates in adapting the original model to understand the trophic structure according to frugivores traits i e body size representing the predator in lotka volterra and according to a large spatiotemporal variation in fruit production representing the analogous of the prey in lotka volterra whereby several regions worldwide are having their original vertebrate faunas depleted the significance of our study was to show that the repeated events of local extinctions are able to conduct an ecological process near to chaos leading to regional changes in the ecosystem patterns and process we acknowledge that within all possible mathematical models only the understandable and manageable models and the models able to be fully explored are helping to achieve an understanding of ecological systems and processes grimm 1994 thus we recognize that our predator prey based models can require further settings and future modeling of frugivory could incorporate more complex ecological processes the evaluation of the results of our modeling via paired samples wilcoxon test showed that the deterministic scenarios of feijoa fruit removal were statistically different from the expected per time showing that our model can be more accurate for real world prone scenarios than stochastic scenarios as initially conceived considering the scenarios of defaunation in the meta region of study our approach based on classical models of predator prey and their conceptual derivation was useful in regard to concluding that the feijoa is an important resource for local fauna and allochthone elements however the potential of feijoa as a resource is under utilized because the offer exceeds the demand perhaps due to the low density of potential frugivores within the relictual assemblages of vertebrates the hypothetical removal of frugivores shifts non random effects in the seed dispersal process the opposite of increasing frugivores which may improve the reproductive success of feijoa our insights derived from simulations with different magnitudes of possible scenarios within the anthropocene e g defaunation and rewilding for frugivory events on a semi domesticated tree representing a threatened environment within anthropogenic landscapes the increase of seed dispersal ecology understanding has so far had little influence on conservation practice and politics while the needs of conservation practice have had little influence on seed dispersal research mcconkey et al 2012 thus we provide theoretical simulations to predict the behavior of the relationship between mammals birds and fruit trees over the long term these results can serve as a basis for conservation and management plans for the species involved and the landscapes in which they are found which are experiencing an overwhelming defaunation process funding brazilian program for biodiversity research ppbio atlantic forest network national council for scientific and technological

25008,universal features of ecological processes have mathematical properties that are naturally nonlinear and intricate hitherto oftentimes approximated only by mathematical equations we aimed to evaluate via mathematical modeling different scenarios of productivity and frugivory of acca sellowiana feijoa by vertebrates in the highlands of the subtropical atlantic forest in doing so based on an empirical baseline of mutualistic interactions we simulated defaunation species reintroduction and variations in resource production to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of interactions within the network we utilized empirical data of interactions obtained via camera traps from 2015 to 2016 we performed frugivory simulations based on the use of predator prey models with the addition of exponential logistical and structured growth we evaluated 13 deterministic and stochastic models of frugivory and numerically compared the fruits removal rates among the models and empirical data we conducted a weighted network formality analysis evaluating the general topology of networks and a niche overlaps analysis of each scenario to understand the variation in resource sharing dynamics our results showed that vertebrates underexploited the potential of feijoa as a subjacent resource showing that the available fruits exceed the demand of local biota the network robustness can be significantly changed by species loss or by rewilding however in all scenarios resource sharing is less than expected the hypothetical removal by frugivores promote non random negative effects in the potential seed dispersal process whereas the increase of frugivores that may improve the reproductive success of feijoa our insights allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of different scenarios of frugivory and to provide contributions to increase understanding of the relationship between fruit eating and fleshy fruited plants our results can be used as a proxy for conservation and management

recent study has shown that feijoa provides a resource for more than 20 vertebrates mammals and birds of the subtropical atlantic forest highlands increasing the seasonal diversity bogoni et al 2018b this fact is all the more important because feijoa fruits are available during a season when araucaria seeds pinhão the main resource of fom are not available souza 2007 santos et al 2009 and the region is experiencing a constant and unprecedented defaunation process bogoni et al 2016 the main causes of defaunation result from a human induced biodiversity crisis from the local to the biogeographical scale vertebrate biota are succumbing due to hunting habitat loss and fragmentation population isolating encounters with exotic species and their diseases and collisions with vehicles abra et al 2019 canale et al 2012 galetti et al 2017 peres 1990 redford 1992 empirical evidences show that the dynamics of frugivory and the effects of defaunation on the ecological process has not been addressed at long term studies consequently not being able to evaluate different scenarios of productivity freckleton 2004 here we employed a mathematical model based on a predator prey approach to assess the effects of biodiversity fluctuations on a paramount ecosystem process i e frugivory and seed dispersal our study is based on a fleshy fruited plant feijoa presenting expressive variation in productivity and strong interaction with relictual vertebrates biota which although it has evidence of producing beyond demand is responsible for maintaining the residual diversity of vertebrates in areas where it occurs in association with araucaria trees moreover our meta region of study i e the highland of fom is one of the most threatened along the atlantic forest of south america thus our main goal is to evaluate different scenarios of feijoa frugivory by mammals and birds simulating species loss and species reintroduction to understand the dynamics of the vertebrate feijoa interactions spatiotemporally via removal rates variation in the topology and metrics of mutualistic networks and niche overlaps 2 material and methods 2 1 data and theoretical ecological scenarios for mathematical simulations mutualistic network and niche overlapping analysis we utilized the data of feijoa frugivory from 2015 to 2016 obtained in bogoni et al 2018b performed via camera trapping along four sites in protected areas of the subtropical atlantic forest highlands são joaquim national park site 1 and site 2 surroundings of the private protected area rppn grande floresta das araucárias site 3 and within rppn leão da montanha site 4 fig 1 supplementary material 1 empirical data were obtained from the southern hemisphere starting at autumn in the beginning of 2015 until autumn in the beginning of 2016 utilizing 28 focal individuals of feijoa with a total of 4470 camera traps day we performed the simulations in an executable built in fortran 90 american national standards institute 1980 supplementary material 2 and 3 and in r r core team 2016 based on bipartite dormann et al 2008 and ecosim packages gotelli et al 2015 supplementary material 4 we made deterministic and stochastic models in which we compared numerically the removal rates with the best removal rate and with the empirical values based on averages from 2015 to 2016 bolker 2008 we evaluated 15 different scenarios table 1 the basaline scenarios sc were real data of feijoa frugivory obtained from 2015 to 2016 according to bogoni et al 2018b sc1 to sc3 six simulations sc4 to sc9 were based on a theoretical decrease or an increase of potential frugivores richness i e not stricto sensu frugivores based on a dietary classification and consequently on the initial removal rate number of independent interactions and species body size four scenarios sc10 to sc13 were based on a stochastic approach simulating arbitrary random defaunation of 25 50 and 75 and a species richness increase by 25 we based the scenario sc14 on a mixed approach of defaunation removing the largest mammal and the largest bird of the database and rewilding simulating species reintroduction in the frugivory system the scenario sc15 was based on the baseline data averages observed from 2015 to 2016 including intrinsic values of feijoa s tree mortality and natality moreover the sc15 scenario was designed to include a variation on frugivores mortality and natality such as intrinsic variations in feijoa s productivity and intrinsic variations in frugivory rates for all these stochastic scenarios in time zero t0 we kept the production values and initial removal rates equal to those observed in loco during 2015 2016 bogoni et al 2018b we executed the models up to five times with intervals of 0 1 simulating 51 feijoa harvests one per year of interactions between feijoa fruits and vertebrate fauna supporting information 4 and 5 simulations based on the decrease of frugivore fauna were justified by reference to empirical evidence of perturbations in the real world scenario for example in the study region the defaunation index ranges between 0 2 low and 0 8 high bogoni et al 2016 simulations based on the decrease of frugivore fauna reflected a hypothetical scenario of the reintroduction of large bodied vertebrates as has occurred in some places in southern brazil e g brusius 2009 2 2 mathematical model description we utilized an approach based on the lotka volterra predator prey model lotka 1925 volterra 1926 on the hastings powell tritrophic chaotic model hastings and powell 1991 and on the rosenzweig macarthur predation model rosenzweig and macarthur 1963 containing features of exponential logistical and structured growth gotelli 2007 despite the fact that these equations were developed from the 1920s to the 1990s all of them remain classics in particular the oldest equation i e lotka volterra is currently often used for quantitative ecology providing a framework to understand species interactions species coexistence and community assembly e g bunin 2017 liu and fan 2017 o dwyer 2018 lotka volterra equations are nonlinear differential equations of first order encoding interspecies interactions carrying capacity and continuous time lotka 1925 volterra 1926 however here we adapted this approach to frugivory including in the equation i the number of individuals trees producing fruits i e not only the initial value of prey in this case the feijoa fruits ii an intrinsic variation in productivity beyond the intrinsic natality and mortality and iii the ecological implication of the frugivores body size thus we self adapted a mathematical model to predict the productivity independent of and dependent evolutionarily on removal rates availability balance and removal of feijoa fruits in interaction with mammals and birds in order to do this we constructed the model based on equations 01 to 05 detailed as follow equation 01 resource dependent productivity p p 0 exp k d t v p a d t m p p 0 v p a n p p 0 v p a k d t where p dependent productivity p0 initial or observed productivity k support capacity usually assumed 0 75 dt time intervals usually 0 1 vp intrinsic variation in productivity ratio a number of producers number of trees mp intrinsic mortality of producers ratio and np intrinsic natality of producers ratio for all simulations except scenario sc15 we used intrinsic variation in productivity ratio mp intrinsic mortality of producers ratio and np intrinsic natality of producers ratio equal to zero because we were interested in extrinsic variation in productivity dependent on removal new simulations with variation in these intrinsic parameters can be performed using the fortran executable contained in

intrinsic mortality of frugivores and nr intrinsic natality of frugivores based on observations in the absolute variation of empirical data from 2015 to 2016 we choose to use a division by 1000 in part of this equation because the multiplication of species richness s by abundance ab derived from independent records that inflated the final removal values we assumed that this mathematical artifice would best represent the possible future reality of fruit removal i e it was used to obtain a reduction in the order of numerical magnitude without losing the interaction between richness and abundance of species provided in the equation equation 05 removal r d b where d availability obtained in equation 03 and b balance obtained in equation 04 calibration of mathematical models involves the use of experimental or field data to estimate the unknown parameters of the model gu 2018 as our model was a physically motivated simulation model that aimed to generate predictions that are at least consistent with physical laws and with previous behavior oliver and alfonzo 2018 we assume that our calibration can be considered as a product of the use of empirical data field data and simulations experiments of defaunation and rewilding which respects values of the previous time to generate values for future times nevertheless as a form of evaluation of the modeling results we used the values of removal in order to create a probability matrix per time intervals in doing so we first obtained the division of removal value by time from time 1 51 followed by the division of removal sum by total time i e 51 thereby we summed both values and applied a division by 2 obtaining a value of removal per time probability matrix containing absolute values of expected removal we then applied the paired samples wilcoxon test to compare the data obtaining a significance value between observed removal rates and expected removal rates 2 3 network and niche overlapping approach we applied a mutualistic network approach newman 2004 analyzing the general topology of networks per site under each aforementioned scenario supplementary material 6 all frugivory records and supplementary material 7 data summarization utilized in analysis for each scenario we obtained four metrics i average degree ii modularity iii connectivity and iv nestedness olesen et al 2007 pires et al 2011 the mean degree describes the number of interactions by animals and sites of feijoa presence connectance represents the ratio between the number of interactions observed in relation to the number of possible interactions ranging from 0 to 1 pires et al 2011 modularity m quantifies the tendency of the nodes to cluster into cohesive groups olesen et al 2007 and nestedness n indicates a hierarchical pattern of interactions in which the interactions of the less connected assemblages sites of frugivory form a subset of the interactions of the most connected representing a structural fitting almeida neto et al 2008 for modularity we used newman s approach newman 2004 and compared the obtained m with 1000 null models created a priori with a species degree ranging between 0 and the mean of the degree of real network observed for the original data bogoni et al 2018b significance p 0 05 was based on the ratio at which larger or equal to the observed m value occurs in the null models m bascompte et al 2003 for nestedness we used the nodf criteria almeida neto et al 2008 nodf ranges from 0 when the matrix is non nested to 100 when the matrix is perfectly nested almeida neto et al 2008 pires et al 2014 we also compared the n value of the network with the value generated by 1000 null models adopting the same criteria aforementioned for modularity significance bascompte et al 2003 our approach of niche overlapping and respective analysis is based on the competitive exclusion principle and coexistence gause 1934 hardin 2009 ideas which were expanded into mathematical theories regarding limiting similarity and treatments of the ecological niche chase and leibold 2003 macarthur and levins 1967 the basic metrics for niche overlap are either the pianka index or the czekanowski index the pianka index is similar to the competition coefficient α in lotka volterra equations and the czekanowski index is the area of intersection of two resource utilization histograms both based on randomization algorithm gotelli et al 2015 we performed the analysis for each scenario based on the pianka metric and on the algorithm ra3 which reshuffles the row values the algorithms retain the observed niche breadth of each species that is the relative degree of specialization but they randomly alter which particular resource categories are used gotelli et al 2015 the pianka index ranges from 0 0 to 1 0 indicating a gradient of none niche overlap to full niche overlap respectively lopes et al 2015 the data are randomized based on the algorithm ra3 in 5000 null assemblages and we then created a histogram of simulated niche overlap values and estimated the tail probability two tailed of the observed data under the null hypothesis p observed niche overlap h0 lopes et al 2015 for network and niche overlap analysis we used the adjacency matrixes by species per site with the values of removal rates per species i e species degree in percent supplementary material 6 and supplementary material 7 3 results 3 1 removal rates on average our mathematical simulations showed an average removal of 16 3 7 2 sd ranging from 2 6 to 24 9 table 1 the best removal scenario was the deterministic model simulating the tapirus terrestris and tayassu pecari reintroduction in all sites sc7 totaling a richness of 22 species of potential frugivores with maximum removal ratio of 24 9 an increase of 73 in comparison with empirical data from 2015 to 2016 sc3 the worst case of removal rates was the stochastic scenario with a random defaunation of 75 sc12 16 5 less than the real removal rate sc3 and 22 3 less than the best removal scenario sc7 in which removal values were often close to zero chaos table 1 fig 2 supplementary material 8 the evaluation of removal data per time obtained from modeling compared with a probability matrix via a paired samples wilcoxon test showed that the vast majority of deterministic scenarios of feijoa fruit removal were statistically different from those expected per time intervals table 1 3 2 network metrics comparing the empirical data from 2015 to 2016 with the deterministic and stochastic models we obtained considerable variation with respect to network topology and their respective metrics species and sites degree had a variation ranging from 1 1 to 2 5 and 9 2 to 5 6 respectively in relation to empirical data from 2015 to 2016 sc3 the networks connectance ranged from 0 38 to 0 60 a variating in relation to the real data csc3 0 46 of from 17 to 30 modularity decreased in all scenarios except in the sc8 removing eira barbara and sc2 empirical data from 2016 scenarios when paired with sc3 results baseline however all modularity values except in sc6 sc12 and sc13 were statistically larger than obtained in null models mnull 0 14 in regard to the nestedness metric we found an inverse pattern of modularity generally increasing in relation to the empirical data sc3 among the scenarios only sc2 nsc2 37 5 sc6 sc7 sc10 and sc13 nmodels 50 were statistically different p 0 05 from the null models nnull 47 3 fig 3 3 3 niche overlapping the metrics of niche overlapping showed that on average our scenarios had 36 7 6 5 less niche overlapping when compared with the confidence intervals of the null models indicating no great competition for feijoa fruits typically showing that the offer exceeds the demand the best scenario was the sc13 i e increasing the richness and removal rates at 25 showing an observed overlap of 0 466 significantly lower 24 7 than the expected value 0 753 simulating defaunation and reducing the feijoa fruit removal our results of niche overlapping showed a decrease of apparent competition for all scenarios the niche overlap is significative lower than expected in the null models p 0 01 table 2 4 discussion mathematical modeling is an important tool for understanding the exploitation of biological resources the equations involve process exposing discrepancies able to reveal important and nontrivial features of systems kar et al 2010 the fruit removal rate and abundance of frugivores are indicators of how well seed dispersal is currently working carlo and morales 2008 kelly et al 2004 however the loss of seed dispersers can disrupt this important ecological process hitherto this has not been widely studied mcconkey and o farrill 2016 our stochastic scenarios with high defaunation simulations from five to 15 species showed that interactions decrease by about 13 in relation to the best scenario obtained this issue arises alongside chaos disrupting the ecological interaction between feijoa and vertebrates beyond the numerical loss in removal rates and consequently in feijoa recruitment the results of removal rates are related to forest richness composition regeneration and expansion robertson et al 2006 despite fruit removal rates not being directly related to seed germination the decline in this ecological process is related to disturbed environments with low regeneration potential kirika et al 2008 our main results under a deterministic simulation of reintroducing only two large fruit eating species t terrestris and t pecari within a real mutualistic network of frugivory showed that the final fruit removal rate would increase by about 73 i e circa of 2200 seeds per harvest enabling a contribution to phytodemographic dynamics frugivores substantially affect seed dispersal through the number of fruits they remove and by the pattern of seed deposition jordano and schupp 2000 wenny 2000 this mutualistic network and their robustness are highly dependent for instance on the structure abundance and composition of the frugivores and plants array albert et al 2000 functional loss of dispersers is addressed at the species level with recruitment patterns documented in ecosystems both with and without the disperser species levi and peres 2013 pérez méndez et al 2015 or through mutualistic networks which are modeled under disperser loss and their consequences for network metrics mello et al 2011 vidal et al 2014 of the metrics used in this study nestedness leads to an increase in network robustness as a result of many ecological interactions nielsen and bascompte 2007 piazzon et al 2011 our results showed a higher nestedness in scenarios with species increase e g with t terrestris and t pecari reintroduction and with a stochastic increase of 25 in species richness increasing not only the removal rates sites degrees and species degrees but also the network robustness however in scenarios with defaunation the nestedness also had an increase in comparison with the real data due to the removal of species that are not pan distributed along our spatial gradient in contrast the modularity of network a propriety of the network clusters cohesion olesen et al 2007 decreased in all simulations except in real data from 2016 and where the main fruit eating mammal e barbara was removed when compared with the basaline scenario real data from 2015 to 2016 this pattern of reduction in modularity shows that the real pattern although intermediary of weakly interlinked sites that are internally strongly connected by frugivores can be compromised if the situation simulated in our simulations actually occurs additionally modular networks are more stable because they can retain the impacts of a perturbation e g defaunation within a module and minimize the impacts on other modules krause et al 2003 teng and mccann 2004 modularity quantifies the tendency of the nodes to cluster into cohesive groups that are more connected among themselves than with the rest of the network olesen et al 2007 in the real world scenario cumulative local extinctions that can escalate into wholesale defaunation are more likely to occur at landscape to regional scales when nearby source populations and their rescue effect are missing further the modularity of feijoa network frugivory was higher than expected at random indicating weak groups of sites linked by some species in common bogoni et al 2018b and thus showing that site 1 and site 4 can act as a source of species for the other sites the intermediary connectance of networks was the metric with the least variation in relation to the real data highlighting the real data from 2016 with a decrease of 0 08 and stochastic scenarios of high defaunation sc12 and richness increase sc13 each of these results shows that the interaction potential can be greater than observed although connectance decreases with increasing network size jordano 1987 moreover all of these variations may be the result of chance especially in stochastic scenarios thus controlling the simulations in deterministic scenarios we can keep the greatest robustness of the network based on the result of the network metrics the best case scenario was the deterministic hypothetical reintroduction of t terrestris and t pecari which can ensure many ecosystem services both species are under threat in brazilian territory play several ecological functions and occur currently only in certain large fragments within the atlantic forest gatti et al 2011 jorge et al 2013 keuroghlian et al 2014 o farrill et al 2013 the random increase of frugivores richness will depend on the ecological traits of species introduced within the network abrams et al 1996 albert et al 2015 but generally this introduction can increase the complexity of mutualistic networks enhancing ecosystem function in the atlantic forest silva et al 2015 by contrast to the best case scenario the worst case scenario of the simulation of defaunation could predict an alarming situation in regard to the seed dispersal process this aspect is particularly relevant considering that areas of the subtropical atlantic forest are constantly experiencing defaunation bogoni et al 2016 2018a leading to a shift in several ecological patterns and processes from small to large spatiotemporal scales dirzo et al 2014 galetti et al 2013 feijoa acts as an attractor and resource provision for native fauna and allochtone animals e g cattle in the scarce season structuring mammal and bird communities spatiotemporally bogoni et al 2018b however the available fruits are greater than the demand in this case resource sharing and expected competition by fauna to obtain fruits seems to be absent as our niche overlapping analysis revealed it makes sense that in places with high productivity of fruits and a biota that is a pale shadow of its former self the offer exceeds many times over the demand for this seasonal resource resource sharing is one of the determinant processes of increased diversity of coexisting species within an ecological community pianka 1974 it has been shown that a community with more resource sharing or greater niche overlap can support more species than one with less niche overlap pianka 1974 and both processes depend on environmental variability may and macarthur 1972 furthermore the frugivory in feijoa may not generate competition because fruit productivity is greater than the removal rates even though the distribution of food resources in rainforests varies widely both in time and space mourthé 2014 however this tenuous competition for feijoa fruits may have been different in the past due to the contemporary absence of megafauna considering that a large number of mammals that make up the megafauna body size 44 kg of south america were extinct at the end of the late pleistocene and early holocene circa 50 genera many of them potentially fed on feijoa fruits it would be reasonable to suggest that past existence of megafauna probably produced a significant increase in demand for and consequently in consumption and dispersion of feijoa for example in south america the largest frugivore was the gomphothere 7580 kg currently it is the tapir 300 kg 96 lighter than the gomphothere hansen and galetti 2009 this issue should be stretched beyond an absolute animal size to be context dependent hansen and galetti 2009 these events of downsizing determining loss of or changes in numerous ecological functions including knowing the legacy of extinct mutualistic interactions are important to assess the roles and success of megafauna in seed dispersal hansen and galetti 2009 pires et al 2017 for instance simulations suggest that extinct large bodied frugivores would often disperse large seeds over larger distances pires et al 2017 our results show a similarity with these aforementioned defaunation and downsizing effects on the ecological process for instance it seems that feijoa has become evolutionarily equipped to providing many and large fruits to the fauna even when including the local absent megafauna in the system t terrestris and t pecari our modeling showed that the limits of removal reach only 1 3 of available fruit but represent an increase of 73 in observed average frugivory baseline scenario sc3 in the mixed scenario sc14 removing the largest mammal and the largest bird present in the system the best removal rate increases by 36 in relation to the observed thus in evolutionary terms it is preferable for feijoa to have large bodied species at the expense of smaller ones which is evident by fruit weight 130 g the array of frugivores can influence productivity fruit and seed size and demographic variations at both short and long term evolutionary scales galetti et al 2013 all these evolutionary changes are underway for some plant species at sites without large fruit eating species galetti et al 2013 in fact we emphasize that feijoa is an attractor for the relictual biota contained in the atlantic forest highlands mainly acting as a temporary alternative resource during the austral summer autumn a time when resources are scarce we acknowledge that among sites and considering both temporal replicas the productivity of feijoa fruits is expressively variable site 1 9602 7 fruits ha 1 site 2 922 6 fruits ha 1 site 3 3105 5 fruits ha 1 and site 4 2852 7 fruits ha 1 however the frugivory among sites was proportional to the fruits productivity when both temporal replicas were combined the removal proportion was 3 35 for site 1 27 84 for site 2 13 70 for site 3 and 12 77 for site 4 these rates of removal represent considering the fruits ha 1 produced 341 9 73 0 fruits site 1 326 4 site 2 251 1 site 3 425 4 and site 4 364 8 feijoa fruits and the distance among studied sites did not exercise a significant influence on frugivory bogoni et al 2018b the challenging novelty and significance of this study established a connection between population dynamics described by the generalized lotka volterra equations and an ecological process at community level scale i e frugivory in doing so innovates in adapting the original model to understand the trophic structure according to frugivores traits i e body size representing the predator in lotka volterra and according to a large spatiotemporal variation in fruit production representing the analogous of the prey in lotka volterra whereby several regions worldwide are having their original vertebrate faunas depleted the significance of our study was to show that the repeated events of local extinctions are able to conduct an ecological process near to chaos leading to regional changes in the ecosystem patterns and process we acknowledge that within all possible mathematical models only the understandable and manageable models and the models able to be fully explored are helping to achieve an understanding of ecological systems and processes grimm 1994 thus we recognize that our predator prey based models can require further settings and future modeling of frugivory could incorporate more complex ecological processes the evaluation of the results of our modeling via paired samples wilcoxon test showed that the deterministic scenarios of feijoa fruit removal were statistically different from the expected per time showing that our model can be more accurate for real world prone scenarios than stochastic scenarios as initially conceived considering the scenarios of defaunation in the meta region of study our approach based on classical models of predator prey and their conceptual derivation was useful in regard to concluding that the feijoa is an important resource for local fauna and allochthone elements however the potential of feijoa as a resource is under utilized because the offer exceeds the demand perhaps due to the low density of potential frugivores within the relictual assemblages of vertebrates the hypothetical removal of frugivores shifts non random effects in the seed dispersal process the opposite of increasing frugivores which may improve the reproductive success of feijoa our insights derived from simulations with different magnitudes of possible scenarios within the anthropocene e g defaunation and rewilding for frugivory events on a semi domesticated tree representing a threatened environment within anthropogenic landscapes the increase of seed dispersal ecology understanding has so far had little influence on conservation practice and politics while the needs of conservation practice have had little influence on seed dispersal research mcconkey et al 2012 thus we provide theoretical simulations to predict the behavior of the relationship between mammals birds and fruit trees over the long term these results can serve as a basis for conservation and management plans for the species involved and the landscapes in which they are found which are experiencing an overwhelming defaunation process funding brazilian program for biodiversity research ppbio atlantic forest network national council for scientific and technological

25009,demographic rates differ between populations and also fluctuate over time sometimes driving large fitness differences but the strength of stochastic effects remain heretofore unresolved we demonstrate the importance of stochastic processes by comparing the drivers of long term population growth we quantify stochastic contributions to differences in population growth rates among 218 plant and two animal populations representing 62 species all records from the compadre and comadre matrix databases suitable for our analyses using the small noise approximation life table response experiment sna ltre a recently developed matrix model tool for decomposing the stochastic contributions of elasticities variability and correlations stochastic influences comprise over a quarter of all contributions to population growth variation among populations mean sd 28 14 the relative importance of stochastic effects decreases with generation time and lifespan confirming predictions that longevity buffers populations against the negative effects of variability stochastic effects are larger when populations differ widely in growth rates suggesting that stochasticity is likely to be important where ecological conditions vary greatly and are larger among herbaceous perennials than among woody plants ferns and succulents possibly reflecting phenotypic plasticity in response to fluctuating environments overall we show that stochastic effects are often strong enough to warrant the additional effort required to characterize their contributions to population growth keywords correlation covariance elasticity life table response experiment small noise approximation stochastic matrix model 1 introduction populations living in natural environments experience stochastic fluctuations in local environmental conditions that drive variability in demographic rates horvitz and schemske 1995 jongejans and de kroon 2005 ozgul et al 2006 with sometimes large effects on long term population dynamics boyce et al 2006 differences in stochastic environmental processes may thereby drive population growth trajectories apart so including stochastic effects in demographic models helps researchers better understand the conditions underlying population growth and decline and also helps managers to better target conservation efforts therefore incorporating stochasticity improves mathematical models used in basic ecology and conservation settings houston et al 1988 tuljapurkar 1990a menges 1992 fieberg and ellner 2001 lande et al 2003 salguero gómez and de kroon 2010 but the magnitude of stochastic effects across species is not well characterized in general demographic rate fluctuations reduce population growth relative to predictions based on mean rates alone boyce 1977 variability may have large effects on population fitness lande et al 2003 tuljapurkar et al 2003 davison et al 2013 or stochastic effects may be relatively small benton et al 1995 jacquemyn et al 2012 but the importance of environmental variability is likely increasing under anthropogenic disturbance and global climate change lande 1998 boyce et al 2006 when fluctuations in demographic rates are relatively small deterministic methods are nearly sufficient and inclusion of variance in addition to mean rate effects often generates accurate estimates of long term population growth lande and orzack 1988 zuidema and franco 2001 davison et al 2010 if fluctuations are large or correlated however simple stochastic methods may fail to accurately represent population dynamics one reason is that correlations among demographic rates can magnify or mitigate the effects of variability doak et al 2005 such that positive correlations may drive population decline even if mean rates would indicate increase boyce 1977 lande 1993 pfab and scholes 2004 jenouvrier et al 2009 stochastic effects are stronger if important i e high elasticity rates are positively correlated doak et al 2005 less commonly negative covariance may permit species persistence despite negative intrinsic growth rates higgins et al 2000 negative correlations may buffer population growth against variability through compensatory effects doak and morris 2010 density dependence mcdonald et al 2016 or inverse norms of reaction to environmental effects knops et al 2007 in each case stochastic effects may differ between populations so models including stochasticity may more accurately characterize population growth or decline and thereby provide valuable additional information not available through deterministic methods populations may adapt to different types of environmental variability over generations via stabilizing selection by buffering important demographic rates against variation pfister 1998 morris and doak 2004 or alternatively through phenotypic plasticity tailoring labile individual life histories to track fluctuations in local environments koons et al 2009 chevin et al 2010 jongejans et al 2010a these adaptations may be reflected in differences in elasticities which estimate potential fitness consequences of demographic rate perturbations which are suggestive of the selection pressures acting on demographic rates and life cycle transitions benton and grant 1996 and thus help managers identify the rates limiting population growth or causing local decline caswell 2000 these adaptations may also be reflected in stochastic elasticities to vital rate variability haridas and tuljapurkar 2005 which predict positive effects of environmental fluctuations in the rarer cases where higher variability benefits populations tuljapurkar et al 2003 morris and doak 2005 population level differences are also important in evolutionary ecology signaling local adaptation to distinct habitat conditions and life history divergence that may alter co evolutionary relationships or set the stage for speciation dieckmann and doebeli 1999 or stochastic influences may disrupt speciation events johansson and ripa 2006 in conservation biology where the drivers of population decline are frequent targets of management interventions population differences allow managers to identify key characteristics of populations and environments that favor persistence or extinction caswell 2000 stochastic effects may be especially important for small declining or slowly growing populations dennis 2002 and understanding more about their effects improves our understanding of life history diversity and the conditions underlying persistence or extinction to identify the actual drivers of population level differences in growth or decline in abundance comparative demographers may apply a widely used set of decomposition methods collectively called life table response experiments ltre caswell 2001 which quantify the contributions of individual rates such as fertility or survival at a given age to observed differences in population performance for review see caswell 2000 for comparison of retrospective methods see table b1 like life stage analysis lsa wisdom et al 2000 another method for estimating vital rate contributions deterministic ltre methods provide important information about the gross drivers of population differences in the form of mean vital rates but they do not address the role of environmental variability some ltre analyses consider patterns of temporal variation in matrix elements horvitz et al 1997 fréville et al 2004 jongejans and de kroon 2005 folk et al 2007 or identify year effects on populations angert 2006 and variance decomposition techniques like ltres have proven to be useful for studying how differences in various demographic processes contribute to spatiotemporal variation in population growth horvitz et al 1997 bruna and oli 2005 jiménez sierra et al 2007 but they treat temporal variation in the same way as spatial variation importantly deterministic ltres ignore the fact that persistent temporal variation in matrix elements results in a long term stochastic growth rate that is different from the deterministic growth rate in order to directly study the effects of time variation in population dynamics stochastic models are required one ltre method davison et al 2010 incorporates stochastic effects by using stochastic elasticities tuljapurkar et al 2003 haridas and tuljapurkar 2005 to estimate the contributions of vital rate variability to long term population growth another caswell 2010 distinguishes the contributions of environmental variability versus responses of demographic rates to environmental conditions while these advances provide valuable additional information about population differences neither addresses vital rate correlations which are important for both population dynamics doak et al 2005 and natural selection lande and arnold 1983 a more recent method davison et al 2013 applies an iterated kitagawa 1955 decomposition to the small noise approximation of the stochastic growth rate tuljapurkar 1990a in order to directly quantify contributions to population level differences in stochastic growth rates made by differences in 1 mean vital rates 2 variability in vital rates 3 demographic rate correlations and 4 vital rate elasticities we expect that this newer sna ltre approach to analysing temporal variability will prove especially useful in the analysis of natural populations experiencing environmental change environmental stochasticity is important for natural selection benton and grant 1996 and for the persistence of species and populations tuljapurkar and orzack 1980 for a review of stochastic matrix models in conservation see fieberg and ellner 2001 long term population growth in fluctuating environments as described in the lewontin and cohen 1969 model of the stochastic growth rate can be estimated using the stochastic growth rate λs cohen 1979 which is the appropriate measure of long term population growth in fluctuating environments caswell 2001 387 401 and which is most accurately estimated using the small noise approximation of the stochastic population growth rate sna tuljapurkar 1990a the sna ltre provides additional utility for comparative demography and allows researchers to ask more nuanced questions about the factors driving population growth or decline patterning of the contributions of vital rate variation tell us important information about the potential for demographic buffering against the negative effects of environmental variation pfister 1998 the fitness effects of differences in vital rate correlations may reveal information about the trade offs underlying vital rate effects stearns 1983 koenig and knops 1998 and population growth effects of elasticity differences may tell us about spatial variation in selection pressures benton and grant 1999 and local adaptation pickup et al 2012 in this paper we demonstrate the value of sna ltre decomposition for comparing the population level effects of environmental stochasticity across 62 species we show that stochastic effects are common across plant species and that in many populations stochastic contributions are large enough to warrant the extra effort required to estimate their effects we also test several predictions based on ecological theory first because mean demographic rates summarize gross differences in population performance as demonstrated by the good fit in many deterministic ltre studies we expect mean rates to be the dominant driver of variation in population dynamics how strong stochastic effects are in general is an empirical question that we attempt to answer using available time series data describing population dynamics second because longevity buffers populations against temporal stochastic effects morris et al 2008 we expect stochastic effects to play a smaller role in explaining among population differences in long lived species third we predict that stochastic effects will be stronger among herbaceous plants than among other plant growth forms ramula and lehtilä 2005 so we compare herbaceous perennials to the remainder of our species which we had to lump due to small numbers shrubs trees succulents ferns and one pair of animal populations last we predict that stochastic effects will be stronger when population growth rates differ widely because large spatial differences in population performance are likely to result in diverging elasticity patterns and may also reflect strong effects of stochastic environments however even large stochastic contributions may balance to yield small net contributions to population growth differences davison et al 2013 so we examine both the direction and magnitude of stochastic effects 2 methods 2 1 data collection we

davison et al 2013 2 4 study characteristics and life history traits we examine underlying relationships of stochastic contributions with several study characteristics such as study duration and number of populations as well as with species life history traits such as generation time and life expectancy table 1 each study compared multiple populations of each species m 2 and anova showed significant study effects on stochastic contributions p 0 001 to deal with this nestedness we statistically analyze values averaged per species table 1 and we repeat each regression analysis with a

avoid confounding life expectancy of species with very low seed bank or seedling survival we use maximum stage specific remaining life expectancies ex in the regression analyses because herbaceous plants are demographically distinct silvertown et al 1993 and because stochastic effects may be stronger for herbaceous species ramula and lehtilä 2005 we compare the 169 populations of 48 herbaceous perennial species with all other species pooled to see if they differ significantly in stochastic effects because there are so few populations of each of the other growth forms we do not compare them

cases p 0 2 phylogenetic linear regressions at the species level show similar patterns as the standard regression at the population level table 1 differences in stochastic growth rates and average generation time again showed consistent patterns whereas the correlation of stochastic effects and mean stochastic growth rate is significant across populations but not across species table 1 4 discussion across 220 populations representing 62 plant and one animal species stochastic processes make substantial contributions in some cases accounting for more than half of the growth differences between populations although effects of mean demographic rates are usually more important than stochastic effects over a quarter of all contributions were via stochastic processes indicating that sna ltres capture important effects that are missed by deterministic ltres in classic ltres covariance is used in the decomposition of variance in population growth rates brault and caswell 1993 caswell 2001 thus revealing the importance of correlation without quantifying it directly the sna ltre extends this variance decomposition allowing us to quantify the contribution of variability to differences in long term population growth vs stochastic contributions of demographic rate correlations and elasticities whereas contributions of variability cσ are always negative correlation contributions cρ and net contributions of covariance cς can be positive fig 1 decomposing these two elements of covariance provides additional information not available using previous methods table s1 our results show that stochastic effects contribute generally more to population differences in short lived species which complements earlier findings of stronger roles of stochasticity within populations of shorter lived species menges 1992 morris and doak 2004 stochastic effects are especially strong among declining populations and in populations with large differences in intrinsic growth rates garcía et al 2008 which are precisely those of greatest conservation concern menges 1992 this further underscores the importance of incorporating stochasticity into conservation models we also confirmed that herbaceous perennials differ from other species silvertown et al 1993 but our sample was too small to detect differences among the other types of organisms six study characteristics and life history traits explained some portion of the observed variation in stochastic contributions generation time maximum remaining life expectancy matrix dimension the number of populations and the intrinsic deterministic growth rate table 1 figs b3 s7 but study duration was not significant table 1 fig b8 as expected stochastic effects were less important among long lived species table 1 figs 3 b4 this supports theory predicting that long lived species are buffered against temporal fluctuations morris et al 2008 through bet hedging trade offs slatkin 1974 and iteroparity tuljapurkar 1990b positive and negative correlation effects act across the entire life cycle and are correlated with both generation time and life expectancy whereas variability effects differ with generation time but not with life expectancy this suggests that the negative effects of uncorrelated stochastic noise are buffered more by the pace of fertility than by the pace of mortality studies with larger matrix dimensions had lower contributions of cv differences table 1 fig b5 which is somewhat unexpected since larger matrices with more stage transitions generally allow for more variation in survival growth and retrogression salguero gómez and plotkin 2010 however a larger number of stage transitions may also allow a broader distribution of positive and negative contributions that cancel at the population level whereas restructuring matrices with fewer stages would summarize the combined effect over a larger number of transitions and may obscure the effects of variability also long lived species e g trees are often modeled with larger matrices than herbaceous species with smaller growth forms and fewer growth classes lower matrix dimension may be the result of small sample sizes insufficient to parameterize larger matrices that more precisely model stage transitions ramula and lehtilä 2005 thus obscuring potential effects of covariation among vital rates this may be especially important for herbaceous perennials ramula and lehtilä 2005 which comprise 73 of our sample and for short lived species in which the smallest establishment stages are especially important for population fitness salguero gómez and plotkin 2010 we suggest that researchers will have more explanatory power if they obtain sample sizes of sufficient spatial breadth and temporal depth to estimate vital rate covariance effects in addition to sampling effects from the number of individuals observed in each study site study design also limits our ability to detect stochastic effects through the number of sites studied correlation effects were stronger in study systems with more surveyed populations table 1 fig b6 suggesting that including a wider range of study sites may reveal differences in trade offs or synchrony that are missed by smaller studies this may be because a wider variety of habitats with distinct correlation patterns are sampled whereas covariance is reduced in the averaged vital rates of the reference matrix via portfolio effects hector et al 2010 rapidly growing populations had smaller elasticity contributions table 1 fig b7 it is well known that growing and declining populations often have contrasting elasticity patterns de kroon et al 2000d and we show that where population growth rates differ widely there are larger effects of differences in elasticities and correlations and mean effects are smaller table 1 fig b3 this suggests that studies examining large deviations in vital rates should consider stochastic effects and this may be especially important in conservation studies where some populations are declining rapidly and others are declining slowly or increasing 4 1 alternative approaches and future directions stochastic contributions may reflect differences in environmental effects like local microclimate or localized disturbance but also reflect different phenotypic and life history responses to shared environments so it is important to note here the distinction between shared environments at different scales we found that stochastic effects were larger in spatially diverse study systems that may have a broad range of habitats spatially distinct populations may be close enough geographically to share a common weather environment and yet have fixed differences in terms of their soil structure nutrient availability or other local habitat characteristics van der meer et al 2016v these differences may influence populations responses to a common shared temporal weather sequence and may alter the degree or even the sign of correlations between vital rates in other words fixed site specific environmental conditions may produce differences in demographic responses to environmental conditions or in the average demographic rates themselves regardless of these responses and this may drive distinct responses to temporal vs spatial variation jongejans and de kroon 2005 for instance differences in the contributions of variability at the site level may reflect local habitat differences vs regional differences reflecting differences in broader climate patterns jongejans et al 2010b the distinction between the demographic rate responses of distinct populations and differences in the environmental drivers of these responses is addressed by caswell 2010 see below another caveat is that phenotypic correlations may not reflect underlying demographic trade offs but rather opportunity costs of zero sum rules governing transitions out of a given stage class morris and doak 2004 although the contributions of these correlations are informative about stochastic effects alternative stochastic sltre approaches were simultaneously published in a previous special feature in matrix modeling advances salguero gómez and de kroon 2010 the approach of caswell 2010 decomposes differences in stochastic population growth rates as a function of environmental state dynamics autocorrelation and vital rate responses to environmental states while the sltre presented by davison et al 2010 uses stochastic elasticities to decompose differences in stochastic growth rates into contributions from differences in means vs variance in vital rates although the sna ltre results presented here address effects of environmental stochasticity these previous approaches cannot it would be interesting to compare our results to those that would be obtained using these other methods caswell s 2010 method would more directly provide information about autocorrelation and the environmental drivers of stochastic effects while the previous approach of davison et al 2010 would allow us to assess the utility of stochastic elasticities tuljapurkar et al 2003 haridas and tuljapurkar 2005 for predicting the effect of variability on population level differences a comprehensive comparison of the different methods available which is beyond the scope of the current paper could help researchers choose ltres that would best serve their study goals table b1 summarizes six retrospective decomposition methods other transient and stochastic ltres may provide complementary insights to sna ltre analyses koons et al 2016 used transient ltres to distinguish contributions of vital rates vs population structure and found that population structure was most important for short term population growth in populations with low survival in our analyses the effect of generation time could be partially explained by population structure with short generation populations containing more early stage individuals that are relatively sensitive to environmental fluctuations other work in stochastic demography raises questions that we were unable to answer with the data currently contained in compadre and comadre salguero gómez et al 2015 2016 villellas et al 2013 analyzed correlations between vital rate contributions and local environmental conditions on population dynamics of populations of the herb plantago coronopus showing that lower vital rate means and higher vital rate variability in peripheral populations had an overall negative but non significant effect on the growth rates in these populations it would be interesting to see if stochastic effects are larger among peripheral populations in the datasets we analyzed to assess this would require information about the geographical distribution of populations within their distribution which is not yet contained in these databases van der meer et al 2014 investigated the effect of abandonment on populations of the grassland species succisa pratensis and found that abandonment negatively affected survival and seedling establishment but positively affected individual growth and flower production overall this lowered long term stochastic population growth rates in the abandoned populations their research suggests that it would also be interesting to analyze contributions at the lower level vital rate level to better understand the nuances of stochastic effects on mutually exclusive outcomes like dormancy and emergence davison et al 2013 caution should therefore be exercised when interpreting them as the result of phenotypic trade offs we performed sna ltres on matrix elements since we were mainly interested in the dichotomy of deterministic vs stochastic effects but a lower level vital rate analysis may reveal additional nuances that are important for particular populations for instance focusing on the relative effects of fecundity growth and survival compagnoni et al 2016 showed that vital rate correlations have little effect on stochastic population dynamics of three perennial plant species which are also present in our dataset and our analyses agree with theirs the relative contributions of correlations range from 2 1 to 5 6 while this finding is likely typical for long lived species that are buffered against stochastic effects generalizations across species require better understanding of why stochastic processes matter more in some species and environments than in others autocorrelation in vital rates across years may also be important tuljapurkar and haridas 2006 paniw et al 2018 and adding lagged correlations to ltres would reveal nuances of delayed effects like reduced growth or fertility following reproduction newell 1991 nicotra 1999 or costs of dormancy that may be delayed for years shefferson et al 2003 since davison et al 2013 found that variability in dormancy rates were the strongest driver of fitness difference among three orchid populations cypripedium calceolus the effects of lagged correlations may reveal even stronger stochastic effects and these methods are being extended to incorporate delayed effects the temporal signature of particular years with strong environmental effects can be assessed using habitat stage elasticities horvitz et al 2005 but lagged effects can also be incorporated into the sna to decompose time series data and identify the year effects driving population trajectories apart these improvements are left for future work stochastic effects are especially important in light of increasing environmental uncertainty due to anthropogenic influences such as land use changes altering disturbance regimes and global climate change increasing environmental fluctuations boyce et al 2006 understanding correlation patterns may be especially relevant in applied or conservation work where confidence in the prioritization of management interventions relies on estimates of the relative importance of demographic rates wisdom et al 2000 caution managers to consider the effects of correlation due to potential unintended consequences of actions affecting correlated rates for instance positive knock on effects may reinforce the effects of interventions at life cycle stages whose transitions are strongly correlated with other high elasticity stages on the other hand negative correlations could lead to low survival if interventions increase fertility to levels unsustainable under either physiological or environmental constraints previous methods incorporate correlations into elasticity analysis van tienderen 1995v but the sna ltre is the first to retrospectively decompose the fitness contributions of differences in correlation structure by quantifying the stochastic effects of differences in the elasticities and covariance of vital rates we learn about potential trade offs facing populations in variable environments and we may be more confident in our predictions regarding the outcomes of management interventions the sna ltre method provides an additional tool for researchers investigating stochastic population dynamics and should therefore be highly useful for applications in basic ecology and conservation biology broad scale comparisons like the one presented here help to flesh out our understanding of general life history variation however details of particular study systems form the basis of much of comparative demography and sna ltre are just as useful for finding the particular effects that are driving individual populations toward growth or decline previous applications showed how dormancy trade offs may balance to maintain relatively stationary populations davison et al 2013 or how mean vital rate effects of frequent disturbance e g mowing can swamp stochastic contributions by occurring so often that their effects vary little over time jacquemyn et al 2012 each of the study systems examined in this paper present nuances that would be interesting to researchers and managers concerned with the specific drivers of population dynamics in those systems although detailed comparisons are beyond the scope of this paper these data and methods present ample opportunity to extract more valuable information out of sna ltre for individual species and populations given the long history of ltre analysis in evolutionary ecology and conservation biology these methods should prove useful to many researchers trying to understand what factors are driving population level differences in their study systems 4 2 demographic data despite the size of the compadre database salguero gómez et al 2015 relatively few studies were suitable for our stochastic analyses 62 out of 781 or 7 9 as we have shown for plants stochastic effects may be more apparent in studies with multiple sites that capture environmental variation and local adaptation effects as well as in studies surveying enough individuals to parameterize matrix models of sufficient stage structure resolution to reflect life cycle differences in the effects of environmental variation and phenotypic correlations we therefore encourage biodemographers to continue their valuable efforts in long term demographic field studies at multiple sites especially in species groups that are currently underrepresented in long term data sets e g ferns succulents shrubs also given the availability of plant demographic data sufficient to analyze stochastic effects across populations there is a striking lack of longitudinal data describing animal s demographic rates over time in multiple populations comadre salguero gómez et al 2016 the animal counterpart to compadre contained only one out of 492 studies with data sufficient to conduct a sna ltre although environmental variability may be easier to study in plant species it is nonetheless important for animal population persistence as well and any increase in quality longitudinal data would help researchers better understand stochastic effects in animals 5 conclusions our study shows that for the 220 populations in our sample stochastic effects account for over a quarter magnitude of all drivers of observed differences in long term population growth in variable environments stochastic effects may be especially important when fitness differs widely between populations and for short lived organisms with rapid generation times and may be more important for herbaceous species with plastic life cycles especially in the study of disturbance adaptation the effects of habitat modification extreme weather effects and climate change stochastic ltres improve our understanding of the drivers of population fluctuations persistence and extinction improved understanding of how synchrony in life cycle transitions drives knock on effects through positive covariance or buffers populations through negative covariance should help conservation managers to identify and counter the negative effects of environmental variability quantifying the effects of phenotypic trade offs which may stem from zero sum allocation to survival growth and retrogression or may reflect costs of reproduction as growth and survival respond to reproduction also helps us understand life history diversity and suggests how selection differences may drive population level fitness and local adaptation given the widespread use of deterministic ltres in ecology and evolution conservation biology and environmental resource management and the minor additional effort required to quantify stochastic effects provides valuable information that is unavailable through deterministic methods funding this research was partly funded by the netherlands organization for scientific research nwo

25009,demographic rates differ between populations and also fluctuate over time sometimes driving large fitness differences but the strength of stochastic effects remain heretofore unresolved we

all contributions to population growth variation among populations mean sd 28 14 the relative importance of stochastic effects decreases with generation time and lifespan confirming predictions that longevity buffers populations against the negative effects of variability stochastic effects are larger when populations differ widely in growth rates suggesting that stochasticity is likely to be important where ecological conditions vary greatly and are larger among herbaceous perennials than among woody plants ferns and succulents possibly reflecting phenotypic plasticity in response to fluctuating environments overall we show that stochastic effects are often strong enough to warrant the additional effort required to characterize their contributions to population growth keywords correlation covariance elasticity life table response experiment small noise approximation stochastic matrix model 1 introduction populations living in natural environments experience stochastic fluctuations in local environmental conditions that drive variability in demographic rates horvitz and schemske 1995 jongejans and de kroon 2005 ozgul et al 2006 with sometimes large effects on long term population dynamics boyce et al 2006 differences in stochastic environmental processes may thereby drive population growth trajectories apart so including stochastic effects in demographic models helps researchers better understand the conditions underlying population growth and decline and also helps managers to better target conservation efforts therefore incorporating stochasticity improves

magnitude of stochastic effects across species is not well characterized in general demographic rate fluctuations reduce population growth relative to predictions based on mean rates alone boyce 1977 variability may have large effects on population fitness lande et al 2003 tuljapurkar et al 2003 davison et al 2013 or stochastic effects may be relatively small benton et al 1995 jacquemyn et al 2012 but the importance of environmental variability is likely increasing under anthropogenic disturbance and global climate change lande 1998 boyce et al 2006 when fluctuations in demographic rates are relatively small deterministic methods are nearly sufficient and inclusion of variance in addition to mean rate effects often generates accurate estimates of long term population growth lande and orzack 1988 zuidema and franco 2001 davison et al 2010 if fluctuations are large or correlated however simple stochastic methods may fail to accurately represent population dynamics one reason is that correlations among demographic rates can magnify or mitigate the effects of variability doak et al 2005 such that positive correlations may drive population decline even if mean rates would indicate increase boyce 1977 lande 1993 pfab and scholes 2004 jenouvrier et al 2009 stochastic effects are stronger if important i e high elasticity rates are positively correlated doak et al 2005 less commonly negative covariance may permit species persistence despite negative intrinsic growth rates higgins et al 2000 negative correlations may buffer population growth against variability through compensatory effects doak and morris 2010 density dependence mcdonald et al 2016 or inverse norms of reaction to environmental effects knops et al 2007 in each case stochastic effects may differ between populations so models including stochasticity may more accurately characterize population growth or decline and thereby provide valuable additional information not available through deterministic methods populations may adapt to different types of environmental variability over generations via stabilizing selection by buffering important demographic rates against variation pfister 1998 morris and doak 2004 or alternatively through phenotypic plasticity tailoring labile individual life histories to track fluctuations in local environments koons et al 2009 chevin et al 2010 jongejans et al 2010a these adaptations may be reflected in differences in elasticities which estimate potential fitness consequences of demographic rate perturbations which are suggestive of the selection pressures acting on demographic rates and life cycle transitions benton and grant 1996 and thus help managers identify the rates limiting population growth or causing local decline caswell 2000 these adaptations may also be reflected in stochastic elasticities to vital rate variability haridas and tuljapurkar 2005 which predict positive effects of environmental fluctuations in the rarer cases where higher variability benefits populations tuljapurkar et al 2003 morris and doak 2005 population level differences are also important in evolutionary ecology signaling local adaptation to distinct habitat conditions and life history divergence that may alter co evolutionary relationships or set the stage for speciation dieckmann and doebeli 1999 or stochastic influences may disrupt speciation events johansson and ripa 2006 in conservation biology where the drivers of population decline are frequent targets of management interventions population differences allow managers to identify key characteristics of populations and environments that favor persistence or extinction caswell 2000 stochastic effects may be especially important for small declining or slowly growing populations dennis 2002 and understanding more about their effects improves our understanding of life history diversity and the conditions underlying persistence or extinction to identify the actual drivers of population level differences in growth or decline in abundance comparative demographers may apply a widely used set of decomposition methods collectively called life table response experiments ltre caswell 2001 which quantify the contributions of individual rates such as fertility or survival at a given age to observed differences in population performance for review see caswell 2000 for comparison of retrospective methods see table b1 like life stage analysis lsa wisdom et al 2000 another method for estimating vital rate contributions deterministic ltre methods provide important information about the gross drivers of population differences in the form of mean vital rates but they do not address the role of environmental variability some ltre analyses consider patterns of temporal variation in matrix elements horvitz et al 1997 fréville et al 2004 jongejans and de kroon 2005 folk et al 2007 or identify year effects on populations angert 2006 and variance decomposition techniques like ltres have proven to be useful for studying how differences in various demographic processes contribute to spatiotemporal variation in population growth horvitz et al 1997 bruna and oli 2005 jiménez sierra et al 2007 but they treat temporal variation in the same way as spatial variation importantly deterministic ltres ignore the fact that persistent temporal variation in matrix elements results in a long term stochastic growth rate that is different from the deterministic growth rate in order to directly study the effects of time variation in population dynamics stochastic models are required one ltre method davison et al 2010 incorporates stochastic effects by using stochastic elasticities tuljapurkar et al 2003 haridas and tuljapurkar 2005 to estimate the contributions of vital rate variability to long term population growth another caswell 2010 distinguishes the contributions of environmental variability versus responses of demographic rates to environmental conditions while these advances provide valuable additional information about population differences neither addresses vital rate correlations which are important for both population dynamics doak et al 2005 and natural selection lande and arnold 1983 a more recent method davison et al 2013 applies an iterated kitagawa 1955 decomposition to the small noise approximation of the stochastic growth rate tuljapurkar 1990a in order to directly quantify contributions to population level differences in stochastic growth rates made by differences in 1 mean vital rates 2 variability in vital rates 3 demographic rate correlations and 4 vital rate elasticities we expect that this newer sna ltre approach to analysing temporal variability will prove especially useful in the analysis of natural populations experiencing environmental change environmental stochasticity is important for natural selection benton and grant 1996 and for the persistence of species and populations tuljapurkar and orzack 1980 for a review of stochastic matrix models in conservation see fieberg and ellner 2001 long term population growth in fluctuating environments as described in the lewontin and cohen 1969 model of the stochastic growth rate can be estimated using the stochastic growth rate λs cohen 1979 which is the appropriate measure of long term population growth in fluctuating environments caswell 2001 387 401 and which is most accurately estimated using the small noise approximation of the stochastic population growth rate sna tuljapurkar 1990a the sna ltre provides additional utility for comparative demography and allows researchers to ask more nuanced questions about the factors driving population growth or decline patterning of the contributions of vital rate variation tell us important information about the potential for demographic buffering against the negative effects of environmental variation pfister 1998 the fitness effects of differences in vital rate correlations may reveal information about the trade offs underlying vital rate effects stearns 1983 koenig and knops 1998 and population growth effects of elasticity differences may tell us about spatial variation in selection pressures benton and grant 1999 and local adaptation pickup et al 2012 in this paper we demonstrate the value of sna ltre decomposition for comparing the population level effects of environmental stochasticity across 62 species we show that stochastic effects are common across plant species and that in many populations stochastic contributions are large enough to warrant the extra effort required to estimate their effects we also test several predictions based on ecological theory first because mean demographic rates summarize gross differences in population performance as demonstrated by the good fit in many deterministic ltre studies we expect mean rates to be the dominant driver of variation in population dynamics how strong stochastic effects are in general is an empirical question that we attempt to answer using available time series data describing population dynamics second because longevity buffers populations against temporal stochastic effects morris et al 2008 we expect stochastic effects to play a smaller role in explaining among population differences in long lived species third we predict that stochastic effects will be stronger among herbaceous plants than among other plant growth forms ramula and lehtilä 2005 so we compare herbaceous perennials to the remainder of our species which we had to lump due to small numbers shrubs trees succulents ferns and one pair of animal populations last we predict that stochastic effects will be stronger when population growth rates differ widely because large spatial differences in population performance are likely to result in diverging elasticity patterns and may also reflect strong effects of stochastic environments however even large stochastic contributions may balance to yield small net contributions to population growth differences davison et al 2013 so we examine both the direction and magnitude of stochastic effects 2 methods 2 1 data collection we

davison et al 2013 2 4 study characteristics and life history traits we examine underlying relationships of stochastic contributions with several study characteristics such as study duration and number of populations as well as with species life history traits such as generation time and life expectancy table 1 each study compared multiple populations of each species m 2 and anova showed significant study effects on stochastic contributions p 0 001 to deal with this nestedness we statistically analyze values averaged per species table 1 and we repeat each regression analysis with a

avoid confounding life expectancy of species with very low seed bank or seedling survival we use maximum stage specific remaining life expectancies ex in the regression analyses because herbaceous plants are demographically distinct silvertown et al 1993 and because stochastic effects may be stronger for herbaceous species ramula and lehtilä 2005 we compare the 169 populations of 48 herbaceous perennial species with all other species pooled to see if they differ significantly in stochastic effects because there are so few populations of each of the other growth forms we do not compare them

cases p 0 2 phylogenetic linear regressions at the species level show similar patterns as the standard regression at the population level table 1 differences in stochastic growth rates and average generation time again showed consistent patterns whereas the correlation of stochastic effects and mean stochastic growth rate is significant across populations but not across species table 1 4 discussion across 220 populations representing 62 plant and one animal species stochastic processes make substantial contributions in some cases accounting for more than half of the growth differences between populations although effects of mean demographic rates are usually more important than stochastic effects over a quarter of all contributions were via stochastic processes indicating that sna ltres capture important effects that are missed by deterministic ltres in classic ltres covariance is used in the decomposition of variance in population growth rates brault and caswell 1993 caswell 2001 thus revealing the importance of correlation without quantifying it directly the sna ltre extends this variance decomposition allowing us to quantify the contribution of variability to differences in long term population growth vs stochastic contributions of demographic rate correlations and elasticities whereas contributions of variability cσ are always negative correlation contributions cρ and net contributions of covariance cς can be positive fig 1 decomposing these two elements of covariance provides additional information not available using previous methods table s1 our results show that stochastic effects contribute generally more to population differences in short lived species which complements earlier findings of stronger roles of stochasticity within populations of shorter lived species menges 1992 morris and doak 2004 stochastic effects are especially strong among declining populations and in populations with large differences in intrinsic growth rates garcía et al 2008 which are precisely those of greatest conservation concern menges 1992 this further underscores the importance of incorporating stochasticity into conservation models we also confirmed that herbaceous perennials differ from other species silvertown et al 1993 but our sample was too small to detect differences among the other types of organisms six study characteristics and life history traits explained some portion of the observed variation in stochastic contributions generation time maximum remaining life expectancy matrix dimension the number of populations and the intrinsic deterministic growth rate table 1 figs b3 s7 but study duration was not significant table 1 fig b8 as expected stochastic effects were less important among long lived species table 1 figs 3 b4 this supports theory predicting that long lived species are buffered against temporal fluctuations morris et al 2008 through bet hedging trade offs slatkin 1974 and iteroparity tuljapurkar 1990b positive and negative correlation effects act across the entire life cycle and are correlated with both generation time and life expectancy whereas variability effects differ with generation time but not with life expectancy this suggests that the negative effects of uncorrelated stochastic noise are buffered more by the pace of fertility than by the pace of mortality studies with larger matrix dimensions had lower contributions of cv differences table 1 fig b5 which is somewhat unexpected since larger matrices with more stage transitions generally allow for more variation in survival growth and retrogression salguero gómez and plotkin 2010 however a larger number of stage transitions may also allow a broader distribution of positive and negative contributions that cancel at the population level whereas restructuring matrices with fewer stages would summarize the combined effect over a larger number of transitions and may obscure the effects of variability also long lived species e g trees are often modeled with larger matrices than herbaceous species with smaller growth forms and fewer growth classes lower matrix dimension may be the result of small sample sizes insufficient to parameterize larger matrices that more precisely model stage transitions ramula and lehtilä 2005 thus obscuring potential effects of covariation among vital rates this may be especially important for herbaceous perennials ramula and lehtilä 2005 which comprise 73 of our sample and for short lived species in which the smallest establishment stages are especially important for population fitness salguero gómez and plotkin 2010 we suggest that researchers will have more explanatory power if they obtain sample sizes of sufficient spatial breadth and temporal depth to estimate vital rate covariance effects in addition to sampling effects from the number of individuals observed in each study site study design also limits our ability to detect stochastic effects through the number of sites studied correlation effects were stronger in study systems with more surveyed populations table 1 fig b6 suggesting that including a wider range of study sites may reveal differences in trade offs or synchrony that are missed by smaller studies this may be because a wider variety of habitats with distinct correlation patterns are sampled whereas covariance is reduced in the averaged vital rates of the reference matrix via portfolio effects hector et al 2010 rapidly growing populations had smaller elasticity contributions table 1 fig b7 it is well known that growing and declining populations often have contrasting elasticity patterns de kroon et al 2000d and we show that where population growth rates differ widely there are larger effects of differences in elasticities and correlations and mean effects are smaller table 1 fig b3 this suggests that studies examining large deviations in vital rates should consider stochastic effects and this may be especially important in conservation studies where some populations are declining rapidly and others are declining slowly or increasing 4 1 alternative approaches and future directions stochastic contributions may reflect differences in environmental effects like local microclimate or localized disturbance but also reflect different phenotypic and life history responses to shared environments so it is important to note here the distinction between shared environments at different scales we found that stochastic effects were larger in spatially diverse study systems that may have a broad range of habitats spatially distinct populations may be close enough geographically to share a common weather environment and yet have fixed differences in terms of their soil structure nutrient availability or other local habitat characteristics van der meer et al 2016v these differences may influence populations responses to a common shared temporal weather sequence and may alter the degree or even the sign of correlations between vital rates in other words fixed site specific environmental conditions may produce differences in demographic responses to environmental conditions or in the average demographic rates themselves regardless of these responses and this may drive distinct responses to temporal vs spatial variation jongejans and de kroon 2005 for instance differences in the contributions of variability at the site level may reflect local habitat differences vs regional differences reflecting differences in broader climate patterns jongejans et al 2010b the distinction between the demographic rate responses of distinct populations and differences in the environmental drivers of these responses is addressed by caswell 2010 see below another caveat is that phenotypic correlations may not reflect underlying demographic trade offs but rather opportunity costs of zero sum rules governing transitions out of a given stage class morris and doak 2004 although the contributions of these correlations are informative about stochastic effects alternative stochastic sltre approaches were simultaneously published in a previous special feature in matrix modeling advances salguero gómez and de kroon 2010 the approach of caswell 2010 decomposes differences in stochastic population growth rates as a function of environmental state dynamics autocorrelation and vital rate responses to environmental states while the sltre presented by davison et al 2010 uses stochastic elasticities to decompose differences in stochastic growth rates into contributions from differences in means vs variance in vital rates although the sna ltre results presented here address effects of environmental stochasticity these previous approaches cannot it would be interesting to compare our results to those that would be obtained using these other methods caswell s 2010 method would more directly provide information about autocorrelation and the environmental drivers of stochastic effects while the previous approach of davison et al 2010 would allow us to assess the utility of stochastic elasticities tuljapurkar et al 2003 haridas and tuljapurkar 2005 for predicting the effect of variability on population level differences a comprehensive comparison of the different methods available which is beyond the scope of the current paper could help researchers choose ltres that would best serve their study goals table b1 summarizes six retrospective decomposition methods other transient and stochastic ltres may provide complementary insights to sna ltre analyses koons et al 2016 used transient ltres to distinguish contributions of vital rates vs population structure and found that population structure was most important for short term population growth in populations with low survival in our analyses the effect of generation time could be partially explained by population structure with short generation populations containing more early stage individuals that are relatively sensitive to environmental fluctuations other work in stochastic demography raises questions that we were unable to answer with the data currently contained in compadre and comadre salguero gómez et al 2015 2016 villellas et al 2013 analyzed correlations between vital rate contributions and local environmental conditions on population dynamics of populations of the herb plantago coronopus showing that lower vital rate means and higher vital rate variability in peripheral populations had an overall negative but non significant effect on the growth rates in these populations it would be interesting to see if stochastic effects are larger among peripheral populations in the datasets we analyzed to assess this would require information about the geographical distribution of populations within their distribution which is not yet contained in these databases van der meer et al 2014 investigated the effect of abandonment on populations of the grassland species succisa pratensis and found that abandonment negatively affected survival and seedling establishment but positively affected individual growth and flower production overall this lowered long term stochastic population growth rates in the abandoned populations their research suggests that it would also be interesting to analyze contributions at the lower level vital rate level to better understand the nuances of stochastic effects on mutually exclusive outcomes like dormancy and emergence davison et al 2013 caution should therefore be exercised when interpreting them as the result of phenotypic trade offs we performed sna ltres on matrix elements since we were mainly interested in the dichotomy of deterministic vs stochastic effects but a lower level vital rate analysis may reveal additional nuances that are important for particular populations for instance focusing on the relative effects of fecundity growth and survival compagnoni et al 2016 showed that vital rate correlations have little effect on stochastic population dynamics of three perennial plant species which are also present in our dataset and our analyses agree with theirs the relative contributions of correlations range from 2 1 to 5 6 while this finding is likely typical for long lived species that are buffered against stochastic effects generalizations across species require better understanding of why stochastic processes matter more in some species and environments than in others autocorrelation in vital rates across years may also be important tuljapurkar and haridas 2006 paniw et al 2018 and adding lagged correlations to ltres would reveal nuances of delayed effects like reduced growth or fertility following reproduction newell 1991 nicotra 1999 or costs of dormancy that may be delayed for years shefferson et al 2003 since davison et al 2013 found that variability in dormancy rates were the strongest driver of fitness difference among three orchid populations cypripedium calceolus the effects of lagged correlations may reveal even stronger stochastic effects and these methods are being extended to incorporate delayed effects the temporal signature of particular years with strong environmental effects can be assessed using habitat stage elasticities horvitz et al 2005 but lagged effects can also be incorporated into the sna to decompose time series data and identify the year effects driving population trajectories apart these improvements are left for future work stochastic effects are especially important in light of increasing environmental uncertainty due to anthropogenic influences such as land use changes altering disturbance regimes and global climate change increasing environmental fluctuations boyce et al 2006 understanding correlation patterns may be especially relevant in applied or conservation work where confidence in the prioritization of management interventions relies on estimates of the relative importance of demographic rates wisdom et al 2000 caution managers to consider the effects of correlation due to potential unintended consequences of actions affecting correlated rates for instance positive knock on effects may reinforce the effects of interventions at life cycle stages whose transitions are strongly correlated with other high elasticity stages on the other hand negative correlations could lead to low survival if interventions increase fertility to levels unsustainable under either physiological or environmental constraints previous methods incorporate correlations into elasticity analysis van tienderen 1995v but the sna ltre is the first to retrospectively decompose the fitness contributions of differences in correlation structure by quantifying the stochastic effects of differences in the elasticities and covariance of vital rates we learn about potential trade offs facing populations in variable environments and we may be more confident in our predictions regarding the outcomes of management interventions the sna ltre method provides an additional tool for researchers investigating stochastic population dynamics and should therefore be highly useful for applications in basic ecology and conservation biology broad scale comparisons like the one presented here help to flesh out our understanding of general life history variation however details of particular study systems form the basis of much of comparative demography and sna ltre are just as useful for finding the particular effects that are driving individual populations toward growth or decline previous applications showed how dormancy trade offs may balance to maintain relatively stationary populations davison et al 2013 or how mean vital rate effects of frequent disturbance e g mowing can swamp stochastic contributions by occurring so often that their effects vary little over time jacquemyn et al 2012 each of the study systems examined in this paper present nuances that would be interesting to researchers and managers concerned with the specific drivers of population dynamics in those systems although detailed comparisons are beyond the scope of this paper these data and methods present ample opportunity to extract more valuable information out of sna ltre for individual species and populations given the long history of ltre analysis in evolutionary ecology and conservation biology these methods should prove useful to many researchers trying to understand what factors are driving population level differences in their study systems 4 2 demographic data despite the size of the compadre database salguero gómez et al 2015 relatively few studies were suitable for our stochastic analyses 62 out of 781 or 7 9 as we have shown for plants stochastic effects may be more apparent in studies with multiple sites that capture environmental variation and local adaptation effects as well as in studies surveying enough individuals to parameterize matrix models of sufficient stage structure resolution to reflect life cycle differences in the effects of environmental variation and phenotypic correlations we therefore encourage biodemographers to continue their valuable efforts in long term demographic field studies at multiple sites especially in species groups that are currently underrepresented in long term data sets e g ferns succulents shrubs also given the availability of plant demographic data sufficient to analyze stochastic effects across populations there is a striking lack of longitudinal data describing animal s demographic rates over time in multiple populations comadre salguero gómez et al 2016 the animal counterpart to compadre contained only one out of 492 studies with data sufficient to conduct a sna ltre although environmental variability may be easier to study in plant species it is nonetheless important for animal population persistence as well and any increase in quality longitudinal data would help researchers better understand stochastic effects in animals 5 conclusions our study shows that for the 220 populations in our sample stochastic effects account for over a quarter magnitude of all drivers of observed differences in long term population growth in variable environments stochastic effects may be especially important when fitness differs widely between populations and for short lived organisms with rapid generation times and may be more important for herbaceous species with plastic life cycles especially in the study of disturbance adaptation the effects of habitat modification extreme weather effects and climate change stochastic ltres improve our understanding of the drivers of population fluctuations persistence and extinction improved understanding of how synchrony in life cycle transitions drives knock on effects through positive covariance or buffers populations through negative covariance should help conservation managers to identify and counter the negative effects of environmental variability quantifying the effects of phenotypic trade offs which may stem from zero sum allocation to survival growth and retrogression or may reflect costs of reproduction as growth and survival respond to reproduction also helps us understand life history diversity and suggests how selection differences may drive population level fitness and local adaptation given the widespread use of deterministic ltres in ecology and evolution conservation biology and environmental resource management and the minor additional effort required to quantify
