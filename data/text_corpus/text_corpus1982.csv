9910,achieving high crop yield with less irrigation is important to improve water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp in water limited regions in the north china plain ncp coupling the impacts of precipitation and irrigation on the crop yield is therefore an essential tool for understanding crop response to different water sources and forecasting irrigation water requirements in this study the ceres wheat model was used to simulate winter wheat yield wp and iwp under different irrigation schedules no deficit full and automatic irrigation and three precipitation category years wet normal and dry years results showed that the amount of precipitation fluctuated significantly over site years leading to considerably varied irrigation water requirements for the wet year deficit two irrigations at greening and jointing stages treatment 11 alleviated water stress during key winter wheat growth periods contributing to increasing biomass yield wp and iwp however when reducing the irrigation amount by 50 a significant increase in wp and a nonsignificant difference in yield were found at fengqiu and shangqiu two irrigation applications 11 improved pre anthesis biomass and wheat yield while achieving high wp and iwp in normal and dry years except for extreme drought conditions the finding also indicated that the distribution of growing season precipitation exerted a significant impact on irrigation time if the early season precipitation was low shifting the irrigation to an earlier time to ensure pre anthesis water requirements which can synchronously achieve the goals of increasing wp and maintaining a higher yield in conclusion optimizing irrigation strategies to various precipitation conditions will be a promising and effective practice for wheat production and water conservation keywords north china plain winter wheat deficit irrigation water productivity ceres wheat model 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the main food crops in the north china plain ncp wang et al 2016 production of which accounts for about 70 of entire wheat production in china lu and fan 2013 lv et al 2017 however water shortage greatly constrains the wheat production over this region fang et al 2010 wang et al 2001 the rainfall during the winter wheat growth period can meet only 25 40 of crop water demands leaving a 200 300 mm water deficit in the ncp cao et al 2013a liu et al 2001 thus supplemental irrigation is essential to fulfilling the large crop water demand for maintaining high wheat production chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2003 zhou et al 2007 groundwater is the major source of irrigation water in the ncp traditional irrigation strategies generally apply more than 300 mm of water during the growing season which has led to low water productivity wp li et al 2012 over exploitation of groundwater has reduced the groundwater table caused severe environmental problems and threatened sustainable agricultural development chen et al 2003 han et al 2016 wang et al 2009 substantial improvement should be made to reduce or even eliminate the current agricultural use of groundwater difallah et al 2017 wang et al 2001 however supplemental irrigation is essential to obtaining a higher winter wheat yield fang et al 2010 kijne et al 2003 consequently efficient and sustainable water management is urgently needed to resolve the conflict between yield improvement and irrigation water consumption to ensure the long term sustainability of irrigated agriculture water saving irrigation schedules with high yields will become more important deficit irrigation typically defined as an irrigation strategy that the application of irrigation water below the full crop water requirement is a promising approach to minimizing irrigation water use tari 2016 deficit irrigation only at critical growth stages has been broadly utilized to increase water productivity chai et al 2016 jensen et al 2014 kang and zhang 2004 this approach can close the gap of crop water requirements at sensitive growth stages and allows moderate water stress at nonsensitive growth stages however inconsistent irrigation strategies are recommended based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of irrigation schedules bian et al 2016 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2016 these differences may be attributed to the large variability of seasonal precipitation seasonal precipitation is a key factor for wheat yield in ncp as it directly affects the irrigation water demand and water balance of winter wheat chen et al 2014 dar et al 2017 thus the development of appropriate and effective water saving practices needs to consider the differences in seasonal precipitation previous studies were mainly location specific field experiments chen et al 2010 wu et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 but field experiments are time and labor costly because of the critical input data requirement in soil types cultivars meteorological data and management practices therefore process based modeling is a valuable and feasible tool used to assess the effect of different climate conditions and irrigation schedules on crop yield and productivity geerts and raes 2009 heng et al 2007 dssat model has high accuracy in simulating crop growth and development jones et al 2003 including phenology dates biomass and grain yield ceres wheat which is embedded in the dssat software is a wheat growth simulation model and has been widely evaluated by many researchers to assess the effect of irrigation water on wheat production arora et al 2007 attia et al 2016 benli et al 2007 the optimized irrigation schedules have been thoroughly studied and widely applied to improve wheat yield and increase wp qin et al 2018 li et al 2005 and xu et al 2018 reported that two irrigations could be adequate for winter wheat in the ncp lv et al 2011 proposed that single irrigation at jointing could produce a higher yield and wp than traditional practices in shandong province bian et al 2016 found that two irrigations of 60 mm at both jointing and heading stages resulted in a higher yield than applying 120 mm only at the jointing stage however these studies are scattered based on the finite set of irrigation experiments in local orientated climate conditions and have less capability of extrapolation in making accurate schedules considering the large spatial variation in rainfall the irrigation performance needs further comprehensive analysis it is imperative to choose multiple stations based on the different growing season precipitation patterns to fully investigate suitable irrigation schedules and assess water use utilization thus in this study six representative stations were selected from different rainfall types along the west east and south north integrated with the ceres wheat model to simulate the effects of different irrigation schemes rainfed deficit full and automatic irrigation on yield and to explore irrigation treatments of high yield and high wp the ceres wheat model was used in this study with the objectives to 1 evaluate winter wheat yield evapotranspiration et and wp response to different irrigation schedules and 2 explore high wp and irrigation water productivity iwp to provide theoretical support for popularization and application of optimizing irrigation measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the north china plain ncp includes hebei henan shandong provinces and the beijing and tianjin municipalities with the exclusion of the north of hebei province where winter wheat cannot grow because of annual accumulated temperature below 4200 c d liu and han 1987 fig 1 the main crops are irrigated winter wheat and summer maize prevailing soils in ncp are formed of fluvial materials from the yellow river which is fertile and favorable for arable farming cao et al 2013b however water shortage and over exploitation of groundwater threaten sustainable food production in this region the climate of the ncp is temperate and monsoonal with rainy hot summers and dry cold winters the average annual temperature ranges from 12 0 to 13 meng et al 2007 the mean annual precipitation decreases from the southwest to the northeast in addition the seasonal distribution of precipitation is uneven with about 70 of the precipitation concentrates in the maize growing season june to september while only approximately 30 of it occurs during the growing season of winter wheat end of september or october in the sowing year to june next year in ncp the mean precipitation in the winter wheat growing season is only about 122 225 mm which is usually insufficient to meet the winter wheat water demand sun et al 2010 and this gap varies considerably due to the precipitation variability hence six stations changping cp luancheng lc yucheng yc taian ta fengqiu fq and shangqiu sq along the west east and south north were chosen according to long term 1980 2015 average growing season precipitation to investigate the effects of variation in rainfall on irrigation schedules six stations selected are cp with precipitation of less than 140 mm lc and yc of 140 180 mm ta and fq of 180 220 mm and sq of more than 220 mm precipitation shows an increasing pattern from the northeast to the southwest during the winter wheat growing season 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 crop management information in this study the ceres wheat model was used to simulate winter wheat yield and water use at six representative stations in the ncp the model requires crop management information including planting dates planting density planting depth

zhengmai9023 and yumai 34 were planted at lc yc fq and sq respectively crop data on wheat phenology cultivar type yields et and management information at cp were collected from xing et al 2016 while ta was obtained from bian et al 2016 and qi et al 2011 the wheat cultivars jing9843 and jimai 22 were used at cp and ta respectively the detailed general information and the management practices for each station are given in supplementary table s1 2 2 2 climate data climatic data including the daily maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine hours and precipitation these data were collected from the china meteorological administration cma http www cma gov cn daily solar radiation was estimated by sunshine hours using the angstrom formula black et al 1954 each of the six stations directly collected data from weather stations managed by cma to capture the spatial variability of winter wheat growing season precipitation fig 1 daily precipitation data from 40 meteorological stations uniformly distributed was used for interpolating over the ncp based on the inverse distance weighting method shukla et al 2020 the winter wheat growing season accumulative precipitation values were calculated by summing daily precipitation from sowing dates to harvest dates sowing and harvest dates varied regionally and ranged from early october to late june in the north and from late october to early june in the south of the ncp 2 2 3 soil data the soil data used in our study was obtained from the china soil scientific database http vdb3 soil csdb cn and the national ecosystem observation and research network http www cnern org cn soil types at six stations are loam and clay loam which are the dominant soil texture selected for simulation soil properties at different layers were collected and as input information including soil bulk density bd drained upper limit dul lower limit ll and saturated volumetric water content sat etc detailed information including the bulk and hydraulic parameters were summarized in table 1 2 3 crop model and simulation 2 3 1 ceres wheat model the ceres wheat model is a component driven mechanism model which dynamically simulates crop growth and development from planting to harvest on a daily time step taking into account the effects of weather genotype soil water carbon and nitrogen planting irrigation and fertilizer management dente et al 2008 rinaldi 2004 thorp et al 2010 currently it has been widely applied to different regions with variable climates and environments ahmad et al 2019 dokoohaki et al 2017 crop parameters and physiological characteristics are given in the form of genetic coefficients a detailed description of the model can be found in jones et al 2003 four phenology coefficients p1v p1d p5 and phint impact plant phenological development while the other three growth coefficients g1 g2 and g3 are related to grain yield generally wheat phenological development is divided into several phases based on growing degree days gdd leaf area development is dependent on the availability of assimilates temperature water deficit and nitrogen stress biomass accumulation is computed as a function of photosynthetically active intercepted radiation and radiation use efficiency the final grain yield is calculated as the product of grain number plant population and grain weight 2 3 2 simulation of crop water use the ceres wheat model could adequately simulate the water stress effect crop growth stage and daily et acting as a valuable tool for helping to study how to improve wp in the agriculture system saseendran et al 2008 crop water use et related to the crop life cycle is simulated through the soil water balance of the ceres wheat model the soil water balance module is computed based on precipitation irrigation soil evaporation transpiration drainage surface runoff and infiltration all processes that directly affect water content in the soil profile throughout the seasonal simulation the model utilizes a simple cascading method to apportion infiltrated water among different soil layers runoff is estimated based on the antecedent soil water content and drainage is estimated by the slowest draining layer of the soil profile actual soil evaporation is based on a two stage process ritchie 1972 plant transpiration is calculated from the distribution of roots and available water in the soil layer root distribution and extractable water in soil layers could modify potential transpiration for actual water uptake or transpiration the details of the soil water balance module are expressed as the following equation 1 et p i δ s d r where et is evapotranspiration p is precipitation i is irrigation s is the difference in soil water storage between the initial soil content at the time of sowing and the harvest time content d is soil water drainage r is surface runoff 2 4 calibration and validation the ceres wheat model was calibrated using experimental data from six stations firstly genetic parameters were derived using a trial and error method to match the simulated anthesis and maturity dates to the observed ones then the model was run with the derived crop phenological parameters and the performance was checked in terms of yield soil water content and et the calibrated genetic coefficients were described in table 2 after calibration the model was validated by comparing the observed data on phenology yield et and soil water content during the other years table 3 to evaluate the performance of the model the statistical indicators of coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse and willmott s index of agreement d willmott 1982 were used to check the agreement between observed and simulated values the formulas are as follows 2 r 2 i 1 n s i s m i m 2 i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n m i m 2 3 rmse i 1 n s i m i 2 n 100 4 nrmse i 1 n s i m i 2 n m 100 5 d 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n s i m m i m 2 0 d 1 where s i is the simulated value m i is the observed value s is the average of simulated values m is the average of observed values n is a sample size a larger value of r2 corresponds to a better model simulation rmse is chosen to evaluate the goodness of fit of soil water content rmse is less than 0 1 indicates an excellent fit when it is between 0 1 and 0 2 the fit is good when it is between 0 2 and 0 3 the fit is moderate if it is larger than 0 3 the fit is poor a value of nrmse smaller than 10 indicates a good simulation accuracy nrmse between 20 and 30 indicates a general accuracy and nrmse larger than 30 indicates a poor accuracy the value of d close to 1 indicates a good agreement between the simulated and observed values while a d value of zero indicates no predictability iglesias 2009 2 5 simulation experiments different irrigation treatments no deficit full and automatic irrigation were conducted to determine the effects of different irrigation levels on yield including different irrigation timing over wintering greening jointing heading and grain filling frequency zero one two three four five and automatic and amount 0 80 160 240 320 400 mm and automatic no irrigation was managed without irrigation deficit irrigation was applied to guarantee crop growth which was irrigated one to four times full irrigation was irrigated with five irrigations at the stages of over wintering greening jointing heading and grain filling zhang et al 2006 automatic irrigation was set based on the soil water content of 50 field capacity and the irrigation amount was calculated by comparing the soil moisture in soil profiles with the target upper limits 100 of field capacity in the main root zone 0 1 m the per irrigation amount of all the irrigation treatments was 80 mm details of irrigation treatments are listed in table 4 for all irrigation schedules the initial soil water condition was the field capacity zhang et al 2004 zhou et al 2018 this was adequate for winter wheat emergence and germination moreover all irrigation simulation experiments were conducted without nutrition stress 2 6 classification of precipitation category years we used the pearson type iii distribution method to classify different precipitation years the different precipitation years are a reflection of the precipitation during the winter wheat growing season the steps of the pearson type iii distribution method are as follows 1 rank precipitation in the wheat growing season of each year in descending order based on the total number of growing seasons 2 assign a rank of m to each descending order with 1 being the largest and n being the smallest 3 calculate the empirical probability p of the pearson type iii distribution chow et al 1988 6 p m n 1 100 4 divide n observations into different categories of precipitation years according to their p value zhang et al 2016 the precipitation years are divided into three classes wet year normal year and dry year with separate points of 25 50 and 75 p values respectively 2 7 modeling and data analysis the calibrated ceres wheat model was then used to assess the effects of precipitation and different irrigation schedules on winter wheat yield wp and iwp wp is defined as the ratio of crop yield to water lorite et al 2013 it is used to evaluate optimum irrigation management strategies to ensure the most efficient use of water resources liu et al 2016 iwp is an effective indicator and combines grain yield and the cost of irrigation du et al 2010 wp and iwp are shown in eqs 7 and 8 7 wp yi et 8 iwp yi y0 i where wp is water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 yi is irrigated yield kg ha 1 iwp is irrigation water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 y0 is rainfed yield kg ha 1 i is total irrigation amount mm 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the evaluation performance of the model was shown in fig 2 the results showed that the simulated anthesis agreed well with the observed anthesis with r2 of 0 89 nrmse of 2 25 and d values of 1 00 fig 2a the r2 nrmse and d between simulated and observed maturity were 0 80 2 71 and 0 99 fig 2b moreover simulated yields were well matched with the observations r2 0 84 nrmse 6 67 d 0 88 fig 2c the simulated et was in good agreement with the observed et with r2 0 70 nrmse 5 65 and d 0 99 fig 2d by comparison between measured and simulated soil water content it exposed that the simulated soil water content at different depths agreed well with the observed values fig 3 the rmse of the whole soil profile ranged from 0 010 to 0 052 cm3cm 3 at lc from 0 009 to 0 038 cm3cm 3 at yc from 0 015 to 0 054 cm3cm 3 at fq and from 0 018 to 0 033 cm3cm 3at sq stations respectively all the rmse were less than 0 1 cm3cm 3 the r2 and d values were between 0 31 and 0 90 and 0 60 0 97 at lc 0 50 0 90 and 0 80 0 99 at yc 0 15 0 88 and 0 48 0 93 at fq and 0 69 0 91 and 0 88 0 96 at sq respectively overall the above model evaluation results indicated that the ceres wheat model could well be applied to simulate phenological development yield information and water balance for winter wheat 3 2 precipitation characteristics during the winter wheat growing season winter wheat growing season precipitation at cp lc yc ta fq and sq stations from 1980 to 2015 was shown in fig 4 precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat exhibited higher variability with a coefficient of variation of 42 7 44 0 33 3 33 6 39 0 and 33 8 respectively moreover precipitation with an average value of 133 130 122 172 174 and 225 mm respectively was considerably lower than the winter wheat water requirement therefore winter wheat primarily depended on irrigation to produce a high yield and it was necessary to analyze the impact of irrigation treatments on winter wheat in different precipitation years in the 36 year time series of precipitation weather data the pearson iii type distribution method was used to classify the year type of precipitation i e wet normal and dry years moreover the precipitation distribution across the different precipitation years was shown in fig 5 profound variability in monthly rainfall amount and distribution was observed for all precipitation years growing season rainfall was unevenly distributed and was less than 50 mm across all the stations except sq from february march during the normal and dry years precipitation in february or march even was less than 20 mm however the higher rainfall before heading april or may may result in better vegetative and growth which played an important role in wheat production zhang et al 2013 3 3 changes of soil water storage δs and evapotranspiration et 3 3 1 changes of soil water storage δs fig 6 depicted the s for three precipitation years with different irrigation schedules as irrigation increased s decreased significantly and deficit irrigation treatments extracted more water than full and automatic irrigation treatments supplementary fig s1 moreover s varied based on irrigation treatments and precipitation levels in different years in the wet year the higher s was obtained by one irrigation treatment 4 at lc yc and ta three stations while one irrigation treatment 3 at cp and one irrigation treatment 2 at fq switching from one irrigation to two irrigations significantly reduced s at all cp lc yc ta fq and sq six stations even increasing irrigation from 0 mm to 80 mm led to a significant reduction in s for the sq station during the normal and dry years one irrigation treatment 4 kept s at a high level changing from one irrigation treatment 4 to two irrigation treatments 11 led to s reduction by 0 6 0 1 5 0 2 5 4 and 2 5 in normal year respectively additionally the corresponding reduction in dry year for six stations was only 0 0 1 2 3 5 1 9 and 3 7 respectively 3 3 2 evapotranspiration et the et magnitude of each precipitation year was similar for most of the stations in which no irrigation had the least et and full irrigation had the most et fig 7 there was no significant difference between full irrigation and automatic irrigation however the greater the precipitation the smaller the incremental change in et was observed et didn t change among the treatments for the sq site due to the relatively abundant rainfall in the wet year similar to s et in irrigation at the greening or jointing stage was higher than that at the heading or grain filling stage this may be related to the enhanced water utilization of winter wheat with the canopy s rapid development during the greening to jointing period furthermore the irrigation treatments and precipitation years had a significant effect on the et for the wet year treatment 11 significantly increased the et and reached 90 7 92 7 91 9 97 3 94 0 and 100 of the treatment 32 for cp lc yc ta fq and sq stations respectively however during the normal and dry years there was a large difference in et between treatment 11 and treatment 32 the amount of irrigation increased would offset the reduction in soil water storage and improve et four irrigation treatments 27 increased the et to be as high as in full irrigation treatment 32 except at cp et was 8 6 and 16 0 lower under treatment 27 than under treatment 32 during the normal and dry years at the cp station 3 3 3 evapotranspiration et of different growth stages the et of different growth stages under various irrigation treatments was shown in fig 8 the effects of irrigation on et at different stages were similar during the three precipitation years from sowing to jointing the et under irrigation at the pre jointing stage was significantly greater than that at the post jointing stage deficit two irrigation treatments 7 or 11 could result in the highest pre jointing et while using the least irrigation amount one irrigation treatment 4 significantly increased jointing to the anthesis et in addition two irrigation treatments 8 and 11 which irrigation was 1 5 times lower than that of full irrigation 32 but they obtained similar jointing to anthesis et irrigation at the pre jointing significantly decreased anthesis to maturity et compared with that at the post jointing nevertheless the total et in two irrigation treatments 8 or 11 was significantly higher indicating that the more increment in pre anthesis et was as compared to a reduction in post anthesis et moreover the variation of et at different stages was influenced by the growing season rainfall in the wet year with an abundant rainfall supplement no differences in the et of growth stages were observed among all treatments at the sq station 3 4 yield and biomass accumulation 3 4 1 yield changes in the yield of winter wheat with different irrigation schedules in the three precipitation years were given in fig 9 the range of no irrigation yields was 3546 8178 kg ha 1 2363 7733 kg ha 1 and 1765 3137 kg ha 1 during the wet normal and dry years respectively the yield of winter wheat was synthetically affected by both precipitation and irrigation yields exhibited an increasing trend with the increase in irrigation at five stations but it didn t change at sq during the wet year moreover irrigation at different growth stages significantly affected the degree of yield increment in the wet year yields from one irrigation treatment 4 were significantly higher than those of no irrigation treatment 1 at lc yc and ta stations one irrigation treatment 3 considerably improved yield at cp while one irrigation treatment 2 increased yield by 11 0 at fq the yield kept increasing when irrigation increased to two irrigation treatments of 11 at lc yc and ta stations while two irrigation treatments 7 at cp station the wheat yield reached a plateau under two irrigations at cp lc yc and ta four stations however at fq one irrigation could substantially increase the yield and keep it at a high level in normal and dry years treatment 4 significantly increased yield at all stations except sq moreover changing from one irrigation treatment 4 to two irrigation treatments 11 significantly increased yield except at cp with the irrigation amount increasing the yield increased by 1309 kg ha 1 at cp during the dry year 3 4 2 biomass accumulation fig 10 depicted biomass accumulation at various stages of growth biomass at different growing stages greatly affected by irrigation treatments in the early growth stage biomass accumulation did not differ markedly with various irrigation schedules data not shown from the jointing to maturity stages biomass accumulation under irrigation was significantly higher than under no irrigation except for the sq but the increment became smaller with the increasing precipitation water supply in the wet year two irrigation treatments 8 and 11 greatly enhanced the jointing anthesis and maturity biomass at lc yc ta and fq stations at cp the high jointing and anthesis biomass was found in two irrigation treatments 7 and maturity biomass increased notably with the irrigation increase in the normal year jointing biomass under deficit two irrigation treatments 11 was 1 6 0 1 1 0 0 32 and 0 lower than under automatic irrigation treatment 33 at six stations respectively moreover anthesis biomass was similar between treatment 11 and treatment 33 at maturity the biomass difference between treatment 11 and treatment 33 expanded but obtained a similar yield this may be due to the moderately limited irrigation that significantly increased jointing and anthesis biomass and then improved the yield in the dry year jointing anthesis was 1 9 2 6 0 0 3 and 1 9 lower under treatment 11 than under treatment 33 at cp lc yc ta and fq respectively at wheat anthesis biomass reached a plateau when applied to two irrigation treatments 11 at lc yc ta and fq simultaneously there wasn t a significant difference in jointing and anthesis biomass between treatment 7 and 33 at sq at the wheat maturity stage large differences in biomass were found between two irrigations and full irrigation at all stations 3 5 water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp 3 5 1 water productivity wp the various irrigation scenarios greatly affected the magnitude of wp under different precipitation years for winter wheat fig 11 the wp under deficit irrigation was higher than under full or automatic irrigation because of more reduction in et as compared to the reduction in yield wp reached the maximum value under the no one or two irrigations and declined under the three and four irrigations moreover the precipitation variation led to different changes in wp under different precipitation years in the wet year the wp in one irrigation treatment 4 was higher with the values of 1 65 1 50 and 1 70 kg m3 at lc yc and ta respectively the wp of wheat under two irrigation treatments 8 and 11 were not different from that under one irrigation treatment 4 the wp under one irrigation treatment 4 was 16 8 lower than that under one irrigation treatment 3 at cp while it was 7 3 lower than that under one irrigation treatment 2 at fq in particular irrigation didn t affect wp at sq the higher wp was obtained by treatment 11 with 1 96 1 64 1 67 1 71 and 1 86 kg m3 at cp lc yc ta and fq stations during the normal year respectively while the corresponding wp was 1 75 1 96 1 62 1 95 and 1 91 kg m3 during the dry year respectively at sq the wp under treatment 11 was slightly lower than under treatment 4 during the normal year due to the higher reduction in et as compared to a little reduction in yield but wp under two irrigation treatments 7 reached a maximum value of 2 24 kg m3 during the dry year 3 5 2 irrigation water productivity iwp the iwp under different irrigation treatments and precipitation years was presented in fig 12 deficit irrigation applied at the pre jointing stage obtained a higher iwp than no full and automatic irrigation in the wet year one irrigation treatment 3 had the highest iwp of 2 64 kg m3 at cp while one irrigation treatment 4 had the highest iwp at lc yc and ta with values of 3 60 3 11 and 3 93 kg m3 respectively at fq iwp was kept at a high level under one irrigation treatment 2 however there was no difference in iwp among all irrigation schedules at sq suggesting that no further yield gain resulted from the irrigation the higher iwp was observed in two irrigation treatments 7 and 11 at cp furthermore two irrigation treatments 11 produced higher iwp at lc yc and ta stations in normal and dry years the iwp under one irrigation treatment 4 was highest at cp lc yc ta and fq stations followed by two irrigation treatments 11 at sq station one irrigation treatment 3 had the highest iwp of 2 2 and 5 0 kg m3 followed by two irrigation treatments 7 of 1 1 and 3 8 kg m3 during the normal and dry years respectively 4 discussion in the north china plain ncp water is the most limiting factor for winter wheat growth javed et al 2021 wang et al 2001 and irrigation is an efficient measure to reduce water stress and significantly increase grain yield dar et al 2017 si et al 2020 sun et al 2019 however the effect of irrigation schedules on winter wheat yield varied due to differences in precipitation characteristics of the experimental years geng et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 this study has chosen six representative stations based on the precipitation distribution at different site years along the west east and south north in ncp since the spatial variability of rainfall was large and drove the variation in water demand for irrigation for the most of precipitation years the water stored in the soil was insufficient to meet crop requirements necessitating supplemental irrigation to maintain soil moisture for later crop growth the finding of this study exposed that deficit two irrigations increased soil moisture contribution improved wp and produced a comparable yield to that under full or automatic irrigation for most of the precipitation years our finding also revealed that supplemental irrigation especially during the greening or jointing stage was of great significance for replenishing depleted soil moisture among all treatments automatic and full irrigation treatments had the lowest s supplementary fig s1 the increase in irrigation amount significantly decreased s moreover the s under deficit irrigation treatments at the pre jointing stage were higher than those under treatments at the post jointing stage with the late application of irrigation such as at the grain filling stage less soil water was utilized by winter wheat this was possibly related to the reduction of soil water storage s in the top portion of the soil and the utilization of water stored in the top soil layer had a greater impact on winter wheat than that of the deep root system zhang et al 2009 deficit two irrigations at greening and jointing stages increased the efficiency of soil water which had the potential to increase crop production under the limited water supply for most of the stations one irrigation could greatly increase yield and keep a high level at fq and sq stations in the wet year however due to the less precipitation at cp in the dry year additional irrigation was needed at the heading stage besides the uneven distribution of precipitation affected the wheat yield fig 5 zhang et al 2013 have suggested that rainfall before heading was correlated with grain yield in this study the greater precipitation happened in the jointing stage march 101 mm at sq in the wet year which would provide a favorable soil water content for wheat vegetative growth thus treatment with no irrigation could maintain a high yield level besides yield without irrigation at ta was lower than that at cp lc and yc in the wet year though ta had greater precipitation this was also attributed to the more rainfall distributed during the earlier periods and increased soil moisture at these three stations while more rainfall occurred during the later growing stages at ta achieving high yield has a significantly positive correlation with improving biomass xue et al 2006 in this study full or automatic irrigation had the highest maturity biomass followed by deficit irrigation fig 9 no irrigation applied after planting significantly decreased biomass and then decreased yield compared to irrigation treatments besides winter wheat yield is directly related to the biomass accumulation partitioning process xu et al 2018 xue et al 2006 and mainly are carbohydrates stored before heading and the photosynthetic products after heading tian et al 2011 it was important to manage the pre anthesis biomass and translocation after anthesis villegas et al 2001 in this study we found that two irrigations applied at greening or jointing stages observed lower maturity biomass but obtained higher pre anthesis biomass and yield this was mainly due to irrigation during greening to jointing stages that could provide a favorable soil water content for wheat vegetative growth and the greater effect of pre anthesis biomass on yield moreover biomass is largely dependent on lai man et al 2017 parry et al 2010 in our study deficit two irrigations significantly delayed leaf senescence and resulted in a higher laimax supplementary fig s2 because a larger lai would improve crop canopy light interception and thus improve biomass and yield falster and westoby 2003 this is another indication that appropriate irrigation could increase pre anthesis biomass accelerate the remobilization of biomass into grains and improve the uptake and translocation of water et is the process in which water moves into the atmosphere through the soil and plants no difference in et was found between different irrigation treatments during the early growth stage of winter wheat fig 13 due to the smaller canopy coverage and low temperature then it increased substantially with the canopy development and gradual high temperature february april which coincided with the growing stage from greening to stem extension moreover in these periods the et under deficit irrigation has started to be distinct from that under full or automatic irrigation and this difference was larger especially in dry years s contributed greatly to the seasonal et under limited water supply the water content in dry year was substantially lower than the water observed in normal and wet years it was found that the large change in soil water content at sowing with that at harvest for no irrigation treatment supplementary fig s1 larger s were observed in the dry year was mainly due to the lower rainfall which resulted in more serious drought conditions and required more soil water supply sun et al 2006 found that wheat yield was positively correlated with the et our study found that deficit irrigation got the lower et during the entire season but similar yield values compared to full or automatic irrigation this is primarily because deficit irrigation had lower et throughout the growing season but higher pre anthesis et and thus higher biomass the jointing irrigation was crucial for vegetative growth and development and the yield was most sensitive to water stress at this stage zhang et al 2006 our study found that irrigation at greening jointing stage average increased et by 3 3 10 3 2 0 8 9 and 2 6 10 4 compared that at heading grain filling stage in wet normal and dry years respectively in all three precipitation years deficit two irrigations obtained high pre anthesis et and produced high wp with a stable yield except for extreme drought or wet conditions optimization of irrigation strategies is beneficial for wheat production and water conservation in the ncp in this study excessive irrigation didn t contribute to an increase in yield and wp iwp decreased with more irrigation because the increase in irrigation was greater as compared to the increase in yield dar et al 2017 by combining two irrigations for greening and jointing into one irrigation for greening or jointing the iwp average increased by 44 3 it suggested that single irrigation at the greening or jointing stage had great positive effects on grain yield while maintaining low water consumption with enough water supply the irrigation schedule could be changed to one irrigation at greening or jointing with lower yield penalties this supported the experimental results that one irrigation applied at the recovery to jointing stage could maintain a stable yield and high wp xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in normal and dry years two irrigations could typically meet the high water requirements of the majority of the stations two irrigations at greening and jointing stages are considered suitable and recommended for winter wheat in terms of both yield wp and iwp xu et al 2018 also found that two irrigations contributed to the best yield and wp for winter wheat besides our study showed that supplemental irrigation during greening was better than the anthesis because irrigation during the greening stage could provide a favorable soil water environment for the wheat leaf area liu et al 2021 supplementary fig s2 therefore the wp and iwp have significantly increased du et al 2010 li and ren 2019 found that irrigation during the booting to anthesis stage played an important role in replenishing water demands in this study during extremely dry conditions supplemental irrigation at heading should be adopted to sustain stable wheat production and water conservation this was agreed with the field experimental results by zhang et al 2003 which revealed that three irrigations during dry years were able to maintain a high yield and relatively high wp therefore adopting an appropriate irrigation strategy should consider precipitation variability which not only reduces irrigation water and water consumption but also optimizes growing season precipitation in addition the effects of irrigation were closely related to rainfall during different growth stages wu et al 2015 if the water supply during the early growth stage was limited irrigation time advanced could offset the negative effect of the water deficit and provide a favorable soil water environment for the wheat yield increasing 5 conclusion irrigation was crucial for most of the site years to reduce the reliance of agricultural activities on weather conditions however precipitation during the growing season of winter wheat fluctuated greatly and thus affected water requirements we recommend an optimized irrigation strategy under different precipitation conditions to maximize the wheat yields wp and iwp for the wet year two irrigations considered suitable and recommended for winter wheat in terms of both yield wp and iwp simultaneously with a greater and sufficient water supply at sq and fq the irrigation schedule could be changed to one irrigation applied at greening to jointing with improved wp and iwp during both normal and dry years two irrigations of greening and jointing could replenish soil moisture during the vegetative period benefiting pre anthesis biomass grain yield wp and iwp additional irrigation at the heading stage was able to maintain a relatively high wp and contribute to high yield production in extreme drought conditions furthermore the effects of the irrigation schedule were closely related to the precipitation distribution during the crop growth stages when the early growth stage rainfall was limited shifting to earlier irrigation was better due to the rainfall increased during the later growth stage of winter wheat which would weaken

9910,achieving high crop yield with less irrigation is important to improve water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp in water limited regions in the north china plain ncp coupling the impacts of precipitation and irrigation on the crop yield is therefore an essential tool for understanding crop response to different water sources and forecasting irrigation water requirements in this study the ceres wheat model was used to simulate winter wheat yield wp and iwp under different irrigation schedules no deficit full and automatic irrigation and three precipitation category years wet normal and dry years results showed that the amount of precipitation fluctuated significantly over site years leading to considerably varied irrigation water requirements for the wet year deficit two irrigations at greening and jointing stages treatment 11 alleviated water stress during key winter wheat growth periods contributing to increasing biomass yield wp and iwp however when reducing the irrigation amount by 50 a significant increase in wp and a nonsignificant difference in yield were found at fengqiu and shangqiu two irrigation applications 11 improved pre anthesis biomass and wheat yield while achieving high wp and iwp in normal and dry years except for extreme drought conditions the finding also indicated that the distribution of growing season precipitation exerted a significant impact on irrigation time if the early season precipitation was low shifting the irrigation to an earlier time to ensure pre anthesis water requirements which can synchronously achieve the goals of increasing wp and maintaining a higher yield in conclusion optimizing irrigation strategies to various precipitation conditions will be a promising and effective practice for wheat production and water conservation keywords north china plain winter wheat deficit irrigation water productivity ceres wheat model 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the main food crops in the north china plain ncp wang et al 2016 production of which accounts for about 70 of entire wheat production in china lu and fan 2013 lv et al 2017 however water shortage greatly constrains the wheat production over this region fang et al 2010 wang et al 2001 the rainfall during the winter wheat growth period can meet only 25 40 of crop water demands leaving a 200 300 mm water deficit in the ncp cao et al 2013a liu et al 2001 thus supplemental irrigation is essential to fulfilling the large crop water demand for maintaining high wheat production chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2003 zhou et al 2007 groundwater is the major source of irrigation water in the ncp traditional irrigation strategies generally apply more than 300 mm of water during the growing season which has led to low water productivity wp li et al 2012 over exploitation of groundwater has reduced the groundwater table caused severe environmental problems and threatened sustainable agricultural development chen et al 2003 han et al 2016 wang et al 2009 substantial improvement should be made to reduce or even eliminate the current agricultural use of groundwater difallah et al 2017 wang et al 2001 however supplemental irrigation is essential to obtaining a higher winter wheat yield fang et al 2010 kijne et al 2003 consequently efficient and sustainable water management is urgently needed to resolve the conflict between yield improvement and irrigation water consumption to ensure the long term sustainability of irrigated agriculture water saving irrigation schedules with high yields will become more important deficit irrigation typically defined as an irrigation strategy that the application of irrigation water below the full crop water requirement is a promising approach to minimizing irrigation water use tari 2016 deficit irrigation only at critical growth stages has been broadly utilized to increase water productivity chai et al 2016 jensen et al 2014 kang and zhang 2004 this approach can close the gap of crop water requirements at sensitive growth stages and allows moderate water stress at nonsensitive growth stages however inconsistent irrigation strategies are recommended based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of irrigation schedules bian et al 2016 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2016 these differences may be attributed to the large variability of seasonal precipitation seasonal precipitation is a key factor for wheat yield in ncp as it directly affects the irrigation water demand and water balance of winter wheat chen et al 2014 dar et al 2017 thus the development of appropriate and effective water saving practices needs to consider the differences in seasonal precipitation previous studies were mainly location specific field experiments chen et al 2010 wu et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 but field experiments are time and labor costly because of the critical input data requirement in soil types cultivars meteorological data and management practices therefore process based modeling is a valuable and feasible tool used to assess the effect of different climate conditions and irrigation schedules on crop yield and productivity geerts and raes 2009 heng et al 2007 dssat model has high accuracy in simulating crop growth and development jones et al 2003 including phenology dates biomass and grain yield ceres wheat which is embedded in the dssat software is a wheat growth simulation model and has been widely evaluated by many researchers to assess the effect of irrigation water on wheat production arora et al 2007 attia et al 2016 benli et al 2007 the optimized irrigation schedules have been thoroughly studied and widely applied to improve wheat yield and increase wp qin et al 2018 li et al 2005 and xu et al 2018 reported that two irrigations could be adequate for winter wheat in the ncp lv et al 2011 proposed that single irrigation at jointing could produce a higher yield and wp than traditional practices in shandong province bian et al 2016 found that two irrigations of 60 mm at both jointing and heading stages resulted in a higher yield than applying 120 mm only at the jointing stage however these studies are scattered based on the finite set of irrigation experiments in local orientated climate conditions and have less capability of extrapolation in making accurate schedules considering the large spatial variation in rainfall the irrigation performance needs further comprehensive analysis it is imperative to choose multiple stations based on the different growing season precipitation patterns to fully investigate suitable irrigation schedules and assess water use utilization thus in this study six representative stations were selected from different rainfall types along the west east and south north integrated with the ceres wheat model to simulate the effects of different irrigation schemes rainfed deficit full and automatic irrigation on yield and to explore irrigation treatments of high yield and high wp the ceres wheat model was used in this study with the objectives to 1 evaluate winter wheat yield evapotranspiration et and wp response to different irrigation schedules and 2 explore high wp and irrigation water productivity iwp to provide theoretical support for popularization and application of optimizing irrigation measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the north china plain ncp includes hebei henan shandong provinces and the beijing and tianjin municipalities with the exclusion of the north of hebei province where winter wheat cannot grow because of annual accumulated temperature below 4200 c d liu and han 1987 fig 1 the main crops are irrigated winter wheat and summer maize prevailing soils in ncp are formed of fluvial materials from the yellow river which is fertile and favorable for arable farming cao et al 2013b however water shortage and over exploitation of groundwater threaten sustainable food production in this region the climate of the ncp is temperate and monsoonal with rainy hot summers and dry cold winters the average annual temperature ranges from 12 0 to 13 meng et al 2007 the mean annual precipitation decreases from the southwest to the northeast in addition the seasonal distribution of precipitation is uneven with about 70 of the precipitation concentrates in the maize growing season june to september while only approximately 30 of it occurs during the growing season of winter wheat end of september or october in the sowing year to june next year in ncp the mean precipitation in the winter wheat growing season is only about 122 225 mm which is usually insufficient to meet the winter wheat water demand sun et al 2010 and this gap varies considerably due to the precipitation variability hence six stations changping cp luancheng lc yucheng yc taian ta fengqiu fq and shangqiu sq along the west east and south north were chosen according to long term 1980 2015 average growing season precipitation to investigate the effects of variation in rainfall on irrigation schedules six stations selected are cp with precipitation of less than 140 mm lc and yc of 140 180 mm ta and fq of 180 220 mm and sq of more than 220 mm precipitation shows an increasing pattern from the northeast to the southwest during the winter wheat growing season 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 crop management information in this study the ceres wheat model was used to simulate winter wheat yield and water use at six representative stations in the ncp the model requires crop management information including planting dates planting density planting depth

zhengmai9023 and yumai 34 were planted at lc yc fq and sq respectively crop data on wheat phenology cultivar type yields et and management information at cp were collected from xing et al 2016 while ta was obtained from bian et al 2016 and qi et al 2011 the wheat cultivars jing9843 and jimai 22 were used at cp and ta respectively the detailed general information and the management practices for each station are given in supplementary table s1 2 2 2 climate data climatic data including the daily maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine hours and precipitation these data were collected from the china meteorological administration cma http www cma gov cn daily solar radiation was estimated by sunshine hours using the angstrom formula black et al 1954 each of the six stations directly collected data from weather stations managed by cma to capture the spatial variability of winter wheat growing season precipitation fig 1 daily precipitation data from 40 meteorological stations uniformly distributed was used for interpolating over the ncp based on the inverse distance weighting method shukla et al 2020 the winter wheat growing season accumulative precipitation values were calculated by summing daily precipitation from sowing dates to harvest dates sowing and harvest dates varied regionally and ranged from early october to late june in the north and from late october to early june in the south of the ncp 2 2 3 soil data the soil data used in our study was obtained from the china soil scientific database http vdb3 soil csdb cn and the national ecosystem observation

collected and as input information including soil bulk density bd drained upper limit dul lower limit ll and saturated volumetric water content sat etc detailed information including the bulk and hydraulic parameters were summarized in table 1 2 3 crop model and simulation 2 3 1 ceres wheat model the ceres wheat model is a component driven mechanism model which dynamically simulates crop growth and development from planting to harvest on a daily time step taking into account the effects of weather genotype soil water carbon and nitrogen planting irrigation and fertilizer management dente et al 2008 rinaldi 2004 thorp et al 2010 currently it has been widely applied to different regions with variable climates and environments ahmad et al 2019 dokoohaki et al 2017 crop parameters and physiological characteristics are given in the form of genetic coefficients a detailed description of the model can be found in jones et al 2003 four phenology coefficients p1v p1d p5 and phint impact plant phenological development while the other three growth coefficients g1 g2 and g3 are related to grain yield generally wheat phenological development is divided into several phases based on growing degree days gdd leaf area development is dependent on the availability of assimilates temperature water deficit and nitrogen stress biomass accumulation is computed as a function of photosynthetically active intercepted radiation and radiation use efficiency the final grain yield is calculated as the product of grain number plant population and grain weight 2 3 2 simulation of crop water use the ceres wheat model could adequately simulate the water stress effect crop growth stage and daily et acting as a valuable tool for helping to study how to improve wp in the agriculture system saseendran et al 2008 crop water use et related to the crop life cycle is simulated through the soil water balance of the ceres wheat model the soil water balance module is computed based on precipitation irrigation soil evaporation transpiration drainage surface runoff and infiltration all processes that directly affect water content in the soil profile throughout the seasonal simulation the model utilizes a simple cascading method to apportion infiltrated water among different soil layers runoff is estimated based on the antecedent soil water content and drainage is estimated by the slowest draining layer of the soil profile actual soil evaporation is based on a two stage process ritchie 1972 plant transpiration is calculated from the distribution of roots and available water in the soil layer root distribution and extractable water in soil layers could modify potential transpiration for actual water uptake or transpiration the details of the soil water balance module are expressed as the following equation 1 et p i δ s d r where et is evapotranspiration p is precipitation i is irrigation s is the difference in soil water storage between the initial soil content at the time of sowing and the harvest time content d is soil water drainage r is surface runoff 2 4 calibration and validation the ceres wheat model was calibrated using experimental data from six stations firstly genetic parameters were derived using a trial and error method to match the simulated anthesis and maturity dates to the observed ones then the model was run with the derived crop phenological parameters and the performance was checked in terms of yield soil water content and et the calibrated genetic coefficients were described in table 2 after calibration the model was validated by comparing the observed data on phenology yield et and soil water content during the other years table 3 to evaluate the performance of the model the statistical indicators of coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse and willmott s index of agreement d willmott 1982 were used to check the agreement between observed and simulated values the formulas are as follows 2 r 2 i 1 n s i s m i m 2 i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n m i m 2 3 rmse i 1 n s i m i 2 n 100 4 nrmse i 1 n s i m i 2 n m 100 5 d 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n s i m m i m 2 0 d 1 where s i is the simulated value m i is the observed value s is the average of simulated values m is the average of observed values n is a sample size a larger value of r2 corresponds to a better model simulation rmse is chosen to evaluate the goodness of fit of soil water content rmse is less than 0 1 indicates an excellent fit when it is between 0 1 and 0 2 the fit is good when it is between 0 2 and 0 3 the fit is moderate if it is larger than 0 3 the fit is poor a value of nrmse smaller than 10 indicates a good simulation accuracy nrmse between 20 and 30 indicates a general accuracy and nrmse larger than 30 indicates a poor accuracy the value of d close to 1 indicates a good agreement between the simulated and observed values while a d value of zero indicates no predictability iglesias 2009 2 5 simulation experiments different irrigation treatments no deficit full and automatic irrigation were conducted to determine the effects of different irrigation levels on yield including different irrigation timing over wintering greening jointing heading and grain filling frequency zero one two three four five and automatic and amount 0 80 160 240 320 400 mm and automatic no irrigation was managed without irrigation deficit irrigation was applied to guarantee crop growth which was irrigated one to four times full irrigation was irrigated with five irrigations at the stages of over wintering greening jointing heading and grain filling zhang et al 2006 automatic irrigation was set based on the soil water content of 50 field capacity and the irrigation amount was calculated by comparing the soil moisture in soil profiles with the target upper limits 100 of field capacity in the main root zone 0 1 m the per irrigation amount of all the irrigation treatments was 80 mm details of irrigation treatments are listed in table 4 for all irrigation schedules the initial soil water condition was the field capacity zhang et al 2004 zhou et al 2018 this was adequate for winter wheat emergence and germination moreover all irrigation simulation experiments were conducted without nutrition stress 2 6 classification of precipitation category years we used the pearson type iii distribution method to classify different precipitation years the different precipitation years are a reflection of the precipitation during the winter wheat growing season the steps of the pearson type iii distribution method are as follows 1 rank precipitation in the wheat growing season of each year in descending order based on the total number of growing seasons 2 assign a rank of m to each descending order with 1 being the largest and n being the smallest 3 calculate the empirical probability p of the pearson type iii distribution chow et al 1988 6 p m n 1 100 4 divide n observations into different categories of precipitation years according to their p value zhang et al 2016 the precipitation years are divided into three classes wet year normal year and dry year with separate points of 25 50 and 75 p values respectively 2 7 modeling and data analysis the calibrated ceres wheat model was then used to assess the effects of precipitation and different irrigation schedules on winter wheat yield wp and iwp wp is defined as the ratio of crop yield to water lorite et al 2013 it is used to evaluate optimum irrigation management strategies to ensure the most efficient use of water resources liu et al 2016 iwp is an effective indicator and combines grain yield and the cost of irrigation du et al 2010 wp and iwp are shown in eqs 7 and 8 7 wp yi et 8 iwp yi y0 i where wp is water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 yi is irrigated yield kg ha 1 iwp is irrigation water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 y0 is rainfed yield kg ha 1 i is total irrigation amount mm 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the evaluation performance of the model was shown in fig 2 the results showed that the simulated anthesis agreed well with the observed anthesis with r2 of 0 89 nrmse of 2 25 and d values of 1 00 fig 2a the r2 nrmse and d between simulated and observed maturity were 0 80 2 71 and 0 99 fig 2b moreover simulated yields were well matched with the observations r2 0 84 nrmse 6 67 d 0 88 fig 2c the simulated et was in good agreement with the observed et with r2 0 70 nrmse 5 65 and d 0 99 fig 2d by comparison between measured and simulated soil water content it exposed that the simulated soil water content at different depths agreed well with the observed values fig 3 the rmse of the whole soil profile ranged from 0 010 to 0 052 cm3cm 3 at lc from 0 009 to 0 038 cm3cm 3 at yc from 0 015 to 0 054 cm3cm 3 at fq and from 0 018 to 0 033 cm3cm 3at sq stations respectively all the rmse were less than 0 1 cm3cm 3 the r2 and d values were between 0 31 and 0 90 and 0 60 0 97 at lc 0 50 0 90 and 0 80 0 99 at yc 0 15 0 88 and 0 48 0 93 at fq and 0 69 0 91 and 0 88 0 96 at sq respectively overall the above model evaluation results indicated that the ceres wheat model could well be applied to simulate phenological development yield information and water balance for winter wheat 3 2 precipitation characteristics during the winter wheat growing season winter wheat growing season precipitation at cp lc yc ta fq and sq stations from 1980 to 2015 was shown in fig 4 precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat exhibited higher variability with a coefficient of variation of 42 7 44 0 33 3 33 6 39 0 and 33 8 respectively moreover precipitation with an average value of 133 130 122 172 174 and 225 mm respectively was considerably lower than the winter wheat water requirement therefore winter wheat primarily depended on irrigation to produce a high yield and it was necessary to analyze the impact of irrigation treatments on winter wheat in different precipitation years in the 36 year time series of precipitation weather data the pearson iii type distribution method was used to classify the year type of precipitation i e wet normal and dry years moreover the precipitation distribution across the different precipitation years was shown in fig 5 profound variability in monthly rainfall amount and distribution was observed for all precipitation years growing season rainfall was unevenly distributed and was less than 50 mm across all the stations except sq from february march during the normal and dry years precipitation in february or march even was less than 20 mm however the higher rainfall before heading april or may may result in better vegetative and growth which played an important role in wheat production zhang et al 2013 3 3 changes of soil water storage δs and evapotranspiration et 3 3 1 changes of soil water storage δs fig 6 depicted the s for three precipitation years with different irrigation schedules as irrigation increased s decreased significantly and deficit irrigation treatments extracted more water than full and automatic irrigation treatments supplementary fig s1 moreover s varied based on irrigation treatments and precipitation levels in different years in the wet year the higher s was obtained by one irrigation treatment 4 at lc yc and ta three stations while one irrigation treatment 3 at cp and one irrigation treatment 2 at fq switching from one irrigation to two irrigations significantly reduced s at all cp lc yc ta fq and sq six stations even increasing irrigation from 0 mm to 80 mm led to a significant reduction in s for the sq station during the normal and dry years one irrigation treatment 4 kept s at a high level changing from one irrigation treatment 4 to two irrigation treatments 11 led to s reduction by 0 6 0 1 5 0 2 5 4 and 2 5 in normal year respectively additionally the corresponding reduction in dry year for six stations was only 0 0 1 2 3 5 1 9 and 3 7 respectively 3 3 2 evapotranspiration et the et magnitude of each precipitation year was similar for most of the stations in which no irrigation had the least et and full irrigation had the most et fig 7 there was no significant difference between full irrigation and automatic irrigation however the greater the precipitation the smaller the incremental change in et was observed et didn t change among the treatments for the sq site due to the relatively abundant rainfall in the wet year similar to s et in irrigation at the greening or jointing stage was higher than that at the heading or grain filling stage this may be related to the enhanced water utilization of winter wheat with the canopy s rapid development during the greening to jointing period furthermore the irrigation treatments and precipitation years had a significant effect on the et for the wet year treatment 11 significantly increased the et and reached 90 7 92 7 91 9 97 3 94 0 and 100 of the treatment 32 for cp lc yc ta fq and sq stations respectively however during the normal and dry years there was a large difference in et between treatment 11 and treatment 32 the amount of irrigation increased would offset the reduction in soil water storage and improve et four irrigation treatments 27 increased the et to be as high as in full irrigation treatment 32 except at cp et was 8 6 and 16 0 lower under treatment 27 than under treatment 32 during the normal and dry years at the cp station 3 3 3 evapotranspiration et of different growth stages the et of different growth stages under various irrigation treatments was shown in fig 8 the effects of irrigation on et at different stages were similar during the three precipitation years from sowing to jointing the et under irrigation at the pre jointing stage was significantly greater than that at the post jointing stage deficit two irrigation treatments 7 or 11 could result in the highest pre jointing et while using the least irrigation amount one irrigation treatment 4 significantly increased jointing to the anthesis et in addition two irrigation treatments 8 and 11 which irrigation was 1 5 times lower than that of full irrigation 32 but they obtained similar jointing to anthesis et irrigation at the pre jointing significantly decreased anthesis to maturity et compared with that at the post jointing nevertheless the total et in two irrigation treatments 8 or 11 was significantly higher indicating that the more increment in pre anthesis et was as compared to a reduction in post anthesis et moreover the variation of et at different stages was influenced by the growing season rainfall in the wet year with an abundant rainfall supplement no differences in the et of growth stages were observed among all treatments at the sq station 3 4 yield and biomass accumulation 3 4 1 yield changes in the yield of winter wheat with different irrigation schedules in the three precipitation years were given in fig 9 the range of no irrigation yields was 3546 8178 kg ha 1 2363 7733 kg ha 1 and 1765 3137 kg ha 1 during the wet normal and dry years respectively the yield of winter wheat was synthetically affected by both precipitation and irrigation yields exhibited an increasing trend with the increase in irrigation at five stations but it didn t change at sq during the wet year moreover irrigation at different growth stages significantly affected the degree of yield increment in the wet year yields from one irrigation treatment 4 were significantly higher than those of no irrigation treatment 1 at lc yc and ta stations one irrigation treatment 3 considerably improved yield at cp while one irrigation treatment 2 increased yield by 11 0 at fq the yield kept increasing when irrigation increased to two irrigation treatments of 11 at lc yc and ta stations while two irrigation treatments 7 at cp station the wheat yield reached a plateau under two irrigations at cp lc yc and ta four stations however at fq one irrigation could substantially increase the yield and keep it at a high level in normal and dry years treatment 4 significantly increased yield at all stations except sq moreover changing from one irrigation treatment 4 to two irrigation treatments 11 significantly increased yield except at cp with the irrigation amount increasing the yield increased by 1309 kg ha 1 at cp during the dry year 3 4 2 biomass accumulation fig 10 depicted biomass accumulation at various stages of growth biomass at different growing stages greatly affected by irrigation treatments in the early growth stage biomass accumulation did not differ markedly with various irrigation schedules data not shown from the jointing to maturity stages biomass accumulation under irrigation was significantly higher than under no irrigation except for the sq but the increment became smaller with the increasing precipitation water supply in the wet year two irrigation treatments 8 and 11 greatly enhanced the jointing anthesis and maturity biomass at lc yc ta and fq stations at cp the high jointing and anthesis biomass was found in two irrigation treatments 7 and maturity biomass increased notably with the irrigation increase in the normal year jointing biomass under deficit two irrigation treatments 11 was 1 6 0 1 1 0 0 32 and 0 lower than under automatic irrigation treatment 33 at six stations respectively moreover anthesis biomass was similar between treatment 11 and treatment 33 at maturity the biomass difference between treatment 11 and treatment 33 expanded but obtained a similar yield this may be due to the moderately limited irrigation that significantly increased jointing and anthesis biomass and then improved the yield in the dry year jointing anthesis was 1 9 2 6 0 0 3 and 1 9 lower under treatment 11 than under treatment 33 at cp lc yc ta and fq respectively at wheat anthesis biomass reached a plateau when applied to two irrigation treatments 11 at lc yc ta and fq simultaneously there wasn t a significant difference in jointing and anthesis biomass between treatment 7 and 33 at sq at the wheat maturity stage large differences in biomass were found between two irrigations and full irrigation at all stations 3 5 water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp 3 5 1 water productivity wp the various irrigation scenarios greatly affected the magnitude of wp under different precipitation years for winter wheat fig 11 the wp under deficit irrigation was higher than under full or automatic irrigation because of more reduction in et as compared to the reduction in yield wp reached the maximum value under the no one or two irrigations and declined under the three and four irrigations moreover the precipitation variation led to different changes in wp under different precipitation years in the wet year the wp in one irrigation treatment 4 was higher with the values of 1 65 1 50 and 1 70 kg m3 at lc yc and ta respectively the wp of wheat under two irrigation treatments 8 and 11 were not different from that under one irrigation treatment 4 the wp under one irrigation treatment 4 was 16 8 lower than that under one irrigation treatment 3 at cp while it was 7 3 lower than that under one irrigation treatment 2 at fq in particular irrigation didn t affect wp at sq the higher wp was obtained by treatment 11 with 1 96 1 64 1 67 1 71 and 1 86 kg m3 at cp lc yc ta and fq stations during the normal year respectively while the corresponding wp was 1 75 1 96 1 62 1 95 and 1 91 kg m3 during the dry year respectively at sq the wp under treatment 11 was slightly lower than under treatment 4 during the normal year due to the higher reduction in et as compared to a little reduction in yield but wp under two irrigation treatments 7 reached a maximum value of 2 24 kg m3 during the dry year 3 5 2 irrigation water productivity iwp the iwp under different irrigation treatments and precipitation years was presented in fig 12 deficit irrigation applied at the pre jointing stage obtained a higher iwp than no full and automatic irrigation in the wet year one irrigation treatment 3 had the highest iwp of 2 64 kg m3 at cp while one irrigation treatment 4 had the highest iwp at lc yc and ta with values of 3 60 3 11 and 3 93 kg m3 respectively at fq iwp was kept at a high level under one irrigation treatment 2 however there was no difference in iwp among all irrigation schedules at sq suggesting that no further yield gain resulted from the irrigation the higher iwp was observed in two irrigation treatments 7 and 11 at cp furthermore two irrigation treatments 11 produced higher iwp at lc yc and ta stations in normal and dry years the iwp under one irrigation treatment 4 was highest at cp lc yc ta and fq stations followed by two irrigation treatments 11 at sq station one irrigation treatment 3 had the highest iwp of 2 2 and 5 0 kg m3 followed by two irrigation treatments 7 of 1 1 and 3 8 kg m3 during the normal and dry years respectively 4 discussion in the north china plain ncp water is the most limiting factor for winter wheat growth javed et al 2021 wang et al 2001 and irrigation is an efficient measure to reduce water stress and significantly increase grain yield dar et al 2017 si et al 2020 sun et al 2019 however the effect of irrigation schedules on winter wheat yield varied due to differences in precipitation characteristics of the experimental years geng et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 this study has chosen six representative stations based on the precipitation distribution at different site years along the west east and south north in ncp since the spatial variability of rainfall was large and drove the variation in water demand for irrigation for the most of precipitation years the water stored in the soil was insufficient to meet crop requirements necessitating supplemental irrigation to maintain soil moisture for later crop growth the finding of this study exposed that deficit two irrigations increased soil moisture contribution improved wp and produced a comparable yield to that under full or automatic irrigation for most of the precipitation years our finding also revealed that supplemental irrigation especially during the greening or jointing stage was of great significance for replenishing depleted soil moisture among all treatments automatic and full irrigation treatments had the lowest s supplementary fig s1 the increase in irrigation amount significantly decreased s moreover the s under deficit irrigation treatments at the pre jointing stage were higher than those under treatments at the post jointing stage with the late application of irrigation such as at the grain filling stage less soil water was utilized by winter wheat this was possibly related to the reduction of soil water storage s in the top portion of the soil and the utilization of water stored in the top soil layer had a greater impact on winter wheat than that of the deep root system zhang et al 2009 deficit two irrigations at greening and jointing stages increased the efficiency of soil water which had the potential to increase crop production under the limited water supply for most of the stations one irrigation could greatly increase yield and keep a high level at fq and sq stations in the wet year however due to the less precipitation at cp in the dry year additional irrigation was needed at the heading stage besides the uneven distribution of precipitation affected the wheat yield fig 5 zhang et al 2013 have suggested that rainfall before heading was correlated with grain yield in this study the greater precipitation happened in the jointing stage march 101 mm at sq in the wet year which would provide a favorable soil water content for wheat vegetative growth thus treatment with no irrigation could maintain a high yield level besides yield without irrigation at ta was lower than that at cp lc and yc in the wet year though ta had greater precipitation this was also attributed to the more rainfall distributed during the earlier periods and increased soil moisture at these three stations while more rainfall occurred during the later growing stages at ta achieving high yield has a significantly positive correlation with improving biomass xue et al 2006 in this study full or automatic irrigation had the highest maturity biomass followed by deficit irrigation fig 9 no irrigation applied after planting significantly decreased biomass and then decreased yield compared to irrigation treatments besides winter wheat yield is directly related to the biomass accumulation partitioning process xu et al 2018 xue et al 2006 and mainly are carbohydrates stored before heading and the photosynthetic products after heading tian et al 2011 it was important to manage the pre anthesis biomass and translocation after anthesis villegas et al 2001 in this study we found that two irrigations applied at greening or jointing stages observed lower maturity biomass but obtained higher pre anthesis biomass and yield this was mainly due to irrigation during greening to jointing stages that could provide a favorable soil water content for wheat vegetative growth and the greater effect of pre anthesis biomass on yield moreover biomass is largely dependent on lai man et al 2017 parry et al 2010 in our study deficit two irrigations significantly delayed leaf senescence and resulted in a higher laimax supplementary fig s2 because a larger lai would improve crop canopy light interception and thus improve biomass and yield falster and westoby 2003 this is another indication that appropriate irrigation could increase pre anthesis biomass accelerate the remobilization of biomass into grains and improve the uptake and translocation of water et is the process in which water moves into the atmosphere through the soil and plants no difference in et was found between different irrigation treatments during the early growth stage of winter wheat fig 13 due to the smaller canopy coverage and low temperature then it increased substantially with the canopy development and gradual high temperature february april which coincided with the growing stage from greening to stem extension moreover in these periods the et under deficit irrigation has started to be distinct from that under full or automatic irrigation and this difference was larger especially in dry years s contributed greatly to the seasonal et under limited water supply the water content in dry year was substantially lower than the water observed in normal and wet years it was found that the large change in soil water content at sowing with that at harvest for no irrigation treatment supplementary fig s1 larger s were observed in the dry year was mainly due to the lower rainfall which resulted in more serious drought conditions and required more soil water supply sun et al 2006 found that wheat yield was positively correlated with the et our study found that deficit irrigation got the lower et during the entire season but similar yield values compared to full or automatic irrigation this is primarily because deficit irrigation had lower et throughout the growing season but higher pre anthesis et and thus higher biomass the jointing irrigation was crucial for vegetative growth and development and the yield was most sensitive to water stress at this stage zhang et al 2006 our study found that irrigation at greening jointing stage average increased et by 3 3 10 3 2 0 8 9 and 2 6 10 4 compared that at heading grain filling stage in wet normal and dry years respectively in all three precipitation years deficit two irrigations obtained high pre anthesis et and produced high wp with a stable yield except for extreme drought or wet conditions optimization of irrigation strategies is beneficial for wheat production and water conservation in the ncp in this study excessive irrigation didn t contribute to an increase in yield and wp iwp decreased with more irrigation because the increase in irrigation was greater as compared to the increase in yield dar et al 2017 by combining two irrigations for greening and jointing into one irrigation for greening or jointing the iwp average increased by 44 3 it suggested that single irrigation at the greening or jointing stage had great positive effects on grain yield while maintaining low water consumption with enough water supply the irrigation schedule could be changed to one irrigation at greening or jointing with lower yield penalties this supported the experimental results that one irrigation applied at the recovery to jointing stage could maintain a stable yield and high wp xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in normal and dry years two irrigations could typically meet the high water requirements of the majority of the stations two irrigations at greening and jointing stages are considered suitable and recommended for winter wheat in terms of both yield wp and iwp xu et al 2018 also found that two irrigations contributed to the best yield and wp for winter wheat besides our study showed that supplemental irrigation during greening was better than the anthesis because irrigation during the greening stage could provide a favorable soil water environment for the wheat leaf area liu et al 2021 supplementary fig s2 therefore the wp and iwp have significantly increased du et al 2010 li and ren 2019 found that irrigation during the booting to anthesis stage played an important role in replenishing water demands in this study during extremely dry conditions supplemental irrigation at heading should be adopted to sustain stable wheat production and water conservation this was agreed with the field experimental results by zhang et al 2003 which revealed that three irrigations during dry years were able to maintain a high yield and relatively high wp therefore adopting an appropriate irrigation strategy should consider precipitation variability which not only reduces irrigation water and water consumption but also optimizes growing season precipitation in addition the effects of irrigation were closely related to rainfall during different growth stages wu et al 2015 if the water supply during the early growth stage was limited irrigation time advanced could offset the negative effect of the water deficit and provide a favorable soil water environment for the wheat yield increasing 5 conclusion irrigation was crucial for most of the site years to reduce the reliance of agricultural activities on weather conditions however precipitation during the growing season of winter wheat fluctuated greatly and thus affected water requirements we recommend an optimized irrigation strategy under different precipitation conditions to maximize the wheat yields wp and iwp for the wet year two irrigations considered suitable and recommended for winter wheat in terms of both yield wp and iwp simultaneously with a greater and sufficient water supply at sq and fq the irrigation schedule could be changed to one irrigation applied at greening to jointing with improved wp and iwp during both normal and dry years two irrigations of greening and jointing could replenish soil moisture during the vegetative period benefiting pre anthesis biomass grain yield wp and iwp additional irrigation at the heading stage was able to maintain a relatively high wp and contribute to high yield production in extreme drought conditions furthermore the effects of the irrigation schedule were closely related to the precipitation distribution during the crop growth stages when the early growth stage rainfall was limited shifting to earlier irrigation was better due to the rainfall increased during the later growth stage of winter wheat which would weaken

9911,several surface energy balance seb models are currently used to unleash the boundless potential of geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs techniques their main output namely the actual evapotranspiration eta is required for the assessment of water budget at basin regional and national levels still the lack of the required expertise coupled with sometimes missing input data limits their usage by researchers policy makers water managers and farmers in this study a novel comprehensive monthly adjusted crop coefficients akc list was produced in which these coefficients are usually used to retrieve the much needed eta using the climate sensitive reference crop evapotranspiration et0 more particularly the eta is calculated for more than sixty different crop types present in the mediterranean climate california united states it is based on the two consecutive years of 2018 and 2019 which were wet and dry respectively the google earth engine gee version of the surface energy balance algorithm for land improved sebali surnamed sebaligee with an absolute mean error ame of 9 56 mm month in the study area was used along the annual crop map from the united states department of agriculture usda the main results showed that the average monthly akc values ranged between 0 45 and 1 53 more specifically october and november presented the lowest akc values averaged among all crop types with akc values around 0 76 on the other hand march april and june had the largest average akc values at nearly 1 17 the monthly akc values of the 60 crops studied in the plain of california would potentially assist authorities and hydrologists to better calculate the actual monthly plant water consumption in a simpler way over the upcoming years keywords actual evapotranspiration crop coefficient surface energy balance algorithm for land improved sebali water consumption 1 introduction in an era of fast advancements in digital imagery and technology agricultural studies seem to be lacking behind marin et al 2016 the huge gap between farmers and policy makers on one hand and researchers on the other appears to be consistently expanding park et al 2017 this is exacerbated by the slow incorporation of agricultural studies within the geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs techniques these latter approaches can provide accurate and crucial crop related indices e g normalized difference vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai soil water content swc actual evapotranspiration eta biomass production bm at different temporal and spatial scales through the existence of different space platforms faour et al 2018 ghoussein et al 2018 in terms of water consumption and demand the most straightforward manner to fill this gap is to provide farmers and planners with readily available averaged eta values based on multiple years and adapted for a specific site location still the changing weather conditions and climatic factors e g air temperature relative humidity wind speed incoming solar radiation can hugely affect eta rates mhawej and faour 2020 even within the same zone the best option would be then to apply the crop coefficient kc values for diverse crops in the considered locations these coefficients are then multiplied by the climate sensitive reference crop evapotranspiration et0 to assess the crop evapotranspiration etc thus providing important information on crop water consumption as follows 1 etc kc x et 0 where etc is the crop evapotranspiration under unstressed conditions kc is the crop coefficient under standard conditions and et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration this is exactly what was produced two decades ago in the fao 56 exhaustive kc list allen et al 1998 still the fao 56 kc list main limitations reside in only providing kc values in three major stages for each crop i e initial mid and end of season and under standard conditions only usually nonexistent in real life even when including other situations such as a changing relative humidity wind speed salinity or the impact of the climate change several previous studies have questioned its direct usage more particularly marin et al 2016 selected three experiments with diverse crop types in terms of physiology and planting arrangements to assess the crop coefficient paradigm and its relation to et0 they concluded that the definition of kc as presented in fao 56 should be improved to capture the change in et0 lozano et al 2017 focused on melon crop cultivated in a protected environment their findings even after adjustments as requested in allen et al 1998 depicted a shorter phenological stage compared to the fao data coupled with different kc values in the initial intermediate and final phenological stages wang et al 2018 conducted a winter wheat field experiment for three consecutive years between 2013 and 2016 while including the impact of straw mulching their findings showed that the corrected kc values from fao 56 have underestimated the real kc of winter wheat in mid season allen et al 2005 tried to check the ability of calculating kc from discharge measurements based on the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach an overprediction of 8 was found fandiño et al 2012 tested the change in vineyards kc in three irrigation scenarios i e rain fed surface and subsurface drip irrigation for three crop seasons between 2008 and 2010 even when using the dual kc approach and after much calibrations and validations their kc values disagreed with the fao 56 values similarly jiang et al 2019 used the dual kc method for the maize crop between 2013 and 2014 in northwest china they found that kc values were higher than fao 56 data at both initial and development stages furthermore mata gonzález et al 2005 have discussed the inappropriate use of fao 56 kc values to estimate evapotranspiration for different crop types in arid ecosystems where plants do not have high leaf area index lai or little stomatal resistance to water loss they concluded that the fao 56 kc method typically overestimated water use when plants encounter suboptimal conditions thus it is not suitable for determining actual evapotranspiration of vegetation adapted to arid conditions zanotelli et al 2019 showed a discrepancy between apple orchard kc values retrieved from fao and their values based on eddy covariance towers placed in south italy such difference was related to relatively humid environment and the availability of a distinctive grass surface this was thoroughly discussed in annandale and stockle 1994 study which has provided a sensitivity analysis of a changing kc with variations in solar radiation air temperature air vapor density and wind speed they suggested that for crops taller than those prevailing at the site where they were experimentally derived usually coupled with a lower canopy resistance kc values fluctuate with changes in weather conditions thus it was recommended to develop regionally based adjusted kc akc values which could better assist in irrigation management while providing better understanding of plant water consumption for the studied region ko et al 2009 mhawej and faour 2020 this is the main objective of this paper such information can be retrieved through the implementation of an accurate seb model fed with satellite images providing good eta estimations while extending the monitoring at the field level in this context this study used an iteration of the widely validated surface energy balance algorithm for land improved sebali model in different climatic regions mhawej et al 2020a 2020b allam et al 2021 surnamed sebaligee and detailed in mhawej and faour 2020 landsat 8 30 m satellite images were used to assess the changing kc values in more than sixty crop types in the california plain united states the annual crop maps of 2018 and 2019 provided by united states department of agriculture usda are used as a crop mask it is important to note that the presented comprehensive list of akc in this paper corresponds to monthly values and the akc values are hence adapted for the california plain region our findings assist water manager and policy makers to propose sustainable water budget and accounting plans in a straightforward and easy manner in the mediterranean climate california plain 2 material and methods 2 1 study area a part of the major plain in the state of california united states is considered as the study area fig 1 extending over an area of 2640 km2 the mean altitude is 26 m a s l the prevailing climate is a hot summer mediterranean with an average annual precipitation of 420 mm between 2018 and 2019 agriculture is the main economic activity in the study area with more than sixty different crop types available almond plantation is widespread over 357 km2 followed by alfalfa and walnut with 233 km2 and 211 km2 respectively according to the usda nass averaged between 2018 and 2019 2 2 data background and methods sebaligee is the latest iteration of sebali fully automated open source user friendly and produces accurate eta estimation using the massive computational power and large remote sensing database available within the google earth engine gee cloud platform mhawej and faour 2020 a comparison between sebali sebaligee and fao 56 methods is found in table 1 sebaligee was specifically calibrated and validated in the plain of california thus within the considered study area which is very close to the eddy covariance flux towers i e us twt and us tw3 the eta absolute mean error ame was 0 32 mm day mhawej and faour 2020 it is important to note that sebali was proposed using several improvements found in the previous seb models e g agricultural based hot cold pixels selection water stress ws factor identification and instantaneous to daily et transformation but also with a reduction of the required inputs including some of the previously pivotal climatic and soil related datasets an automated selection of hot cold pixels an internal water based calibration process and a cloud removal procedure it is based on the widely known surface energy equation price 1985 at the earth s surface which can be approximated as follows 2 rn g h e 0 where rn is the net radiation flux at the surface w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 and e is the latent heat flux w m 2 this latter considered as the residual of the surface energy equation particularly above natural environment is what the satellite based approaches are aiming to resolve using the available visible used for vegetation conditions and albedo near infrared used for vegetation conditions shortwave infrared used for albedo and thermal bands used for land surface temperatures the general structure of seb models can be found in fig 2 we refrain from adding further information as readers can refer to mhawej et al 2020a 2020b and allam et al 2021 for more background and technical information different satellites were used in this study as inputs in sebaligee fig 3 the 30 m landsat 8 satellite datasets were collected in 2018 and in 2019 as discussed in mhawej et al 2020a 2020b level 1 top of atmosphere toa datasets were processed to retrieve the land surface temperature lst faour et al 2015 2016 level 2 surface reflectance sr images corresponding to atmospherically corrected satellite images generated from the land surface reflectance code lasrc were used to calculate the ndvi and albedo values faour et al 2018 2015 nasrallah et al 2018 the elevation and slope data were retrieved from the 90 m nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm version 4 furthermore agricultural lands were processed from a combination of 1 km version 6 terra and aqua land cover modis products i e mcd12q1 the cloud cover data were extracted from the modis terra daily snow cover product i e mod10a1 climatic datasets i e temperature relative humidity wind speed were acquired from the era5 or the fifth generation ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate a simplified flowchart of sebaligee is found in fig 3 it is important to note that sebaligee enables the incorporation of the required inputs i e landsat 8 srtm mcd12q1 and era5 automatically without any interference from the user having only selected the needed month and year sebaligee was then implemented between january 2018 and december 2019 on the gee platform available at https bit ly 3nynmoy automatically producing 30 m monthly akc values mhawej et al 2020a 2020b mhawej and faour 2020 users shall need simply to apply the following equation to retrieve the eta values as follows 3 eta akc x et 0 where eta is the actual crop evapotranspiration akc is found in table 2 and et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration it is important to note that sebaligee solves and provides et0 eta and akc the 30 m usda nass cropland data were used for the identification of diverse crop types locations within the study area more particularly to minimize errors due to changing climate and management conditions in each crop type the 2018 wet year and 2019 dry year were averaged as a result several thousands plots fig 4 over 4 million agricultural pixels were considered in this study where the usda nass cropland data crop map already identifying several crop types in each of the years 2018 and 2019 was used further online processing was done including the average and the standard deviation retrieval of akc values per crop type and at plot level it is important to note that given the consideration of the huge number of plots for each crop type stretched over a large study area 2600 km2 the obtained average monthly akc values based on the satellite overpass dates can reflect the monthly akc values for these crops in this specific climatic zone more precisely no temporal interpolation of akc values was done between the satellite overpass time as the diverse spatially distributed akc values in each month are surrogate to the different akc values in that same month and for each crop type 3 results almond showed an increasing trend from an akc value of 0 77 in november to 1 31 in march a descending trend is seen afterwards with akc values of 0 75 in october a small decrease followed by an increase is highlighted in june and july alfalfa showed two cycles indicating two cuts in the considered years with the first beginning in january and ending in may the second is much wider and had begun in may and ended in november december winter wheat presented a small peak in november december followed by a considerably higher peak in march with an akc value of 1 23 as the area is dominated by almond the average akc trendline for the whole considered area is coinciding largely with almond akc trendline fig 5 this latter enables to identify the monthly crop water demand consumption in the study area s plots labelled as one or more crop types according to the usda nass cropland data but also to manage the water resources of the study area all year long including months with and without vegetation cover thus akc values are available in each month and for each pixel even when no cultivation is available for instance for sweet corn plots cultivated around january and remaining for 140 days allen et al 1998 akc values between july and december represent the evaporation from the soil differing between soil types and managements but captured in the akc values which are mandatory in basin scale assessments of water availability and allocation the comprehensive monthly average akc for the sixty available crop types in the study area is presented in table 2 4 discussion sebaligee has been already calibrated and validated for the considered study area and its outputs showed a good agreement with ground based et measurements with an ame of 0 32 mm day mhawej and faour 2020 the multi year average akc values include the effects of the different agro climatic zones within the study area diverse irrigation and fertilization management plans different soil types and different genotypes including such heterogeneity and huge number of plots enabled setting an average closer to reality where policy makers and farm managers can benefit from for a better assessment of their choices to optimize their water use e g water allocation budget estimation etc addressing decision makers and end users for this purpose has been particularly discussed in previous research e g park et al 2017 french et al 2020 nasrallah et al 2020 highlighting the importance to obtain a similar factor for more adequate irrigation and fertilization interventions particularly when produced in a near real time scale the crops studied showed a similar behavior concerning the akc trend over their growing seasons during the beginning of the crop cycle the akc values were low indicating low vegetation growth and thus a low water demand especially for the annual crops since usually in their early vegetative development transpiration rate is very low as values approach 1 and beyond indicating maximum vegetative growth eta normally is thus equal and or higher than the crop reference et chahbi bellakanji et al 2018 in this case and particularly in the considered plain where crops are destined for mass consumption farmers and land owners tend to irrigate their fields to maximize their final yields scanlon et al 2012 zaccaria et al 2017 as found in previous almonds research e g clark et al 2007 stevens et al 2012 spinelli et al 2016 bellvert et al 2018 garcía tejero et al 2018 the akc values found based on sebaligee were higher than the standard fao kc i e 0 9 and reached 1 3 in mid season this confirms the need for more realistic kc values particularly in the california region sanden et al 2012 where almond is a major agricultural commodity the two decreasing akc values found in june and in september could be due to the plantation of different almond cultivars similar to what was found in bellvert et al 2018 studying two cultivars namely cv nonpareil and cv carmel on alternating rows the almond planting period stretched between february and october which can be due to the vast geographic area studied including different climatic conditions and management practices in comparison the fao 56 report allen et al 1998 indicated a season beginning in march and ending eight months later for the deciduous orchard in california therefore and as suggested by the fao 56 report adjustments of kc are required when the mid and late season cover several climatic seasons including wet and dry years allen et al 1998 still this paper showed an average of both wet and dry seasons further processing and investigations can be produced by the users when focusing on a specific season condition similar observations can be deduced for alfalfa plantations where two cutting cycles were seen according to the two peaks found in fig 5 in fao 56 report the first cutting cycle begins in january whereas the second starts in april based on fig 5 the second cycle began in may mid season akc values in the first cycle appear to be higher than those reported in the fao 56 kc list i e 0 95 but aligned with other studies e g hunsaker et al 2002 allen et al 2005 benli et al 2006 also it is important to note that sebali and sebaligee are based on sebal considering a well watered grass as the reference crop and not alfalfa and thus akc alfalfa value might be higher than 1 cereals especially winter crops i e wheat rye oat triticale and barley showed akc values exceeding 1 only during heading and flowering stages i e 1 1 1 2 which is aligned with previous findings e g bodner et al 2015 draghici et al 2019 other cereals including those cultivated during spring summer seasons e g corn and sorghum had a higher average akc over the whole season due to a very short dormancy period compared to winter cereals khaledian et al 2011 the monthly cereals i e barley oats and winter wheat akc trends coincided well with their growth stages including germination flowering and physiological maturity but also aligned with several previous studies e g ko et al 2009 palosuo et al 2011 nasrallah et al 2020 mhawej et al 2020a more particularly the akc value starts increasing after dormancy stage is over february march in which an increase in akc is seen then during heading flowering phase the akc reaches its maximum as an indication of maximum evaporation transpiration time while at the end of the season and at the physiological maturity the akc value declines to reach lower values again furthermore akc values per crop showed some discrepancies over the fao 56 values main causes can be related to a changing crop management including irrigation and fertilization schedules battisti et al 2020 which might lead to changes in sowing dates in addition to the appearance of new genotypes with less water demands gracia romero et al 2018 fueled by the variability of climate and the increase of economic and environmental impacts sinclair et al 2020 still further assessments should be conducted at plot level to derive the actual magnitude as well as the direct causes of such a change the importance of this study lies in proposing adjusted kc values over a large area in the california plain this is particularly needed due to the changing climatic and environmental conditions added to human induced changes including diverse cropping systems agricultural practices and budgets this study has enabled for the first time to our knowledge to exhaustively include more than sixty crop types of akc values and at a monthly scale averaged over two consecutives dry and wet years the inclusion of the available data from several thousand plots provided good insight on the actual condition of many crops and helped to draw crucial conclusions still akc in comparison to the fao 56 kc factor has some disadvantages the first is related to its applicability at a regional scale only whereas the standard kc can be applied globally in this context regional and national based studies and over multiple years need to be conducted before arriving at the transferability of the akc values over multiple regions across the globe furthermore the akc values are not focused on the crop development stages but rather assess the water consumption at a monthly scale even when the land is not cultivated a prior knowledge of the diverse development stages of the existent crops is then required more importantly a remote sensing expertise might also be needed to interpret the akc layers anyhow future research shall focus on implementing sebaligee over other representative agricultural regions assisting farmers and other interested parties to ensure healthy crop with good production while withstanding global water scarcity this would enable to propose better water productivity and accounting strategies more in depth analysis can be conducted at plot and regional levels to help complete the picture on the actual water consumption bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 this would enable a comprehensive and effective management of available water resources 5 conclusion with the increasing usage of the advancing technology particularly in precision agriculture pa along a changing world due to natural and anthropogenic impacts the need to update our previous understanding is pivotal this paper aims to propose adjusted kc values for a large number of crops within the california large plain in the united states to be used for the next few years it was done through the usage of rs and gis techniques coupled with the implementation of a widely validated sebaligee model between 2018 and 2019 outputs shall enable decision makers and land managers to have better understanding on the actual water related issues and crisis main findings included a variation of akc seasonal values in comparison to the fao 56 standard kc values but also longer development seasons the average monthly akc values ranged between 0 45 and 1 53 more specifically october and november presented the lowest akc values averaged among all crop types with akc values around 0 76 march april and june had the highest average akc values at around 1 17 using monthly akc values can assist in proposing more adequate water management plans in response to the global warming impact and the changing human behaviors and motivations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

actual evapotranspiration eta is required for the assessment of water budget at basin regional and national levels still the lack of the required expertise coupled with sometimes missing input data limits their usage by researchers policy makers water managers and farmers in this study a novel comprehensive monthly adjusted crop coefficients akc list was produced in which these coefficients are usually used to retrieve the much needed eta using the climate sensitive reference crop evapotranspiration et0 more particularly the eta is calculated for more than sixty different crop types present in the mediterranean climate california united states it is based on the two consecutive years of 2018 and 2019 which were wet and dry respectively the google earth engine gee version of the surface energy balance algorithm for land improved sebali surnamed sebaligee with an absolute mean error ame of 9 56 mm month in the study area was used along the annual crop map from the united states department of agriculture usda the main results showed that the average monthly akc values ranged between 0 45 and 1 53 more specifically october and november presented the lowest akc values averaged among all crop types with akc values around 0 76 on the other hand march april and june had the largest average akc values at nearly 1 17 the monthly akc values of the 60 crops studied in the plain of california would potentially assist authorities and hydrologists to better calculate the actual monthly plant water consumption in a simpler way over the upcoming years keywords actual evapotranspiration crop coefficient surface energy balance algorithm for land improved sebali water consumption 1 introduction in an era of fast advancements in digital imagery and technology agricultural studies seem to be lacking behind marin et al 2016 the huge gap between farmers and policy makers on one hand and researchers on the other appears to be consistently expanding park et al 2017 this is exacerbated by the slow incorporation of agricultural studies within the geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs techniques these latter approaches can provide accurate and crucial crop related indices e g normalized difference vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai soil water content swc actual evapotranspiration eta biomass production bm at different temporal and spatial scales through the existence of different space platforms faour et al 2018 ghoussein et al 2018 in terms of water consumption and demand the most straightforward manner to fill this gap is to provide farmers and planners with readily available averaged eta values based on multiple years and adapted for a specific site location still the changing weather conditions and climatic factors e g air temperature relative humidity wind speed incoming solar radiation can hugely affect eta rates mhawej and faour 2020 even within the same zone the best option would be then to apply the crop coefficient kc values for diverse crops in the considered locations these coefficients are then multiplied by the climate sensitive reference crop evapotranspiration et0 to assess the crop evapotranspiration etc thus providing important information on crop water consumption as follows 1 etc kc x et 0 where etc is the crop evapotranspiration under unstressed conditions kc is the crop coefficient under standard conditions and et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration this is exactly what was produced two decades ago in the fao 56 exhaustive kc list allen et al 1998 still the fao 56 kc list main limitations reside in only providing kc values in three major stages for each crop i e initial mid and end of season and under standard conditions only usually nonexistent in real life even when including other situations such as a changing relative humidity wind speed salinity or the impact of the climate change several previous studies have questioned its direct usage more particularly marin et al 2016 selected three experiments with diverse crop types in terms of physiology and planting arrangements to assess the crop coefficient paradigm and its relation to et0 they concluded that the definition of kc as presented in fao 56 should be improved to capture the change in et0 lozano et al 2017 focused on melon crop cultivated in a protected environment their findings even after adjustments as requested in allen et al 1998 depicted a shorter phenological stage compared to the fao data coupled with different kc values in the initial intermediate and final phenological stages wang et al 2018 conducted a winter wheat field experiment for three consecutive years between 2013 and 2016 while including the impact of straw mulching their findings showed that the corrected kc values from fao 56 have underestimated the real kc of winter wheat in mid season allen et al 2005 tried to check the ability of calculating kc from discharge measurements based on the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach an overprediction of 8 was found fandiño et al 2012 tested the change in vineyards kc in three irrigation scenarios i e rain fed surface and subsurface drip irrigation for three crop seasons between 2008 and 2010 even when using the dual kc approach and after much calibrations and validations their kc values disagreed with the fao 56 values similarly jiang et al 2019 used the dual kc method for the maize crop between 2013 and 2014 in northwest china they found that kc values were higher than fao 56 data at both initial and development stages furthermore mata gonzález et al 2005 have discussed the inappropriate use of fao 56 kc values to estimate evapotranspiration for different crop types in arid ecosystems where plants do not have high leaf area index lai or little stomatal resistance to water loss they concluded that the fao 56 kc method typically overestimated water use when plants encounter suboptimal conditions thus it is not suitable for determining actual evapotranspiration of vegetation adapted to arid conditions zanotelli et al 2019 showed a discrepancy between apple orchard kc values retrieved from fao and their values based on eddy covariance towers placed in south italy such difference was related to relatively humid environment and the availability of a distinctive grass surface this was thoroughly discussed in annandale and stockle 1994 study which has provided a sensitivity analysis of a changing kc with variations in solar radiation air temperature air vapor density and wind speed they suggested that for crops taller than those prevailing at the site where they were experimentally derived usually coupled with a lower canopy resistance kc values fluctuate with changes in weather conditions thus it was recommended to develop regionally based adjusted kc akc values which could better assist in irrigation management while providing better understanding of plant water consumption for the studied region ko et al 2009 mhawej and faour 2020 this is the main objective of this paper such information can be retrieved through the implementation of an accurate seb model fed with satellite images providing good eta estimations while extending the monitoring at the field level in this context this study used an iteration of the widely validated surface energy balance algorithm for land improved sebali model in different climatic regions mhawej et al 2020a 2020b allam et al 2021 surnamed sebaligee and detailed in mhawej and faour 2020 landsat 8 30 m satellite images were used to assess the changing kc values in more than sixty crop types in the california plain united states the annual crop maps of 2018 and 2019 provided by united states department of agriculture usda are used as a crop mask it is important to note that the presented comprehensive list of akc in this paper corresponds to monthly values and the akc values are hence adapted for the california plain region our findings assist water manager and policy makers to propose sustainable water budget and accounting plans in a straightforward and easy manner in the mediterranean climate california plain 2 material and methods 2 1 study area a part of the major plain in the state of california united states is considered as the study area fig 1 extending over an area of 2640 km2 the mean altitude is 26 m a s l the prevailing climate is a hot summer mediterranean with an average annual precipitation of 420 mm between 2018 and 2019 agriculture is the main economic activity in the study area with more than sixty different crop types available almond plantation is widespread over 357 km2 followed by alfalfa and walnut with 233 km2 and 211 km2 respectively according to the usda nass averaged between 2018 and 2019 2 2 data background and methods sebaligee is the latest iteration of sebali fully automated open source user friendly and produces accurate eta estimation using the massive computational power and large remote sensing database available within the google earth engine gee cloud platform mhawej and faour 2020 a comparison between sebali sebaligee and fao 56 methods is found in table 1 sebaligee was specifically calibrated and validated in the plain of california thus within the considered study area which is very close to the eddy covariance flux towers i e us twt and us tw3 the eta absolute mean error ame was 0 32 mm day mhawej and faour 2020 it is important to note that sebali was proposed using several improvements found in the previous seb models e g agricultural based hot cold pixels selection water stress ws factor identification and instantaneous to daily et transformation but also with a reduction of the required inputs including some of the previously pivotal climatic and soil related datasets an automated selection of hot cold pixels an internal water based calibration process and a cloud removal procedure it is based on the widely known surface energy equation price 1985 at the earth s surface which can be approximated as follows 2 rn g h e 0 where rn is the net radiation flux at the surface w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 and e is the latent heat flux w m 2 this latter considered as the residual of the surface energy equation particularly above natural environment is what the satellite based approaches are aiming to resolve using the available visible used for vegetation conditions and albedo near infrared used for vegetation conditions shortwave infrared used for albedo and thermal bands used for land surface temperatures the general structure of seb models can be found in fig 2 we refrain from adding further information as readers can refer to mhawej et al 2020a 2020b and allam et al 2021 for more background and technical information different satellites were used in this study as inputs in sebaligee fig 3 the 30 m landsat 8 satellite datasets were collected in 2018 and in 2019 as discussed in mhawej et al 2020a 2020b level 1 top of atmosphere toa datasets were processed to retrieve the land surface temperature lst faour et al 2015 2016 level 2 surface reflectance sr images corresponding to atmospherically corrected satellite images generated from the land surface reflectance code lasrc were used to calculate the ndvi and albedo values faour et al 2018 2015 nasrallah et al 2018 the elevation and slope data were retrieved from the 90 m nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm version 4 furthermore agricultural lands were processed from a combination of 1 km version 6 terra and aqua land cover modis products i e mcd12q1 the cloud cover data were extracted from the modis terra daily snow cover product i e mod10a1 climatic datasets i e temperature relative humidity wind speed were acquired from the era5 or the fifth generation ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate a simplified flowchart of sebaligee is found in fig 3 it is important to note that sebaligee enables the incorporation of the required inputs i e landsat 8 srtm mcd12q1 and era5 automatically without any interference from the user having only selected the needed month and year sebaligee was then implemented between january 2018 and december 2019 on the gee platform available at https bit ly 3nynmoy automatically producing 30 m monthly akc values mhawej et al 2020a 2020b mhawej and faour 2020 users shall need simply to apply the following equation to retrieve the eta values as follows 3 eta akc x et 0 where eta is the actual crop evapotranspiration akc is found in table 2 and et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration it is important to note that sebaligee solves and provides et0 eta and akc the 30 m usda nass cropland data were used for the identification of diverse crop types locations within the study area more particularly to minimize errors due to changing climate and management conditions in each crop type the 2018 wet year and 2019 dry year were averaged as a result several thousands plots fig 4 over 4 million agricultural pixels were considered in this study where the usda nass cropland data crop map already identifying several crop types in each of the years 2018 and 2019 was used further online processing was done including the average and the standard deviation retrieval of akc values per crop type and at plot level it is important to note that given the consideration of the huge number of plots for each crop type stretched over a large study area 2600 km2 the obtained average monthly akc values based on the satellite overpass dates can reflect the monthly akc values for these crops in this specific climatic zone more precisely no temporal interpolation of akc values was done between the satellite overpass time as the diverse spatially distributed akc values in each month are surrogate to the different akc values in that same month and for each crop type 3 results almond showed an increasing trend from an akc value of 0 77 in november to 1 31 in march a descending trend is seen afterwards with akc values of 0 75 in october a small decrease followed by an increase is highlighted in june and july alfalfa showed two cycles indicating two cuts in the considered years with the first beginning in january and ending in may the second is much wider and had begun in may and ended in november december winter wheat presented a small peak in november december followed by a considerably higher peak in march with an akc value of 1 23 as the area is dominated by almond the average akc trendline for the whole considered area is coinciding largely with almond akc trendline fig 5 this latter enables to identify the monthly crop water demand consumption in the study area s plots labelled as one or more crop types according to the usda nass cropland data but also to manage the water resources of the study area all year long including months with and without vegetation cover thus akc values are available in each month and for each pixel even when no cultivation is available for instance for sweet corn plots cultivated around january and remaining for 140 days allen et al 1998 akc values between july and december represent the evaporation from the soil differing between soil types and managements but captured in the akc values which are mandatory in basin scale assessments of water availability and allocation the comprehensive monthly average akc for the sixty available crop types in the study area is presented in table 2 4 discussion sebaligee has been already calibrated and validated for the considered study area and its outputs showed a good agreement with ground based et measurements with an ame of 0 32 mm day mhawej and faour 2020 the multi year average akc values include the effects of the different agro climatic zones within the study area diverse irrigation and fertilization management plans different soil types and different genotypes including such heterogeneity and huge number of plots enabled setting an average closer to reality where policy makers and farm managers can benefit from for a better assessment of their choices to optimize their water use e g water allocation budget estimation etc addressing decision makers and end users for this purpose has been particularly discussed in previous research e g park et al 2017 french et al 2020 nasrallah et al 2020 highlighting the importance to obtain a similar factor for more adequate irrigation and fertilization interventions particularly when produced in a near real time scale the crops studied showed a similar behavior concerning the akc trend over their growing seasons during the beginning of the crop cycle the akc values were low indicating low vegetation growth and thus a low water demand especially for the annual crops since usually in their early vegetative development transpiration rate is very low as values approach 1 and beyond indicating maximum vegetative growth eta normally is thus equal and or higher than the crop reference et chahbi bellakanji et al 2018 in this case and particularly in the considered plain where crops are destined for mass consumption farmers and land owners tend to irrigate their fields to maximize their final yields scanlon et al 2012 zaccaria et al 2017 as found in previous almonds research e g clark et al 2007 stevens et al 2012 spinelli et al 2016 bellvert et al 2018 garcía tejero et al 2018 the akc values found based on sebaligee were higher than the standard fao kc i e 0 9 and reached 1 3 in mid season this confirms the need for more realistic kc values particularly in the california region sanden et al 2012 where almond is a major agricultural commodity the two decreasing akc values found in june and in september could be due to the plantation of different almond cultivars similar to what was found in bellvert et al 2018 studying two cultivars namely cv nonpareil and cv carmel on alternating rows the almond planting period stretched between february and october which can be due to the vast geographic area studied including different climatic conditions and management practices in comparison the fao 56 report allen et al 1998 indicated a season beginning in march and ending eight months later for the deciduous orchard in california therefore and as suggested by the fao 56 report adjustments of kc are required when the mid and late season cover several climatic seasons including wet and dry years allen et al 1998 still this paper showed an average of both wet and dry seasons further processing and investigations can be produced by the users when focusing on a specific season condition similar observations can be deduced for alfalfa plantations where two cutting cycles were seen according to the two peaks found in fig 5 in fao 56 report the first cutting cycle begins in january whereas the second starts in april based on fig 5 the second cycle began in may mid season akc values in the first cycle appear to be higher than those reported in the fao 56 kc list i e 0 95 but aligned with other studies e g hunsaker et al 2002 allen et al 2005 benli et al 2006 also it is important to note that sebali and sebaligee are based on sebal considering a well watered grass as the reference crop and not alfalfa and thus akc alfalfa value might be higher than 1 cereals especially winter crops i e wheat rye oat triticale and barley showed akc values exceeding 1 only during heading and flowering stages i e 1 1 1 2 which is aligned with previous findings e g bodner et al 2015 draghici et al 2019 other cereals including those cultivated during spring summer seasons e g corn and sorghum had a higher average akc over the whole season due to a very short dormancy period compared to winter cereals khaledian et al 2011 the monthly cereals i e barley oats and winter wheat akc trends coincided well with their growth stages including germination flowering and physiological maturity but also aligned with several previous studies e g ko et al 2009 palosuo et al 2011 nasrallah et al 2020 mhawej et al 2020a more particularly the akc value starts increasing after dormancy stage is over february march in which an increase in akc is seen then during heading flowering phase the akc reaches its maximum as an indication of maximum evaporation transpiration time while at the end of the season and at the physiological maturity the akc value declines to reach lower values again furthermore akc values per crop showed some discrepancies over the fao 56 values main causes can be related to a changing crop management including irrigation and fertilization schedules battisti et al 2020 which might lead to changes in sowing dates in addition to the appearance of new genotypes with less water demands gracia romero et al 2018 fueled by the variability of climate and the increase of economic and environmental impacts sinclair et al 2020 still further assessments should be conducted at plot level to derive the actual magnitude as well as the direct causes of such a change the importance of this study lies in proposing adjusted kc values over a large area in the california plain this is particularly needed due to the changing climatic and environmental conditions added to human induced changes including diverse cropping systems agricultural practices and budgets this study has enabled for the first time to our knowledge to exhaustively include more than sixty crop types of akc values and at a monthly scale averaged over two consecutives dry and wet years the inclusion of the available data from several thousand plots provided good insight on the actual condition of many crops and helped to draw crucial conclusions still akc in comparison to the fao 56 kc factor has some disadvantages the first is related to its applicability at a regional scale only whereas the standard kc can be applied globally in this context regional and national based studies and over multiple years need to be conducted before arriving at the transferability of the akc values over multiple regions across the globe furthermore the akc values are not focused on the crop development stages but rather assess the water consumption at a monthly scale even when the land is not cultivated a prior knowledge of the diverse development stages of the existent crops is then required more importantly a remote sensing expertise might also be needed to interpret the akc layers anyhow future research shall focus on implementing sebaligee over other representative agricultural regions assisting farmers and other interested parties to ensure healthy crop with good production while withstanding global water scarcity this would enable to propose better water productivity and accounting strategies more in depth analysis can be conducted at plot and regional levels to help complete the picture on the actual water consumption bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 this would enable a comprehensive and effective management of available water resources 5 conclusion with the increasing usage of the advancing technology particularly in precision agriculture pa along a changing world due to natural and anthropogenic impacts the need to update our previous understanding is pivotal this paper aims to propose adjusted kc values for a large number of crops within the california large plain in the united states to be used for the next few years it was done through the usage of rs and gis techniques coupled with the implementation of a widely validated sebaligee model between 2018 and 2019 outputs shall enable decision makers and land managers to have better understanding on the actual water related issues and crisis main findings included a variation of akc seasonal values in comparison to the fao 56 standard kc values but also longer development seasons the average monthly akc values ranged between 0 45 and 1 53 more specifically october and november presented the lowest akc values averaged among all crop types with akc values around 0 76 march april and june had the highest average akc values at around 1 17 using monthly akc values can assist in proposing more adequate water management plans in response to the global warming impact and the changing human behaviors and motivations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9912,this study explored the effects of ammonia oxidizing bacterial aob strain s2 7 25 on the compensatory growth of corn zea mays l upon post drought rewatering using seedlings as test materials this study consisted of two treatment conditions isolation and screening of aob strain and aob strain inoculated to soils isolated and screened from soil s2 7 25 had 100 similarity to acinetobacter pittii the experimental design of s2 7 25 inoculation to soils was composed of five treatments 1 wetness 2 post drought rewatering 3 post drought rewatering with s2 7 25 inoculation 4 post drought rewatering with nitrification inhibitor addition to soil and 5 post drought rewatering with nitrification inhibitor addition to soil and s2 7 25 inoculation rewatering increased the total biomass and net photosynthetic rate of corn compared with wetness and s2 7 25 inoculation greatly increased these parameters of rewatering corn however nitrification inhibitor addition greatly decreased these parameters of rewatering corn inoculated with or without s2 7 25 rewatering increased the rhizosphere soil nitrification rate of corn and rewatering with s2 7 25 inoculation further increased it however nitrification inhibitor addition decreased this parameter in rewatering corn with or without s2 7 25 inoculation the cytokinin delivery rates from the roots to the leaves were regulated by soil nitrification in the rhizosphere and it determined the leaf cytokinin concentration that is closely related to corn rewatering growth the highest leaf cytokinin concentration during rewatering caused over compensatory growth and the highest water use efficiency in rewatering corn with s2 7 25 inoculation among all treatments compensatory and under compensatory growth occurred in rewatering corn and in corn with nitrification inhibitor addition respectively in a word s2 7 25 increased corn compensatory growth by regulating soil nitrification and root induced leaf cytokinin keywords ammonia oxidising bacteria strain soil nitrification corn compensatory growth cytokinin post drought rewatering 1 introduction the shortage of water resources seriously threatens crop production in northern china yan et al 2018 increasing the water use efficiency of crop is an effective measure to cope with this problem crop compensatory growth upon post drought rewatering is the fast growth of crop during rewatering to offset the growth decrease during drought plant under compensatory compensatory and over compensatory growths occur when compensatory biomasses during recovery growth below equal to and exceeding the lost biomass during environmental stress respectively belsky 1986 grogan and zamin 2018 on the basis of the theory of post drought rewatering compensatory growth of crops water saving techniques such as supplemental irrigation rainwater harvesting irrigation regulated deficit irrigation and deficit irrigation have been widely used in agricultural production wei et al 2018 ali et al 2019 martinez romero et al 2019 himanshu et al 2019 therefore the post drought rewatering compensatory growth of crops is important for water saving in agricultural production many studies on the post drought rewatering compensatory growth of crops focused on the underlying physiological mechanism for example post drought rewatering enhances photosynthetic rates as a result the growth rates of wheat cotton maize and sorghum after rewatering are improved tatar et al 2016 luo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 fertilisation could increase the post drought rewatering growth of pennisetum centrasiaticum by enhancing photosynthesis luo et al 2014 niu et al 2018 reported that cotton post drought rewatering compensatory growth is closely related to root growth soil nitrate no3 is an important influencing factor of crop compensatory growth a decrease in no3 supply in soil inhibits the synthesis of cytokinin in corn roots and its delivery to the leaves whereas an increase in no3 supply promotes these processes in addition the leaf cytokinin regulated by the roots is closely related to the compensatory growth of corn upon post drought rewatering wang et al 2016a 2018 in soil no3 is produced mainly via nitrification wang et al 2020a found that soil nitrification causes compensatory growth in corn furthermore wang et al 2020b reported that rhizosphere soil nitrification is directly related to the compensatory growth of corn thus soil nitrification of the rhizosphere is the key factor regulating the compensatory growth of corn soil nitrification mainly includes two steps firstly ammonia oxidising bacteria aob and ammonia oxidising archaea oxidise ammonium nitrogen into nitrite nitrogen then nitrite oxidising bacteria oxidise nitrite nitrogen into no3 in soil nitrite nitrogen is easily oxidised to no3 however the oxidation of ammonium nitrogen into nitrite nitrogen is the rate limiting step of soil nitrification fang et al 2019 aob are often distributed in soils rich in organic nutrients but ammonia oxidising archaea often occur in poor soils wang et al 2016b rhizosphere micro environment gathers much organic nutrient substances hinsinger et al 2009 chowdhury et al 2017 which is beneficial for the growth of soil aob thus rhizosphere soil aob is important for crop compensatory growth by inoculating soil phosphate solubilizing bacteria increase the resistance of aloe vera aloe barbadensis miller to drought khajeeyan et al 2019 inoculation with the plant growth promoting rhizobacteria of pseudomonas fluorescens strain increases the water deficit stress tolerance and yield of sweet corn zea mays l var saccharata zarei et al 2019 inoculating bacteria to soil is an effective way to testify its effects on the growth of crops under drought however the effects of rhizosphere soil aob strains on crop compensatory growth remain unclear filling this research gap is important to elucidate the underlying mechanism as the third largest global crop in the world corn is widely planted in china corn seedlings grow fast thus their variation in growth is apt to be detected hence this study selected corn seedlings as test materials an aob strain from soil was isolated screened and then inoculated to soil to explore its effects on cytokinin synthesis in the roots the relationship between leaf cytokinin and corn growth was explored and the effects of the aob strain on the crop compensatory growth of corn upon post drought rewatering were determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design 2 1 1 isolation and screening of soil aob strain a soil aob strain was isolated and screened and the mediums used in this isolation and screening was as following enrichment medium nh4 2so4 0 5 g kh2po4 0 75 g nah2po4 0 25 g mnso4 4h2o 0 01 g mgso4 7h2o 0 03 g caco3 5 0 g distilled water 1000 ml ph 7 2 separation medium enrichment medium 1 l agar 2 5 g lb medium tryptone 10 g yeast extract 5 g nacl 10 g distilled water 1000 ml ph 7 0 samples of corn rhizosphere soil were collected and then added to the enrichment medium to cultivate for 15 25 days at 28 under dark conditions when the aob was found occurring by using griess reagent to test part of the enrichment solution was transferred to a new enrichment medium to continue to cultivate this process was repeated two times to obtain pure aob enrichment solution then part of this solution was coated in the separation medium to cultivate for 5 8 days at 28 under dark conditions when tip size bacterial colonies occurred single colony were selected and coated in the separation medium of the agar plate this process was repeated 5 10 times to obtain pure bacterial colonies which were inoculated into the enrichment solution to produce the aob inoculated solution used in the present study in addition part of the aob inoculated solution was inoculated in lb medium to study its heterotrophic growth the characters of individual forms of isolated aob strains were observed under an optic microscope and the isolated aob strains were tested by gram staining bacterial total dna was extracted using the bacterial genome extraction kit bioer technology co ltd and 16srdna was also amplified the forward primer was 27f 5 agagttgatcctggctcag 3 and the reverse primer was 1492r 5 taccttgttacgactt 3 a 25 µl pcr reaction system included the following components 2 5 µl of 10 buffer with mg2 2 µl of dntp 2 5 mmol l 0 4 µl each of forward and reverse primers 10 µmol l 30 ng of dna template 0 75 u of ex taq dna polymerase and the rest being ddh2o the reaction procedure was as follows 4 min of predegeneration at 94 1 min of degeneration at 94 45 s of renaturation at 55 2 min of extension at 72 30 cycles and 10 min of 72 the amplification products were analysed using 1 0 agarose gels the dna fragment purification kit was used to purify about 1 5 kb target fragment purified production was sequenced in sangon biotech company dna sequencing results were comparatively analysed with genbank to obtain the genes of close strains the neighbour joining method of mega3 1 was used to construct aob phylogenetic trees the isolated and screened aob strain was inoculated into the soil samples to test its effect on soil nitrification exp 1 twelve uniform soils with 50 g each were prepared they were divided into four groups with three soils per group approximately 1 ml culture solution of the isolated and screened aob strain 7 5 g l was applied into the soils in the second and fourth groups in addition about 1 ml of the nitrification inhibitor 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate solution 1 5 g l was added to the third and fourth groups to inhibit soil nitrification then 20 g of each soil sample was cultivated for 7 days at 25 c under 60 of the field water capacity the differences in soil no3 content between soils of cultivation and no cultivation were divided by the 7 days to obtain the net soil nitrification rates therefore treatments in exp 1 were as follows 1 soil without any additives st 2 soil inoculated with aob strain si 3 soil added with the nitrification inhibitor sn and 4 soil inoculated with aob strain and added with the nitrification inhibitor sc each treatment was repeated in triplicate 2 1 2 corn compensatory growth of drought stress rewatering the present study was carried out using the pot experiment in henan university of science and technology luoyang city henan province china the average annual rainfall was 601 mm and the average temperature was 14 2 c in this site the corn zea mays l variety used in this test was zhengdan 958 which features drought resistance and good adaptability on may 15th 2020 15 corn seeds were planted in a plastic pot 21 5 cm in mouth diameter 20 0 cm in height containing 5 8 kg of soil and the soil organic carbon content was 24 1 g kg at the same time with 2 12 g kg of total nitrogen content two hundred of these pots were prepared corn seedlings emerged after approximately 6 days by thinning five strong and healthy seedlings in each pot were allowed to grow for 10 days then evenly grown seedlings of 45 pots were chosen these 45 pots were averagely split into five groups a growth period of 10 days was set up for drought and a 10 day rewatering period was established the first group remained wet during drought and rewatering and the second third fourth and fifth groups were under drought and wet conditions during the two periods about 30 ml of the nitrification inhibitor 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate solution 1 5 g l was added to the fourth and fifth groups per day 3 days before the inoculation of aob to the end of the drought period to inhibit soil nitrification pre experimental results showed that its inhibitory effect on corn growth indicated hysteresis at the end of the drought period approximately 100 ml of the culture solution of the isolated and screened aob strain 7 5 g l was applied into the soils in the third and fifth groups the experiment on the compensatory growth of corn upon post drought rewatering exp 2 involved five treatments 1 being wet pw 2 post drought rewatering pd 3 post drought rewatering with aob strain inoculation pi 4 post drought rewatering with nitrification inhibitor addition to soil pn and 5 post drought rewatering with nitrification inhibitor addition to soil and aob strain inoculation pc the nine pots of each treatment were split into three groups and the three pots in each group were the three replicates for each treatment water was added to pots with soil water contents below 50 of the field capacity to ensure their soil water contents are 50 55 of the field capacity which indicated drought similarly wetness was obtained by adding water to maintain soil water contents that are 75 80 of the field capacity according to wang et al 2018 the soil water contents were calculated using the following formula 1 1 swc b t b d b e b p b d fwc 100 where swc bt bd be bp and fwc are the soil water content temporary whole pot weight net dried soil weight empty pot weight estimated fresh weight of all plants and field water capacity in each pot respectively bp was decided on extra pots early one group of each treatment was selected to measure plant hormones biomass soil nh4 and no3 contents and soil nitrification rates at the end of the drought period it was the same at days 5 and 10 after rewatering at the end of the drought period the net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate tr and stomatal conductance sc were measured in each treatment and the same was performed at days 3 6 and 9 after rewatering 2 2 measurements and data analysis 2 2 1 biomass and photosynthesis the roots were splintered off from corns by washing biomass was measured by drying fresh samples at 65 c for 72 h the aboveground and total biomasses were calculated by adding the stem and leaf biomasses and the stem leaf and root biomasses respectively water use efficiency was measured by water use throughout the drought and rewatering periods divided by the increase in total biomass total biomass increase was calculated by its difference between the start of the drought period and the end of the rewatering period and the added water throughout the drought and rewatering periods indicated water use pn tr and gs were measured using li 6400 photosynthesis equipment at 11 00 am on sunny days 2 2 2 soil nitrification the pot walls were cut open to take the soil and root out as a whole then the soils were removed from the whole root by patting this patting process was repeated many times until small soil particles were removed from the roots these small soil particles were collected which formed the rhizosphere soil used in this study these peeling soil samples at the beginning of patting were also collected which formed the non rhizosphere soil used in this study soil ammonium nh4 and no3 contents were measured using the indophenol blue colorimetric method and phenol disulphonic acid spectrophotometry as previously described by lu 1999 soil net nitrification rate was measured using the culture method soil samples at the end of the drought period in pd pi pn and pc were cultured at 25 c under the field water capacity of 50 55 for the simulation of drought soil samples at days 5 and 10 after rewatering in all treatments and at the end of drought stress period in pw were cultured at 25 c under the field water capacity of 75 80 to simulate wet condition the differences in soil no3 content between soils before and after cultivation were divided by the 7 days to obtain the net soil nitrification rates 2 2 3 plant hormone the corn was clipped at the stem base then 1 0 g of absorbent cotton was used to cover these wounds to absorb xylem sap for 12 h the xylem sap volume was obtained by using the cotton weight increase being divided by 1 g cm3 by compacting cotton the saps were squeezed out of the cotton and they were collected to measure the zeatin riboside zr and abscisic acid aba concentrations in xylem saps in accordance with the method described by qin and wang 2020 the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure indole 3 acetic acid iaa and gibberellic acid ga3 contents zr and aba contents in the leaves and zr and aba contents in the xylem saps czr and caba respectively the zr and aba amounts in the xylem saps collected per h were used to express zr and aba delivery rates from the roots to the leaves r zr and r aba respectively table 1 lists the abbreviations used in this study values presented in the tables and graphs were mean values and duncan s multiple range test p 0 05 was performed to analyse the difference among these values by using microsoft excel 2007 3 results 3 1 exp 1 aob strain s2 7 25 was isolated and screened in the present study as shown in fig 1 this strain belonged to acinetobacter and had 100 similarity to acinetobacter pittii when s2 7 25 was inoculated to separation and lb media its colony appeared in separation medium after 3 5 days and after 1 3 days in lb medium fig 2a and b this result showed that the growth potential of s2 7 25 was greater in lb medium than in separation medium in the aob separation medium the bacterial colony of s2 7 25 appeared beige opaque round irregular edge and smooth surfaced fig 2a s2 7 25 was 1 25 µm long 0 57 µm wide and showed an oval shape under the microscope fig 2c soil nitrification rates were 3 2 47 8 and 4 2 times higher in si than in st sn and sc respectively and it was 1 3 and 15 0 times higher in st than in sn and sc respectively fig 3 therefore the inoculation of s2 7 25 greatly increased soil nitrification rate but the nitrification inhibitor caused it to drop sharply and greatly restricted the promotional effect of s2 7 25 on it 3 2 exp 2 3 2 1 biomass aboveground and total biomasses were significantly higher in pw than in pd pi pn and pc before rewatering fig 4 which indicated that corn growth was inhibited by drought these biomasses were similar between pd and pw at 10 days post rewatering indicating that rewatering increased corn growth total biomasses were 1 62 and 1 69 times higher in pi than in pw and pd at 10 days post rewatering respectively which showed that the inoculation of s2 7 25 greatly increased the growth of rewatering corn total biomasses at 10 days post rewatering in pd and pw were 1 38 and 1 45 times those in pn respectively and that in pi was 2 1 times that in pc thus the nitrification inhibitor restrained corn growth and the promotional effect of s2 7 25 on corn growth on the basis of total biomasses over compensatory compensatory and under compensatory growth occurred in pi pd and pn and pc respectively the water use efficiency in pi was 2 times greater than that in pd fig 5 and it was 1 45 1 63 and 1 36 times greater in pd than in pw pn and pc respectively therefore rewatering increased water use and it was much more effective in promoting water use when s2 7 25 was inoculated 3 2 2 photosynthetic characteristics before rewatering values of pn tr and sc were significantly higher in pw than in pd pi pn and pc fig 6 which showed that drought restrained the photosynthesis of corn rewatering increased photosynthesis and rewatering with s2 7 25 inoculation had greater effects on it pn sc and tr were significantly higher in pd than in pw and they were higher in pi than in all other treatments during the rewatering period moreover pn tr and sc were significantly lower in pn than in pd and in pc than in pi at 5 and 10 days after rewatering therefore the nitrification inhibitor inhibited corn photosynthesis and the promotional effect of s2 7 25 on photosynthesis 3 2 3 plant hormones before rewatering leaf zr content rzr and czr significantly increased in pw compared with pd pi pn and pc table 2 which indicated that drought decreased leaf cytokinin content and its delivery from roots to leaves considering that zr is a major cytokinin form by contrast these indices increased after rewatering in specific leaf zr content significantly increased at 5 days after rewatering in pd compared with pw and rzr and czr had similar values at 5 and 10 days after rewatering between pd and pw furthermore s2 7 25 increased these indices of rewatering corn leaf zr content rzr and czr significantly increased in pi compared with pr and pw at 5 and 10 days after rewatering the leaf zr content significantly increased in pd and pw compared with pn and the leaf zr content rzr and czr significantly increased in pi compared with pc at 5 and 10 days after rewatering therefore the nitrification inhibitor decreased these indices and it also greatly restrained the promotional effect of s2 7 25 on these indices the aba content of the leaves was significantly higher in pw than in pd pi pn and pc before rewatering but not during rewatering which showed that drought increased leaf aba content but rewatering reversed this effect leaf iaa content significantly increased in pn and pc compared with pw pi and pr at 5 and 10 days after rewatering thus the nitrification inhibitor increased leaf iaa content the rewatering nitrification inhibitor and inoculation of s2 7 25 only slightly affected ga3 content in the leaves 3 2 4 soil nitrification rate soil nh4 and no3 nitrogen as shown in table 3 rhizosphere soil no3 contents were significantly higher in pw than in pd pi pn and pc before rewatering which showed that no3 accumulation decreased under drought in non rhizosphere and rhizosphere environments no significant differences in soil no3 and nh4 contents were observed among pw pd and pi during the rewatering period however soil no3 was significantly lower and soil nh4 content was significantly higher in pn and pc than in pd and pi during this period respectively therefore the nitrification inhibitor could increase nh4 and decrease no3 accumulation in soils and s2 7 25 only slightly affected soil no3 and nh4 contents non rhizosphere and rhizosphere soil nitrification rates significantly increased in pw compared with pd pi pn and pc before rewatering and in pi compared with the other treatments during rewatering thus drought restrained but s2 7 25 promoted soil nitrification the nitrification rates significantly increased in pd compared with pw during the rewatering period in the rhizosphere soil but not in the non rhizosphere soil therefore rewatering increased rhizosphere soil nitrification rates significantly lower soil nitrification rates in the non rhizosphere and rhizosphere environments were observed in pn and pc compared with the other treatments during the rewatering period which showed that the nitrification inhibitor inhibited soil nitrification and the promotional effect of s2 7 25 on the soil nitrification 4 discussion 4 1 effect of s2 7 25 on leaf cytokinin in the present study the average rhizosphere and non rhizosphere soil nitrification rates were nearly two times higher in pi than in pd during rewatering in exp 2 the main reason for this phenomenon was that the inoculation of s2 7 25 increased soil nitrification the soil culture test in exp 1 demonstrated that the inoculation of s2 7 25 increased the soil nitrification rate by more than two times in the soil ecosystem except for autotrophic aob some heterotrophic aob such as acinetobacter pseudomonas ochrobactrum paracoccus and nitrosomonas play an important role in soil nitrification li et al 2020 matsuno et al 2013 taylor et al 2009 kouki et al 2011 reddy et al 2014 our isolated and screened aob strains of s2 7 25 belong to acinetobacter and showed mixed nutritional characteristics indicating that it can increase soil nitrification due to no3 being produced mainly via nitrification more no3 were released from soil in pi compared with pd however the soil no3 concentrations in rhizosphere and non rhizosphere environments were similar between pd and pi during rewatering this finding was mainly because of fast growth after rewatering using a great deal of soil no3 in pi given the presence of the nitrification inhibitor in exp 2 soil no3 contents in the rhizosphere and non rhizosphere environments were lower in pc and pn than in pd and pi respectively borzouei et al 2021 reported that the nitrification inhibitor inhibits the activity of soil microorganisms involved in soil nitrification and decreases soil nitrification rate for the same reason similar soil nitrification rates and no3 contents in the rhizosphere and non rhizosphere environments occurred in pc and pn among the treatments of pi pd and pn the highest soil nitrification rates occurred in pi the next was in pd and the third place was in pn during rewatering as a result the most no3 was released form soil in pi and the second and third places was in pd and pn respectively the contact chances of no3 with the roots were in the order of pi pd and pn and the stimulate intensities of no3 in the roots were in the order of pi pd and pn soil no3 can stimulate roots to synthesise cytokinins in various plants landrein et al 2018 poitout et al 2018 the highest rzr czr and tr in pi during the rewatering period demonstrated the most cytokinins being synthesised and delivered to the leaves resulting in the highest leaf cytokinin content in pi among pi pd and pn cytokinins are mainly synthesised in the roots and can be transmitted to the leaves by means of xylem sap zaicovski et al 2008 wang et al 2016b r zr indicates the delivery speed of cytokinins from roots to leaves in the darkness the cytokinin delivery rate to the leaves in sunlight was the product of t r and c zr as transpiration drives sap to transmit from roots to leaves under this condition similar rzr and czr were recorded between pd and pc but the low tr in pc caused less cytokinin transmission from roots to leaves compared with pd during rewatering as a result leaf cytokinin content was higher in pd than in pc it was likewise that more cytokinin was delivered from roots to increase leaf cytokinin content in pd compared with pw during rewatering 4 2 effect of s2 7 25 on compensatory growth s2 7 25 in pi greatly increased its corn growth during rewatering resulting in 1 69 times higher total biomasses in pi compared with pd at 10 days after rewatering the corn growth after rewatering was mainly involved in the fast photosynthetic organic matter accumulation cytokinins promote photosynthesis kobayashi et al 2012 de moura et al 2017 hence leaf cytokinins caused the high p n in pi compared with pd during rewatering in addition cytokinins play a key role in cell division and its horizontal elongation which benefit photosynthetic organic matter accumulation the nitrification inhibitor restrained the activity of s2 7 25 which caused 1 25 and 2 12 times higher total biomasses in pd and pi than in pn and pc at 10 days after rewatering respectively in the present study compensatory growth occurred in pd the high rhizosphere soil nitrification rate in pd caused more cytokinin being delivered from roots to increase its leaf cytokinin content and p n compared with pw thereby promoting compensatory growth similarly wang et al 2020a 2020b reported that the high rhizosphere soil nitrification rate promotes cytokinin synthesis in roots and compensatory growth in corns of post drought rewatering however non rhizosphere soil nitrification exerted minimal influence on this phenomenon s2 7 25 greatly increased the rhizosphere and non rhizosphere soil nitrification rates of rewatering corns which were more beneficial to root cytokinin synthesis and its delivery to the leaves in pi compared with pd and pw therefore over compensatory growth and the highest water use efficiency occurred in pi accordingly the nitrification inhibitor restrained the activity of s2 7 25 or other soil microbial involved in soil nitrification during rewatering in pc and pn therefore under compensatory growth occurred in these treatments cytokinin producing rhizobacteria of bacillus subtilis could increase the cytokinin contents in the roots and shoots of platycladus orientalis under drought because these bacteria secrete cytokinins that are exogenous hormones applied to the roots the cytokinin increase in the shoots improves its growth and resistance to drought stress liu et al 2013 similar to liu et al 2013 selvakumar et al 2018 found that the cytokinin producing rhizobacteria of citrococcus zhacaiensis and bacillus amyloliquefaciens can promote tomato growth and alleviate deficit irrigation stress effects by secreting cytokinins around its roots different from these studies the present study revealed the leaf cytokinin increase mechanism in plants caused by soil rhizobacteria based on the system of soil roots and leaves that is the soil nitrification the root cytokinin production under no3 stimulation and cytokinin delivery from roots to leaves were integrated into one system to reveal the effects of s2 7 25 on corn compensatory growth and water use efficiency in the future the symbiosis of aob strain and corn roots under drought stress rewatering and wet conditions should be studied to explore the lasting effect of aob strain on cytokinin production and corn growth in this way the corn compensatory growth upon post drought rewatering based on aob strain inoculation will be further revealed 5 conclusion rewatering increased the soil nitrification rates of the rhizosphere in corn of post drought rewatering during the rewatering period inoculation of s2 7 25 greatly increased the soil nitrification rates but the application of a nitrification inhibitor reduced them soil nitrification of the rhizosphere played an important role on cytokinin synthesis in the roots and its delivery to the leaves thereby regulating cytokinin concentration in the leaves the increase in corn leaf cytokinins caused by rewatering increased the photosynthetic rate which boosted the growth of rewatering corn and triggered compensatory growth after post drought rewatering similarly the leaf cytokinin increase of rewatering corn caused by s2 7 25 inoculation greatly promoted photosynthetic rate which resulted in over compensatory growth and high water use efficiency in these corns when s2 7 25 activity was restrained by the nitrification inhibitor the growth of rewatering corn was inhibited and under compensatory growth occurred strain s2 7 25 can increase corn compensatory growth by regulating soil nitrification in the rhizosphere and root induced leaf cytokinins

9912,this study explored the effects of ammonia oxidizing bacterial aob strain s2 7 25 on the compensatory growth of corn zea mays l upon post drought rewatering using seedlings as test materials this study consisted of two treatment conditions isolation and screening of aob strain and aob strain inoculated to soils isolated and screened from soil s2 7 25 had 100 similarity to acinetobacter pittii the experimental design of s2 7 25 inoculation to soils was composed of five treatments 1 wetness 2 post drought rewatering 3 post drought rewatering with s2 7 25 inoculation 4 post drought rewatering with nitrification inhibitor addition to soil and 5 post drought rewatering with nitrification inhibitor addition to soil and s2 7 25 inoculation rewatering increased the total biomass and net photosynthetic rate of corn compared with wetness and s2 7 25 inoculation greatly increased these parameters of rewatering corn however nitrification inhibitor addition greatly decreased these parameters of rewatering corn inoculated with or without s2 7 25 rewatering increased the rhizosphere soil nitrification rate of corn and rewatering with s2 7 25 inoculation further increased it however nitrification inhibitor addition decreased this parameter in rewatering corn with or without s2 7 25 inoculation the cytokinin delivery rates from the roots to the leaves were regulated by soil nitrification in the rhizosphere and it determined the leaf cytokinin concentration that is closely related to corn rewatering growth the highest leaf cytokinin concentration during rewatering caused over compensatory growth and the highest water use efficiency in rewatering corn with s2 7 25 inoculation among all treatments compensatory and under compensatory growth occurred in rewatering corn and in corn with nitrification inhibitor addition respectively in a word s2 7 25 increased corn compensatory growth by regulating soil nitrification and root induced leaf cytokinin keywords ammonia oxidising bacteria strain soil nitrification corn compensatory growth cytokinin post drought rewatering 1 introduction the shortage of water resources seriously threatens crop production in northern china yan et al 2018 increasing the water use efficiency of crop is an effective measure to cope with this problem crop compensatory growth upon post drought rewatering is the fast growth of crop during rewatering to offset the growth decrease during drought plant under compensatory compensatory and over compensatory growths occur when compensatory biomasses during recovery growth below equal to and exceeding the lost biomass during environmental stress respectively belsky 1986 grogan and zamin 2018 on the basis of the theory of post drought rewatering compensatory growth of crops water saving techniques such as supplemental irrigation rainwater harvesting irrigation regulated deficit irrigation and deficit irrigation have been widely used in agricultural production wei et al 2018 ali et al 2019 martinez romero et al 2019 himanshu et al 2019 therefore the post drought rewatering compensatory growth of crops is important for water saving in agricultural production many studies on the post drought rewatering compensatory growth of crops focused on the underlying physiological mechanism for example post drought rewatering enhances photosynthetic rates as a result the growth rates of wheat cotton maize and sorghum after rewatering are improved tatar et al 2016 luo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 fertilisation could increase the post drought rewatering growth of pennisetum centrasiaticum by enhancing photosynthesis luo et al 2014 niu et al 2018 reported that cotton post drought rewatering compensatory growth is closely related to root growth soil nitrate no3 is an important influencing factor of crop compensatory growth a decrease in no3 supply in soil inhibits the synthesis of cytokinin in corn roots and its delivery to the leaves whereas an increase in no3 supply promotes these processes in addition the leaf cytokinin regulated by the roots is closely related to the compensatory growth of corn upon post drought rewatering wang et al 2016a 2018 in soil no3 is produced mainly via nitrification wang et al 2020a found that soil nitrification causes compensatory growth in corn furthermore wang et al 2020b reported that rhizosphere soil nitrification is directly related to the compensatory growth of corn thus soil nitrification of the rhizosphere is the key factor regulating the compensatory growth of corn soil nitrification mainly includes two steps firstly ammonia oxidising bacteria aob and ammonia oxidising archaea oxidise ammonium nitrogen into nitrite nitrogen then nitrite oxidising bacteria oxidise nitrite nitrogen into no3 in soil nitrite nitrogen is easily oxidised to no3 however the oxidation of ammonium nitrogen into nitrite nitrogen is the rate limiting step of soil nitrification fang et al 2019 aob are often distributed in soils rich in organic nutrients but ammonia oxidising archaea often occur in poor soils wang et al 2016b rhizosphere micro environment gathers much organic nutrient substances hinsinger et al 2009 chowdhury et al 2017 which is beneficial for the growth of soil aob thus rhizosphere soil aob is important for crop compensatory growth by inoculating soil phosphate solubilizing bacteria increase the resistance of aloe vera aloe barbadensis miller to drought khajeeyan et al 2019 inoculation with the plant growth promoting rhizobacteria of pseudomonas fluorescens strain increases the water deficit stress tolerance and yield of sweet corn zea mays l var saccharata zarei et al 2019 inoculating bacteria to soil is an effective way to testify its effects on the growth of crops under drought however the effects of rhizosphere soil aob strains on crop compensatory growth remain unclear filling this research gap is important to elucidate the underlying mechanism as the third largest global crop in the world corn is widely planted in china corn seedlings grow fast thus their variation in growth is apt to be detected hence this study selected corn seedlings as test materials an aob strain from soil was isolated screened and then inoculated to soil to explore its effects on cytokinin synthesis in the roots the relationship between leaf cytokinin and corn growth was explored and the effects of the aob strain on the crop compensatory growth of corn upon post drought rewatering were determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design 2 1 1 isolation and screening of soil aob strain a soil aob strain was isolated and screened and the mediums used in this isolation and screening was as following enrichment medium nh4 2so4 0 5 g kh2po4 0 75 g nah2po4 0 25 g mnso4 4h2o 0

samples of corn rhizosphere soil were collected and then added to the enrichment medium to cultivate for 15 25 days at 28 under dark conditions when the aob was found occurring by using griess reagent to test part of the enrichment solution was transferred to a new enrichment medium to continue to cultivate this process was repeated two times to obtain pure aob enrichment solution then part of this solution was coated in the separation medium to cultivate for 5 8 days at 28 under dark conditions when tip size bacterial colonies occurred single colony were selected and coated in the separation medium of the agar plate this process was repeated 5 10 times to obtain pure bacterial colonies which were inoculated into the enrichment solution to produce the aob inoculated solution used in the present study in addition part of the aob inoculated solution was inoculated in lb medium to study its heterotrophic growth the characters of individual forms of isolated aob strains were observed

buffer with mg2 2 µl of dntp 2 5 mmol l 0 4 µl each of forward and reverse primers 10 µmol l 30 ng of dna template 0 75 u of ex taq dna polymerase and the rest being ddh2o the reaction procedure was as follows 4 min of predegeneration at 94 1 min of degeneration at 94 45 s of renaturation at 55 2 min of extension at 72 30 cycles and 10 min of 72 the amplification products were analysed using 1 0 agarose gels the dna fragment purification kit was used to purify about 1 5 kb target fragment purified production was sequenced in sangon biotech company dna sequencing results were comparatively analysed with genbank to obtain the genes of close strains the neighbour joining method of mega3 1 was used to construct aob phylogenetic trees the isolated and screened aob strain was inoculated into the soil samples to test its effect on soil nitrification exp 1 twelve uniform soils with 50 g each were prepared they were divided into four groups with three soils per group approximately 1 ml culture solution of the isolated and screened aob strain 7 5 g l was applied into the soils in the second and fourth groups in addition about 1 ml of the nitrification inhibitor 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate solution 1 5 g l was added to the third and fourth groups to inhibit soil nitrification then 20 g of each soil sample was cultivated for 7 days at 25 c under 60 of the field water capacity the differences in soil no3 content between soils of cultivation and no cultivation were divided by the 7 days to obtain the net soil nitrification rates therefore treatments in exp 1 were as follows 1 soil without any additives st 2 soil inoculated with aob strain si 3 soil added with the nitrification inhibitor sn and 4 soil inoculated with aob strain and added with the nitrification inhibitor sc each treatment was repeated in triplicate 2 1 2 corn compensatory growth of drought stress rewatering the present study was carried out using the pot experiment in henan university of science and technology luoyang city henan province china the average annual rainfall was 601 mm and the average temperature was 14 2 c in this site the corn zea mays l variety used in this test was zhengdan 958 which features drought resistance and good adaptability on may 15th 2020 15 corn seeds were planted in a plastic pot 21 5 cm in mouth diameter 20 0 cm in height containing 5 8 kg of soil and the soil organic carbon content was 24 1 g kg at the same time with 2 12 g kg of total nitrogen content two hundred of these pots were prepared corn seedlings emerged after approximately 6 days by thinning five strong and healthy seedlings in each pot were allowed to grow for 10 days then evenly grown seedlings of 45 pots were chosen these 45 pots were averagely split into five groups a growth period of 10 days was set up for drought and a 10 day rewatering period was established the first group remained wet during drought and rewatering and the second third fourth and fifth groups were under drought and wet conditions during the two periods about 30 ml of the nitrification inhibitor 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate solution 1 5 g l was added to the fourth and fifth groups per day 3 days before the inoculation of aob to the end of the drought period to inhibit soil nitrification pre experimental results showed that its inhibitory effect on corn growth indicated hysteresis at the end of the drought period approximately 100 ml of the culture solution of the isolated and screened aob strain 7 5 g l was applied into the soils in the third and fifth groups the experiment on the compensatory growth of corn upon post drought rewatering exp 2 involved five treatments 1 being wet pw 2 post drought rewatering pd 3 post drought rewatering with aob strain inoculation pi 4 post drought rewatering with nitrification inhibitor addition to soil pn and 5 post drought rewatering with nitrification inhibitor addition to soil and aob strain inoculation pc the nine pots of each treatment were split into three groups and the three pots in each group were the three replicates for each treatment water was added to pots with soil water contents below 50 of the field capacity to ensure their soil water contents are 50 55 of the field capacity which indicated drought similarly wetness was obtained by adding water to maintain soil water contents that are 75 80 of the field capacity according to wang et al 2018 the soil water contents were calculated using the following formula 1 1 swc b t b d b e b p b d fwc 100 where swc bt bd be bp and fwc are the soil water content temporary whole pot weight net dried soil weight empty pot weight estimated fresh weight of all plants and field water capacity in each pot respectively bp was decided on extra pots early one group of each treatment was selected to measure plant hormones biomass soil nh4 and no3 contents and soil nitrification rates at the end of the drought period it was the same at days 5 and 10 after rewatering at the end of the drought period the net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate tr and stomatal conductance sc were measured in each treatment and the same was performed at days 3 6 and 9 after rewatering 2 2 measurements and data analysis 2 2 1 biomass and photosynthesis the roots were splintered off from corns by washing biomass was measured by drying fresh samples at 65 c for 72 h the aboveground and total biomasses were calculated by adding the stem and leaf biomasses and the stem leaf and root biomasses respectively water use efficiency was measured by water use throughout the drought and rewatering periods divided by the increase in total biomass total biomass increase was calculated by its difference between the start of the drought period and the end of the rewatering period and the added water throughout the drought and rewatering periods indicated water use pn tr and gs were measured using li 6400 photosynthesis equipment at 11 00 am on sunny days 2 2 2 soil nitrification the pot walls were cut open to take the soil and root out as a whole then the soils were removed from the whole root by patting this patting process was repeated many times until small soil particles were removed from the roots these small soil particles were collected which formed the rhizosphere soil used in this study these peeling soil samples at the beginning of patting were also collected which formed the non rhizosphere soil used in this study soil ammonium nh4 and no3 contents were measured using the indophenol blue colorimetric method and phenol disulphonic acid spectrophotometry as previously described by lu 1999 soil net nitrification rate was measured using the culture method soil samples at the end of the drought period in pd pi pn and pc were cultured at 25 c under the field water capacity of 50 55 for the simulation of drought soil samples at days 5 and 10 after rewatering in all treatments and at the end of drought stress period in pw were cultured at 25 c under the field water capacity of 75 80 to simulate wet condition the differences in soil no3 content between soils before and after cultivation were divided by the 7 days to obtain the net soil nitrification rates 2 2 3 plant hormone the corn was clipped at the stem base then 1 0 g of absorbent cotton was used to cover these wounds to absorb xylem sap for 12 h the xylem sap volume was obtained by using the cotton weight increase being divided by 1 g cm3 by compacting cotton the saps were squeezed out of the cotton and they were collected to measure the zeatin riboside zr and abscisic acid aba concentrations in xylem saps in accordance with the method described by qin and wang 2020 the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure indole 3 acetic acid iaa and gibberellic acid ga3 contents zr and aba contents in the leaves and zr and aba contents in the xylem saps czr and caba respectively the zr and aba amounts in the xylem saps collected per h were used to express zr and aba delivery rates from the roots to the leaves r zr and r aba respectively table 1 lists the abbreviations used in this study values presented in the tables and graphs were mean values and duncan s multiple range test p 0 05 was performed to analyse the difference among these values by using microsoft excel 2007 3 results 3 1 exp 1 aob strain s2 7 25 was isolated and screened in the present study as shown in fig 1 this strain belonged to acinetobacter and had 100 similarity to acinetobacter pittii when s2 7 25 was inoculated to separation and lb media its colony appeared in separation medium after 3 5 days and after 1 3 days in lb medium fig 2a and b this result showed that the growth potential of s2 7 25 was greater in lb medium than in separation medium in the aob separation medium the bacterial colony of s2 7 25 appeared beige opaque round irregular edge and smooth surfaced fig 2a s2 7 25 was 1 25 µm long 0 57 µm wide and showed an oval shape under the microscope fig 2c soil nitrification rates were 3 2 47 8 and 4 2 times higher in si than in st sn and sc respectively and it was 1 3 and 15 0 times higher in st than in sn and sc respectively fig 3 therefore the inoculation of s2 7 25 greatly increased soil nitrification rate but the nitrification inhibitor caused it to drop sharply and greatly restricted the promotional effect of s2 7 25 on it 3 2 exp 2 3 2 1 biomass aboveground and total biomasses were significantly higher in pw than in pd pi pn and pc before rewatering fig 4 which indicated that corn growth was inhibited by drought these biomasses were similar between pd and pw at 10 days post rewatering indicating that rewatering increased corn growth total biomasses were 1 62 and 1 69 times higher in pi than in pw and pd at 10 days post rewatering respectively which showed that the inoculation of s2 7 25 greatly increased the growth of rewatering corn total biomasses at 10 days post rewatering in pd and pw were 1 38 and 1 45 times those in pn respectively and that in pi was 2 1 times that in pc thus the nitrification inhibitor restrained corn growth and the promotional effect of s2 7 25 on corn growth on the basis of total biomasses over compensatory compensatory and under compensatory growth occurred in pi pd and pn and pc respectively the water use efficiency in pi was 2 times greater than that in pd fig 5 and it was 1 45 1 63 and 1 36 times greater in pd than in pw pn and pc respectively therefore rewatering increased water use and it was much more effective in promoting water use when s2 7 25 was inoculated 3 2 2 photosynthetic characteristics before rewatering values of pn tr and sc were significantly higher in pw than in pd pi pn and pc fig 6 which showed that drought restrained the photosynthesis of corn rewatering increased photosynthesis and rewatering with s2 7 25 inoculation had greater effects on it pn sc and tr were significantly higher in pd than in pw and they were higher in pi than in all other treatments during the rewatering period moreover pn tr and sc were significantly lower in pn than in pd and in pc than in pi at 5 and 10 days after rewatering therefore the nitrification inhibitor inhibited corn photosynthesis and the promotional effect of s2 7 25 on photosynthesis 3 2 3 plant hormones before rewatering leaf zr content rzr and czr significantly increased in pw compared with pd pi pn and pc table 2 which indicated that drought decreased leaf cytokinin content and its delivery from roots to leaves considering that zr is a major cytokinin form by contrast these indices increased after rewatering in specific leaf zr content significantly increased at 5 days after rewatering in pd compared with pw and rzr and czr had similar values at 5 and 10 days after rewatering between pd and pw furthermore s2 7 25 increased these indices of rewatering corn leaf zr content rzr and czr significantly increased in pi compared with pr and pw at 5 and 10 days after rewatering the leaf zr content significantly increased in pd and pw compared with pn and the leaf zr content rzr and czr significantly increased in pi compared with pc at 5 and 10 days after rewatering therefore the nitrification inhibitor decreased these indices and it also greatly restrained the promotional effect of s2 7 25 on these indices the aba content of the leaves was significantly higher in pw than in pd pi pn and pc before rewatering but not during rewatering which showed that drought increased leaf aba content but rewatering reversed this effect leaf iaa content significantly increased in pn and pc compared with pw pi and pr at 5 and 10 days after rewatering thus the nitrification inhibitor increased leaf iaa content the rewatering nitrification inhibitor and inoculation of s2 7 25 only slightly affected ga3 content in the leaves 3 2 4 soil nitrification rate soil nh4 and no3 nitrogen as shown in table 3 rhizosphere soil no3 contents were significantly higher in pw than in pd pi pn and pc before rewatering which showed that no3 accumulation decreased under drought in non rhizosphere and rhizosphere environments no significant differences in soil no3 and nh4 contents were observed among pw pd and pi during the rewatering period however soil no3 was significantly lower and soil nh4 content was significantly higher in pn and pc than in pd and pi during this period respectively therefore the nitrification inhibitor could increase nh4 and decrease no3 accumulation in soils and s2 7 25 only slightly affected soil no3 and nh4 contents non rhizosphere and rhizosphere soil nitrification rates significantly increased in pw compared with pd pi pn and pc before rewatering and in pi compared with the other treatments during rewatering thus drought restrained but s2 7 25 promoted soil nitrification the nitrification rates significantly increased in pd compared with pw during the rewatering period in the rhizosphere soil but not in the non rhizosphere soil therefore rewatering increased rhizosphere soil nitrification rates significantly lower soil nitrification rates in the non rhizosphere and rhizosphere environments were observed in pn and pc compared with the other treatments during the rewatering period which showed that the nitrification inhibitor inhibited soil nitrification and the promotional effect of s2 7 25 on the soil nitrification 4 discussion 4 1 effect of s2 7 25 on leaf cytokinin in the present study the average rhizosphere and non rhizosphere soil nitrification rates were nearly two times higher in pi than in pd during rewatering in exp 2 the main reason for this phenomenon was that the inoculation of s2 7 25 increased soil nitrification the soil culture test in exp 1 demonstrated that the inoculation of s2 7 25 increased the soil nitrification rate by more than two times in the soil ecosystem except for autotrophic aob some heterotrophic aob such as acinetobacter pseudomonas ochrobactrum paracoccus and nitrosomonas play an important role in soil nitrification li et al 2020 matsuno et al 2013 taylor et al 2009 kouki et al 2011 reddy et al 2014 our isolated and screened aob strains of s2 7 25 belong to acinetobacter and showed mixed nutritional characteristics indicating that it can increase soil nitrification due to no3 being produced mainly via nitrification more no3 were released from soil in pi compared with pd however the soil no3 concentrations in rhizosphere and non rhizosphere environments were similar between pd and pi during rewatering this finding was mainly because of fast growth after rewatering using a great deal of soil no3 in pi given the presence of the nitrification inhibitor in exp 2 soil no3 contents in the rhizosphere and non rhizosphere environments were lower in pc and pn than in pd and pi respectively borzouei et al 2021 reported that the nitrification inhibitor inhibits the activity of soil microorganisms involved in soil nitrification and decreases soil nitrification rate for the same reason similar soil nitrification rates and no3 contents in the rhizosphere and non rhizosphere environments occurred in pc and pn among the treatments of pi pd and pn the highest soil nitrification rates occurred in pi the next was in pd and the third place was in pn during rewatering as a result the most no3 was released form soil in pi and the second and third places was in pd and pn respectively the contact chances of no3 with the roots were in the order of pi pd and pn and the stimulate intensities of no3 in the roots were in the order of pi pd and pn soil no3 can stimulate roots to synthesise cytokinins in various plants landrein et al 2018 poitout et al 2018 the highest rzr czr and tr in pi during the rewatering period demonstrated the most cytokinins being synthesised and delivered to the leaves resulting in the highest leaf cytokinin content in pi among pi pd and pn cytokinins are mainly synthesised in the roots and can be transmitted to the leaves by means of xylem sap zaicovski et al 2008 wang et al 2016b r zr indicates the delivery speed of cytokinins from roots to leaves in the darkness the cytokinin delivery rate to the leaves in sunlight was the product of t r and c zr as transpiration drives sap to transmit from roots to leaves under this condition similar rzr and czr were recorded between pd and pc but the low tr in pc caused less cytokinin transmission from roots to leaves compared with pd during rewatering as a result leaf cytokinin content was higher in pd than in pc it was likewise that more cytokinin was delivered from roots to increase leaf cytokinin content in pd compared with pw during rewatering 4 2 effect of s2 7 25 on compensatory growth s2 7 25 in pi greatly increased its corn growth during rewatering resulting in 1 69 times higher total biomasses in pi compared with pd at 10 days after rewatering the corn growth after rewatering was mainly involved in the fast photosynthetic organic matter accumulation cytokinins promote photosynthesis kobayashi et al 2012 de moura et al 2017 hence leaf cytokinins caused the high p n in pi compared with pd during rewatering in addition cytokinins play a key role in cell division and its horizontal elongation which benefit photosynthetic organic matter accumulation the nitrification inhibitor restrained the activity of s2 7 25 which caused 1 25 and 2 12 times higher total biomasses in pd and pi than in pn and pc at 10 days after rewatering respectively in the present study compensatory growth occurred in pd the high rhizosphere soil nitrification rate in pd caused more cytokinin being delivered from roots to increase its leaf cytokinin content and p n compared with pw thereby promoting compensatory growth similarly wang et al 2020a 2020b reported that the high rhizosphere soil nitrification rate promotes cytokinin synthesis in roots and compensatory growth in corns of post drought rewatering however non rhizosphere soil nitrification exerted minimal influence on this phenomenon s2 7 25 greatly increased the rhizosphere and non rhizosphere soil nitrification rates of rewatering corns which were more beneficial to root cytokinin synthesis and its delivery to the leaves in pi compared with pd and pw therefore over compensatory growth and the highest water use efficiency occurred in pi accordingly the nitrification inhibitor restrained the activity of s2 7 25 or other soil microbial involved in soil nitrification during rewatering in pc and pn therefore under compensatory growth occurred in these treatments cytokinin producing rhizobacteria of bacillus subtilis could increase the cytokinin contents in the roots and shoots of platycladus orientalis under drought because these bacteria secrete cytokinins that are exogenous hormones applied to the roots the cytokinin increase in the shoots improves its growth and resistance to drought stress liu et al 2013 similar to liu et al 2013 selvakumar et al 2018 found that the cytokinin producing rhizobacteria of citrococcus zhacaiensis and bacillus amyloliquefaciens can promote tomato growth and alleviate deficit irrigation stress effects by secreting cytokinins around its roots different from these studies the present study revealed the leaf cytokinin increase mechanism in plants caused by soil rhizobacteria based on the system of soil roots and leaves that is the soil nitrification the root cytokinin production under no3 stimulation and cytokinin delivery from roots to leaves were integrated into one system to reveal the effects of s2 7 25 on corn compensatory growth and water use efficiency in the future the symbiosis of aob strain and corn roots under drought stress rewatering and wet conditions should be studied to explore the lasting effect of aob strain on cytokinin production and corn growth in this way the corn compensatory growth upon post drought rewatering based on aob strain inoculation will be further revealed 5 conclusion rewatering increased the soil nitrification rates of the rhizosphere in corn of post drought rewatering during the rewatering period inoculation of s2 7 25 greatly increased the soil nitrification rates but the application of a nitrification inhibitor reduced them soil nitrification of the rhizosphere played an important role on cytokinin synthesis in the roots and its delivery to the leaves thereby regulating cytokinin concentration in the leaves the increase in corn leaf cytokinins caused by rewatering increased the photosynthetic rate which boosted the growth of rewatering corn and triggered compensatory growth after post drought rewatering similarly the leaf cytokinin increase of rewatering corn caused by s2 7 25 inoculation greatly promoted photosynthetic rate which resulted in over compensatory growth and high water use efficiency in these corns when s2 7 25 activity was restrained by the nitrification inhibitor the growth of rewatering corn was inhibited and under compensatory growth occurred strain s2 7 25 can increase corn compensatory growth by regulating soil nitrification in the rhizosphere and root induced leaf cytokinins

9913,returning farmland to grasslands rfg to restore soil fertility and prevent land degradation in overused agricultural lands is an important measure however the hydrological processes water consumption and utilization in field systems are undoubtedly changed in shallow groundwater areas owing to rfg experiments in the hetao irrigation district inner mongolia china during 2017 2 yr for alfalfa and 2018 3 yr for alfalfa were conducted to evaluate the difference in soil water distribution percolation groundwater recharge water consumption and water productivity between alfalfa medicago sativa l and maize zea mays l fields the stable oxygen isotope method was used to reveal a strategy to utilize different water sources for alfalfa and maize in an arid shallow groundwater area compared with maize the increase in water consumption by alfalfa increased the soil water consumption of the 0 100 cm soil layer and the groundwater recharge which led to an increase of 9 44 mm and 65 32 mm respectively however the leakage below 100 cm layer decreased by 44 91 compared with those of the maize field the yield and wpc of alfalfa were 29 27 and 6 28 greater than that of maize in 2018 respectively percentages of 75 43 18 73 and 5 84 of irrigation water groundwater and precipitation were taken up by alfalfa during the irrigation period respectively while it was 81 27 12 90 and 5 83 in the maize field respectively after irrigation the crops primarily absorbed water from upper soil layer 0 40 cm comprising 72 93 alfalfa and 69 8 maize however more water from the deeper layers was used by alfalfa before irrigation and the average contribution of 40 100 cm soil layer was 63 0 an increase of 11 2 compared with maize in addition even though maize absorbed water by roots that could reach a soil depth of 80 cm it primarily drew water from the 40 60 cm soil layer keywords water consumption water use efficiency stable oxygen isotope alfalfa maize shallow groundwater area 1 introduction the excessive cultivation of crops is widespread owing to the worldwide increase in global demand for food in recent years in addition to the use of unreasonable planting patterns thus the problems of a reduction in farmland quality and soil salinization have seriously restricted sustainable agricultural development in many countries and regions zhao et al 2004 wang et al 2008 pozo et al 2017 sun and li 2019 zhang et al 2020 the changes in planting patterns e g crop rotation fallow and returning farmland to grassland rfg are usually efficient measures to restore soil fertility and prevent the degradation of soil zhao et al 2004 pozo et al 2017 wu et al 2019 yu et al 2020 zhong et al 2021 recently animal husbandry has experienced unprecedented prosperity worldwide owing to changes in the dietary pattern of consumers with an increase in the consumption of milk meat and other high protein foods burggraf et al 2015 which has caused a substantial increase in the demand for forage thus the rfg has frequently been implemented to improve the quality of soil and develop animal husbandry in many countries and regions e g the united states europe and australia latta et al 2001 ward et al 2002 kobiela et al 2016 huang et al 2018 this measure has been implemented for more than 20 years in china fan et al 2010 and a large amount of poor quality farmland such as saline alkali lands has been converted into forage or grasslands pozo et al 2017 yu et al 2018 alfalfa is not only an important forage crop it can also clearly improve the content of soil nitrogen which results in an increase in productivity and subsequent economic benefits sun and li 2019 zhong et al 2021 however an increase in water consumption became apparent after the implementation of rfg because alfalfa is a perennial forage crop and its high productivity and enormous taproot would lead to high levels of evapotranspiration sanchez et al 2010 huang et al 2018 in addition some studies have reported that shallow groundwater is a significant aqueous source of regional evapotranspiration et and contributes more than 16 of the regional et for irrigation district xue et al 2017 ramos et al 2017 the successive planting of alfalfa would increase the deficits in soil water storage and may even cause a reduction in the amount of shallow groundwater zheng et al 2012 thus evaluating the difference in water consumption and its strategy for utilization between perennial alfalfa and annual crops has an important meaning to popularize the use of rfg in a large area the water consumption of alfalfa each year was 270 1450 mm in different areas and under different agricultural measures sun and li 2019 djaman et al 2020 wang et al 2021 cao et al 2021 although a few studies showed that there was no difference in the total et between alfalfa and maize in a 5 yr continuous cropping system sun and li 2019 most results indicated that the consumption of water by alfalfa was much higher than that of grain crops under the same conditions latta et al 2001 fan et al 2010 huang et al 2018 ge et al 2020 moreover the amount of runoff decreased and the utilization of rainfall and soil water from the deep layer increased substantially in the fields planted with alfalfa compared with those of croplands and uncultivated land based on the use of soil water balance methods for several years fan et al 2010 however the amount of water loss evaporation transpiration and surface runoff of the two crops could not be distinguished quantitatively the soil water consumption of alfalfa in growing season is at least 50 mm or 60 mm higher than those of the grain crops and annual forage crops ward et al 2002 wang et al 2021 and particularly increases the consumption of deep soil water the studies reported that the soil water storage declined at an average rate of 21 4 mm year 1 m 1 within the top 500 cm of soil profile after replacing food crops with alfalfa ge et al 2020 the depletion of soil water following a five year old stand of alfalfa was 200 mm greater than the initial soil water storage fan et al 2010 the maximum depth of soil water depletion of alfalfa extended to 360 cm over time ge et al 2020 while a maximum depth of soil water extraction of maize was only 120 140 cm hao et al 2015 however the soil water consumption of plant was only calculated by the changes in soil water storage and crop root distribution which made it difficult to reveal the details of uptake of water by roots such as its depth and the contribution of uptake of water by the roots heinen 2014 penna et al 2020 therefore it is crucial to reveal the difference in water consumption between perennial alfalfa and annual maize and identify the location and amount of water consumption to optimize an irrigation program in recent years the use of stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen has become an important method to explore the source of water for plants and it has been widely used in studies on the strategies of plant water use picon cochard et al 2001 wang et al 2010 guo et al 2016 wu et al 2016 hardanto et al 2017 penna et al 2020 most studies focus on identifying the depth of root water uptake by plants and its variability during the growth period using the stable isotope method for example maize cotton and wheat primarily absorb the shallow soil water from the 0 20 cm layer during seedling stage asbjornsen et al 2007 wang et al 2010 guo et al 2016 wu et al 2016 and maize cotton and wheat absorb more soil water from the deeper layer during their growth process with the depth of more than 50 cm or even 120 cm can be reached wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 tall vegetation such as most trees e g jujube trees ziziphus jujube huo et al 2018 rubber trees hevea brasiliensis hardanto et al 2017 and walnut trees juglans regia picon cochard et al 2001 can extract water from both shallow and deep soil layers according to the stable isotope method they have a general tendency to absorb soil water from the top and middle soil layers during wet conditions and switch to deeper sources of soil water during dry periods when the water content of shallow soil layers is low picon cochard et al 2001 penna et al 2020 the application of stable isotopes in agricultural systems has primarily been focused on the uptake of water by roots of crops however few studies have utilized stable isotopes to determine the sources of soil water and difference in the strategy of utilization of water sources between perennial alfalfa and annual maize in addition plants with deep roots such as alfalfa can use groundwater by a capillary rise in shallow groundwater areas ramos et al 2017 zheng et al 2012 and the consumption of water by alfalfa would also be increased after mowing huang et al 2018 therefore there is a substantial difference in the pattern of uptake of water by the roots of alfalfa and maize thus it is essential to study the difference in consumption of water and its utilization strategy between alfalfa and maize fields in arid shallow groundwater areas the main objectives of this study were 1 to analyze the difference in soil water distribution percolation groundwater recharge water consumption and water productivity between alfalfa and maize fields using the water balance methods and 2 to determine the uptake of water from different soil layers by alfalfa and maize and the amount of water that they take up from each source using the multi source mass balance method these methods should help to provide a basis for the differentiated water use management of different crops in long term agricultural farming areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiments were conducted during may to september in

content was measured every 3 days using tdr probes fleb 30c weitu inc china with a probe length of 10 cm soil depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm were measured fig 2 each plot had a set of tensiometer and tdr probes installed in the middle of maize and alfalfa plots respectively fig 2 in addition auger boring was used to obtain soil samples to calibrate the tdr readings soil evaporation was measured using an automatic micro lysimeter lys20 beijing time domain china with an inner diameter of 20 cm it was installed in the middle of maize and alfalfa plots the top of micro lysimeter was at the soil surface connected to a load cell that continuously measured the total weight the data were collected automatically every 2 h and the accumulated value was recorded each day fig 2 the soil was generally removed and replaced for the micro lysimeter every 3 5 days and was immediately replaced after precipitation and irrigation the yield of alfalfa was mowed to a 5 cm stubble height at the early flowering stage 10 bloom sun and li 2019 the harvest date was june 28 and september 20 2017 and june 1 july 20 and september 28 2018 three sampling quadrates 1 0 m by 1 0 m were randomly selected in each plot to measure the gross weight of alfalfa all of the samples were oven dried at 105 ºc for 30 min and then kept at 80 ºc until constant weight to measure their dry mass when maize reached physiological maturity 10 plants from each plot were randomly harvested for grain yield the kernels were then threshed by a grain using thresher and the 1000 kernel weight was determined 2 3 2 isotope sampling and determination the soil water and stem water samples were taken 3 5 days before and after each irrigation from june to august to avoid the isotope fractionation caused by transpiration the chosen sampling time was from 12 00 14 00 on a sunny day and the sample position for stem water was located 5 cm above the ground of chlorophyll free maize and alfalfa stems wu et al 2016 the samples were then stored in 10 ml glass bottles all the bottles were sealed with parafilm and subsequently stored at 20 c until the water was extracted using vacuum extraction systems li 2000 lica united technology limited china hardanto et al 2017 and water was extracted from the soils and plant stems by vacuum distillation at 100 c mccole stern 2007 the soil water was sampled at the same time as crop stems an auger was used to obtain soil samples at depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm each sample was a mixture of three different soil cores the soil samples were stored and the water was extracted using the same method precipitation groundwater and irrigation water samples were collected in polyethylene plastic bottles filtered and sealed and stored at 2 c moreover the sample bottles were washed with ultrapure water before sampling the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen for water samples were measured using a liquid water isotope analyzer picarro l2140 i picarro santa clara usa the isotopic composition δ18o or δd was calculated as follows using the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow craig 1961 1 δ 18 ο δ d r s a m p l e r s tan d l a r d 1 1000 where r sample and r standlard are the 18o 16o or d h molar ratios of the sample and standard water and the analytical precision was 0 04 and 0 01 for δd and δ18o respectively 2 3 3 evapotranspiration groundwater recharge or percolation and water productivity the evapotranspiration et was calculated using the following equation allen et al 1998 2 et δ sw p i g d r where p is the precipitation mm i is the irrigation depth mm δsw is the changes in content of soil water in the 0 100 cm soil profile mm g and d are the groundwater recharge and deep percolation at 100 cm layer respectively mm r is the surface runoff mm which was negligible owing to the soil surface of all plots that was flat darcy s law was used to calculate the groundwater recharge or leakage the calculation was as follows 3 d k θ ψ m 2 ψ m 1 z 2 z 1 δ t where d is the amount of water that passes through the boundary of 100 cm underground mm ψ m 1 is the matrix potential of soil water in the 80 cm soil layer cm ψ m 2 is the soil water matrix potential of 120 cm soil layer cm z 1 is the 80 cm soil depth cm z 2 is the 120 cm soil depth cm k θ is the

entire growing season m3 ha 1 2 3 4 multi source mass balance method isosource model the multi source mass balance method phillips et al 2005 was used to identify at which depths the alfalfa and maize absorb water and the amount of water taken up from each source this method calculates the proportionate contribution to water uptake of alfalfa and maize for each soil depth and water source the total feasible percentage combination of each potential source was increased incrementally with a sum of 100 and an isotopic mass balance was performed at each increment to determine if the results compared well with the isotopic composition of stem water the sum of isotopic composition in stem water within a small tolerance is considered to be a feasible combination wu et al 2016 the increment was set at 1 the tolerances of the sum at 0 01 and the uncertainty level at 0 2 the formula for calculation was as follows 5 n 100 i s 1 100 i s 1 where n is the number of feasible combination i is the increment and s is the number of sources 2 4 statistical analysis all the data were analyzed using an analysis of variance anova with spss v 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa the average values were

results 3 1 the difference of soil water content and storage between the alfalfa and maize fields as a whole the soil water content swc for alfalfa field was lower than that of maize field at the soil depth of 40 100 cm and the average decrease during the growing seasaons was 2 51 and 1 42 respectively fig 4 the difference in swc between alfalfa fields and maize fields at the 0 40 cm soil layer decreased with the growth of maize with an average decrease of 2 55 2 01 and 1 74 from may to july for the alfalfa field compared with those of maize field respectively additionally there were different results for the swc of maize fields in 0 40 cm soil layer in august compared with those of other months owing to the continuous increase in temperature and the leaf area index of maize the soil water consumption of maize field in the 0 40 cm layer was 11 08 and 7 0 higher than that of the alfalfa field in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 1 the maximal difference for swc in 40 100 cm soil layer of alfalfa in september during 2017 and 2018 increased by an average of 2 66 for the alfalfa field compared with that of the maize field in 2017 however this value was 1 87 lower in 2018 there were similar results for the soil water storage sws during the growing seasons table 1 generally the variation coefficient cv of sws in the maize and alfalfa fields decreased with soil depth in the 0 100 cm soil layer the cv of sws in the alfalfa field was 0 74 which was an increase of 48 09 compared with that of the maize field soil water was consumed more by alfalfa than by maize in may since it was the seedling stage for maize thus the maximal difference for cv of sws appeared there were similar results in sebtember 3 2 comparison of soil water balance components and water productivity between the alfalfa and maize fields generally there was higher water consumption more groundwater recharge and little leakage below the 100 cm soil layer in alfalfa fields compared with those of maize table 2 the water consumption in alfalfa fields increased by 119 87 mm year 1 on average compared with that of maize fields among them the change in soil water storage of 0 100 cm layer and groundwater recharge in the alfalfa field increased significantly by 9 44 mm and 65 32 mm year 1on average compared with that of maize field respectively moreover the soil water consumption and groundwater recharge of alfalfa and maize increased gradually over time however the percolation in alfalfa field decreased by 44 91 a year on average 45 12 mm year 1 compared with that of maize field the amount of irrigation water used by crops during the process of water consumption was the largest and the ratio of irrigation water to water consumption for alfalfa and maize were 0 76 and 0 91 on average during the rapid growth of crops from june to august respectively the soil evaporation and transpiration in alfalfa field averaged 3 40 and 34 92 higher than those of maize field in both years owing to a higher leaf area index with the maximal transpiration of alfalfa and maize occurring in july and august respectively additionally the effective water consumption ratio ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration for alfalfa was 0 71 and 0 73 in 2017 and 2018 respectively and averaged 12 11 higher than that of maize this difference also indicated that alfalfa had a higher effective water consumption ratio during its period of growth the yields of alfalfa and maize showed the same trend with increasing water consumption by the crop over the two years period table 2 the yield of alfalfa was the highest in 2018 3 year old alfalfa which was 37 86 higher than that in 2017 2 year old alfalfa the yield and its wpc of alfalfa were significantly higher than those of maize in 2018 increasing by 29 27 and 6 28 respectively while decreasing by 1 97 and 23 60 for the yield and wpc in 2017 table 2 these measurements indicated that the wpc was a higher with the growth of perennial forage 3 3 soil water uptake in the alfalfa and maize fields before and after irrigation alfalfa and maize water uptake from different soil layers varied significantly the δ18o in soil water shallow soil layer 0 40 cm was generally higher than that in the deep soil layer 40 100 cm but the δ18o of upper soil water varied significantly after irrigation compared with that before irrigation fig 5c d the main soil layer of root water uptake for alfalfa was 40 60 cm in june before irrigation comprising 25 90 from calculations based on the isosource model fig 5a alfalfa absorbed more water from deeper layers with its growth for example the absorption of water from the 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm soil depths in july and august comprised 27 10 and 23 40 respectively table 3 however the main soil layer of root water uptake for maize was the 40 60 cm soil layer in june and july comprising 29 65 on average and it was 80 cm in august comprising 24 40 fig 5b after irrigation the roots took up water from higher levels of the shallow layer fig 5c d averaging 72 93 alfalfa and 69 8 maize in the 0 40 cm soil layer table 3 the contributions of 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm soil layers for alfalfa and maize were significant compared with that of the other soil layers p 0 05 however the increase in root water uptake that appeared from the deep layer was owing to an increase in the biomass of roots that grew in august following irrigation and the contributions of soil water in the 40 100 cm layer were 40 2 and 42 3 for alfalfa and maize respectively table 3 3 4 water use strategies for different water sources in the alfalfa and maize fields the uptake of water by alfalfa and maize from different soil layers varied significantly the δ18o values in soil water in 20 30 cm and 80 cm layers of the alfalfa field were close to those of groundwater before irrigation while the δ18o values in soil water in 20 30 cm and 60 cm layers of the maize field were similar to those of groundwater fig 6a c this indicated that the soil water in 20 30 cm 60 cm and 80 cm soil layers primarily originated from groundwater in the alfalfa and maize fields the δ18o values in irrigation water and groundwater were similar each month after irrigation fig 6d f thus some irrigation water percolated to the groundwater the δ18o values in soil water at the 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm layers was close to those of irrigation water which indicated that irrigation water was primarily stored in these layers the main source of water for transpiration originated from irrigation groundwater and precipitation by the medium of soil water the largest sources of soil water from recharge of irrigation water recharge contribution of irrigation water groundwater and precipitation in the alfalfa field were 75 43 18 73 and 5 84 on average during the irrigation period respectively while these values were 81 27 12 90 and 5 83 for the maize field respectively fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 difference in water consumption between the perennial forage and annual crops the water consumption for perennial forage was clearly higher than that of the annual crop the soil water consumption for alfalfa field increased by at least about 50 mm compared with that of grain crops in the growing season wang et al 2021 and increased by 9 44 mm for the alfalfa field compared with that of maize field duing 2017 and 2018 the main reasons were that the perennial forage with more fine roots in deep soil li et al 2018 can use more deep soil water huang et al 2018 and groundwater song et al 2017 in contrast the main root of annual crop is concentrated in the shallow soil layer bai and li 2003 such as the 0 40 cm soil layer for maize gao et al 2014 wu et al 2016 moreover maize primarily absorbed water in the upper layer of 0 50 cm at the jointing and flowering stages and more than 70 of water was absorbed by the roots wang et al 2010 which may be the reason why the swc of maize in 0 40 cm soil layer is higher than that of alfalfa in august fig 4 thus the difference was more apparent in the shallow groundwater area for example the average groundwater recharge for alfalfa field increased by 65 32 mm compared with that of the maize field in the study table 2 alfalfa is a drought tolerant and densely planted crop with a high leaf area index sanchez et al 2010 the et partitioning of plant was closely linked to leaf area index qiu et al 2019 leading to the alfalfa had a higher effective water consumption ratio table 2 additionally a previous study revealed that a higher proportion of deep water uptake is associated with a higher percentage of foliage cover in the dry season schwendenmann et al 2010 in this study the swc in deep soil layer 40 60 cm for the alfalfa field was lower than that of maize field owing to the increased consumption of soil water by alfalfa fig 4 returning farmland to grassland rfg as a soil protection measure and planting grass or forage in areas with poor environmental conditions helped to increase the storage of soil carbon yu et al 2018 zhong et al 2021 in particular perennial leguminous plants store more soil carbon storage than annual crops or grasses agegnehu and amede 2017 which provides a carbon source for microorganisms guo et al 2018 the organic matter secreted by microorganisms becomes intertwined with the mineral particles of soil by adsorption to form new large particles zhong et al 2021 this increases the polymerism of soil clay particles reducing their expansion and dispersion caused by soil salt accumulation and improving the hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention capability lado ben hur 2010 perennial alfalfa has been shown to extract water from deeper in the soil than annual pastures and grain crops ward et al 2002 huang et al 2018 this results in a greater depth of dry soil that acts as a storage zone for subsequent irrigation and rainfall thus reducing the amount of water that leaks beyond the root zone and into the groundwater ward et al 2002 in this study the leakage of irrigation water decreased and the contribution of irrigation water was increased by planting alfalfa to replace maize with an average leakage that decreased by 44 91 table 2 4 2 difference of water use strategy between perennial forage and annual crops the primary source of water for plant transpiration is soil water penna et al 2020 but in the shallow groundwater area the capillary rise of groundwater was an important component of the soil water balance ramos et al 2017 therefore the contribution of shallow groundwater to the soil water in root zone cannot be ignored previous studies have used the stable isotopes method to identify and quantify other water sources such as groundwater and water from irrigation zhang et al 1999 mccole stern 2007 bargués et al 2017 however trees such as juniperus ashei mccole stern 2007 and vitellaria paradoxa bargués et al 2017 only use groundwater during dry periods riparian plants such as populus euphratica and tamarix chinensis obtained more than 93 and 90 of the water from groundwater in the lower reaches of the heihe basin wu et al 2016 in our study the stronger use of groundwater by alfalfa was owing to the plasticity in root water uptake depths table 3 the contribution of groundwater was 18 73 in the alfalfa field which was an increase of 5 83 compared with that of the maize field fig 7 moreover water contained in deeper soil layers can be absorbed and redistributed to shallower soil by deep roots for plant transpiration during dry periods hao et al 2010 penna et al 2020 in this study groundwater replenished water to the 30 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm layers through a capillary rise in the maize and alfalfa fields before irrigation respectively fig 6 the plant can absorb and redistribute water to shallower soil though its root system irrigation can have a substantial effect on the use of water by plants resulting in crops that use different proportions of water from various soil depths goebel et al 2015 wu et al 2016 for example maize primarily absorbed water from the surface soil during wet periods and deeper soil during dry conditions wu et al 2016 in this study the main soil layer of root water uptake increased after irrigation averaging 72 93 for alfalfa and 69 8 for maize in the 0 40 cm soil layer table 3 while the crops absorbed water from deeper layers when the water content was low which was similar to the findings of previous research wu et al 2016 the largest sources of soil water by irrigation water recharge averarged 75 43 and 81 27 for alfalfa and maize respectively which was similar to the results obtained using water balance method fig 7 in addition a function of seasonality or different meteorological forcing were also important reasons for the changes between the different soil water sources penna et al 2020 more water from deeper layers was absorbed as the plants grew the maize roots could penetrate soil as deeply as 80 cm and alfalfa could even utilize water from the 100 soil layer table 3 the root biomass of alfalfa decreases owing to frequent harvests luo et al 1995 this is particularly true for fine roots which leads to a contribution of the 40 100 cm soil layer that was lower than that of maize in august table 3 4 3 water productivity between perennial forage and annual crops the new stems grow slowly in the early stage of alfalfa and the yield of straw is low however the new stems and yield quickly increase as the years of growth increase huang et al 2018 the alfalfa yield and water use efficiency reach their maximum when the growth period is between six and nine years and then gradually decrease wang et al 2021 however huang et al 2018 reported that the aboveground biomass of alfalfa reached a peak value in grasslands that had been cultivated for three and four years and then gradually decreased in this study the yield of alfalfa was the highest in 2018 3 year old alfalfa table 2 these results were similar with the findings of previous studies the yield of alfalfa increased with increasing stand age huang et al 2018 wang et al 2021 however an increase in the yields of alfalfa increases the amount of alfalfa evapotranspiration it has been shown that soil evaporation and transpiration for alfalfa fields are higher than those of maize ren and huang 2016 this caused the yield and water productivity of alfalfa to be higher than those of maize but the difference in wpc decreased as the alfalfa grew table 2 5 conclusions the water consumption of alfalfa was significantly higher than that of maize over both years of the experiment the increase in water consumption by alfalfa increased the soil water consumption and groundwater recharge and the contribution of groundwater to the alfalfa field was 18 73 on average during the irrigation period an increase of 5 83 compared with maize percentages of 75 43 and 81 27 of irrigation water were taken up by alfalfa and maize respectively the alfalfa used more water from deeper layers the average contributions of 40 100 cm soil layer increase of 11 2 compared with maize before irrigation the uptake of water by roots switched from deep layers to shallow layers after irrigation and comprised 72 93 and 69 8 of alfalfa and maize from soil water at a depth of 0 40 cm respectively in conclusion this indicates that alfalfa absorbs soil water more effectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

9913,returning farmland to grasslands rfg to restore soil fertility and prevent land degradation in overused agricultural lands is an important measure however the hydrological processes water consumption and utilization in field systems are undoubtedly changed in shallow groundwater areas owing to rfg experiments in the hetao irrigation district inner mongolia china during 2017 2 yr for alfalfa and 2018 3 yr for alfalfa were conducted to evaluate the difference in soil water distribution percolation groundwater recharge water consumption and water productivity between alfalfa medicago sativa l and maize zea mays l fields the stable oxygen isotope method was used to reveal a strategy to utilize different water sources for alfalfa and maize in an arid shallow groundwater area compared with maize the increase in water consumption by alfalfa increased the soil water consumption of the 0 100 cm soil layer and the groundwater recharge which led to an increase of 9 44 mm and 65 32 mm respectively however the leakage below 100 cm layer decreased by 44 91 compared with those of the maize field the yield and wpc of alfalfa were 29 27 and 6 28 greater than that of maize in 2018 respectively percentages of 75 43 18 73 and 5 84 of irrigation water groundwater and precipitation were taken up by alfalfa during the irrigation period respectively while it was 81 27 12 90 and 5 83 in the maize field respectively after irrigation the crops primarily absorbed water from upper soil layer 0 40 cm comprising 72 93 alfalfa and 69 8 maize however more water from the deeper layers was used by alfalfa before irrigation and the average contribution of 40 100 cm soil layer was 63 0 an increase of 11 2 compared with maize in addition even though maize absorbed water by roots that could reach a soil depth of 80 cm it primarily drew water from the 40 60 cm soil layer keywords water consumption water use efficiency stable oxygen isotope alfalfa maize shallow groundwater area 1 introduction the excessive cultivation of crops is widespread owing to the worldwide increase in global demand for food in recent years in addition to the use of unreasonable planting patterns thus the problems of a reduction in farmland quality and soil salinization have seriously restricted sustainable agricultural development in many countries and regions zhao et al 2004 wang et al 2008 pozo et al 2017 sun and li 2019 zhang et al 2020 the changes in planting patterns e g crop rotation fallow and returning farmland to grassland rfg are usually efficient measures to restore soil fertility and prevent the degradation of soil zhao et al 2004 pozo et al 2017 wu et al 2019 yu et al 2020 zhong et al 2021 recently animal husbandry has experienced unprecedented prosperity worldwide owing to changes in the dietary pattern of consumers with an increase in the consumption of milk meat and other high protein foods burggraf et al 2015 which has caused a substantial increase in the demand for forage thus the rfg has frequently been implemented to improve the quality of soil and develop animal husbandry in many countries and regions e g the united states europe and australia latta et al 2001 ward et al 2002 kobiela et al 2016 huang et al 2018 this measure has been implemented for more than 20 years in china fan et al 2010 and a large amount of poor quality farmland such as saline alkali lands has been converted into forage or grasslands pozo et al 2017 yu et al 2018 alfalfa is not only an important forage crop it can also clearly improve the content of soil nitrogen which results in an increase in productivity and subsequent economic benefits sun and li 2019 zhong et al 2021 however an increase in water consumption became apparent after the implementation of rfg because alfalfa is a perennial forage crop and its high productivity and enormous taproot would lead to high levels of evapotranspiration sanchez et al 2010 huang et al 2018 in addition some studies have reported that shallow groundwater is a significant aqueous source of regional evapotranspiration et and contributes more than 16 of the regional et for irrigation district xue et al 2017 ramos et al 2017 the successive planting of alfalfa would increase the deficits in soil water storage and may even cause a reduction in the amount of shallow groundwater zheng et al 2012 thus evaluating the difference in water consumption and its strategy for utilization between perennial alfalfa and annual crops has an important meaning to popularize the use of rfg in a large area the water consumption of alfalfa each year was 270 1450 mm in different areas and under different agricultural measures sun and li 2019 djaman et al 2020 wang et al 2021 cao et al 2021 although a few studies showed that there was no difference in the total et between alfalfa and maize in a 5 yr continuous cropping system sun and li 2019 most results indicated that the consumption of water by alfalfa was much higher than that of grain crops under the same conditions latta et al 2001 fan et al 2010 huang et al 2018 ge et al 2020 moreover the amount of runoff decreased and the utilization of rainfall and soil water from the deep layer increased substantially in the fields planted with alfalfa compared with those of croplands and uncultivated land based on the use of soil water balance methods for several years fan et al 2010 however the amount of water loss evaporation transpiration and surface runoff of the two crops could not be distinguished quantitatively the soil water consumption of alfalfa in growing season is at least 50 mm or 60 mm higher than those of the grain crops and annual forage crops ward et al 2002 wang et al 2021 and particularly increases the consumption of deep soil water the studies reported that the soil water storage declined at an average rate of 21 4 mm year 1 m 1 within the top 500 cm of soil profile after replacing food crops with alfalfa ge et al 2020 the depletion of soil water following a five year old stand of alfalfa was 200 mm greater than the initial soil water storage fan et al 2010 the maximum depth of soil water depletion of alfalfa extended to 360 cm over time ge et al 2020 while a maximum depth of soil water extraction of maize was only 120 140 cm hao et al 2015 however the soil water consumption of plant was only calculated by the changes in soil water storage and crop root distribution which made it difficult to reveal the details of uptake of water by roots such as its depth and the contribution of uptake of water by the roots heinen 2014 penna et al 2020 therefore it is crucial to reveal the difference in water consumption between perennial alfalfa and annual maize and identify the location and amount of water consumption to optimize an irrigation program in recent years the use of stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen has become an important method to explore the source of water for plants and it has been widely used in studies on the strategies of plant water use picon cochard et al 2001 wang et al 2010 guo et al 2016 wu et al 2016 hardanto et al 2017 penna et al 2020 most studies focus on identifying the depth of root water uptake by plants and its variability during the growth period using the stable isotope method for example maize cotton and wheat primarily absorb the shallow soil water from the 0 20 cm layer during seedling stage asbjornsen et al 2007 wang et al 2010 guo et al 2016 wu et al 2016 and maize cotton and wheat absorb more soil water from the deeper layer during their growth process with the depth of more than 50 cm or even 120 cm can be reached wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 tall vegetation such as most trees e g jujube trees ziziphus jujube huo et al 2018 rubber trees hevea brasiliensis hardanto et al 2017 and walnut trees juglans regia picon cochard et al 2001 can extract water from both shallow and deep soil layers according to the stable isotope method they have a general tendency to absorb soil water from the top and middle soil layers during wet conditions and switch to deeper sources of soil water during dry periods when the water content of shallow soil layers is low picon cochard et al 2001 penna et al 2020 the application of stable isotopes in agricultural systems has primarily been focused on the uptake of water by roots of crops however few studies have utilized stable isotopes to determine the sources of soil water and difference in the strategy of utilization of water sources between perennial alfalfa and annual maize in addition plants with deep roots such as alfalfa can use groundwater by a capillary rise in shallow groundwater areas ramos et al 2017 zheng et al 2012 and the consumption of water by alfalfa would also be increased after mowing huang et al 2018 therefore there is a substantial difference in the pattern of uptake of water by the roots of alfalfa and maize thus it is essential to study the difference in consumption of water and its utilization strategy between alfalfa and maize fields in arid shallow groundwater areas the main objectives of this study were 1 to analyze the difference in soil water distribution percolation groundwater recharge water consumption and water productivity between alfalfa and maize fields using the water balance methods and 2 to determine the uptake of water from different soil layers by alfalfa and maize and the amount of water that they take up from each source using the multi source mass balance method these methods should help to provide a basis for the differentiated water use management of different crops in long term agricultural farming areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiments were conducted during may to september in 2017 and 2018 at shengmu high tech economic park 107 02 19 e 40 24 32 n located in dengkou county inner mongolia province china fig 1 the site is in a typical temperate continental monsoon climate

similar soil salinity soil physical and chemical properties for each treatment the experimental design was a completely random design composed of three replicates of two treatments i e six plots two treatments including alfalfa medicago sativa l fields and maize zea mays l fields fig 2 each field plot was 10 m long and 6 0 m wide a one meter deep plastic sheet was buried to prevent side leakage from the surrounding farmlands with a surrounding width of 2 m to avoid external influences the alfalfa cultivar used was algonquin and it was seeded 2 cm deep on may 5 2016 in rows that were spaced

monteith formula allen et al 1998 fig 3 the groundwater level was measured using an automatic water level gauge hobo u20 onset computer during the experimental period fig 3 the soil water potential at 80 and 120 cm soil layers was measured every 3 days using tensiometers zknt 100 zhonghui china and additional measurements were taken before and after irrigation and precipitation the soil water content was measured every 3 days using tdr probes fleb 30c weitu inc china with a probe length of 10 cm soil depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm were measured fig 2 each plot had a set of tensiometer and tdr probes installed in the middle of maize and alfalfa plots respectively fig 2 in addition auger boring was used to obtain soil samples to calibrate the tdr readings soil evaporation was measured using an automatic micro lysimeter lys20 beijing time domain china with an inner diameter of 20 cm it was installed in the middle of maize and alfalfa plots the top of micro lysimeter was at the soil surface connected to a load cell that continuously measured the total weight the data were collected automatically every 2 h and the accumulated value was recorded each day fig 2 the soil was generally removed and replaced for the micro lysimeter every 3 5 days and was immediately replaced after precipitation and irrigation the yield of alfalfa was mowed to a 5 cm stubble height at the early flowering stage 10 bloom sun and li 2019 the harvest date was june 28 and september 20 2017 and june 1 july 20 and september 28 2018 three sampling quadrates 1 0 m by 1 0 m were randomly selected in each plot to measure the gross weight of alfalfa all of the samples were oven dried at 105 ºc for 30 min and then kept at 80 ºc until constant weight to measure their dry mass when maize reached physiological maturity 10 plants from each plot were randomly harvested for grain yield the kernels were then threshed by a grain using thresher and the 1000 kernel weight was determined 2 3 2 isotope sampling and determination the soil water and stem water samples were taken 3 5 days before and after each irrigation from june to august to avoid the isotope fractionation caused by transpiration the chosen sampling time was from 12 00 14 00 on a sunny day and the sample position for stem water was located 5 cm above the ground of chlorophyll free maize and alfalfa stems wu et al 2016 the samples were then stored in 10 ml glass bottles all the bottles were sealed with parafilm and subsequently stored at 20 c until the water was extracted using vacuum extraction systems li 2000 lica united technology limited china hardanto et al 2017 and water was extracted from the soils and plant stems by vacuum distillation at 100 c mccole stern 2007 the soil water was sampled at the same time as crop stems an auger was used to obtain soil samples at depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm each sample was a mixture of three different soil cores the soil samples were stored and the water was extracted using the same method precipitation groundwater and irrigation water samples were collected in polyethylene plastic bottles filtered and sealed and stored at 2 c moreover the sample bottles were washed with ultrapure water before sampling the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen for water samples were measured using a liquid water isotope analyzer picarro l2140 i picarro santa clara usa the isotopic composition δ18o or δd was calculated as follows using the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow craig 1961 1 δ 18 ο δ d r s a m p l e r s tan d l a r d 1 1000 where r sample and r standlard are the 18o 16o or d h molar ratios of the sample and standard water and the analytical precision was 0 04 and 0 01 for δd and δ18o respectively 2 3 3 evapotranspiration groundwater recharge or percolation and water productivity the evapotranspiration et was calculated using the following equation allen et al 1998 2 et δ sw p i g d r where p is the precipitation mm i is the irrigation depth mm δsw is the changes in content of soil water in the 0 100 cm soil profile mm g and d are the groundwater recharge and deep percolation at 100 cm layer respectively mm r is the surface runoff mm which was negligible owing to the soil surface of all plots that was flat darcy s law was used to calculate the groundwater recharge or leakage the calculation was as follows 3 d k θ ψ m 2 ψ m 1 z 2 z 1 δ t where d is the amount of water that passes through the boundary of 100 cm underground mm ψ m 1 is the

entire growing season m3 ha 1 2 3 4 multi source mass balance method isosource model the multi source mass balance method phillips et al 2005 was used to identify at which depths the alfalfa and maize absorb water and the amount of water taken up from each source this method calculates the proportionate contribution to water uptake of alfalfa and maize for each soil depth and water source the total feasible percentage combination of each potential source was increased incrementally with a sum of 100 and an isotopic mass balance was performed at each increment to determine if the results compared well with the isotopic composition of stem water the sum of isotopic composition in stem water within a small tolerance is considered to be a feasible combination wu et al 2016 the increment was set at 1 the tolerances of the sum at 0 01 and the uncertainty level at 0 2 the formula for calculation was as follows 5 n 100 i s 1 100 i s 1 where n is the number of feasible combination i is the

results 3 1 the difference of soil water content and storage between the alfalfa and maize fields as a whole the soil water content swc for alfalfa field was lower than that of maize field at the soil depth of 40 100 cm and the average decrease during the growing seasaons was 2 51 and 1 42 respectively fig 4 the difference in swc between alfalfa fields and maize fields at the 0 40 cm soil layer decreased with the growth of maize with an average decrease of 2 55 2 01 and 1 74 from may to july for the alfalfa field compared with those of maize field respectively additionally there were different results for the swc of maize fields in 0 40 cm soil layer in august compared with those of other months owing to the continuous increase in temperature and the leaf area index of maize the soil water consumption of maize field in the 0 40 cm layer was 11 08 and 7 0 higher than that of the alfalfa field in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 1 the maximal difference for swc in 40 100 cm soil layer of alfalfa in september during 2017 and 2018 increased by an average of 2 66 for the alfalfa field compared with that of the maize field in 2017 however this value was 1 87 lower in 2018 there were similar results for the soil water storage sws during the growing seasons table 1 generally the variation coefficient cv of sws in the maize and alfalfa fields decreased with soil depth in the 0 100 cm soil layer the cv of sws in the alfalfa field was 0 74 which was an increase of 48 09 compared with that of the maize field soil water was consumed more by alfalfa than by maize in may since it was the seedling stage for maize thus the maximal difference for cv of sws appeared there were similar results in sebtember 3 2 comparison of soil water balance components and water productivity between the alfalfa and maize fields generally there was higher water consumption more groundwater recharge and little leakage below the 100 cm soil layer in alfalfa fields compared with those of maize table 2 the water consumption in alfalfa fields increased by 119 87 mm year 1 on average compared with that of maize fields among them the change in soil water storage of 0 100 cm layer and groundwater recharge in the alfalfa field increased significantly by 9 44 mm and 65 32 mm year 1on average compared with that of maize field respectively moreover the soil water consumption and groundwater recharge of alfalfa and maize increased gradually over time however the percolation in alfalfa field decreased by 44 91 a year on average 45 12 mm year 1 compared with that of maize field the amount of irrigation water used by crops during the process of water consumption was the largest and the ratio of irrigation water to water consumption for alfalfa and maize were 0 76 and 0 91 on average during the rapid growth of crops from june to august respectively the soil evaporation and transpiration in alfalfa field averaged 3 40 and 34 92 higher than those of maize field in both years owing to a higher leaf area index with the maximal transpiration of alfalfa and maize occurring in july and august respectively additionally the effective water consumption ratio ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration for alfalfa was 0 71 and 0 73 in 2017 and 2018 respectively and averaged 12 11 higher than that of maize this difference also indicated that alfalfa had a higher effective water consumption ratio during its period of growth the yields of alfalfa and maize showed the same trend with increasing water consumption by the crop over the two years period table 2 the yield of alfalfa was the highest in 2018 3 year old alfalfa which was 37 86 higher than that in 2017 2 year old alfalfa the yield and its wpc of alfalfa were significantly higher than those of maize in 2018 increasing by 29 27 and 6 28 respectively while decreasing by 1 97 and 23 60 for the yield and wpc in 2017 table 2 these measurements indicated that the wpc was a higher with the growth of perennial forage 3 3 soil water uptake in the alfalfa and maize fields before and after irrigation alfalfa and maize water uptake from different soil layers varied significantly the δ18o in soil water shallow soil layer 0 40 cm was generally higher than that in the deep soil layer 40 100 cm but the δ18o of upper soil water varied significantly after irrigation compared with that before irrigation fig 5c d the main soil layer of root water uptake for alfalfa was 40 60 cm in june before irrigation comprising 25 90 from calculations based on the isosource model fig 5a alfalfa absorbed more water from deeper layers with its growth for example the absorption of water from the 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm soil depths in july and august comprised 27 10 and 23 40 respectively table 3 however the main soil layer of root water uptake for maize was the 40 60 cm soil layer in june and july comprising 29 65 on average and it was 80 cm in august comprising 24 40 fig 5b after irrigation the roots took up water from higher levels of the shallow layer fig 5c d averaging 72 93 alfalfa and 69 8 maize in the 0 40 cm soil layer table 3 the contributions of 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm soil layers for alfalfa and maize were significant compared with that of the other soil layers p 0 05 however the increase in root water uptake that appeared from the deep layer was owing to an increase in the biomass of roots that grew in august following irrigation and the contributions of soil water in the 40 100 cm layer were 40 2 and 42 3 for alfalfa and maize respectively table 3 3 4 water use strategies for different water sources in the alfalfa and maize fields the uptake of water by alfalfa and maize from different soil layers varied significantly the δ18o values in soil water in 20 30 cm and 80 cm layers of the alfalfa field were close to those of groundwater before irrigation while the δ18o values in soil water in 20 30 cm and 60 cm layers of the maize field were similar to those of groundwater fig 6a c this indicated that the soil water in 20 30 cm 60 cm and 80 cm soil layers primarily originated from groundwater in the alfalfa and maize fields the δ18o values in irrigation water and groundwater were similar each month after irrigation fig 6d f thus some irrigation water percolated to the groundwater the δ18o values in soil water at the 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm layers was close to those of irrigation water which indicated that irrigation water was primarily stored in these layers the main source of water for transpiration originated from irrigation groundwater and precipitation by the medium of soil water the largest sources of soil water from recharge of irrigation water recharge contribution of irrigation water groundwater and precipitation in the alfalfa field were 75 43 18 73 and 5 84 on average during the irrigation period respectively while these values were 81 27 12 90 and 5 83 for the maize field respectively fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 difference in water consumption between the perennial forage and annual crops the water consumption for perennial forage was clearly higher than that of the annual crop the soil water consumption for alfalfa field increased by at least about 50 mm compared with that of grain crops in the growing season wang et al 2021 and increased by 9 44 mm for the alfalfa field compared with that of maize field duing 2017 and 2018 the main reasons were that the perennial forage with more fine roots in deep soil li et al 2018 can use more deep soil water huang et al 2018 and groundwater song et al 2017 in contrast the main root of annual crop is concentrated in the shallow soil layer bai and li 2003 such as the 0 40 cm soil layer for maize gao et al 2014 wu et al 2016 moreover maize primarily absorbed water in the upper layer of 0 50 cm at the jointing and flowering stages and more than 70 of water was absorbed by the roots wang et al 2010 which may be the reason why the swc of maize in 0 40 cm soil layer is higher than that of alfalfa in august fig 4 thus the difference was more apparent in the shallow groundwater area for example the average groundwater recharge for alfalfa field increased by 65 32 mm compared with that of the maize field in the study table 2 alfalfa is a drought tolerant and densely planted crop with a high leaf area index sanchez et al 2010 the et partitioning of plant was closely linked to leaf area index qiu et al 2019 leading to the alfalfa had a higher effective water consumption ratio table 2 additionally a previous study revealed that a higher proportion of deep water uptake is associated with a higher percentage of foliage cover in the dry season schwendenmann et al 2010 in this study the swc in deep soil layer 40 60 cm for the alfalfa field was lower than that of maize field owing to the increased consumption of soil water by alfalfa fig 4 returning farmland to grassland rfg as a soil protection measure and planting grass or forage in areas with poor environmental conditions helped to increase the storage of soil carbon yu et al 2018 zhong et al 2021 in particular perennial leguminous plants store more soil carbon storage than annual crops or grasses agegnehu and amede 2017 which provides a carbon source for microorganisms guo et al 2018 the organic matter secreted by microorganisms becomes intertwined with the mineral particles of soil by adsorption to form new large particles zhong et al 2021 this increases the polymerism of soil clay particles reducing their expansion and dispersion caused by soil salt accumulation and improving the hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention capability lado ben hur 2010 perennial alfalfa has been shown to extract water from deeper in the soil than annual pastures and grain crops ward et al 2002 huang et al 2018 this results in a greater depth of dry soil that acts as a storage zone for subsequent irrigation and rainfall thus reducing the amount of water that leaks beyond the root zone and into the groundwater ward et al 2002 in this study the leakage of irrigation water decreased and the contribution of irrigation water was increased by planting alfalfa to replace maize with an average leakage that decreased by 44 91 table 2 4 2 difference of water use strategy between perennial forage and annual crops the primary source of water for plant transpiration is soil water penna et al 2020 but in the shallow groundwater area the capillary rise of groundwater was an important component of the soil water balance ramos et al 2017 therefore the contribution of shallow groundwater to the soil water in root zone cannot be ignored previous studies have used the stable isotopes method to identify and quantify other water sources such as groundwater and water from irrigation zhang et al 1999 mccole stern 2007 bargués et al 2017 however trees such as juniperus ashei mccole stern 2007 and vitellaria paradoxa bargués et al 2017 only use groundwater during dry periods riparian plants such as populus euphratica and tamarix chinensis obtained more than 93 and 90 of the water from groundwater in the lower reaches of the heihe basin wu et al 2016 in our study the stronger use of groundwater by alfalfa was owing to the plasticity in root water uptake depths table 3 the contribution of groundwater was 18 73 in the alfalfa field which was an increase of 5 83 compared with that of the maize field fig 7 moreover water contained in deeper soil layers can be absorbed and redistributed to shallower soil by deep roots for plant transpiration during dry periods hao et al 2010 penna et al 2020 in this study groundwater replenished water to the 30 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm layers through a capillary rise in the maize and alfalfa fields before irrigation respectively fig 6 the plant can absorb and redistribute water to shallower soil though its root system irrigation can have a substantial effect on the use of water by plants resulting in crops that use different proportions of water from various soil depths goebel et al 2015 wu et al 2016 for example maize primarily absorbed water from the surface soil during wet periods and deeper soil during dry conditions wu et al 2016 in this study the main soil layer of root water uptake increased after irrigation averaging 72 93 for alfalfa and 69 8 for maize in the 0 40 cm soil layer table 3 while the crops absorbed water from deeper layers when the water content was low which was similar to the findings of previous research wu et al 2016 the largest sources of soil water by irrigation water recharge averarged 75 43 and 81 27 for alfalfa and maize respectively which was similar to the results obtained using water balance method fig 7 in addition a function of seasonality or different meteorological forcing were also important reasons for the changes between the different soil water sources penna et al 2020 more water from deeper layers was absorbed as the plants grew the maize roots could penetrate soil as deeply as 80 cm and alfalfa could even utilize water from the 100 soil layer table 3 the root biomass of alfalfa decreases owing to frequent harvests luo et al 1995 this is particularly true for fine roots which leads to a contribution of the 40 100 cm soil layer that was lower than that of maize in august table 3 4 3 water productivity between perennial forage and annual crops the new stems grow slowly in the early stage of alfalfa and the yield of straw is low however the new stems and yield quickly increase as the years of growth increase huang et al 2018 the alfalfa yield and water use efficiency reach their maximum when the growth period is between six and nine years and then gradually decrease wang et al 2021 however huang et al 2018 reported that the aboveground biomass of alfalfa reached a peak value in grasslands that had been cultivated for three and four years and then gradually decreased in this study the yield of alfalfa was the highest in 2018 3 year old alfalfa table 2 these results were similar with the findings of previous studies the yield of alfalfa increased with increasing stand age huang et al 2018 wang et al 2021 however an increase in the yields of alfalfa increases the amount of alfalfa evapotranspiration it has been shown that soil evaporation and transpiration for alfalfa fields are higher than those of maize ren and huang 2016 this caused the yield and water productivity of alfalfa to be higher than those of maize but the difference in wpc decreased as the alfalfa grew table 2 5 conclusions the water consumption of alfalfa was significantly higher than that of maize over both years of the experiment the increase in water consumption by alfalfa increased the soil water consumption and groundwater recharge and the contribution of groundwater to the alfalfa field was 18 73 on average during the irrigation period an increase of 5 83 compared with maize percentages of 75 43 and 81 27 of irrigation water were taken up by alfalfa and maize respectively the alfalfa used more water from deeper layers the average contributions of 40 100 cm soil layer increase of 11 2 compared with maize before irrigation the uptake of water by roots switched from deep layers to shallow layers after irrigation and comprised 72 93 and 69 8 of alfalfa and maize from soil water at a depth of 0 40 cm respectively in conclusion this indicates that alfalfa absorbs soil water more effectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

of drip irrigation systems keywords modeling moisture redistribution neuro fuzzy fuzzy c means clustering particle swarm optimization gravity search algorithm 1 introduction surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems are usually utilized in some semi arid and arid areas of iran mainly to decrease water losses and enhance water use efficiency the dimensions of wetting patterns are important factors to design and manage surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems thus in order to provide an optimal distribution of water into the crop root zone the appropriate design and operation of drip irrigation systems require knowledge of the shape and the exact dimensions of wetted bulb around the emitters yao et al 2011 cook et al 2003 kandelous and simunek 2010a hammami and zayani 2016 when these systems are designed poorly or operated inappropriately however their performance can be appreciably less than ideal al ogaidi et al 2016 shiri et al 2020a karimi et al 2020 knowing the wetting pattern in horizontal and vertical directions is imperative in choosing the correct spacing among the emitters the appropriate distance of laterals and the emitter installation depths elnesr and alazba 2019 kilic 2020 kanda et al 2020 in addition considering moisture redistribution values can minimize runoff as well as water deep percolation by determining the optimal distance between emitters and laterals mohammadbeigi et al 2016 according to the results of previous research some factors affect these patterns such as soil bulk density emitter outflow rate saturated hydraulic conductivity initial moisture content application time emitter position surface or subsurface and water application mode continuous or pulse singh et al 2006 al ogaidi et al 2016 malek and peters 2011 shiri et al 2020a karimi et al 2020 during the last decades many studies have been carried out to evaluate the wetting dimensions under continuous and pulse surface subsurface irrigation drip systems from point resources leading to different modeling categories the most common models include the numerical šimůnek et al 2011 elnesr and alazba 2019 analytical cook et al 2003 hammami and zayani 2016 empirical singh et al 2006 al ogaidi et al 2016 karimi et al 2021 the empirical models despite being easy to use are site specific and not suitable for general use shiri et al 2020a as the numerical and analytical models need high computational cost and a higher level of skills in their use they cannot be used for design and for determining operating objectives the important parameters for accurately determining the wetting redistribution pattern in the drip irrigation systems are horizontal redistribution dre and downward vertical redistribution vre which usually occurs after cut offing the irrigation process see fig 1 many research studies have been conducted to estimate the moisture distribution pattern during irrigation and limited attentions are paid to the prediction of wetting redistribution in the drip irrigation systems according to karimi et al 2013 moisture redistribution depends on soil properties e g saturated hydraulic conductivity or irrigation system parameters e g outlet emitter outflow rate and emitter installation depth mohammadbeigi et al 2016 investigated the moisture redistribution pattern under continuous and pulse surface drip irrigation systems their results showed that considerable values of the existing moisture distribution are associated with redistribution in other words in the clay soils with a flow rate of 2 4 l h about 23 of the vertical distribution of soil moisture is associated with redistribution they concluded that the moisture redistribution in the continuous irrigation system was 4 7 more than the pulse irrigation system using dimensional analysis buckingham π theorem karimi et al 2015 developed some equations for simulating horizontal and vertical redistribution patterns of the moisture front in the continuous irrigation system elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 investigated the soil moisture redistribution and deep percolation losses under continuous and pulse surface drip irrigation systems by taking into account the hysteresis phenomenon in two various soil samples silt loam and loamy sand their results showed that percolation loss is significantly reduced in the pulse irrigation system according to the above mentioned studies conducted in this field it is clear that considerable percentages of the dimensions of the wetted front are associated with the moisture redistribution after cut offing the irrigation process then wetting redistribution modeling is an important work for optimizing the lateral emitter spaces and emitter installation depth under surface and subsurface drip irrigations therefore utilizing an appropriate method is essential to simulate the wetted redistribution of moisture bulb with a high accurate and quick prediction consequently artificial intelligence ai based

anfis fcm anfis anns and sediment rating curve in estimating suspended sediment discharge in rivers the results indicated that the anfis fcm model was superior to the other three models the literature review in this area showed that there are many studies have focused on the dimensions of the moisture front under surface drip irrigation system whereas limited investigations have been conducted to simulate the soil moisture redistribution pattern especially for subsurface irrigation systems besides previous researches are mainly aimed at estimating the redistribution pattern for the continuous irrigation mode also review of various resources shows that analytical and numerical models require considerable computing power and a higher level of skill so their applications in operating and design purposes might be difficult meanwhile artificial intelligence models with suitable precision could be suitable alternatives for these models therefore the main contributions of the present study are as follows i to estimate the diameter of horizontal and downward vertical redistribution by soil and system parameters under continuous and pulse surface subsurface irrigation systems ii to investigate the ability of anfis fcm pso grnn and mars techniques in estimation of moisture redistribution pattern and iii to introduce the novel hybrid technique called anfis fcm psogsa and compare its outcomes with the other three models 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental model the laboratory tests were carried out at the central laboratory of the university of kurdistan iran a rectangular cube model with dimensions of 3 m in length 0 5 m in width and 1 m in height was used in the experiments fig 2 one side of the model is made of plexiglas sheets for monitoring the moisture wetting front and the other sides are metal plates three air dried soil textures with physical features table 1 were exactly filled into the model based on the bulk density of each soil sample to get the uniform initial water distribution and soil stability the soil inside the compartments were left in the laboratory for the time period of 24 48 h shiri et al 2020a al ogaidi et al 2016 the preferential flow along the walls was prevented by treating the lysimeter walls with glue and sprayed with sand for making a coarse surface kandelous and simunek 2010b emitters netafim emitters were attached to a water reservoir by micro polyethylene tubes main sub main and lateral with diameters of 32 20 and 16 mm respectively a pressure gauge and a valve were installed after the pump to measure the pressure values and to maintain steady outflow rate it should be mentioned that all tests were conducted at a constant pressure value of 2 bars the filtration system was used to prevent emitter clogging via suspended particles the flow was controlled by placing an off on valve within the lateral and sub main pipes into each container by taking into account the low outflow rate in each test the inflow was regulated by an installed by pass assembly so that the additional water was returned to the reservoir fig 2 shows the schematic description of the experimental setup totally 108 experiments were carried out with three kinds of emitter outflow rate 2 4 and 6 l h three types of soil textures light medium and heavy texture three different emitter installation depths 0 15 and 30 cm and four different irrigation modes one type for continuous irrigation three kinds for pulse irrigation in addition the pulse on off time ratios were selected as 30 30 20 40 and 40 20 where the first number refers to the irrigation time and the later shows the resting off time of the system in each cycle however the active time on time for all treatments was 4 h that made the volume of applied water for all treatments equal this container provides half space of the complete cylinder i e half of the wetted zone was considered in the experiments so the actual emitter outflow rate was multiplied by 2 kandelous and simunek 2010a 2010b al ogaidi et al 2016 shiri et al 2020a finally after completing the irrigation process i e the duration of 4 h the redistribution wetting front was

manufactured by golden software golden colorado usa the horizontal and vertical redistribution values were calculated table 2 represents the statistical parameters of the used experimental data in this research the results of table 2 showed wide range of input variables applied for modeling in the table sd and cv refer the standard deviation and coefficient of variation from table 2 elapsed time appears to have the highest variation cv 0 93 and it is closely followed by the emitter installation depth saturated hydraulic conductivity while the initial soil moisture has the lowest variation initial soil moisture varies between 0 8 and 3 2 which is consistent with previous studies al ogaidi et al 2016 kandelous and simunek 2010a 2010b the mentioned parameters t v q ks θ0 z and tirr ttot were utilized as the input of models to predict the diameter of horizontal redistribution dre and downward vertical redistribution vre in this research 470 and 443 patterns were used for modeling the dre and vre respectively 2 2 generalized regression neural network grnn the grnn model was presented by nadaraya 1964 and watson 1964 the grnn as a type of radial basis function networks rbfn related the input output variables using a universal approximator to compute any smooth function the grnn considered as nonparametric estimation method usually applied in statistics based on kernel regressions the grnn model is a three layer network that unlike the multi layer perceptron mlp algorithm the number of hidden layer s neurons simply calculated and equals to the number of observed data the number of neurons for the input output layers is equals to the dimension of input output vectors fig 3 shows schematic flowchart of grnn architecture the grnn utilizes eq 1 for

regression the mars algorithm firstly proposed by friedman 1991 has been used for different engineering fields during the past years from civil engineering to hydrology because of its powerful abilities kisi et al 2019 jahanpanah et al 2019 there are three main semesters in this model including basis function bf knots and spline function akin et al 2020 basis functions bfs represent the relationship among predictive variables vs target variables amounting max 0 c x or max 0 x c where x and c are respectively the threshold and input variable values as one of the main concepts in this model knots also represent the base and base end points functions for each individual node a regression model was developed through the application of a spline function consisting of 1 or more basis functions bfs and substitutes the principal predictors kisi and heddam 2019 abraham et al 2001 predicted mars model value is mainly based on the linear combination of bf elements a brief description of the above mentioned model is presented as follows assuming that y and x x1 x2 xp represent the target variable and a matrix of p input variables respectively the mars model equation can be written as follows 2 y f x β 0 m 1 m β 0 b f m x where β0 represents the initial fixed value bfm denotes the base functions applied for the mars model fitting and m shows the overall number of bfs friedman 1991 ghasemzadeh et al 2018 mars model consists of two phases the selection phase forward search and the reversal pruning phase fig 4 forward phase can be considered as a group of optimum input variables following a series of splits however the above excessively forward stepwise selection process attains a complicated over fitted model andres et al 2011 such a model despite perfectly fitting the data will yield poor predictive performance to enhance the accuracy of forecasting and improving the model predictive performance the backward procedure is applied to remove the unwanted variables from the previous selection phase generalized cross validation gcv which is the base for the backward pruning process was calculated as the deletion criterion craven and wahba 1978 sekulic and

optimization of the individual basic function the range of 2 d 4 is the best value of d friedman 1991 over fitting may occur if the selection comprises several basic functions hence a number of basic functions must be omitted during the pruning phase till a suitably fitted model can be achieved featuring the smallest gcv value deo et al 2016 2 4 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis was first introduced by jang 1993 which consists of several interconnected nodes each having a node function with a set of adjustable or fixed parameters jang et al 1997 via directional links it is the product of a combination of anns and fuzzy logic two soft computing approaches which are widely used as least forecast error estimators adnan et al 2019 for example the rule base containing two takagi sugeno s fuzzy if then rules may be expressed for a fis with a single output f and three inputs x y z as follows 5 rule 1 if x is a 1 y is b 1 and z is c 1 then f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 z s 1 6 rule 2 if x is a 2 y is b 2 and z is c 2 then f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 z s 2 where the output functions of rules 1 and 2 are indicated by f1 and f2 respectively fig 5 displays the structure of an anfis model a description of the node functions on each layer is presented as follows each square node i in the first layer is an adaptive node possessing a node function o l i φa i x for i 1 2 a i is a linguistic label e g small or big and x is the input to the ith node linked to the above node function o l i is the membership function mf of a fuzzy set of a a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 c 1 c 2 determining how the quantifier ai is satisfied by a certain input a i φa i x is generally assumed to follow a gaussian function with a maximum and minimum value of 1 and 0 respectively 7 φ a i x exp x a i b i 2 in which a i b i is a set of parameters the parameters belonging to this layer are denoted as premise parameters in layer 2 each circular node is labeled as π multiplying the incoming signals and sending out the product for example w i φa i x φbi y φc i z where i 1 2 each node s output reveals the firing strength of a single rule in addition each circular node in the third layer is labeled as n here the ratio of the firing strength of a certain rule to the summation of the firing strengths of all the rules is measured by the node i th as follows 8 w i w i w 1 w 2 i 1 2 each square node in layer 4 possesses a node function of o 4 i w i f i w i p i x q i y r i z s i in which pi qi ri si is a set of parameters and w i is the third layer output each parameter in this layer is called a consequent parameter besides each circular node in the fifth layer is labeled as σ which measures the final output by summation of all the incoming signals 9 o 5 i i 1 w i f i i w i f i i w i the anfis network was thus built which functionally equals a first order sugeno fis anfis employs constant or linear output functions jang 1993 can further explain anfis we can use anfis fcm a hybrid method for fuzzy rule generation to reach a few fuzzy rules fcm is also tasked with systematically identifying the fuzzy rule base and fuzzy membership functions for the anfis model 2 5 fuzzy c means clustering fuzzy c means clustering was first introduced by dunn 1973 and it was later improved by bezdek 1981 it is a soft clustering method whereby every data point form a part of a cluster with a degree determined by a membership degree therefore fcm is indeed a fuzzy k means clustering algorithm which rules out any sharp boundary between any pair of clusters jain 2010 velmurugan 2014 thus the most important benefit of the fcm allowing all objects to be part of the different groups in the global set rather than a single group only fcm divides the n vector set x i i 1 2 n into different fuzzy sets determining a cluster center for each set to reduce its dissimilarity measure objective function i 1 2 c is randomly selected from n points now the fcm procedure will be outlined each cluster center c i i 1 2 c is first selected randomly from n data patterns x 1 x 2 x 3 x n second the cluster membership matrix µ shall be calculated as follows 10 μ ij 1 k 1 c d ij d kj 2 m 1 where µij is the membership degree of object j in the cluster i m is the fuzziness exponent weight varying within the range 1 and d ij ci xj is the euclidean distance between point c i and point x j third the objective function can be determined as follows if it falls under a certain threshold the process will terminate 11 j u c 1 c 2 c c i 1 c j i i 1 c i 1 c μ ij m d ij 2 finally using the equation below the new fcm cluster centers c i i 1 2 c is calculated as follows 12 c i j 1 n μ ij m x j j 1 n μ ij m the fcm algorithm is used in this paper to divide the entire training datasets into different parts mfs with different centers anfis as suggested by park et al 2005 is being trained for each part 2 6 particle swarm optimization pso is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm stimulated by the swarming and migratory behaviors of birds during foraging it has been widely used in the context of multiple optimization problems it employs a large number of particles i e potential arrangements to find the best possible arrangement within the search space on where each particle has a fitness value whose velocity is determined by their distance and flight direction and distance pso has been designed to change the individual best fitness value pbest and to achieve the global best fitness value gbest because the population x x 1 x 2 x n includes n particles where particle i x i x i 1 x i 2 x is t is expressed as an s dimensional vector in an s dimensional search space the position of particle i within the search space potential solutions to the problem being debated is characterized by pso u i u i 1 u i 2 u i 3 u is t p best i p i 1 p i 2 p i 3 p is t and δ best δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ s t respectively denote the velocity of particle i the individual best fitness value pbest and the global best fitness value gbest the particle position and the velocity vector are updated according to the corresponding equations defined as follows 13 u i t 1 w u i t c 1 p best i x i t r n c 2 δ best x i t r n 14 x i t 1 x i t u i t 1 in which t represents the number of iterations u i t refers to the velocity of particle i in iteration t moreover w c 1 and c 2 respectively denote the inertia weight the weighting coefficient of particle acceleration and the weighting coefficient of global acceleration likewise c 1 and c 2 c1 c2 2 are learning factors and r n 0 1 and x i t refers to the current position of particle i in iteration t the first part of eq 13 wu refers to the searching capability of pso and the second and third parts i e c 1 p best i x i t r n and c 2 δ best x i t r n indicate the particles ability to optimize pbest and gbest the particle position vector is generated in the search space randomly eq 13 is used in every respect to update the particle velocity vector once the particle velocity is determined the particle position vector is updated using eq 14 until the stopping condition is met the particle position vector is anticipated to alter constantly 2 7 hybrid models of anfis fcm pso in the present study the hybrid anfis fcm pso model was used to predict redistribution parameters with a suitable degree of accuracy pso can help to adjust and achieve the desired anfis parameter values in training in this hybrid model the hybrid anfis fcm pso model flowchart is shown in fig 6 the following steps are taken in the hybrid anfis fcm pso model all datasets for the training model are initially reprocessed the original anfis technique is created by randomly initialization of all parameters with post processed data a suitable number of clusters must support the anfis model to reach an accurate prediction the original anfis technique uses the fcm clustering approach to optimize the results by deriving a set of rules which model the data sets and make up the fis then in these phases it is attempted to extract consequent parameters pi qi ri and premise parameters σ i v i b i to estimate each particle size to set up pso a vector is formed by the iterative extraction of the parameters corresponding to each mf the parameters make up the variables that need to be optimized using pso in this vector which allows us to determine the length of all pso particles the initial population is generated when the pso parameters are specified after all the particles are initialized pso will update each particle position and velocity until convergence to obtain optimum values for every variable each particle s objective function is calculated and consequently the new best possible values are updated finally the optimum values are assigned to the final anfis model as consequent and antecedent parameters 2 8 gravitational search algorithm gsa one of the heuristic based optimization algorithms is gsa which was first presented by rashedi et al 2009 in this algorithm the physical laws are applied to determine the optimum search space solution the gravity force size is proportional to the product of the fitness values of the particles and inversely proportional to the distance between them each individual indicates a possible solution each referring to a single fitness value and each fitness value is indicated by the individual s quality everything with massive particles in gsa across the universe is capable of attracting all other massive particles thus putting a large mass of individuals susceptible to a higher gravitational force therefore a large mass of individuals is close to the globally found best solution to the estimation problem provided that n substances make up a population in an n dimensional search space the position of each individual a possible solution shall be as follows 15 x i x i 1 x i d x i n i 1 2 n in which x i d is the substance position in d dimension of the space all individuals are randomly situated in the search space in the t th generation the gravity of substance j which is described in the d dimensional space as follows 16 f ij d t g t m aj t m pi t r ij t ϵ x j d t x i d t where m aj m pi g t r ij t and ε are respectively the individual i s active gravitational mass passive gravitational mass the t th generation gravitational constant euclidean distance of substance i and substance j and a small constant g i e gravitational constant and r ij euclidean distance of substances i and j are calculated as follows 17 g t g 0 exp α iter maxiter 18 r ij x i t x j t 2 where the initial gravitational constant and decreasing coefficient constant are referred to g 0 and α respectively moreover iter and maxiter indicate the number of current and maximum iterations respectively in a d dimensional search space the calculation of all gravity applied to substance i are given as follows 19 f i d t j 1 j i n r nj f ij d t where r nj is a 0 to 1 random number the acceleration of substance i as suggested by newton s laws of motion is proportional to d dimensions of force and inversely proportional to the mass inverse a substance s acceleration is evaluated as follows 20 a i d t f i d t m i t where the number of current iterations and substance i s mass are denoted by t and m i respectively substance i s position and velocity will be updated with the following conditions 21 u i d t 1 r ni u i d t a i d t 22 x i d t 1 x i d t u i d t 1 where r ni is a 0 to 1 random number it can be easily observed from two above mentioned equations that the current velocity and acceleration of a substance are defined in terms of the final velocity part and its acceleration the substance s current position is the same as its current position plus its final velocity the substance quality is characterized by fitness meaning that the higher the substance quality the greater the efficiency there is a positive correlation between gravity and the weight of the substance negatively correlated with motion as shown in the above mentioned equation using the corresponding condition the substance quality is updated as follows 23 m i t fit i t worst t best t worst t where fit i t best t and worst t are substance i s fitness value best individual and worst individual all in the tth generation respectively concerning the problem of minimization best t and worst t are calculated as follows 24 best t min j 1 n fit i t worst t max j 1 n fit j t the corresponding eq 25 characterizes the quality standardization rashedi et al 2009 25 m i t m i t j 1 n m j t 2 9 pso gsa algorithm gsa improved the optimization capacity however the process of moving to the optimum value seemed to have little convergence and could easily fall into a local optimal solution as a more sophisticated tool the so called pso gsa algorithm was therefore developed in which the individual s velocity and position are refreshed to address gsa weaknesses a schematic diagram of an anfis fcm psogsa model is presented in fig 7 the pso gsa fundamental principles are as follows first we create the velocity vector u i u i1 u i2 u is t and the initial position vector x x 1 x 2 x n of n individuals arbitrarily fitness values best t worst t and the corresponding position vector of each individual are calculated based on the initial position of each individual eqs 23 to 25 estimate the individual s qualities and eqs 21 to 22 estimate acceleration a gravitational constant ℊ and the euclidean distance between two individuals and the gravity of the individual ℱ the global searching capability of pso allows the updated individual velocity and position the fitness value and the corresponding optimum value are then calculated and when the number of iterations is achieved the best individual is reached eq 26 26 u i t 1 w u i t c 1 r n a c i t c 2 r n δ best x i t where the velocity of substance i in the tth generation the inertia weight the acceleration coefficient a random number in the range of 0 1 the substance i acceleration in the fttth generation and the optimized solution are denoted by u i t c j w ac i t and δ best respectively once the velocity vector is updated the substance position vector will be refreshed given the corresponding condition defined as follows 27 x i t 1 x i t u i t 1 3 application and results the main focus of this section is to investigate the ability of a new machine learning method in estimating the diameter of horizontal redistribution dre and downward vertical redistribution vre and comparing its accuracy with two alternative methods the evaluation process is divided into three sections describing the performances assessment of the models results of the estimation of diameter of horizontal redistribution dre and results of the estimation of downward vertical redistribution vre the proposed models were respectively as follows i the generalized regression neural network grnn ii the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars iii the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis with fuzzy c means fcm algorithm optimized using particle swarm optimization pso called anfis fcm pso and iv the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with fuzzy c means optimized using pso and by using the gravitational search algorithm gsa called anfis fcm psogsa data were first randomized using randperm function random permutation was applied of matlab and then divided in two parts by separating the 80 of the whole data for training and 20 for testing 3 1 performance assessment the performance assessment of the proposed models was conducted in terms of diameter of horizontal redistribution dre cm and the downward vertical redistribution vre cm the comparison between estimated and measured data was performed in terms of several statistical metrics such as coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae the performances metrics were calculated as follow 28 m a e 1 n i 1 n ο i ρ i 0 m a e 29 r m s e 1 n i 1 n ο i ρ i 2 0 r m s e 30 n s e 1 i 1 n ο i ρ i 2 i 1 n ο i ο i 2 n s e 1 31 r 2 1 ν i 1 n ο i ο i ρ i ρ i 1 ν i 1 n ο i ο i 2 1 ν i 1 n ρ i ρ i 2 2 0 r 2 1 the assessment was performed in terms of seven different input combinations m1 to m7 using seven different input variables namely i the emitter flow rates q ii the emitter installation depths z iii the pulse on off time ratios t on t tot iv the elapsed time after cut offing the irrigation process t v the volume of applied water during irrigation v vi the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and vii the soil initial moisture measured as gravimetric percentage θ0 see tables 3 and 4 in addition the performance was assessed according to different plots using the measured values as described in section 2 1 and the calculated values by different models figs 8 and 11 show the comparison between measured and calculated values of dre and vre in addition figs 9 and 12 show the boxplots illustrating the overall accuracies of the predicted values of dre and vre using the three models in comparison with the observed values besides figs 10 and 13 provide the generated taylor diagrams for the dre and vre respectively since they provide a strong indication of their reliability in terms of correlation coefficient r the root mean square difference and the ratio of the variances all calculated between measured and predicted data and plotted against the measured data 3 2 diameter of horizontal redistribution dre estimation for the three machines learning models the level of agreement between measured and calculated diameters of horizontal redistribution dre are given in table 3 the two anfis models were trained using several numbers of clusters in the range of 2 10 according to table 3 using mars models the root mean square errors rmse ranges from 1 243 cm to 2 125 cm and the mean absolute error mae ranges from 0 906 cm to 1 498 cm linear regression yields an overall r2 ranging from 0 497 to 0 842 while the nse value was ranged from 0 497 to 0 827 table 3 validation the modeled data using mars model trained using only the elapsed time after cut offing the irrigation process t delivered during the validation testing stage showed very low agreement with the measured dre expressed by the high value of rmse 2 125 cm and mae 1 498 cm and low values of r2 and nse r2 0 497 nse 0 497 table 3 m1 validation additionally very low modeling efficiency metrics r2 and nse indicate insufficient performance of the mars model in order to examine the effect of different variables on model s efficiency the number of input variables was increased from 1 to 7 m1 to m7 inclusion of the z combined with t m2 the mars model performances had been significantly improved with an increase of the r2 16 2 and nse 25 2 further improvement in the model performances was achieved using m3 model having inputs of t z and ton ttot for which lower discrepancies between measured and calculated dre was observed which has led to a significant increase in the r2 and nse values by 45 9 and 45 4 respectively resulting in a significant decrease in the rmse and mae values by 25 8 and 24 7 respectively beyond the m3 model m4 to m7 it can be concluded that both predictive models worked well with high accuracy they accurately estimate the dre however it is worthwhile to note that the difference between the four models m4 to m7 was negligible and results show a slight improvement particularly in r2 and nse values and we need to shed more light on the models performances as seen from table 3 the r2 nse rmse and mae values lie in the range of 0 4977 0 9304 0 4975 0 9248 1 243 1 276 cm and 0 907 0 938 cm respectively comparing the performances metrics the m4 and m5 models worked similarly with the same r2 and nse values of 0 832 and 0 820 the m6 and m7 models were slightly superior to the m4 and m5 models and they worked equally taking into account all the four performance metrics these results indicate general applicability of the mars estimation methodology for different input combination with reasonable accuracy and the m6 model was deemed as the best model for dre estimation having a number of input variables less than the m7 model and it should be concluded that the variable v does not contribute to a significant improvement in the models performances it is also clear from table 3 that the grnn has a rmse range from 1 2259 cm to 2 103 cm and a mae ranges from 0 880 cm to 1 454 cm linear regression gives an overall r2 ranged from 0 5082 to 0 8111 while the nse value was ranged from 0 5076 to 0 8589 comparison with the mars method indicates that the grnn performs slightly better than the mars method table 3 also shows the results obtained using the anfis fcm pso and anfis fcm psogsa models for most of the input combinations the estimation accuracy of dre was now large and significantly improved compared to the mars estimation illustrating that hybridizing of the anfis fcm with evolutionary bio inspired algorithm makes a positive contribution for m1 and m2 models results show that the anfis fcm pso and anfis fcm psogsa poorly estimated dre compared to the mars model the determinant coefficient r2 ranges from 0 555 to 0 638 for anfis fcm pso and from 0 508 to 0 625 for anfis fcm pso table 3 validation rmses and maes were very large higher than 1 835 cm and 1 250 cm for anfis fcm pso and higher than 1 835 cm and 1 314 cm for anfis fcm psogsa and they were relatively small compared to the values obtained using mars models table 3 consequently no significant improvement was found compared to the mars models for the first two input combination second it is clear from the results reported in table 3 that the gain achieved by the gravitational search algorithm gsa is negligible using the m1 and m2 combination from the third input combination m3 the improvement is arguably more important than the first two input combinations m1 and m2 the results allow us to conclude that without any doubt the best accuracy among all proposed models were obtained using the anfis fcm psogsa which corresponds to the m6 having as input variables t z k s θ 0 q t on t tot the anfis fcm psogsa i e m6 has the best performances with the lowest rmse 0 822 cm and mae 0 661 cm and the highest r2 0 930 and nse 0 925 on the contrary to the anfis fcm pso the best performances were obtained using the m7 input combination significantly less than the anfis fcm psogsa for comparison the anfis fcm psogsa improved the accuracy of the anfis fcm pso by decreasing the rmse and mae by 29 6 and 18 5 and increasing the r2 and nse values by 6 089 and 9 00 respectively however the performances of the mars model are worse than the two anfis models the rmse and mae of the mars model were 6 1 and 10 6 higher than those obtained by anfis fcm pso and 33 9 and 27 1 higher than those obtained by anfis fcm psogsa however when the volume of applied water during irrigation v was included i e m7 the performances of the anfis fcm psogsa become worse than the model without v i e m6 different from the other methods the grnn produced the best accuracy for m4 and this is inferior in estimation of the dre compared to the anfis fcm psogsa however the grnn was ranked as the 2nd place with respect to four measurements results reported in table 3 indicate that the soil initial moisture measured as gravimetric percentage θ0 has strong impacts on the model performances while the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks variable can be a good variable to improve the model performance for mars models the model with the ks variable i e m4 has the best performances with the lowest rmse 1 276 cm and mae 0 938 cm whereas the mars model performances without ks variable deteriorate when k s is dropped from the inputs i e m3 and the rmse and mae have become much large rmse 1 576 cm mae 1 128 cm with a significant increase of 19 1 and 16 8 i e m3 vs m4 similarly the performances of the grnn and anfis fcm pso models without ks variable deteriorate when k s is dropped from the inputs i e m3 and the rmse and mae have become much large rmse 1 593 cm mae 1 103 cm for the latter model with a significant increase of 23 9 and 23 9 i e m3 vs m4 respectively even more particularly and more significantly inclusion of the ks variable in the grnn and anfis fcm psogsa models i e m4 will bring about an important improvement in the model performances by dramatically reducing the rmse and mae by 42 7 and 35 9 respectively and markedly increasing the r2 and nse values by 19 5 and 19 0 for the anfis fcm psogsa respectively nonetheless the anfis fcm psogsa with m4 combination still outperforms the grnn and anfis fcm pso i e r2 0 921 nse 0 915 for anfis fcm pso vs r2 0 869 nse 0 837 for anfis fcm psogsa and the mars model i e m4 performs slightly worse than the corresponding anfis fcm pso model i e m4 i e r2 0 932 nse 0 819 vs r2 0 869 nse 0 837 respectively in order to further analyze the model s performance in simulating dre the performances of the proposed models were analyzed with and without the inclusion of the θ0 i e m4 vs m5 the inclusion of the θ0 as input variable caused a significant decrease in the model s performances for both machine learning models for mars model the estimation of dre can achieve better accuracy without the inclusion of θ0 i e m4 compared to mars with θ0 i e m5 although the differences between them are less significant and negligible with less than 1 reduction in the rmse and mae values while for the anfis fcm psogsa it is clear that the inclusion of the θ0 i e m5 may lead to a decrease of the model performances by 6 6 and 8 0 in terms of rmse and mae respectively fig 8 compares observed and predicted diameter of horizontal redistribution for all models with the best input variables in the test phase it is apparent that the anfis fcm psogsa model has less scattered estimates compared to anfis fcm pso grnn and mars the results produced by the considered models are illustrated in fig 9 in form of a boxplot as can be seen in this figure the distribution of the anfis fcm psogsa results is more similar to the observed one compared to other models taylor diagram was drawn in fig 10 to compare models accuracy in estimating dre it is observed from the figure that the standard deviation of the anfis fcm psogsa is closer to the observed value and this model has higher correlation and less rmse compared to anfis fcm pso grnn and mars models 3 3 downward vertical redistribution vre estimation the downward vertical redistribution vre cm was modeled according to seven input combinations m1 to m7 table 4 the grnn mars anfis fcm pso and the anfis fcm psogsa abilities to accurately predict the vre are compared in table 4 the evaluation is done using the 4 performance metrics presented in the previous section composed of rmse mae r2 and nse table 4 a first analysis of the results reported in table 4 shows that the anfis fcm psogsa outperforms the anfis fcm pso grnn and mars models for both input combinations more exactly the anfis fcm psogsa with the m5 input combination obtained the best results followed by the grnn anfis fcm pso and the mars was ranked in the last place however what is even more remarkable is that the differences between the models were more significant beyond the m3 combination for instance using the m1 and m2 input combinations all models poorly replicate the vre by exhibiting high values of rmse and mae and low values of r2 and nse using the m3 input combination only the anfis fcm psogsa achieved moderate accuracy with r2 and nse of 0 661 and 0 589 respectively and the rmse and mae were found to be very large and they exceed 1 430 cm and 1 133 cm respectively for all models using the m4 input combination the values of rmse and mae for the mars model were markedly decreased ranging from 1 348 cm and 1 049 1 476 cm and 0 944 cm respectively by applying the anfis fcm pso model and the lowest values were obtained using the anfis fcm psogsa accuracy increased most distinctly using the m5 model with a significant decrease in the rmse and mae values and an important improvement in the r2 and nse values the r2 and nse values for the models with lower accuracies are observed to increase when the t z ton ttot ks and θ0 are incorporated together i e m5 according to table 4 from the m4 to m5 the r2 and nse values changed from 0 7023 and 0 6390 to 0 7816 and 0 7616 for grnn model from 0 636 and 0 635 to 0 744 and 0 724 for mars model from 0 589 and 0 562 to 0 759 and 0 736 for anfis fcm pso model and significant improvement was found for the anfis fcm psogsa model where an analysis of the performances metrics indicates that the r2 and nse values increased by 20 1 and 19 2 and the rmse and mae values decreased by 35 7 and 35 6 respectively although results were improved by the use of the m5 input combination the improvement by increasing the number of input variables is not so important beyond m5 combination for example by varying the input variables from m5 to m6 the performances of the anfis fcm psogsa was made worse the r2 and nse values were dropped from 0 880 and 0 865 to 0 840 and 0 834 respectively similarly the performances of the anfis fcm pso was deteriorated the r2 and nse values were dropped from 0 759 and 0 736 to 0 695 and 0 681 respectively fig 11 compares the observed and predicted downward vertical redistributions for all models with the best input variables in the test phase from the figure it is clear that the least scattered estimates belong to the anfis fcm psogsa model while the mars has the most scattered ones the distributions of the implemented models are compared in fig 12 using boxplots here also the proposed model seems more similar to the observed vre values compared to grnn mars and anfis fcm pso models fig 13 compares the models accuracy in estimating vre on taylor diagram similar to the previous application the anfis fcm psogsa has the best accuracy by having closer standard deviation to observed one and higher correlation and less rmse compared to the anfis fcm pso grnn and mars models 4 conclusion the ability of a new machine learning method anfis fcm psogsa was investigated in the presented study for estimating diameter of horizontal and downward vertical redistributions using soil and system parameters as inputs under continuous and pulse surface subsurface irrigation systems the results are compared with two alternative methods anfis fcm pso grnn and mars using several statistics and graphical methods the results revealed that the proposed model produced promising results compared to other two models improvement in rmse mae r2 and nse of anfis fcm pso is 29 6 18 5 6 1 and 9 0 in estimating diameter of horizontal redistribution and it is 20 1 19 2 35 7 and 35 6 in estimating diameter of downward vertical redistribution using proposed model anfis fcm psogsa respectively the main limitation of the present study is the use of one experimental data however the implemented methods may be assessed by more experimental data in future and thus more generalized conclusions can be obtained the anfis fcm psogsa may be compared with some other advanced machine learning methods such as deep learning or ann psogsa in future studies all these results indicated that the anfis fcm psogsa model could be successfully used in estimating dimensions of wetting patterns using independent soil and system parameters and the provided results may be beneficial for managers and designers for designing and managing surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems in this study the anfis fcm psogsa was compared with the anfis fcm pso in future studies the proposed methods can also be compared with anfis gsa method in estimating the diameter of horizontal and downward vertical redistributions using soil and system parameters as inputs under continuous and pulse surface subsurface irrigation systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

the anfis fcm pso by 20 1 19 2 35 7 and 35 6 in estimating the diameter of downward vertical redistribution the general outcomes recommend the use of new method in estimating wetting front dimensions

drip irrigation systems are usually utilized in some semi arid and arid areas of iran mainly to decrease water losses and enhance water use efficiency the dimensions of wetting patterns are important factors to design and manage surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems thus in order to provide an optimal distribution of water into the crop root zone the appropriate design and operation of drip irrigation systems require knowledge of the shape and the exact dimensions of wetted bulb around the emitters yao et al 2011 cook et al 2003 kandelous and simunek 2010a hammami and zayani 2016 when these systems are designed poorly or operated inappropriately however their performance can be appreciably less than ideal al ogaidi et al 2016 shiri et al 2020a karimi et al 2020 knowing the wetting pattern in horizontal and vertical directions is imperative in choosing the correct spacing among the emitters the appropriate distance of laterals and the emitter installation depths elnesr and alazba 2019 kilic 2020 kanda et al 2020 in addition considering moisture redistribution values can minimize runoff as well as water deep percolation by determining the optimal distance between emitters and laterals mohammadbeigi et al 2016 according to the results of previous research some factors affect these patterns such as soil bulk density emitter outflow rate saturated hydraulic conductivity initial moisture content application time emitter position surface or subsurface and water application mode continuous or pulse singh et al 2006 al ogaidi et al 2016 malek and peters 2011 shiri et al 2020a karimi et al 2020 during the last decades many studies have been carried out to evaluate the wetting dimensions under continuous and pulse surface subsurface irrigation drip systems from point resources leading to different modeling categories the most common models include the numerical šimůnek et al 2011 elnesr and alazba 2019 analytical cook et al 2003 hammami and zayani 2016 empirical singh et al 2006 al ogaidi et al 2016 karimi et al 2021 the empirical models despite being easy to use are site specific and not suitable for general use shiri et al 2020a as the numerical and analytical models need high computational cost and a higher level of skills in their use they cannot be used for design and for determining operating objectives the important parameters for accurately determining the wetting redistribution pattern in the drip irrigation systems are horizontal redistribution dre and downward vertical redistribution vre which usually occurs after cut offing the irrigation process see fig 1 many research studies have been conducted to estimate the moisture distribution pattern during irrigation and limited attentions are paid to the prediction of wetting redistribution in the drip irrigation systems according to karimi et al 2013 moisture redistribution depends on soil properties e g saturated hydraulic conductivity or irrigation system parameters e g outlet emitter outflow rate and emitter installation depth mohammadbeigi et al 2016 investigated the moisture redistribution pattern under continuous and pulse surface drip irrigation systems their results showed that considerable values of the existing moisture distribution are associated with redistribution in other words in the clay soils with a flow rate of 2 4 l h about 23 of the vertical distribution of soil moisture is associated with redistribution they concluded that the moisture redistribution in the continuous irrigation system was 4 7 more than the pulse irrigation system using dimensional analysis buckingham π theorem karimi et al 2015 developed some equations for simulating horizontal and vertical redistribution patterns of the moisture front in the continuous irrigation system elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 investigated the soil moisture redistribution and deep percolation losses under continuous and pulse surface drip irrigation systems by taking into account the hysteresis phenomenon in two various soil samples silt loam and loamy sand their results showed that percolation loss is significantly reduced in the pulse irrigation system according to the above mentioned studies conducted in this field it is clear that considerable percentages of the dimensions of the wetted front are associated with the moisture redistribution after cut offing the irrigation process then wetting redistribution modeling is an important work for optimizing the lateral emitter spaces and emitter installation depth under surface and subsurface drip irrigations therefore utilizing an appropriate method is essential to simulate the wetted redistribution of moisture bulb with a high accurate and quick prediction consequently artificial intelligence ai based

anfis fcm anfis anns and sediment rating curve in estimating suspended sediment discharge in rivers the results indicated that the anfis fcm model was superior to the other three models the literature review in this area showed that there are many studies have focused on the dimensions of the moisture front under surface drip irrigation system whereas limited investigations have been conducted to simulate the soil moisture redistribution pattern especially for subsurface irrigation systems besides previous researches are mainly aimed at estimating the redistribution pattern for the continuous irrigation mode also review of various resources shows that analytical and numerical models require considerable computing power and a higher level of skill so their applications in operating and design purposes might be difficult meanwhile artificial intelligence models with suitable precision could be suitable alternatives for these models therefore the main contributions of the present study are as follows i to estimate the diameter of horizontal and downward vertical redistribution by soil and system parameters under continuous and pulse surface subsurface irrigation systems ii to investigate the ability of anfis fcm pso grnn and mars techniques in estimation of moisture redistribution pattern and iii to introduce the novel hybrid technique called anfis fcm psogsa and compare its outcomes with the other three models 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental model the laboratory tests were carried out at the central laboratory of the university of kurdistan iran a rectangular cube model with dimensions of 3 m in length 0 5 m in width and 1 m in height was used in the experiments fig 2 one side of the model is made of plexiglas sheets for monitoring the moisture wetting front and the other sides are metal plates three air dried soil textures with physical features table 1 were exactly filled into the model based on the bulk density of each soil sample to get the uniform initial water distribution and soil stability the soil inside the compartments were left in the laboratory for the time period of 24 48 h shiri et al 2020a al ogaidi et al 2016 the preferential flow along the walls was prevented by treating the lysimeter walls with glue and sprayed with sand for making a coarse surface kandelous and simunek 2010b emitters netafim emitters were attached to a water reservoir by micro polyethylene tubes main sub main and lateral with diameters of 32 20 and 16 mm respectively a pressure gauge and a valve were installed after the pump to measure the pressure values and to maintain steady outflow rate it should be mentioned that all tests were conducted at a constant pressure value of 2 bars the filtration system was used to prevent emitter clogging via suspended particles the flow was controlled by placing an off on valve within the lateral and sub main pipes into each container by taking into account the low outflow rate in each test the inflow was regulated by an installed by pass assembly so that the additional water was returned to the reservoir fig 2 shows the schematic description of the experimental setup totally 108 experiments were carried out with three kinds of emitter outflow rate 2 4 and 6 l h three types of soil textures light medium and heavy texture three different emitter installation depths 0 15 and 30 cm and four different irrigation modes one type for continuous irrigation three kinds for pulse irrigation in addition the pulse on off time ratios were selected as 30 30 20 40 and 40 20 where the first number refers to the irrigation time and the later shows the resting off time of the system in each cycle however the active time on time for all treatments was 4 h that made the volume of applied water for all treatments equal this container provides half space of the complete cylinder i e half of the wetted zone was considered in the experiments so the actual emitter outflow rate was multiplied by 2 kandelous and simunek 2010a 2010b al ogaidi et al 2016 shiri et al 2020a finally after completing the irrigation process i e the duration of 4 h the redistribution wetting front was recorded by drawing them on the plexiglas plate at the definite times e g 3 6 18 42 and 66 h at the end of each experiment preparing pictures of the wetting zone and utilizing the grapher software manufactured by golden software golden colorado usa the horizontal and vertical redistribution values were calculated table 2 represents the statistical parameters of the used experimental data in this research the results of table 2 showed wide range of input variables applied for modeling in the table sd and cv refer the standard deviation and coefficient of variation from table 2 elapsed time appears to have the highest variation cv 0 93 and it is closely followed by the emitter installation depth saturated hydraulic conductivity while the initial soil moisture has the lowest variation initial soil moisture varies between 0 8 and 3 2 which is consistent with previous studies al ogaidi et al 2016 kandelous and simunek 2010a 2010b the mentioned parameters t v q ks θ0 z and tirr ttot were utilized as the input of models to predict the diameter of horizontal redistribution dre and downward vertical redistribution vre in this research 470 and 443 patterns were used for modeling the dre and vre respectively 2 2 generalized regression neural network grnn the grnn model was presented by nadaraya 1964 and watson 1964 the grnn as a type of radial basis function networks rbfn related the input output variables using a universal approximator to compute any smooth function the grnn considered as nonparametric estimation method usually applied in statistics based on kernel regressions the grnn model is a three layer network that unlike the multi layer perceptron mlp algorithm the number of hidden layer s neurons simply calculated and equals to the number of observed data the number of neurons for the input output layers is equals to the dimension of input output vectors fig 3 shows schematic flowchart of grnn architecture the grnn utilizes eq 1 for obtaining the output 1 y k 1 a 1 n f x k a a 1 n f x k a t a where x x 1 x 2 x n t is an n dimensional input vector i e independent variable and y y 1 y 2 y m t is the output value i e dependent variable n is the number of observations and t a is the target with the ath observation araghinejad 2013 2 3 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars as a nonlinear nonparametric flexible regression the mars algorithm firstly proposed by friedman 1991 has been used for different engineering fields during the past years from civil engineering to hydrology because of its powerful abilities kisi et al 2019 jahanpanah et al 2019 there are three main semesters in this model including basis function bf knots and spline function akin et al 2020 basis functions bfs represent the relationship among predictive variables vs target variables amounting max 0 c x or max 0 x c where x and c are respectively the threshold and input variable values as one of the main concepts in this model knots also represent the base and base end points functions for each individual node a regression model was developed through the application of a spline function consisting of 1 or more basis functions bfs and substitutes the principal predictors kisi and heddam 2019 abraham et al 2001 predicted mars model value is mainly based on the linear combination of bf elements a brief description of the above mentioned model is presented as follows assuming that y and x x1 x2 xp represent the target variable and a matrix of p input variables respectively the mars model equation can be written as follows 2 y f x β 0 m 1 m β 0 b f m x where β0 represents the initial fixed value bfm denotes the base functions applied for the mars model fitting and m shows the overall number of bfs friedman 1991 ghasemzadeh et al 2018 mars model consists of two phases the selection phase forward search and the reversal pruning phase fig 4 forward phase can be considered as a group of optimum input variables following a series of splits however the above excessively forward stepwise selection process attains a complicated over fitted model andres et al 2011 such a model despite perfectly fitting the data will yield poor predictive performance to enhance the accuracy of forecasting and improving the model predictive performance the backward procedure is applied to remove the unwanted variables from the previous selection phase generalized cross validation gcv which is the base for the backward pruning process was calculated as the deletion criterion craven and wahba 1978 sekulic and kowalski 1992 3 gcv m 1 n i 1 n o i f x i 2 1 c m n 2 4 c m d 1 m where oi is the observed value n refers to the number of data f xi represents the values predicted for the pattern i m denotes the number of basic functions and c m indicates the penalty factor deo et al 2016 kisi and heddam 2019 the quantity of parameter d in eq 3 has a smoothing role in the procedure denoting a cost for the optimization of the individual basic function the range of 2 d 4 is the best value of d friedman 1991 over fitting may occur if the selection comprises several basic functions hence a number of basic functions must be omitted during the pruning phase till a suitably fitted model can be achieved featuring the smallest gcv value deo et al 2016 2 4 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis was first introduced by jang 1993 which consists of several interconnected nodes each having a node function with a set of adjustable or fixed parameters jang et al 1997 via directional links it is the product of a combination of anns and fuzzy logic two soft computing approaches which are widely used as least forecast error estimators adnan et al 2019 for example the rule base containing two takagi sugeno s fuzzy if then rules may be expressed for a fis with a single output f and three inputs x y z as follows 5 rule 1 if x is a 1 y is b 1 and z is c 1 then f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 z s 1 6 rule 2 if x is a 2 y is b 2 and z is c 2 then f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 z s 2 where the output functions of rules 1 and 2 are indicated by f1 and f2 respectively fig 5 displays the structure of an anfis model a description of the node functions on each layer is presented as follows each square node i in the first layer is an adaptive node possessing a node function o l i φa i x for i 1 2 a i is a linguistic label e g small or big and x is the input to the ith node linked to the above node function o l i is the membership function mf of a fuzzy set of a a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 c 1 c 2 determining how the quantifier ai is satisfied by a certain input a i φa i x is generally assumed to follow a gaussian function with a maximum and minimum value of 1 and 0 respectively 7 φ a i x exp x a i b i 2 in which a i b i is a set of parameters the parameters belonging to this layer are denoted as premise parameters in layer 2 each circular node is labeled as π multiplying the incoming signals and sending out the product for example w i φa i x φbi y φc i z where i 1 2 each node s output reveals the firing strength of a single rule in addition each circular node in the third layer is labeled as n here the ratio of the firing strength of a certain rule to the summation of the firing strengths of all the rules is measured by the node i th as follows 8 w i w i w 1 w 2 i 1 2 each square node in layer 4 possesses a node function of o 4 i w i f i w i p i x q i y r i z s i in which pi qi ri si is a set of parameters and w i is the third layer output each parameter in this layer is called a consequent parameter besides each circular node in the fifth layer is labeled as σ which measures the final output by summation of all the incoming signals 9 o 5 i i 1 w i f i i w i f i i w i the anfis network was thus built which functionally equals a first order sugeno fis anfis employs constant or linear output functions jang 1993 can further explain anfis we can use anfis fcm a hybrid method for fuzzy rule generation to reach a few fuzzy rules fcm is also tasked with systematically identifying the fuzzy rule base and fuzzy membership functions for the anfis model 2 5 fuzzy c means clustering fuzzy c means clustering was first introduced by dunn 1973 and it was later improved by bezdek 1981 it is a soft clustering method whereby every data point form a part of a cluster with a degree determined by a membership degree therefore fcm is indeed a fuzzy k means clustering algorithm which rules out any sharp boundary between any pair of clusters jain 2010 velmurugan 2014 thus the most important benefit of the fcm allowing all objects to be part of the different groups in the global set rather than a single group only fcm divides the n vector set x i i 1 2 n into different fuzzy sets determining a cluster center for each set to reduce its dissimilarity measure objective function i 1 2 c is randomly selected from n points now the fcm procedure will be outlined each cluster center c i i 1 2 c is first selected randomly from n data patterns x 1 x 2 x 3 x n second the cluster membership matrix µ shall be calculated as follows 10 μ ij 1 k 1 c d ij d kj 2 m 1 where µij is the membership degree of object j in the cluster i m is the fuzziness exponent weight varying within the range 1 and d ij ci xj is the euclidean distance between point c i and point x j third the objective function can be determined as follows if it falls under a certain threshold the process will terminate 11 j u c 1 c 2 c c i 1 c j i i 1 c i 1 c μ ij m d ij 2 finally using the equation below the new fcm cluster centers c i i 1 2 c is calculated as follows 12 c i j 1 n μ ij m x j j 1 n μ ij m the fcm algorithm is used in this paper to divide the entire training datasets into different parts mfs with different centers anfis as suggested by park et al 2005 is being trained for each part 2 6 particle swarm optimization pso is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm stimulated by the swarming and migratory behaviors of birds during foraging it has been widely used in the context of multiple optimization problems it employs a large number of particles i e potential arrangements to find the best possible arrangement within the search space on where each particle has a fitness value whose velocity is determined by their distance and flight direction and distance pso has been designed to change the individual best fitness value pbest and to achieve the global best fitness value gbest because the population x x 1 x 2 x n includes n particles where particle i x i x i 1 x i 2 x is t is expressed as an s dimensional vector in an s dimensional search space the position of particle i within the search space potential solutions to the problem being debated is characterized by pso u i u i 1 u i 2 u i 3 u is t p best i p i 1 p i 2 p i 3 p is t and δ best δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ s t respectively denote the velocity of particle i the individual best fitness value pbest and the global best fitness value gbest the particle position and the velocity vector are updated according to the corresponding equations defined as follows 13 u i t 1 w u i t c 1 p best i x i t r n c 2 δ best x i t r n 14 x i t 1 x i t u i t 1 in which t represents the number of iterations u i t refers to the velocity of particle i in iteration t moreover w c 1 and c 2 respectively denote the inertia weight the weighting coefficient of particle acceleration and the weighting coefficient of global acceleration likewise c 1 and c 2 c1 c2 2 are learning factors and r n 0 1 and x i t refers to the current position of particle i in iteration t the first part of eq 13 wu refers to the searching capability of pso and the second and third parts i e c 1 p best i x i t r n and c 2 δ best x i t r n indicate the particles ability to optimize pbest and gbest the particle position vector is generated in the search space randomly eq 13 is used in every respect to update the particle velocity vector once the particle velocity is determined the particle position vector is updated using eq 14 until the stopping condition is met the particle position vector is anticipated to alter constantly 2 7 hybrid models of anfis fcm pso in the present study the hybrid anfis fcm pso model was used to predict redistribution parameters with a suitable degree of accuracy pso can help to adjust and achieve the desired anfis parameter values in training in this hybrid model the hybrid anfis fcm pso model flowchart is shown in fig 6 the following steps are taken in the hybrid anfis fcm pso model all datasets for the training model are initially reprocessed the original anfis technique is created by randomly initialization of all parameters with post processed data a suitable number of clusters must support the anfis model to reach an accurate prediction the original anfis technique uses the fcm clustering approach to optimize the results by deriving a set of rules which model the data sets and make up the fis then in these phases it is attempted to extract consequent parameters pi qi ri and premise parameters σ i v i b i to estimate each particle size to set up pso a vector is formed by the iterative extraction of the parameters corresponding to each mf the parameters make up the variables that need to be optimized using pso in this vector which allows us to determine the length of all pso particles the initial population is generated when the pso parameters are specified after all the particles are initialized pso will update each particle position and velocity until convergence to obtain optimum values for every variable each particle s objective function is calculated and consequently the new best possible values are updated finally the optimum values are assigned to the final anfis model as consequent and antecedent parameters 2 8 gravitational search algorithm gsa one of the heuristic based optimization algorithms is gsa which was first presented by rashedi et al 2009 in this algorithm the physical laws are applied to determine the optimum search space solution the gravity force size is proportional to the product of the fitness values of the particles and inversely proportional to the distance between them each individual indicates a possible solution each referring to a single fitness value and each fitness value is indicated by the individual s quality everything with massive particles in gsa across the universe is capable of attracting all other massive particles thus putting a large mass of individuals susceptible to a higher gravitational force therefore a large mass of individuals is close to the globally found best solution to the estimation problem provided that n substances make up a population in an n dimensional search space the position of each individual a possible solution shall be as follows 15 x i x i 1 x i d x i n i 1 2 n in which x i d is the substance position in d dimension of the space all individuals are randomly situated in the search space in the t th generation the gravity of substance j which is described in the d dimensional space as follows 16 f ij d t g t m aj t m pi t r ij t ϵ x j d t x i d t where m aj m pi g t r ij t and ε are respectively the individual i s active gravitational mass passive gravitational mass the t th generation gravitational constant euclidean distance of substance i and substance j and a small constant g i e gravitational constant and r ij euclidean distance of substances i and j are calculated as follows 17 g t g 0 exp α iter maxiter 18 r ij x i t x j t 2 where the initial gravitational constant and decreasing coefficient constant are referred to g 0 and α respectively moreover iter and maxiter indicate the number of current and maximum iterations respectively in a d dimensional search space the calculation of all gravity applied to substance i are given as follows 19 f i d t j 1 j i n r nj f ij d t where r nj is a 0 to 1 random number the acceleration of substance i as suggested by newton s laws of motion is proportional to d dimensions of force and inversely proportional to the mass inverse a substance s acceleration is evaluated as follows 20 a i d t f i d t m i t where the number of current iterations and substance i s mass are denoted by t and m i respectively substance i s position and velocity will be updated with the following conditions 21 u i d t 1 r ni u i d t a i d t 22 x i d t 1 x i d t u i d t 1 where r ni is a 0 to 1 random number it can be easily observed from two above mentioned equations that the current velocity and acceleration of a substance are defined in terms of the final velocity part and its acceleration the substance s current position is the same as its current position plus its final velocity the substance quality is characterized by fitness meaning that the higher the substance quality the greater the efficiency there is a positive correlation between gravity and the weight of the substance negatively correlated with motion as shown in the above mentioned equation using the corresponding condition the substance quality is updated as follows 23 m i t fit i t worst t best t worst t where fit i t best t and worst t are substance i s fitness value best individual and worst individual all in the tth generation respectively concerning the problem of minimization best t and worst t are calculated as follows 24 best t min j 1 n fit i t worst t max j 1 n fit j t the corresponding eq 25 characterizes the quality standardization rashedi et al 2009 25 m i t m i t j 1 n m j t 2 9 pso gsa algorithm gsa improved the optimization capacity however the process of moving to the optimum value seemed to have little convergence and could easily fall into a local optimal solution as a more sophisticated tool the so called pso gsa algorithm was therefore developed in which the individual s velocity and position are refreshed to address gsa weaknesses a schematic diagram of an anfis fcm psogsa model is presented in fig 7 the pso gsa fundamental principles are as follows first we create the velocity vector u i u i1 u i2 u is t and the initial position vector x x 1 x 2 x n of n individuals arbitrarily fitness values best t worst t and the corresponding position vector of each individual are calculated based on the initial position of each individual eqs 23 to 25 estimate the individual s qualities and eqs 21 to 22 estimate acceleration a gravitational constant ℊ and the euclidean distance between two individuals and the gravity of the individual ℱ the global searching capability of pso allows the updated individual velocity and position the fitness value and the corresponding optimum value are then calculated and when the number of iterations is achieved the best individual is reached eq 26 26 u i t 1 w u i t c 1 r n a c i t c 2 r n δ best x i t where the velocity of substance i in the tth generation the inertia weight the acceleration coefficient a random number in the range of 0 1 the substance i acceleration in the fttth generation and the optimized solution are denoted by u i t c j w ac i t and δ best respectively once the velocity vector is updated the substance position vector will be refreshed given the corresponding condition defined as follows 27 x i t 1 x i t u i t 1 3 application and results the main focus of this section is to investigate the ability of a new machine learning method in estimating the diameter of horizontal redistribution dre and downward vertical redistribution vre and comparing its accuracy with two alternative methods the evaluation process is divided into three sections describing the performances assessment of the models results of the estimation of diameter of horizontal redistribution dre and results of the estimation of downward vertical redistribution vre the proposed models were respectively as follows i the generalized regression neural network grnn ii the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars iii the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis with fuzzy c means fcm algorithm optimized using particle swarm optimization pso called anfis fcm pso and iv the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with fuzzy c means optimized using pso and by using the gravitational search algorithm gsa called anfis fcm psogsa data were first randomized using randperm function random permutation was applied of matlab and then divided in two parts by separating the 80 of the whole data for training and 20 for testing 3 1 performance assessment the performance assessment of the proposed models was conducted in terms of diameter of horizontal redistribution dre cm and the downward vertical redistribution vre cm the comparison between estimated and measured data was performed in terms of several statistical metrics such as coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae the performances metrics were calculated as follow 28 m a e 1 n i 1 n ο i ρ i 0 m a e 29 r m s e 1 n i 1 n ο i ρ i 2 0 r m s e 30 n s e 1 i 1 n ο i ρ i 2 i 1 n ο i ο i 2 n s e 1 31 r 2 1 ν i 1 n ο i ο i ρ i ρ i 1 ν i 1 n ο i ο i 2 1 ν i 1 n ρ i ρ i 2 2 0 r 2 1 the assessment was performed in terms of seven different input combinations m1 to m7 using seven different input variables namely i the emitter flow rates q ii the emitter installation depths z iii the pulse on off time ratios t on t tot iv the elapsed time after cut offing the irrigation process t v the volume of applied water during irrigation v vi the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and vii the soil initial moisture measured as gravimetric percentage θ0 see tables 3 and 4 in addition the performance was assessed according to different plots using the measured values as described in section 2 1 and the calculated values by different models figs 8 and 11 show the comparison between measured and calculated values of dre and vre in addition figs 9 and 12 show the boxplots illustrating the overall accuracies of the predicted values of dre and vre using the three models in comparison with the observed values besides figs 10 and 13 provide the generated taylor diagrams for the dre and vre respectively since they provide a strong indication of their reliability in terms of correlation coefficient r the root mean square difference and the ratio of the variances all calculated between measured and predicted data and plotted against the measured data 3 2 diameter of horizontal redistribution dre estimation for the three machines learning models the level of agreement between measured and calculated diameters of horizontal redistribution dre are given in table 3 the two anfis models were trained using several numbers of clusters in the range of 2 10 according to table 3 using mars models the root mean square errors rmse ranges from 1 243 cm to 2 125 cm and the mean absolute error mae ranges from 0 906 cm to 1 498 cm linear regression yields an overall r2 ranging from 0 497 to 0 842 while the nse value was ranged from 0 497 to 0 827 table 3 validation the modeled data using mars model trained using only the elapsed time after cut offing the irrigation process t delivered during the validation testing stage showed very low agreement with the measured dre expressed by the high value of rmse 2 125 cm and mae 1 498 cm and low values of r2 and nse r2 0 497 nse 0 497 table 3 m1 validation additionally very low modeling efficiency metrics r2 and nse indicate insufficient performance of the mars model in order to examine the effect of different variables on model s efficiency the number of input variables was increased from 1 to 7 m1 to m7 inclusion of the z combined with t m2 the mars model performances had been significantly improved with an increase of the r2 16 2 and nse 25 2 further improvement in the model performances was achieved using m3 model having inputs of t z and ton ttot for which lower discrepancies between measured and calculated dre was observed which has led to a significant increase in the r2 and nse values by 45 9 and 45 4 respectively resulting in a significant decrease in the rmse and mae values by 25 8 and 24 7 respectively beyond the m3 model m4 to m7 it can be concluded that both predictive models worked well with high accuracy they accurately estimate the dre however it is worthwhile to note that the difference between the four models m4 to m7 was negligible and results show a slight improvement particularly in r2 and nse values and we need to shed more light on the models performances as seen from table 3 the r2 nse rmse and mae values lie in the range of 0 4977 0 9304 0 4975 0 9248 1 243 1 276 cm and 0 907 0 938 cm respectively comparing the performances metrics the m4 and m5 models worked similarly with the same r2 and nse values of 0 832 and 0 820 the m6 and m7 models were slightly superior to the m4 and m5 models and they worked equally taking into account all the four performance metrics these results indicate general applicability of the mars estimation methodology for different input combination with reasonable accuracy and the m6 model was deemed as the best model for dre estimation having a number of input variables less than the m7 model and it should be concluded that the variable v does not contribute to a significant improvement in the models performances it is also clear from table 3 that the grnn has a rmse range from 1 2259 cm to 2 103 cm and a mae ranges from 0 880 cm to 1 454 cm linear regression gives an overall r2 ranged from 0 5082 to 0 8111 while the nse value was ranged from 0 5076 to 0 8589 comparison with the mars method indicates that the grnn performs slightly better than the mars method table 3 also shows the results obtained using the anfis fcm pso and anfis fcm psogsa models for most of the input combinations the estimation accuracy of dre was now large and significantly improved compared to the mars estimation illustrating that hybridizing of the anfis fcm with evolutionary bio inspired algorithm makes a positive contribution for m1 and m2 models results show that the anfis fcm pso and anfis fcm psogsa poorly estimated dre compared to the mars model the determinant coefficient r2 ranges from 0 555 to 0 638 for anfis fcm pso and from 0 508 to 0 625 for anfis fcm pso table 3 validation rmses and maes were very large higher than 1 835 cm and 1 250 cm for anfis fcm pso and higher than 1 835 cm and 1 314 cm for anfis fcm psogsa and they were relatively small compared to the values obtained using mars models table 3 consequently no significant improvement was found compared to the mars models for the first two input combination second it is clear from the results reported in table 3 that the gain achieved by the gravitational search algorithm gsa is negligible using the m1 and m2 combination from the third input combination m3 the improvement is arguably more important than the first two input combinations m1 and m2 the results allow us to conclude that without any doubt the best accuracy among all proposed models were obtained using the anfis fcm psogsa which corresponds to the m6 having as input variables t z k s θ 0 q t on t tot the anfis fcm psogsa i e m6 has the best performances with the lowest rmse 0 822 cm and mae 0 661 cm and the highest r2 0 930 and nse 0 925 on the contrary to the anfis fcm pso the best performances were obtained using the m7 input combination significantly less than the anfis fcm psogsa for comparison the anfis fcm psogsa improved the accuracy of the anfis fcm pso by decreasing the rmse and mae by 29 6 and 18 5 and increasing the r2 and nse values by 6 089 and 9 00 respectively however the performances of the mars model are worse than the two anfis models the rmse and mae of the mars model were 6 1 and 10 6 higher than those obtained by anfis fcm pso and 33 9 and 27 1 higher than those obtained by anfis fcm psogsa however when the volume of applied water during irrigation v was included i e m7 the performances of the anfis fcm psogsa become worse than the model without v i e m6 different from the other methods the grnn produced the best accuracy for m4 and this is inferior in estimation of the dre compared to the anfis fcm psogsa however the grnn was ranked as the 2nd place with respect to four measurements results reported in table 3 indicate that the soil initial moisture measured as gravimetric percentage θ0 has strong impacts on the model performances while the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks variable can be a good variable to improve the model performance for mars models the model with the ks variable i e m4 has the best performances with the lowest rmse 1 276 cm and mae 0 938 cm whereas the mars model performances without ks variable deteriorate when k s is dropped from the inputs i e m3 and the rmse and mae have become much large rmse 1 576 cm mae 1 128 cm with a significant increase of 19 1 and 16 8 i e m3 vs m4 similarly the performances of the grnn and anfis fcm pso models without ks variable deteriorate when k s is dropped from the inputs i e m3 and the rmse and mae have become much large rmse 1 593 cm mae 1 103 cm for the latter model with a significant increase of 23 9 and 23 9 i e m3 vs m4 respectively even more particularly and more significantly inclusion of the ks variable in the grnn and anfis fcm psogsa models i e m4 will bring about an important improvement in the model performances by dramatically reducing the rmse and mae by 42 7 and 35 9 respectively and markedly increasing the r2 and nse values by 19 5 and 19 0 for the anfis fcm psogsa respectively nonetheless the anfis fcm psogsa with m4 combination still outperforms the grnn and anfis fcm pso i e r2 0 921 nse 0 915 for anfis fcm pso vs r2 0 869 nse 0 837 for anfis fcm psogsa and the mars model i e m4 performs slightly worse than the corresponding anfis fcm pso model i e m4 i e r2 0 932 nse 0 819 vs r2 0 869 nse 0 837 respectively in order to further analyze the model s performance in simulating dre the performances of the proposed models were analyzed with and without the inclusion of the θ0 i e m4 vs m5 the inclusion of the θ0 as input variable caused a significant decrease in the model s performances for both machine learning models for mars model the estimation of dre can achieve better accuracy without the inclusion of θ0 i e m4 compared to mars with θ0 i e m5 although the differences between them are less significant and negligible with less than 1 reduction in the rmse and mae values while for the anfis fcm psogsa it is clear that the inclusion of the θ0 i e m5 may lead to a decrease of the model performances by 6 6 and 8 0 in terms of rmse and mae respectively fig 8 compares observed and predicted diameter of horizontal redistribution for all models with the best input variables in the test phase it is apparent that the anfis fcm psogsa model has less scattered estimates compared to anfis fcm pso grnn and mars the results produced by the considered models are illustrated in fig 9 in form of a boxplot as can be seen in this figure the distribution of the anfis fcm psogsa results is more similar to the observed one compared to other models taylor diagram was drawn in fig 10 to compare models accuracy in estimating dre it is observed from the figure that the standard deviation of the anfis fcm psogsa is closer to the observed value and this model has higher correlation and less rmse compared to anfis fcm pso grnn and mars models 3 3 downward vertical redistribution vre estimation the downward vertical redistribution vre cm was modeled according to seven input combinations m1 to m7 table 4 the grnn mars anfis fcm pso and the anfis fcm psogsa abilities to accurately predict the vre are compared in table 4 the evaluation is done using the 4 performance metrics presented in the previous section composed of rmse mae r2 and nse table 4 a first analysis of the results reported in table 4 shows that the anfis fcm psogsa outperforms the anfis fcm pso grnn and mars models for both input combinations more exactly the anfis fcm psogsa with the m5 input combination obtained the best results followed by the grnn anfis fcm pso and the mars was ranked in the last place however what is even more remarkable is that the differences between the models were more significant beyond the m3 combination for instance using the m1 and m2 input combinations all models poorly replicate the vre by exhibiting high values of rmse and mae and low values of r2 and nse using the m3 input combination only the anfis fcm psogsa achieved moderate accuracy with r2 and nse of 0 661 and 0 589 respectively and the rmse and mae were found to be very large and they exceed 1 430 cm and 1 133 cm respectively for all models using the m4 input combination the values of rmse and mae for the mars model were markedly decreased ranging from 1 348 cm and 1 049 1 476 cm and 0 944 cm respectively by applying the anfis fcm pso model and the lowest values were obtained using the anfis fcm psogsa accuracy increased most distinctly using the m5 model with a significant decrease in the rmse and mae values and an important improvement in the r2 and nse values the r2 and nse values for the models with lower accuracies are observed to increase when the t z ton ttot ks and θ0 are incorporated together i e m5 according to table 4 from the m4 to m5 the r2 and nse values changed from 0 7023 and 0 6390 to 0 7816 and 0 7616 for grnn model from 0 636 and 0 635 to 0 744 and 0 724 for mars model from 0 589 and 0 562 to 0 759 and 0 736 for anfis fcm pso model and significant improvement was found for the anfis fcm psogsa model where an analysis of the performances metrics indicates that the r2 and nse values increased by 20 1 and 19 2 and the rmse and mae values decreased by 35 7 and 35 6 respectively although results were improved by the use of the m5 input combination the improvement by increasing the number of input variables is not so important beyond m5 combination for example by varying the input variables from m5 to m6 the performances of the anfis fcm psogsa was made worse the r2 and nse values were dropped from 0 880 and 0 865 to 0 840 and 0 834 respectively similarly the performances of the anfis fcm pso was deteriorated the r2 and nse values were dropped from 0 759 and 0 736 to 0 695 and 0 681 respectively fig 11 compares the observed and predicted downward vertical redistributions for all models with the best input variables in the test phase from the figure it is clear that the least scattered estimates belong to the anfis fcm psogsa model while the mars has the most scattered ones the distributions of the implemented models are compared in fig 12 using boxplots here also the proposed model seems more similar to the observed vre values compared to grnn mars and anfis fcm pso models fig 13 compares the models accuracy in estimating vre on taylor diagram similar to the previous application the anfis fcm psogsa has the best accuracy by having closer standard deviation to observed one and higher correlation and less rmse compared to the anfis fcm pso grnn and mars models 4 conclusion the ability of a new machine learning method anfis fcm psogsa was investigated in the presented study for estimating diameter of horizontal and downward vertical redistributions using soil and system parameters as inputs under continuous and pulse surface subsurface irrigation systems the results are compared with two alternative methods anfis fcm pso grnn and mars using several statistics and graphical methods the results revealed that the proposed model produced promising results compared to other two models improvement in rmse mae r2 and nse of anfis fcm pso is 29 6 18 5 6 1 and 9 0 in estimating diameter of horizontal redistribution and it is 20 1 19 2 35 7 and 35 6 in estimating diameter of downward vertical redistribution using proposed model anfis fcm psogsa respectively the main limitation of the present study is the use of one experimental data however the implemented methods may be assessed by more experimental data in future and thus more generalized conclusions can be obtained the anfis fcm psogsa may be compared with some other advanced machine learning methods such as deep learning or ann psogsa in future studies all these results indicated that the anfis fcm psogsa model could be successfully used in estimating dimensions of wetting patterns using independent soil and system parameters and the provided results may be beneficial for managers and designers for designing and managing surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems in this study the anfis fcm psogsa was compared with the anfis fcm pso in future studies the proposed methods can also be compared with anfis gsa method in estimating the diameter of horizontal and downward vertical redistributions using soil and system parameters as inputs under continuous and pulse surface subsurface irrigation systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
