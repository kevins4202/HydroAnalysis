20100,effective management of rivers and the maintenance of the integrity of linked biophysical systems require multidisciplinary approaches thus river science is a relatively new arena of scientific inquiry that focuses on problems of sustainable management of river systems and it actively integrates multiple scales and various concepts this paper presents a review of new developments in hydrogeomorphic processes understanding which are critical to assess water security for indian river systems indian rivers are under the influence of a diverse interplay of climatic geomorphic tectonic and anthropogenic forces and are broadly classified in terms of himalayan and peninsular rivers which can be further subdivided into 6 major types the himalayan rivers have received greater attention in comparison to rivers in peninsular india within the backdrop of changing climate an improved understanding of the interrelationships between hydrological morphological and ecological processes is the key to quantifying water security for indian rivers in the near future geomorphic threshold hydrological and sediment connectivity groundwater surfacewater gw sw interaction and environmental flow e flow assessment are the essential elements to understand the hydrology morphological ecological processes such studies have been initiated in indian river systems however these are still limited in number stream power distribution based approaches are frequently employed to understand hydrological controls on morphological processes and form in regulated and unregulated rivers as a majority of the himalayan rivers are hydrologically and morphologically disconnected due to large dams or barrages the result is a discontinuum of channel processes peninsular rivers are dominantly bedrock and highly regulated river systems which show significant short to long term flow variability and have tributaries which are not perennial disconnectivity due to extensive flow regulation and water withdrawals impose great stress on the flow processes and sediment transport and result in the progressive decline in channel morphology habitat and ecosystem flow needs a critical research question in highly regulated river systems is regarding how the flow regime at the reach scale and the associated hydrogeomorphic variability can be systematically characterized identification of geomorphic thresholds at different scales and quantification of a hydrological and sediment connectivity in river systems b surface groundwater interaction and c e flow assessment for different reaches in each river basin are the major gaps in river science studies specific to indian river systems especially e flow assessment for different river basins using a holistic approach must be the leading area of river science research to aid management and policy making with the goal of enhancing water security relatively less studied peninsular rivers need more quantitative process based hydrogeomorphic studies and their application for e flow assessment keywords river science river health e flow geomorphic threshold connectivity indian rivers 1 introduction water security can be broadly defined as the availability of acceptable quality and quantity of water mainly for health livelihood and ecosystem services 3 since india is a country with a large population and rising water use demand it becomes essential to make water security strategies to avoid the over exploitation of the water resources in the future rivers shape a significant part of the terrestrial landscape their immense contribution to providing water cannot be neglected while addressing the issue of water security rivers are a significant water source in india and thereby ensuring their good health is essential the health of a river comprises many factors including its flow health good water quality and quantity stable surface groundwater interaction and its ability to adjust to small induced changes therefore addressing river health is an essential aspect of water security river health refers to the ability of the aquatic ecosystem to support and maintain critical ecological processes and a community of organisms with a species composition diversity and functional organization as comparable as possible to that of undisturbed habitats within the entire region 90 64 river ecosystems which are governed by hydro morphological processes operate in both the spatial and temporal scales 114 so to maintain healthy river ecosystems it is vital to consider various controls hydrogeomorphic processes and their scales of influence on the ecosystem response variables 77 the importance of river health highlighted the need for multidisciplinary approach s to study rivers which led to the emergence of river science river science is a multidisciplinary field 101 109 that primarily focuses on the interactions between the physical chemical and biological components within riverscapes at different scales 110 28 over the past few decades advancements in this field have paved the way towards new scientific knowledge and applications in the management of environmental flows eco geomorphology river health river rehabilitation and river hazards however rivers throughout the world have undergone substantial changes because of anthropogenic factors such as flow regulation disruption in sediment transport behavior excessive water withdrawals water pollution which degrades its quality while climate change is expected to further increase the uncertainty 8 116 river health across the globe has deteriorated over the years as a result of both natural and human induced factors these factors change water and sediment fluxes in river systems which finally lead to morphological and ecological changes however such process studies have not yet been assessed with an aim to define water security for river systems as the availability of sufficient water in river is fundamental to maintaining geomorphic and ecological state the water security in river systems should include the process understanding of the hydrogeomorphic system anthropogenic disturbances and climate change affect river health by changing the natural flow regime of the river system in various ways dams reservoirs or artificial levees can restrict the natural flow conditions of a river for example variations in the flow extremes disturb the patterns of sediment transport river connectivity nutrient availability and species growth and abundance which can adversely affect fragile biological communities 85 84 7 22 the building of artificial levees and other channelization structures can restrict the river flow and cause channel downcutting also they reduce channel migration and the formation of secondary channels 15 105 climatic changes may further cause significant impacts on rivers across the world 35 40 49 115 extreme climatic events can alter the geomorphic characters of riverine habitats by causing extreme floods 25 climate changes also causes many glaciers to retreat which may affect flow condition in many himalayan rivers in the future it may cause a reduction in river flow and lead to extensive water shortages 65 taken together these changes can result in pressing water security issues in the future water security has become a critical global concern in the twenty first century 38 both in terms of human use as well as in relation to the ecosystem hence there is a need to assess the impact of water stress on the health of the rivers this study reviews recent advances in hydrogeomorphic aspects of river science and their implications to understand the water security on river systems of india quality of available water in river systems is an equally important issue however degradation to water quality is a well known aspect hence the review is focused on a relatively lesser discussed issue of the hydrogeomorphic processes the hydrogeomorphic characteristics of rivers in india have degraded significantly because of anthropogenic disturbances 56 hydrological models with climate change scenarios project further changes in hydrological regimes 74 which may lead to changes in river morphology and hence to river ecology and river health the review critically assesses the water security concerns in the indian region through various aspects of river science and changing scenario of external controls and finally highlights major gaps in these studies 2 rivers in india the indian subcontinent is drained by river system classified into 18 major river basinsthat serve as a critical water resource of the country fig 1 a majority of indian rivers lie in the tropical setting where the average annual rainfall of 3893 billion cubic meters during the monsoon season 123 strongly influences the availability of water in these river systems the indian rivers are broadly divided into himalayan and peninsular rivers these are further characterized into 6 types based on landscape geological settings and river characteristics 1 large himalayan rivers 2 himalayan foothills fed rivers 3 north flowing cratonic rivers 4 west flowing peninsular rivers 5 east flowing peninsular rivers and 6 coastal rivers 58 the large himalayan rivers originate in the higher and tethys himalayas example being ganga yamuna ghaghra gandak and arun kosi river basins fig 2 these glacial fed rivers are perennial the himalayan foothill fed rivers originate from the siwalik and lesser himalayas some of which are the rapti ramganga kamla balan and bagmati river basins fig 2 where a large number of plains fed tributaries also feed the main channel during the monsoon months june september significant increases in the discharge in the large himalayan and foothill fed rivers lead to frequent flooding north flowing cratonic rivers constitute chambal betwa ken and son river basins the north flowing cratonic rivers receive greater than 85 of their annual discharge during the monsoon season peninsular india has both east and west flowing rivers which are dominantly bedrock incised fig 2 the west flowing narmada and tapi rivers drain into the arabian sea these two major west flowing peninsular rivers are mainly perennial rain fed the coastal and the east flowing peninsular rivers originate from the western ghats the east flowing krishna godavari and mahanadi rivers drain a larger area though a significant part of their basin area falls in the rain shadow zone these peninsular rivers are dominantly monsoon fed with moderate discharges in contrast to the himalayan rivers most of the peninsular rivers show higher variability due to their non perennial nature where the rainfall mainly governs the discharge in the river further the presence of various dams at upstream reaches have significantly reduced the water flow in these channels and part of the channels also get dry during the lean period 123 coastal rivers have small drainage basins fringing the eastern and western coastlines and are more prominent along the west coast of india fig 2 these rivers receive high rainfall 41 compared to other parts of peninsular india hence coastal rivers are characterized by higher discharge per unit area and have higher energy conditions compared to peninsular rivers apart from this some of the rivers flowing through the western india are categorized as inland drainage rivers and are dominantly ephemeral experiencing flow events of varying magnitude indian rivers broadly contribute to greater than 80 of india s total water resources with an average annual potential flow of 1870 km3 yr out of which 63 1180 km3 yr comes from himalayan rivers 70 101 the utilizable annual flow from all the rivers is 690 km3 yr about 50 320 km3 yr of which comes from the himalayan rivers 101 these data highlight the spatial variability of the contribution of rivers to water resources in india making some regions prone to flooding whereas others to drought or both an extensive river system coupled with monsoonal flows provides adequate water resources but the management problems need to be addressed in terms of water security especially during lean period 3 hydrology and river morphological characteristics water availability in river systems is the key to maintaining good health hydrological variability leads to geomorphic processes and morphodiversity which finally defines the habitat for biodiversity however this cause effect relationship between hydrology morphology ecology is not linear and the non linearity is governed by threshold and connectivity issues 82 55 an assessment of water security to maintain river health can be addressed in part through the framework of threshold and connectivity 3 1 threshold driven complex system threshold is defined as the transition that induces significant changes in the forms or processes of rivers 91 20 exceeding threshold conditions produces significant alterations in river characteristics and behavior hence threshold governs the non linear relationship between hydrology and geomorphology of a river a minor variation in the hydrology can cause a major change in the river morphology if the channel is close to the threshold or vice versa hence threshold is an important parameter to define water requirement in channel to maintain or to change the morphological condition of a river system it also determines river sensitivity and resilience to external hydrological changes 17 16 32 33 83 threshold in river systems exist at different scales 20 which indicates variability of river resilience to hydrological change across its tributaries and channel reaches spatio temporal variability in river sensitivity 108 highlights river systems as a complex dynamic system in response to hydrological change hence recognition of existing geomorphic threshold is essential in the river management strategies and to assess the future of indian rivers in response to the reduction in water availability 81 91 82 55 however identification of geomorphic threshold s for indian rives at different scales is a major knowledge gap a few examples of threshold based studies in india highlight the significance of threshold to understand the impact of hydrological change on river morphological state a good understanding of stream hydrology 52 and its future projections through climate and hydrological models are available for most of the indian rivers 74 however the future projections of geomorphic state is still a major research question 57 the hydrological changes impact the geomorphic system of rivers but the nature of river response is governed by the geomorphic threshold the last two decades witnessed a few studies to understand threshold mechanism on indian rivers at different scales at the site scale the avulsion threshold is critical to assessing river dynamics in response to hydrological changes avulsion threshold is governed by site scale processes but it eventually affects flooding at the downstream basin area variation in channel slope and super elevation condition at different sites have been used to explain threshold condition which leads to avulsion events during monsoon flow condition in the hyper avulsive baghmati river and the highly dynamic kosi river systems 53 100 further the impact of flooding on the sediment transport and channel morphology is also governed by non linear threshold based behavior larger flood events in the incised peninsular rivers led to significantly higher discharge above threshold values which caused transport of large boulders and major geomorphic work 62 63 authors have used the presence of large boulders in river channels to quantify stream power in large flood events which represents the power above threshold condition the work highlights the significance of threshold in defining the effectiveness of major flood on geomorphic processes habitat for riverine ecosystem at reach scale is defined by channel morphological patterns hence changes in channel pattern is a major research question at the reach scale in an initial study threshold for planform change in a river basin across braided meandering anabranching patterns was explained by factors like channel gradient width depth ratio and manning roughness in a foothill fed himalayan river systems 53 application of stream power concept leads to improved process understanding and hence process based identification of geomorphic threshold maximum flow efficiency mfe which is defined as the ratio of specific stream power transporting capacity and sediment flux variability 78 provides one such tool to study geomorphic threshold as a function of water availability it has been successfully applied to the yamuna river system to identify the threshold condition responsible for downstream variability in geomorphic change 6 this threshold based hydrogeomorphic analysis also highlighted the role of anthropogenic impacts on river morphodynamics as water availability along these reaches is strongly governed by human impacts water discharge also governs the channel width field data and application of the threshold theory 39 on meandering and braided threads of the ganga brahmaputra plains highlighted a similar relationship between discharge and channel width 37 36 it highlighted the same physical mechanism to set the width of alluvial channel threads hence change in hydrological regime may lead to further change in channel shape of alluvial channel threads and may be predicted for the channels in the ganga brahmaputra plains discharge requirement in a channel to maintain planform morphology should always be above the threshold condition at a regional scale stream power and sediment load data have been used to define the threshold for explaining hydrogeomorphic variability across major rivers of western and eastern ganga plains 53 103 these studies highlight that the impact of hydrological changes on river systems will be different across rivers basins and channel reaches all these case studies highlight the significance of threshold based studies to assess the role of hydrology on geomorphic changes therefore the threshold condition defines water security for the channel to maintain river health more such studies are needed from different rivers basins across different scales to have a better understanding of hydrology morphology relationship 3 2 hydrological connectivity in river systems and appraisal of river sensitivity to water security water availability at different scales i e basin to reach scale is governed by the hydrological connectivity basin scale changes in water budget such as change in water storage due to major engineering structure or land use and land cover lulc change can only lead to a significant change at reach or site scale stream hydrology at downstream reaches if the river system is well connected hydrological connectivity refers to the water mediated transfer of matter sediments energy and organisms in a river system 13 87 120 connectivity is conferred in three spatial dimensions namely longitudinal upstream downstream tributary trunk stream linkages lateral hillslope channel and floodplain channel linkages and vertical groundwater surface water linkages connectivity interactions of the spatial dimension over temporal scale imparts the fourth dimension to connectivity that results in non linearity of the river system 54 geomorphic connectivity governs the retention or storage of material fluxes water and sediments in the river system over varying time scale hydrologically connected river system allows the nutrient exchange and movement of species thus sustaining biodiversity and leading to a good river health by maintaining ecological integrity sediment connectivity affects the physical habitat template 121 by changing the geomorphological state it further affects the hydrological connectivity by potentially determining the water quality movement of water and nutrients on which different species depend 34 121 thus governing the overall river health disconnectivity can be introduced due to anthropogenic activities physical disconnectedness 118 in such scenarios the geomorphic threshold must be crossed to allow connectivity 118 natural disconnectivity in streams such as jamming by woods can cause flood hazards and bed scouring 119 alteration in flow regimes due to human induced disconnectivity such as the building of dams longitudinal disconnectivity channelization lateral disconnectivity and excessive groundwater extraction deep vertical disconnectivity causes geomorphic changes such as channel pattern change and can affect water availability for both ecological and human consumption 80 111 18 127 further channel floodplain lateral connectivity through flood pulses is also important to sustain river ecology as it enhances nutrient exchange between the river and terrestrial system however the construction of various embankments along alluvial rivers has led to decrease in lateral disconnection flow regulation tends to reduce river complexity and habitat heterogeneity changes to the natural flow regime its frequency and magnitude alter the habitat dynamics and have an adverse effect on the existing species that have adapted to the antecedent flow conditions riparian vegetation and create new conditions to which native biota may be poorly adapted 85 consequently this impacts the diversity and abundance of aquatic communities overall disconnectivity could make survival difficult for the indigenous species and can affect the whole food chain 97 the understanding of hydrological and geomorphic connectivity 97 in the indian river systems is still at its infancy 54 in general the rivers are fragmented because of various engineering structures across river basins 6 42 the decline in river discharge downstream of dams leads to a significant decline in hydrological connectivity and sediment transport and adversely affects channel morphology this has been observed at various reaches of major river systems namely yamuna river downstream of delhi ncr 6 and in peninsular rivers where 70 of sediment load has been blocked by dams 42 recently different approaches have been applied to estimate geomorphic connectivity mainly its hydrological connectivity component in various river basins table 1 dis connectivity of a river system further determines how it will respond to natural as well as human induced stresses and exemplifies river sensitivity the interactions and characterizations of connectivity further govern sensitivity hence quantitative assessment of hydrological connectivity 13 55 its magnitude duration frequency and the extent of dynamic connectivity i e spatio temporal dimensions determine the water availability and hydrological forcings which can lead to geomorphic and ecological changes connectivity in various hydrological systems in india is a major cause for concern as it affects the water availability in the rivers to meet the ecological environmental and societal water demand and hence plays an important role in water security 3 3 surface water groundwater connectivity the water flowing through the river and the groundwater system of the basin are in dynamic equilibrium any change in attribute of the river or the groundwater system is likely to affect this dynamic equilibrium 96 the river groundwater interactions and their dynamics are crucial for eco hydrology groundwater recharge and the availability of acceptable quality and quantity of water for sustainable use in the river channel overall climate topography geology lulc and biotic factors strongly influence surface and groundwater interactions 31 the alteration of hydraulic head due to anthropogenic impacts such as excessive groundwater abstraction leads to fall in the hydraulic head of aquifers when compared with nearby surface water and thus results in influent water losing streams 88 120 that can affect river discharge and river processes impacts of excessive groundwater extraction have been observed in the ganga plains for example the recent reduction in the summer flow of the ganga river has been attributed to the reduction in the base flow contribution to rivers by groundwater on account of the enhanced abstraction in the basin 72 76 further the overexploited aquifers of haryana state in the catchment of the yamuna river favors recharge from the rainfall leading to a reduced surface runoff joining the river and hence reduced monsoon flow of the river in the reach 6 the disappearance of a few streams in the tarai area of uttarakhand india 68 and lowering of the flow regime in the kali river ganga plains 66 are more examples of groundwater abstraction impacting river hydrology such drying up of smaller rivers can easily be prevented by a scientifically designed strategy for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater 93 base flow contribution is a major source of water in the river channel the annual base flow contribution of 0 5 million cubic meter 51 has been estimated for the rivers which are upstream of delhi palla stretch fig 3 anthropogenic forcing like water storage in barrage or dams locally changes the stream aquifer dynamics in the delhi stretch of yamuna river water storage in the wazirabad barrage leads to a change in the nature of the river from effluent gaining to influent 95 fig 3 in the context of geographic and climatic variations the groundwater recharge process and the surface groundwater dynamics in different parts of india were also elucidated using the stable isotope fingerprints 26 it has been observed that in the alluvial aquifers the isotopic characteristics of the groundwater remain the same even after movement of the groundwater for hundreds of kilometers over a time span of a few decades 43 further it was established based on comparing the isotopic signatures of the river and groundwater of the central indian peninsula that the base flow contribution from the shallow groundwater sustains the dry season flow of rivers 44 however the groundwater surface water relationship in peninsular india may vary through the season a modflow based modelling analysis of gowri hole sub catchment in peninsular india revealed a gaining nature of river during monsoon due to runoff which changes to a losing nature during post monsoon because of river leakage to aquifers 69 the losing nature of the stream is also responsible for river fragmentation during the summer period hence groundwater surface connectivity is essential to maintaining an active river channel especially in peninsular india the isotope data further provided quantitative information from peninsular indian rivers oxygen isotope fingerprints based estimates in the chaliyar river basin indicate about 15 of groundwater recharge by river water in lowland coastal areas during the post monsoon period and about 29 of groundwater recharge in the midland region 45 overall the geochemical and isotope based analysis highlights significant groundwater and surface water interactions and seasonal variability in different parts of india 73 9 61 67 the dependence of groundwater surface water interaction on rainfall variability reveals its sensitivity to climate change 48 groundwater contribution also governs the water quality in surface water 14 further the hyporheic zone mixing zone between river water and groundwater is crucial for the overall river health 47 11 vertical connectivity through the hyporheic zone influences the volume temperature and flow chemistry 122 it regulates the water quality and transfer of biophysical fluxes in the rivers these vertical connections are bi directional as upwelling and downwelling occur in gaining and losing streams river morphological factors such as the topography of river beds bed mobility and stream bed pressures and hydraulic conductivity govern these interactions 46 112 21 66 understanding the groundwater surfacewater gw sw interactions in a river basin is an important component in studying water security as it helps to assess the water quality climate change impacts and ecological functions 12 and thus the overall health of the river however gw dynamics in river studies are limited in indian river basins 4 e flow estimations on indian rivers gaps and challenges environmental flow e flow is the natural or regulated discharge of a particular quantity timing duration frequency and quality of water flow that is required to maintain the ecological integrity fig 4 of a river to sustain freshwater estuarine and near shore ecosystem 50 24 106 along with the allocation of water for aesthetic values socio economic and critical environment services 2 e flow represents the quid pro quo between water resources management and river basin development while maintaining a healthy flow regime 24 e flow assessments fall in four categories i hydrological ii hydraulic iii habitat simulations and iv holistic 107 holistic methods are robust and widely accepted these methods focus on maintaining the variability of the natural flow regime and assessing the flow requirement for the entire riverine ecosystems 1 71 126 maintaining the e flow within an acceptable extent of deviation from the natural flow regime allows the river to adjust to a new but sustainable dynamic equilibrium 94 thus preserving the entire river s health therefore e flow estimation is a fundamental process to analyze the water security of a river channel for maintaining river health holistic approaches for the assessment of e flow also represent a multidisciplinary approach to define water security estimation of e flow and its provisioning in the regulated rivers is essential to supporting ecological functioning and maintenance of river health while meeting the societal water demand 107 or demand for river rejuvenation 94 however e flow assessments in india are still in the early development stage mostly employing the hydrological method 30 and proposing minimum flow requirements of mean annual flow 10 day average and dry weather flow based on flow duration curve statistical analysis and tenant method table 2 these hydrology based estimates suggest e flow requirement as 10 15 of mean annual flow downstream of hydropower dams the holistic approach implemented for the ganga river basin includes building block methodology 125 and the modified bbm approach 106 involves determining the e flow based on eco geomorphological approach while considering the ecological requirements of keystone species which largely affects the ecosystem relative to its abundance the application of the modified bbm approach suggests e flow requirement during lean flow as 50 60 of the monthly average virgin flow in the hinterland mountains region of the ganga plains even though the flow during monsoon time is sufficient in the ganga river channel and only around 20 of the monthly average flow is required an e flow 106 e flow requirement during lean periods is significant similarly 50 60 of the virgin flow is suggested as e flow requirement for the yamuna river in the delhi ncr region by soni et al 104 based on sediment transport assessment and to maintain floodplain connectivity a recent notification from the government of india highlights flow requirement as 20 30 of monthly average flow 86 however maintaining such discharge values in river channels during the lean period is a challenge due to the overuse of surface water resources to meet the domestic and industrial water requirements in these stretches which leads to water stressed conditions in river channels during the lean period climate change can cause variability in rainfall as well as discharges from glacier melt hence predicting the e flow requirements based on future water availability using the climatic models of projected rainfall 27 and glacier water contributions becomes important e flow estimation of most of the other major rivers in peninsular and western india is unavailable 5 rivers and water security a synthesis anthropogenic disturbances have put a significant stress on rivers all over the world 116 8 which lead to the deterioration of river health the existence and proper functioning of rivers is essential for the survival of human society as the water can be utilized for domestic industrial agricultural and various other uses hence there is a need to understand the hydrological requirements of river systems to maintain their health these requirements commonly known as e flow should be an essential aspect of water security indian rivers such as ganga yamuna which drain the most populated landscapes are also characterized by significant stresses for example an ecological assessment of the ganga river showed that several of its reaches have been degraded 125 it was found that in some reaches the river dynamics was changed due to the construction of diversions while in other reaches inefficient utilization of freshwater resulted in a decreased assimilative capacity of the river most of the himalayan glaciers are retreating at different rates which will be another major hydrological stress on the himalayan rivers in the near future rivers such as kosi gandak and brahmaputra are continually affected due to frequent flooding bank erosion and channel siltation 117 53 89 102 19 further rivers in the peninsular india are different than the himalayan rivers most of the channels are not perennial and are also affected by engineering structures river fragmentation disconnectivity because of engineering structures is a major challenge to maintaining river health arid rivers are more stressed river channels because of the limited availability of water in the channel however e flow assessments are not available for any of these channels there is a need for a detailed hydrogeomorphic analysis of peninsular river systems and assessment of e flow through holistic approaches overall the need for rehabilitation of indian rivers is emerging due to the enhanced degradation of these rivers ecology is governed by habitat defined by hydro morphological attributes of river systems the data on the indian rivers indicates stressed condition as significantly less amount of water flows during the lean period which directly affects the river habitat further reduction in flow will also reduce the sediment transport and associated morphological processes as hydrology morphology process is a threshold driven system the direct impact of hydrological variation on channel morphology is difficult to assess the limited data indicates that the impact of flow regime changes deteriorates the river condition however this impact seems to differ between reaches and between river basins most of the rivers are fragmented because of the construction of several dams and barrages across the river channels the fragmented nature of channels will add to the spatial variability in water stressed conditions beyond the hydrogeomorphic condition of river system water quality is already known to be a major problem in most indian rivers for example flow in some of the major rivers like yamuna 92 ganga 113 and godavari 23 is highly polluted hence overall water quantity and water quality are major challenges to addressing the water security issue in river systems the recent advances in river science especially in hydrogeomorphic studies have strengthened multidisciplinary approaches to analyzing river health which have also helped in maintaining river health there is a need to assess e flow requirements at different reaches especially for reaches fragmented by engineering structures to support sustainable management practices for different river basins and to quantitatively assess the impact of anthropogenic disturbances quantification of e flow and its maintenance in river channels needs to be incorporated in policy frameworks to maintain the river health especially to preserve its ecological and geomorphological integrity 6 conclusions river science offers a comprehensive systematic and physically based basis for the characterization of the river flow regimes within the context of water security river science allows for a physically based characterization of the magnitude and timing of geomorphologic reaches of river systems in the face of uncertain weather climate variability river regulation and withdrawals and climate change in india recent advancements in river science generated new set of data for better characterization of flow regimes hydraulic geometry geomorphic conditions of river channels hydrological projections in different climate change scenario and land use changes improving our understanding of the water requirement for different functioning of river systems hence it will help to define water security for maintaining river health at reach and basin scale however there is a need to focus on the links between river health threshold values surface groundwater interaction e flow and river connectivity identification of geomorphic thresholds at different scales and quantification of a hydrological and sediment connectivity in river systems b surface groundwater interaction and its spatio temporal seasonal variability and c e flow for different reaches in each river basin are major challenges in river science studies studies in these areas will provide a process based quantitative relationship between hydrology and geomorphic conditions which will finally help in better allocation of water resources for the natural functioning of rivers and for the societal benefit in a sustainable way credit authorship contribution statement v jain conceptualization

20100,effective management of rivers and the maintenance of the integrity of linked biophysical systems require multidisciplinary approaches thus river science is a relatively new arena of scientific inquiry that focuses on problems of sustainable management of river systems and it actively integrates multiple scales and various concepts this paper presents a review of new developments in hydrogeomorphic processes understanding which are critical to assess water security for indian river systems indian rivers are under the influence of a diverse interplay of climatic geomorphic tectonic and anthropogenic forces and are broadly classified in terms of himalayan and peninsular rivers which can be further subdivided into 6 major types the himalayan rivers have received greater attention in comparison to rivers in peninsular india within the backdrop of changing climate an improved understanding of the interrelationships between hydrological morphological and ecological processes is the key to quantifying water security for indian rivers in the near future geomorphic threshold hydrological and sediment connectivity groundwater surfacewater gw sw interaction and environmental flow e flow assessment are the essential elements to understand the hydrology morphological ecological processes such studies have been initiated in indian river systems however these are still limited in number stream power distribution based approaches are frequently employed to understand hydrological controls on morphological processes and form in regulated and unregulated rivers as a majority of the himalayan rivers are hydrologically and morphologically disconnected due to large dams or barrages the result is a discontinuum of channel processes peninsular rivers are dominantly bedrock and highly regulated river systems which show significant short to long term flow variability and have tributaries which are not perennial disconnectivity due to extensive flow regulation and water withdrawals impose great stress on the flow processes and sediment transport and result in the progressive decline in channel morphology habitat and ecosystem flow needs a critical research question in highly regulated river systems is regarding how the flow regime at the reach scale and the associated hydrogeomorphic variability can be systematically characterized identification of geomorphic thresholds at different scales and quantification of a hydrological and sediment connectivity in river systems b surface groundwater interaction and c e flow assessment

process based hydrogeomorphic studies and their application for e flow assessment keywords river science river health e flow geomorphic threshold connectivity indian rivers 1 introduction water security can be broadly defined as the availability of acceptable quality and quantity of water mainly for health livelihood and ecosystem services 3 since india is a country with a large population and rising water use demand it becomes essential to make water security strategies to avoid the over exploitation of the water resources in the future rivers shape a significant part of the terrestrial landscape their immense contribution to providing water cannot be neglected while addressing the issue of water security rivers are a significant water source in india and thereby ensuring their good health is essential the health of a river comprises many factors including its flow health good water quality and quantity stable surface groundwater interaction and its ability to adjust to small induced changes therefore addressing river health is an essential aspect of water security river health refers to the ability of the aquatic ecosystem to support and maintain critical ecological processes and a community of organisms with a species composition diversity and functional organization as comparable as possible to that of undisturbed habitats within the entire region 90 64 river ecosystems which are governed by hydro morphological processes operate in both the spatial and temporal scales 114 so to maintain healthy river ecosystems it is vital to consider various controls hydrogeomorphic processes and their scales of influence on the ecosystem response variables 77 the importance of river health highlighted the need for multidisciplinary approach s to study rivers which led to the emergence of river science river science is a multidisciplinary field 101 109 that primarily focuses on the interactions between the physical chemical and biological components within riverscapes at different scales 110 28 over the past few decades advancements in this field have paved the way towards new scientific knowledge and applications in the management of environmental flows eco geomorphology river health river rehabilitation and river hazards however rivers throughout the world have undergone substantial changes because of anthropogenic factors such as flow regulation disruption in sediment transport behavior excessive water withdrawals water pollution which degrades its quality while climate change is expected to further increase the uncertainty 8 116 river health across the globe has deteriorated over the years as a result of both natural and human induced factors these factors change water and sediment fluxes in river systems which finally lead to morphological and ecological changes however such process studies have not yet been assessed with an aim to define water security for river systems as the availability of sufficient water in river is fundamental to maintaining geomorphic and ecological state the water security in river systems should include the process understanding of the hydrogeomorphic system anthropogenic disturbances and climate change affect river health by changing the natural flow regime of the river system in various ways dams reservoirs or artificial levees can restrict the natural flow conditions of a river for example variations in the flow extremes disturb the patterns of sediment transport river connectivity nutrient availability and species growth and abundance which can adversely affect fragile biological communities 85 84 7 22 the building of artificial levees and other channelization structures can restrict the river flow and cause channel downcutting also they reduce channel migration and the formation of secondary channels 15 105 climatic changes may further cause significant impacts on rivers across the world 35 40 49 115 extreme climatic events can alter the geomorphic characters of riverine habitats by causing extreme floods 25 climate changes also causes many glaciers to retreat which may affect flow condition in many himalayan rivers in the future it may cause a reduction in river flow and lead to extensive water shortages 65 taken together these changes can result in pressing water security issues in the future water security has become a critical global concern in the twenty first century 38 both in terms of human use as well as in relation to the ecosystem hence there is a need to assess the impact of water stress on the health of the rivers this study reviews recent advances in hydrogeomorphic aspects of river science and their implications to understand the water security on river systems of india quality of available water in river systems is an equally important issue however degradation to water quality is a well known aspect hence the review is focused on a relatively lesser discussed issue of the hydrogeomorphic processes the hydrogeomorphic characteristics of rivers in india have degraded significantly because of anthropogenic disturbances 56 hydrological models with climate change scenarios project further changes in hydrological regimes 74 which may lead to changes in river morphology and hence to river ecology and river health the review critically assesses the water security concerns in the indian region through various aspects of river science and changing scenario of external controls and finally highlights major gaps in these studies 2 rivers in india the indian subcontinent is drained by river system classified into 18 major river basinsthat serve as a critical water resource of the country fig 1 a majority of indian rivers lie in the tropical setting where the average annual rainfall of 3893 billion cubic meters during the monsoon season 123 strongly influences the availability of water in these river systems the indian rivers are broadly divided into himalayan and peninsular rivers these are further characterized into 6 types based on landscape geological settings and river characteristics 1 large himalayan rivers 2 himalayan foothills fed rivers 3 north flowing cratonic rivers 4 west flowing peninsular rivers 5 east flowing peninsular rivers and 6 coastal rivers 58 the large himalayan rivers originate in the higher and tethys himalayas example being ganga yamuna ghaghra gandak and arun kosi river basins fig 2 these glacial fed rivers are perennial the himalayan foothill fed rivers originate from the siwalik and lesser himalayas some of which are the rapti ramganga kamla balan and bagmati river basins fig 2 where a large number of plains fed tributaries also feed the main channel during the monsoon months june september significant increases in the discharge in the large himalayan and foothill fed rivers lead to frequent flooding north flowing cratonic rivers constitute chambal betwa ken and son river basins the north flowing cratonic rivers receive greater than 85 of their annual discharge during the monsoon season peninsular india has both east and west flowing rivers which are dominantly bedrock incised fig 2 the west flowing narmada and tapi rivers drain into the arabian sea these two major west flowing peninsular rivers are mainly perennial rain fed the coastal and the east flowing peninsular rivers originate from the western ghats the east flowing krishna godavari and mahanadi rivers drain a larger area though a significant part of their basin area falls in the rain shadow zone these peninsular rivers are dominantly monsoon fed with moderate discharges in contrast to the himalayan rivers most of the peninsular rivers show higher variability due to their non perennial nature where the rainfall mainly governs the discharge in the river further the presence of various dams at upstream reaches have significantly reduced the water flow in these channels and part of the channels also get dry during the lean period 123 coastal rivers have small drainage basins fringing the eastern and western coastlines and are more prominent along the west coast of india fig 2 these rivers receive high rainfall 41 compared to other parts of peninsular india hence coastal rivers are characterized by higher discharge per unit area and have higher energy conditions compared to peninsular rivers apart from this some of the rivers flowing through the western india are categorized as inland drainage rivers and are dominantly ephemeral experiencing flow events of varying magnitude indian rivers broadly contribute to greater than 80 of india s total water resources with an average annual potential flow of 1870 km3 yr out of which 63 1180 km3 yr comes from himalayan rivers 70 101 the utilizable annual flow from all the rivers is 690 km3 yr about 50 320 km3 yr of which comes from the himalayan rivers 101 these data highlight the spatial variability of the contribution of rivers to water resources in india making some regions prone to flooding whereas others to drought or both an extensive river system coupled with monsoonal flows provides adequate water resources but the management problems need to be addressed in terms of water security especially during lean period 3 hydrology and river morphological characteristics water availability in river systems is the key to maintaining good health hydrological variability leads to geomorphic processes and morphodiversity which finally defines the habitat for biodiversity however this cause effect relationship between hydrology morphology ecology is not linear and the non linearity is governed by threshold and connectivity issues 82 55 an assessment of water security to maintain river health can be addressed in part through the framework of threshold and connectivity 3 1 threshold driven complex system threshold is defined as the transition that induces significant changes in the forms or processes of rivers 91 20 exceeding threshold conditions produces significant alterations in river characteristics and behavior hence threshold governs the non linear relationship between hydrology and geomorphology of a river a minor variation in the hydrology can cause a major change in the river morphology if the channel is close to the threshold or vice versa hence threshold is an important parameter to define water requirement in channel to maintain or to change the morphological condition of a river system it also determines river sensitivity and resilience to external hydrological changes 17 16 32 33 83 threshold in river systems exist at different scales 20 which indicates variability of river resilience to hydrological change across its tributaries and channel reaches spatio temporal variability in river sensitivity 108 highlights river systems as a complex dynamic system in response to hydrological change hence recognition of existing geomorphic threshold is essential in the river management strategies and to assess the future of indian rivers in response to the reduction in water availability 81 91 82 55 however identification of geomorphic threshold s for indian rives at different scales is a major knowledge gap a few examples of threshold based studies in india highlight the significance of threshold to understand the impact of hydrological change on river morphological state a good understanding of stream hydrology 52 and its future projections through climate and hydrological models are available for most of the indian rivers 74 however the future projections of geomorphic state is still a major research question 57 the hydrological changes impact the geomorphic system of rivers but the nature of river response is governed by the geomorphic threshold the last two decades witnessed a few studies to understand threshold mechanism on indian rivers at different scales at the site scale the avulsion threshold is critical to assessing river dynamics in response to hydrological changes avulsion threshold is governed by site scale processes but it eventually affects flooding at the downstream basin area variation in channel slope and super elevation condition at different sites have been used to explain threshold condition which leads to avulsion events during monsoon flow condition in the hyper avulsive baghmati river and the highly dynamic kosi river systems 53 100 further the impact of flooding on the sediment transport and channel morphology is also governed by non linear threshold based behavior larger flood events in the incised peninsular rivers led to significantly higher discharge above threshold values which caused transport of large boulders and major geomorphic work 62 63 authors have used the presence of large boulders in river channels to quantify stream power in large flood events which represents the power above threshold condition the work highlights the significance of threshold in defining the effectiveness of major flood on geomorphic processes habitat for riverine ecosystem at reach scale is defined by channel morphological patterns hence changes in channel pattern is a major research question at the reach scale in an initial study threshold for planform change in a river basin across braided meandering anabranching patterns was explained by factors like channel gradient width depth ratio and manning roughness in a foothill fed himalayan river systems 53 application of stream power concept leads to improved process understanding and hence process based identification of geomorphic threshold maximum flow efficiency mfe which is defined as the ratio of specific stream power transporting capacity and sediment flux variability 78 provides one such tool to study geomorphic threshold as a function of water availability it has been successfully applied to the yamuna river system to identify the threshold condition responsible for downstream variability in geomorphic change 6 this threshold based hydrogeomorphic analysis also highlighted the role of anthropogenic impacts on river morphodynamics as water availability along these reaches is strongly governed by human impacts water discharge also governs the channel width field data and application of the threshold theory 39 on meandering and braided threads of the ganga brahmaputra plains highlighted a similar relationship between discharge and channel width 37 36 it highlighted the same physical mechanism to set the width of alluvial channel threads hence change in hydrological regime may lead to further change in channel shape of alluvial channel threads and may be predicted for the channels in the ganga brahmaputra plains discharge requirement in a channel to maintain planform morphology should always be above the threshold condition at a regional scale stream power and sediment load data have been used to define the threshold for explaining hydrogeomorphic variability across major rivers of western and eastern ganga plains 53 103 these studies highlight that the impact of hydrological changes on river systems will be different across rivers basins and channel reaches all these case studies highlight the significance of threshold based studies to assess the role of hydrology on geomorphic changes therefore the threshold condition defines water security for the channel to maintain river health more such studies are needed from different rivers basins across different scales to have a better understanding of hydrology morphology relationship 3 2 hydrological connectivity in river systems and appraisal of river sensitivity to water security water availability at different scales i e basin to reach scale is governed by the hydrological connectivity basin scale changes in water budget such as change in water storage due to major engineering structure or land use and land cover lulc change can only lead to a significant change at reach or site scale stream hydrology at downstream reaches if the river system is well connected hydrological connectivity refers to the water mediated transfer of matter sediments energy and organisms in a river system 13 87 120 connectivity is conferred in three spatial dimensions namely longitudinal upstream downstream tributary trunk stream linkages lateral hillslope channel and floodplain channel linkages and vertical groundwater surface water linkages connectivity interactions of the spatial dimension over temporal scale imparts the fourth dimension to connectivity that results in non linearity of the river system 54 geomorphic connectivity governs the retention or storage of material fluxes water and sediments in the river system over varying time scale hydrologically connected river system allows the nutrient exchange and movement of species thus sustaining biodiversity and leading to a good river health by maintaining ecological integrity sediment connectivity affects the physical habitat template 121 by changing the geomorphological state it further affects the hydrological connectivity by potentially determining the water quality movement of water and nutrients on which different species depend 34 121 thus governing the overall river health disconnectivity can be introduced due to anthropogenic activities physical disconnectedness 118 in such scenarios the geomorphic threshold must be crossed to allow connectivity 118 natural disconnectivity in streams such as jamming by woods can cause flood hazards and bed scouring 119 alteration in flow regimes due to human induced disconnectivity such as the building of dams longitudinal disconnectivity channelization lateral disconnectivity and excessive groundwater extraction deep vertical disconnectivity causes geomorphic changes such as channel pattern change and can affect water availability for both ecological and human consumption 80 111 18 127 further channel floodplain lateral connectivity through flood pulses is also important to sustain river ecology as it enhances nutrient exchange between the river and terrestrial system however the construction of various embankments along alluvial rivers has led to decrease in lateral disconnection flow regulation tends to reduce river complexity and habitat heterogeneity changes to the natural flow regime its frequency and magnitude alter the habitat dynamics and have an adverse effect on the existing species that have adapted to the antecedent flow conditions riparian vegetation and create new conditions to which native biota may be poorly adapted 85 consequently this impacts the diversity and abundance of aquatic communities overall disconnectivity could make survival difficult for the indigenous species and can affect the whole food chain 97 the understanding of hydrological and geomorphic connectivity 97 in the indian river systems is still at its infancy 54 in general the rivers are fragmented because of various engineering structures across river basins 6 42 the decline in river discharge downstream of dams leads to a significant decline in hydrological connectivity and sediment transport and adversely affects channel morphology this has been observed at various reaches of major river systems namely yamuna river downstream of delhi ncr 6 and in peninsular rivers where 70 of sediment load has been blocked by dams 42 recently different approaches have been applied to estimate geomorphic connectivity mainly its hydrological connectivity component in various river basins table 1 dis connectivity of a river system further determines how it will respond to natural as well as human induced stresses and exemplifies river sensitivity the interactions and characterizations of connectivity further govern sensitivity hence quantitative assessment of hydrological connectivity 13 55 its magnitude duration frequency and the extent of dynamic connectivity i e spatio temporal dimensions determine the water availability and hydrological forcings which can lead to geomorphic and ecological changes connectivity in various hydrological systems in india is a major cause for concern as it affects the water availability in the rivers to meet the ecological environmental and societal water demand and hence plays an important role in water security 3 3 surface water groundwater connectivity the water flowing through the river and the groundwater system of the basin are in dynamic equilibrium any change in attribute of the river or the groundwater system is likely to affect this dynamic equilibrium 96 the river groundwater interactions and their dynamics are crucial for eco hydrology groundwater recharge and the availability of acceptable quality and quantity of water for sustainable use in the river channel overall climate topography geology lulc and biotic factors strongly influence surface and groundwater interactions 31 the alteration of hydraulic head due to anthropogenic impacts such as excessive groundwater abstraction leads to fall in the hydraulic head of aquifers when compared with nearby surface water and thus results in influent water losing streams 88 120 that can affect river discharge and river processes impacts of excessive groundwater extraction have been observed in the ganga plains for example the recent reduction in the summer flow of the ganga river has been attributed to the reduction in the base flow contribution to rivers by groundwater on account of the enhanced abstraction in the basin 72 76 further the overexploited aquifers of haryana state in the catchment of the yamuna river favors recharge from the rainfall leading to a reduced surface runoff joining the river and hence reduced monsoon flow of the river in the reach 6 the disappearance of a few streams in the tarai area of uttarakhand india 68 and lowering of the flow regime in the kali river ganga plains 66 are more examples of groundwater abstraction impacting river hydrology such drying up of smaller rivers can easily be prevented by a scientifically designed strategy for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater 93 base flow contribution is a major source of water in the river channel the annual base flow contribution of 0 5 million cubic meter 51 has been estimated for the rivers which are upstream of delhi palla stretch fig 3 anthropogenic forcing like water storage in barrage or dams locally changes the stream aquifer dynamics in the delhi stretch of yamuna river water storage in the wazirabad barrage leads to a change in the nature of the river from effluent gaining to influent 95 fig 3 in the context of geographic and climatic variations the groundwater recharge process and the surface groundwater dynamics in different parts of india were also elucidated using the stable isotope fingerprints 26 it has been observed that in the alluvial aquifers the isotopic characteristics of the groundwater remain the same even after movement of the groundwater for hundreds of kilometers over a time span of a few decades 43 further it was established based on comparing the isotopic signatures of the river and groundwater of the central indian peninsula that the base flow contribution from the shallow groundwater sustains the dry season flow of rivers 44 however the groundwater surface water relationship in peninsular india may vary through the season a modflow based modelling analysis of gowri hole sub catchment in peninsular india revealed a gaining nature of river during monsoon due to runoff which changes to a losing nature during post monsoon because of river leakage to aquifers 69 the losing nature of the stream is also responsible for river fragmentation during the summer period hence groundwater surface connectivity is essential to maintaining an active river channel especially in peninsular india the isotope data further provided quantitative information from peninsular indian rivers oxygen isotope fingerprints based estimates in the chaliyar river basin indicate about 15 of groundwater recharge by river water in lowland coastal areas during the post monsoon period and about 29 of groundwater recharge in the midland region 45 overall the geochemical and isotope based analysis highlights significant groundwater and surface water interactions and seasonal variability in different parts of india 73 9 61 67 the dependence of groundwater surface water interaction on rainfall variability reveals its sensitivity to climate change 48 groundwater contribution also governs the water quality in surface water 14 further the hyporheic zone mixing zone between river water and groundwater is crucial for the overall river health 47 11 vertical connectivity through the hyporheic zone influences the volume temperature and flow chemistry 122 it regulates the water quality and transfer of biophysical fluxes in the rivers these vertical connections are bi directional as upwelling and downwelling occur in gaining and losing streams river morphological factors such as the topography of river beds bed mobility and stream bed pressures and hydraulic conductivity govern these interactions 46 112 21 66 understanding the groundwater surfacewater gw sw interactions in a river basin is an important component in studying water security as it helps to assess the water quality climate change impacts and ecological functions 12 and thus the overall health of the river however gw dynamics in river studies are limited in indian river basins 4 e flow estimations on indian rivers gaps and challenges environmental flow e flow is the natural or regulated discharge of a particular quantity timing duration frequency and quality of water flow that is required to maintain the ecological integrity fig 4 of a river to sustain freshwater estuarine and near shore ecosystem 50 24 106 along with the allocation of water for aesthetic values socio economic and critical environment services 2 e flow represents the quid pro quo between water resources management and river basin development while maintaining a healthy flow regime 24 e flow assessments fall in four categories i hydrological ii hydraulic iii habitat simulations and iv holistic 107 holistic methods are robust and widely accepted these methods focus on maintaining the variability of the natural flow regime and assessing the flow requirement for the entire riverine ecosystems 1 71 126 maintaining the e flow within an acceptable extent of deviation from the natural flow regime allows the river to adjust to a new but sustainable dynamic equilibrium 94 thus preserving the entire river s health therefore e flow estimation is a fundamental process to analyze the water security of a river channel for maintaining river health holistic approaches for the assessment of e flow also represent a multidisciplinary approach to define water security estimation of e flow and its provisioning in the regulated rivers is essential to supporting ecological functioning and maintenance of river health while meeting the societal water demand 107 or demand for river rejuvenation 94 however e flow assessments in india are still in the early development stage mostly employing the hydrological method 30 and proposing minimum flow requirements of mean annual flow 10 day average and dry weather flow based on flow duration curve statistical analysis and tenant method table 2 these hydrology based estimates suggest e flow requirement as 10 15 of mean annual flow downstream of hydropower dams the holistic approach implemented for the ganga river basin includes building block methodology 125 and the modified bbm approach 106 involves determining the e flow based on eco geomorphological approach while considering the ecological requirements of keystone species which largely affects the ecosystem relative to its abundance the application of the modified bbm approach suggests e flow requirement during lean flow as 50 60 of the monthly average virgin flow in the hinterland mountains region of the ganga plains even though the flow during monsoon time is sufficient in the ganga river channel and only around 20 of the monthly average flow is required an e flow 106 e flow requirement during lean periods is significant similarly 50 60 of the virgin flow is suggested as e flow requirement for the yamuna river in the delhi ncr region by soni et al 104 based on sediment transport assessment and to maintain floodplain connectivity a recent notification from the government of india highlights flow requirement as 20 30 of monthly average flow 86 however maintaining such discharge values in river channels during the lean period is a challenge due to the overuse of surface water resources to meet the domestic and industrial water requirements in these stretches which leads to water stressed conditions in river channels during the lean period climate change can cause variability in rainfall as well as discharges from glacier melt hence predicting the e flow requirements based on future water availability using the climatic models of projected rainfall 27 and glacier water contributions becomes important e flow estimation of most of the other major rivers in peninsular and western india is unavailable 5 rivers and water security a synthesis anthropogenic disturbances have put a significant stress on rivers all over the world 116 8 which lead to the deterioration of river health the existence and proper functioning of rivers is essential for the survival of human society as the water can be utilized for domestic industrial agricultural and various other uses hence there is a need to understand the hydrological requirements of river systems to maintain their health these requirements commonly known as e flow should be an essential aspect of water security indian rivers such as ganga yamuna which drain the most populated landscapes are also characterized by significant stresses for example an ecological assessment of the ganga river showed that several of its reaches have been degraded 125 it was found that in some reaches the river dynamics was changed due to the construction of diversions while in other reaches inefficient utilization of freshwater resulted in a decreased assimilative capacity of the river most of the himalayan glaciers are retreating at different rates which will be another major hydrological stress on the himalayan rivers in the near future rivers such as kosi gandak and brahmaputra are continually affected due to frequent flooding bank erosion and channel siltation 117 53 89 102 19 further rivers in the peninsular india are different than the himalayan rivers most of the channels are not perennial and are also affected by engineering structures river fragmentation disconnectivity because of engineering structures is a major challenge to maintaining river health arid rivers are more stressed river channels because of the limited availability of water in the channel however e flow assessments are not available for any of these channels there is a need for a detailed hydrogeomorphic analysis of peninsular river systems and assessment of e flow through holistic approaches overall the need for rehabilitation of indian rivers is emerging due to the enhanced degradation of these rivers ecology is governed by habitat defined by hydro morphological attributes of river systems the data on the indian rivers indicates stressed condition as significantly less amount of water flows during the lean period which directly affects the river habitat further reduction in flow will also reduce the sediment transport and associated morphological processes as hydrology morphology process is a threshold driven system the direct impact of hydrological variation on channel morphology is difficult to assess the limited data indicates that the impact of flow regime changes deteriorates the river condition however this impact seems to differ between reaches and between river basins most of the rivers are fragmented because of the construction of several dams and barrages across the river channels the fragmented nature of channels will add to the spatial variability in water stressed conditions beyond the hydrogeomorphic condition of river system water quality is already known to be a major problem in most indian rivers for example flow in some of the major rivers like yamuna 92 ganga 113 and godavari 23 is highly polluted hence overall water quantity and water quality are major challenges to addressing the water security issue in river systems the recent advances in river science especially in hydrogeomorphic studies have strengthened multidisciplinary approaches to analyzing river health which have also helped in maintaining river health there is a need to assess e flow requirements at different reaches especially for reaches fragmented by engineering structures to support sustainable management practices for different river basins and to quantitatively assess the impact of anthropogenic disturbances quantification of e flow and its maintenance in river channels needs to be incorporated in policy frameworks to maintain the river health especially to preserve its ecological and geomorphological integrity 6 conclusions river science offers a comprehensive systematic and physically based basis for the characterization of the river flow regimes within the context of water security river science allows for a physically based characterization of the magnitude and timing of geomorphologic reaches of river systems in the face of uncertain weather climate variability river regulation and withdrawals and climate change in india recent advancements in river science generated new set of data for better characterization of flow regimes hydraulic geometry geomorphic conditions of river channels hydrological projections in different climate change scenario and land use changes improving our understanding of the water requirement for different functioning of river systems hence it will help to define water security for maintaining river health at reach and basin scale however there is a need to focus on the links between river health threshold values surface groundwater interaction e flow and river connectivity identification of geomorphic thresholds at different scales and quantification of a hydrological and sediment connectivity in river systems b surface groundwater interaction and its spatio temporal seasonal variability and c e flow for different reaches in each river basin are major challenges in river science studies studies in these areas will provide a process based quantitative relationship between hydrology and geomorphic conditions which will finally help in better allocation of water resources for the natural functioning of rivers and for the societal benefit in a sustainable way credit authorship contribution statement v jain conceptualization

20101,drought is one of the complex and deleterious natural hazards that poses severe challenges to water security food production ecosystem and socio economic condition in india using efficient drought monitoring and assessment the severe impacts of drought can be reduced however drought monitoring and assessment are associated with large uncertainty due to different datasets methods drought indices and modeling approaches here we examine the sources of uncertainty in drought assessment using multiple observational and future projections datasets methods and hydrological models moreover we discuss potential ways to overcome the challenges associated with drought assessment in india the drought assessment without considering uncertainty may cause overestimation or underestimation of risk in the observed and projected future climate which further affects the planning and management of water resources therefore a thorough understanding of these challenges is essential to improve the existing drought monitoring and assessment approaches keywords drought challenges cmip6 hydrological model uncertainty human influence 1 introduction drought is a complex natural calamity which develops slowly and is difficult to monitor accurately 10 103 moreover a universal definition of drought does not exist due to the involvement of multiple hydroclimatic variables and stakeholders 9 44 43 65 106 since drought characteristics onset termination intensity and areal extent are difficult to be measured drought occurrence poses several challenges to water and food availability 46 63 57 leading to water scarcity crop failure forest fire economic and financial challenges migration and loss of life 21 28 40 63 75 82 93 for instance recent droughts in india have significantly affected water and food availability population and ecology 6 28 63 in india drought primarily occurs due to the deficit in the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr june to september in the last few decades ismr has weakened and caused increased drought frequency in some parts of india 1 34 58 for instance drought frequency has significantly increased over the indo gangetic plain in the post 1960 period 58 the increased drought frequency in the region is associated with increased warming and human activities during the observed climate 55 84 furthermore droughts under the future warming climate are projected to increase over india 4 5 23 62 which cause more severe challenges in the region to reduce the drought risk in the current and future climate reliable assessment and monitoring are essential in the country 1 4 86 however the use of multiple drought indices datasets methods and models contribute to uncertainty in drought assessment during the observed and future warming climate for instance a large number of drought indicators and drought indices are used to examine the intensity duration and areal extent of the drought at different time scale which contributes to considerable uncertainty 54 65 similarly there is significant uncertainty in the projections of future climate due to multiple global climate models gcms scenarios and initial conditions 3 20 66 111 apart from drought indices and datasets different potential evapotranspiration pet methods and hydrological models also trigger additional uncertainty 4 60 81 102 therefore addressing these challenges is essential for drought monitoring and assessment over india which can significantly affect the infrastructure design water resources management and policymaking challenges in the drought assessment initiate with the availability of long term quality controlled datasets and uncertainty in the different observed and future climate datasets further the challenges in drought assessment increase with the involvement of multiple methods and hydrological models to simulate other hydrological and climate variables in addition human activities also pose challenges in the assessment and monitoring of drought conditions for instance d shah et al 84 found that the indo gangetic plain shows less intense and severe droughts under the human water system than in the natural system overall challenges in drought monitoring and assessment due to the multiple datasets observations and future projections methods and hydrological models are not well examined in the indian context a better understanding of challenges in drought assessment is required using the multiple observational datasets projections from climate models cmip6 and lens data and scenarios multiple pet methods and hydrological models we estimate the uncertainty associated with drought assessment we discuss the possible ways to tackle the challenges associated with the drought assessment and monitoring over india 2 uncertainty in drought identification there are several methods to identify and define a drought condition 43 which vary from region to region and also with disciplines 65 105 recently mukherjee et al 65 categorized drought definitions into two categories conceptual and operational drought the conceptual drought definitions involve the physical process like precipitation soil moisture and water storage 53 65 106 however operational drought definitions focus on the drought episodes and drought severity 65 106 therefore numerous drought definitions cause large uncertainties and complexities for the stakeholders and end users 9 44 43 65 106 many countries adopted the conceptual drought definition using the regional rainfall pattern 90 india meteorological department imd defines drought in any area when rainfall deficiency is more than 25 with respect to the long term mean moreover if the area averaged rainfall of india is less than 10 of the long term mean with 20 areal extent the entire country is considered under drought drought normally starts with the deficit in precipitation called meteorological drought which further propagates into various types of droughts i e soil moisture agriculture streamflow hydrological drought and groundwater drought as time increases 10 however the interconnections among various types of droughts are difficult to monitor for any region therefore previous studies 1 86 used separate drought indices to estimate the different droughts like meteorological agriculture hydrological groundwater and socio economic drought for instance the two most common drought indices standardized precipitation index spi 48 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei 100 have been used to monitor meteorological drought similarly standardized runoff index sri 86 standardized soil moisture index ssi 25 and standardized groundwater index sgi 35 are commonly used for hydrological agriculture and groundwaterdrought respectively however the use of multiple drought indices shows different drought characteristics intensity severity and duration in an area at a time which causes difficulty in the identification and declaration of drought 9 65 83 we analyzed the meteorological drought using the two different spi and spei drought indices fig 1 fig 2 in the observed and future periods to determine the differences in drought estimates we find that spi underestimates the drought coverage compared to spei in observed and future warming climate fig 1 fig 2 since spi does not consider the role of atmospheric water demands 100 the areal extent of drought is less during the observed climate fig 1 moreover the area under drought based on spi is significantly lesser than spei in the projected future climate fig 2 which questions the reliability of drought projections based on spi under the warming climate like spi other drought indices may also show different drought estimations under the observed and projected future climate therefore a proper understanding of existing drought indices in drought assessment and monitoring is crucial for the identification and declaration of drought previously mukherjee et al 65 discussed the application and limitation of existing drought indices in the drought assessment moreover a joint drought index based on the multiple drought indices 26 47 has also been proposed 30 42 78 91 to consider the role of all type of droughts meteorological hydrological and agriculture in the drought assessment and monitoring d shah mishra 83 demonstrated that the integrated drought index idi based on the multiple drought indices could be used for drought monitoring and assessment over india moreover the joint drought index which captures the drought variability well can overcome the limitation of the existing drought indices 3 data related uncertainty besides the complexity of drought identification and declaration drought monitoring and assessment have also been a challenge due to the lack of long term observations over india data unavailability limits a complete description and understanding of the drought events and associated mechanisms the long term real time datasets of various hydrological variables are required for real time drought monitoring and assessment 1 86 apart from the data unavailability good quality datasets are also crucial for the drought assessment 90 usually observational datasets contain measurement preparation and instrumental errors 32 67 101 which influence temporal and spatial information of climatic extremes such as drought therefore data selection for the drought assessment and monitoring is crucial for a better understanding of drought various hydrological and climate datasets have been used for drought assessment during the current and future climate for instance either only precipitation for spi or a combination of multiple climate variables i e precipitation temperature wind and humidity for spei are used for the meteorological drought assessment similarly soil moisture runoff and groundwater data are used for agricultural hydrological and groundwater droughts respectively at present multiple global and regional observed datasets are available for india 29 71 88 94 104 107 which have been widely used for drought monitoring and assessment 1 3 60 83 to demonstrate the data related uncertainty in drought assessment during the observed climate figure 1 figure s1 section 3 1 we obtained long term observed precipitation and temperature from imd 71 94 climatic research unit cru v4 02 29 princeton data 88 university of delaware udel v5 01 38 and watch forcing data era interim wfdei 104 for the period 1951 2016 these observed datasets are developed using different interpolation and regriding methods considering the station reanalysis and satellite products 6 58 72 more information about observational datasets can be obtained from previous studies 29 38 71 88 94 104 107 the gridded precipitation and temperature datasets can also be used for the real time drought monitoring system 86 over india to provide drought early warning however long term observed streamflow soil moisture and groundwater datasets are unavailable in india to obtain the long term streamflow soil moisture and groundwater datasets land surface or hydrological models are used with the inputs of precipitation temperature and other static variable datasets however simulated variables using hydrological models can have limitations for drought monitoring and assessment 6 45 86 other than observed datasets we also obtained monthly precipitation pr mean air temperature tas latent heat flux hfls and sensible heat flux hfss data from 16 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 gcms 19 table s1 for four shared socioeconomic pathways ssp1

demonstrate the challenges in drought risk assessment during the future warming climate section 3 2 more details about future datasets are available in aadhar mishra 4 5 3 1 observed datasets we evaluated the multiple observed precipitation and temperature datasets from cru imd udel princeton and wfdei over india to examine the data related uncertainty in drought assessment during the observed period 1951 2016 since the majority of gridded observed datasets from cru imd udel princeton and wfdei include different stations reanalysis and satellite products during the data development processes these datasets show large inconsistencies figure s1 moreover inconsistencies in gridded precipitation and temperature cru imd udel princeton and wfdei are also associated with different interpolation and regridding methods 6 we found differences in the drought frequency and areal extent during the observed period 1951 2016 that can be attributed to differences in the precipitation and temperature datasets fig 1 for instance drought frequency based on spi varied between 17 and 21 among the five datasets where the lowest 17 and highest 21 droughts occurred in imd and princeton datasets respectively moreover the frequency of drought based on intensity also varied in different datasets we found the maximum number of exceptional droughts spi 2 in imd observations however udel and wfdei datasets showed only one exceptional drought event during the period 1951 2016 fig 1a like spi based drought assessment drought frequency and areal extent also varied in spei among all five observational datasets overall all the five datasets cru imd udel princeton and wfdei showed considerable uncertainty in the drought characteristics intensity and areal extent which results less confidence in the drought assessment and monitoring based on a single dataset aadhar mishra 6 suggested to opt all the available observation datasets for the drought assessment and consider maximum and minimum values of drought risk for further assessment infrastructure design and water management additionally there is an urgent need to explore new high resolution datasets with high quality control to improve the drought assessment many states and other agencies in india also collect meteorological datasets with collaboration and improved data sharing mechanisms a standard high quality dataset can be developed further newly developed datasets can be used to calibrate and evaluate hydrological and land surface models 3 2 future projections increased warming and weakening of the indian summer monsoon rainfall have posed several challenges for water and food availability during the observed period in india 55 63 with the increasing global warming the drought risk has accelerated 17 79 92 therefore it is crucial to evaluate the drought risk during the future warming climate for food and water management in one of the most populated regions global climate models gcms provide the opportunity to examine drought assessment in the future 18 35 95 however future climate projections are associated with considerable uncertainties 3 33 49 99 arising from multiple gcms scenarios and internal climate variability figure s2 table s2 as a result previous studies 14 22 39 41 74 97 110 showed the contradiction in the future drought projections for instance dai 14 lehner et al 39 and zhao dai 110 reported a decrease in the drought risk in india however an increase in the drought frequency under the future warming climate has been reported 22 41 74 97 overall gcm datasets have considerable uncertainty in the future drought risk projections 3 5 other than the use of multiple drought indices discussed in the previous section and methods to estimate the pet which will discuss in the next section using the 16 cmip6 datasets with four shared socio economic pathways ssps scenarios and 40 members of lens datasets we show the inconsistency in the area under drought for the future climate fig 2 the future datasets gcms ssps and ensemble members show a large uncertainty in the drought projection fig 2 uncertainty in the drought projections based on the multiple gcms is higher than the uncertainty due to the different scenarios and internal climate variability fig 2a b the different ssps scenarios show a small difference in the areal extent of drought projection fig 2c d moreover our analysis also indicates a considerable role of internal climate variability in the drought projection fig 2e f overall our results highlight the challenges in the drought projection due to the multiple gcms scenarios and initial climate conditions to reduce the uncertainty in the future drought projections previous studies 3 6 suggested to use better performing gcms high skill gcms or best gcms which capture the critical monsoon features and show less bias during the historical climate 3 6 for the future drought projections as the majority of gcms are unable to capture the summer monsoon features i e seasonality onset timing of monsoon intensity and show a significant bias 7 66 77 other than the model selection approach further improvements in the physics of gcms are also needed for the better representation of monsoon precipitation cloud formation and convective precipitation 7 11 77 89 in addition proper representation of human activities i e land use land cover in global climate models will improve the feedback and interaction between land and atmosphere which will reduce the uncertainty in the drought assessment for the future climate 12 4 uncertainty in methods and modeling long term data of various hydrological and climate variables are required for the drought monitoring and assessment however long term datasets are not available over india except for a few climatic variables i e precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature for example evaporation streamflow groundwater and soil moisture data are available only for a short period and at a few locations which hinders the drought assessment and monitoring across the country moreover many river basins ganga brahmaputra and indus in india share the international boundary therefore data is restricted for these basins to obtain the evapotranspiration runoff and soil moisture data for the ungauged remote location we use different pet methods and hydrological models these different pet methods and hydrological models are associated with uncertainty due to different parametrization and model structures which cause an additional source of uncertainty other than datasets in the drought assessment and monitoring therefore it is important to discuss the drought uncertainty due to different pet methods and hydrological models 4 1 pet methods potential evapotranspiration pet is used to estimate the meteorological drought index spei based on the available water difference between precipitation and pet the spei considers the role of both precipitation and temperature in the drought assessment unlike spi there are multiple methods in the literature to estimate the pet 27 52 64 73 80 96 98 108 109 which contribute significant uncertainty for instance previous studies 16 109 found a considerable difference in the pet estimation to examine the challenges associated with drought monitoring and assessment due to pet methods we analyzed five different pet methods for the drought assessment using the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis version 5 era5 data for the observed period 1979 2018 and cmip5 data for the future period fig 3 thornthwaite method 96 hargreaves samani method 27 penman monteith method 64 73 energy based method 52 and modified penman monteith method 108 were used fig 3 these methods have been widely used to estimate the drought for the observed and future climate 4 15 23 56 87 more details about pet methods can be obtained from hargreaves samani 27 milly dunne 52 monteith 64 penman 73 thornthwaite 96 yang et al 108 using the five different pet methods we estimated spei during the observed 1980 2019 and future period 2011 2100 fig 3 we found no significant difference in drought frequency and area during the observed period fig 3a b however pet methods showed significant uncertainty in the drought assessment during the projected future climate fig 3c d for instance the projection of drought frequency and areal extent based on the thornthwaite method was significantly higher than the other methods moreover hargreaves samani and penman monteith methods also projected higher drought frequency and areal extent compared to energy based and modified penman monteith methods these inconsistencies in drought projections are mainly associated with the temperature sensitivity of the pet method 4 since the thornthwaite method solely depends on the temperature pet estimated using the thornthwaite method is highly sensitive to temperature and shows a higher drought risk in the warming climate 4 56 moreover unlike the other methods the recently developed modified penman monteith method considers the changes in the stomatal conductance due to increased global mean co2 concentration and shows a reliable drought projection 4 108 overall previous studies 4 56 108 suggest that the energy based method and modified penman monteith should be used for future drought assessment to estimate the pet 4 2 hydrological modeling to obtain the long term data for various hydrological components we use hydrological and land surface models to simulate the hydrological variables runoff soil moisture groundwater level for the ungauged locations for the observed and future period multiple hydrological models are available to simulate runoff and soil moisture for drought however hydrological models are sensitive to multiple processes initial conditions and parameterization 51 59 61 for instance melsen and guse 51 showed that the model structure controls the parameter sensitivity of hydrological models during the drought assessment moreover before using a hydrological model we also require the calibration and validation of the model against the observed datasets using standard matrices i e nash sutcliffe efficiency nse bias coefficient of determination etc overall drought assessment using the hydrological model outputs is uncertain due to the large differences in parameterization and model structures we used runoff data from five hydrological models variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1996 h08 h zero 8 24 community land model clm3 0 70 noah multi parameterization noah mp 69 and community water model cwatm 13 over india during the period 1951 2016 fig 4 to evaluate the uncertainty in drought assessment related to the multiple hydrological models more information on hydrological modeling and calibration can be obtained from kushwaha et al 37 using the runoff data from the multiple hydrological models we estimated the standardized runoff index sri for the drought assessment fig 4 based on the sri drought index we found a large difference in the drought frequency among the multiple hydrological models during the period 1951 2016 h08 model simulated the lowest drought frequency over india during the observed period 1951 2016 while cwatm simulated the highest drought frequency overall the hydrological model showed large uncertainty in the drought intensity and areal extent over india fig 4 to tackle the uncertainty from different hydrological models novel calibration strategies are needed moreover hydrological models should be selected based on their performance to simulate the drought conditions 5 human influence a majority of hydrological and land surface models individual and in gcms do not consider the role of human activities i e reservoir operation groundwater abstraction land use land cover change in estimating water budget components which can have a significant impact on the drought assessment and monitoring in the region during the observed and future climate for instance h l shah et al 85 showed that reservoir operations and irrigation had modulated the water budget components in india these modulations in the water budget cause contrasting influences on the hydrological and agriculture droughts 84 due to human activities the intensity of agricultural droughts has decreased over india however hydrological droughts have increased 84 the increased human activities have also affected the groundwater level across india 8 50 asoka mishra 8 showed that anthropogenic activities are the major contributor to groundwater changes over most parts of the country which could modulate the drought conditions in the region to understand the influence of human activities on groundwater drought we used the groundwater level data from the natural system using the vic simgm simulation and the human water system to obtain the groundwater data in the natural system we performed the simulations in the variable infiltration capacity simple groundwater model vic simgm 68 76 using the meteorological forcing precipitation temperature and wind however groundwater data for the coupled human water system were obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite using the groundwater levels from the vic simgm and grace we estimated the standardized groundwater index sgi for the drought assessment fig 5 we found that the drought frequency and areal extent based on the vic simgm and grace are significantly different during 2002 2019 for instance drought frequency and areal extent based on the grace data are higher than the drought condition based on vic simgm in the recent period which suggests an intensification of drought conditions in the recent climate due to the increased human activities fig 5 overall the increased human activities have significantly changed the drought condition in the region therefore it is necessary to include human influence in the hydrological modeling 6 summary and future directions india is vulnerable to droughts due to its large population and agriculture driven economy in the last few decades the frequency of severe droughts has increased in india causing several challenges to agricultural production and water availability moreover intense and long lasting droughts are likely to occur in the future climate severe droughts that occurred during the observed climate had considerable impacts on india s surface and groundwater resources agricultural production and economic growth therefore understanding the drought monitoring and assessment challenges in the observed and projected future warming climate is essential to obtain reliable information on drought and minimize the negative impact our study discusses the four major challenges associated with drought monitoring and assessment those challenges are related to drought identification data methods and modeling and human influence on drought characteristics additionally we also discuss the potential ways to reduce these challenges in india identification and declaration of drought pose several difficulties in the drought assessment and monitoring due to the multiple drought indices using the joint drought indices like integrated drought index we can better understand the drought characteristics additional to the drought identification limited data availability and uncertainty among datasets also make drought assessment inconsistent in the observed and future climate limited data availability restricts the understanding of drought propagation and occurrence to address the drought risk uncertainty in the observed datasets we must include the uncertainty of available reliable datasets by considering the minimum and maximum severity values during the infrastructure design and water management moreover data quality and availability during the observational period can be improved using the new satellite datasets crowdsourcing and data sharing between different agencies unlike observed datasets for the future datasets we need to identify the better performing gcms based on the performance during the historical climate for the drought assessment moreover more efforts are required to improve the physical mechanisms of cloud formation monsoon features and convection schemes in the gcms the feedback and interaction between land and atmosphere in gcms can be improved by considering anthropogenic factors in future climate modeling through land surface models other than future datasets an appropriate method i e modified penman monteith method or energy based method should be used to estimate pet in the warming climate which does not overestimate the drought risk in the future climate we need to develop a framework for selecting a reliable hydrological model that can capture the drought mechanism well during the observed and future climate also the hydrological model should be able to represent human activity often we neglect the coupled behavior of human water systems due to data unavailability however we need to explore new datasets using remote sensing or any advanced methods for the proper representation of human activities disclosure statement given their role as guest editor vimal mishra had no involvement in the peer review of

20101,drought is one of the complex and deleterious natural hazards that poses severe challenges to water security food production ecosystem and socio economic condition in india using efficient drought monitoring and assessment the severe impacts of drought can be reduced however drought monitoring and assessment are associated with large uncertainty due to different datasets methods drought indices and modeling approaches here we examine the sources of uncertainty in drought assessment using multiple observational and future projections datasets methods and hydrological models moreover we discuss potential ways to overcome the challenges associated with drought assessment in india the drought assessment without considering uncertainty may cause overestimation or underestimation of risk in the observed and projected future climate which further affects the planning and management of water resources therefore a thorough understanding of these challenges is essential to improve the existing drought monitoring and assessment approaches keywords drought challenges cmip6 hydrological model uncertainty human influence 1 introduction drought is a complex natural calamity which develops slowly and is difficult to monitor accurately 10 103 moreover a universal definition of drought does not exist due to the involvement of multiple hydroclimatic variables and stakeholders 9 44 43 65 106 since drought characteristics onset termination intensity and areal extent are difficult to be measured drought occurrence poses several challenges to water and food availability 46 63 57 leading to water scarcity crop failure forest fire economic and financial challenges migration and loss of life 21 28 40 63 75 82 93 for instance recent droughts in india have significantly affected water and food availability population and ecology 6 28 63 in india drought primarily occurs due to the deficit in the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr june to september in the last few decades ismr has weakened and caused increased drought frequency in some parts of india 1 34 58 for instance drought frequency has significantly increased over the indo gangetic plain in the post 1960 period 58 the increased drought frequency in the region is associated with increased warming and human activities during the observed climate 55 84 furthermore droughts under the future warming climate are projected to increase over india 4 5 23 62 which cause more severe challenges in the region to reduce the drought risk in the current and future climate reliable assessment and monitoring are essential in the country 1 4 86 however the use of multiple drought indices datasets methods and models contribute to uncertainty in drought assessment during the observed and future warming climate for instance a large number of drought indicators and drought indices are used to examine the intensity duration and areal extent of the drought at different time scale which contributes to considerable uncertainty 54 65 similarly there is significant uncertainty in the projections of future climate due to multiple global climate models gcms scenarios and initial conditions 3 20 66 111 apart from drought indices and datasets different potential evapotranspiration pet methods and hydrological models also trigger additional uncertainty 4 60 81 102 therefore addressing these challenges is essential for drought monitoring and assessment over india which can significantly affect the infrastructure design water resources management and policymaking challenges in the drought assessment initiate with the availability of long term quality controlled datasets and uncertainty in the different observed and future climate datasets further the challenges in drought assessment increase with the involvement of multiple methods and hydrological models to simulate other hydrological and climate variables in addition human activities also pose challenges in the assessment and monitoring of drought conditions for instance d shah et al 84 found that the indo gangetic plain shows less intense and severe droughts under the human water system than in the natural system overall challenges in drought monitoring and assessment due to the multiple datasets observations and future projections methods and hydrological models are not well examined in the indian context a better understanding of challenges in drought assessment is required using the multiple observational datasets projections from climate models cmip6 and lens data and scenarios multiple pet methods and hydrological models we estimate the uncertainty associated with drought assessment we discuss the possible ways to tackle the challenges associated with the drought assessment and monitoring over india 2 uncertainty in drought identification there are several methods to identify and define a drought condition 43 which vary from region to region and also with disciplines 65 105 recently mukherjee et al 65 categorized drought definitions into two categories conceptual and operational drought the conceptual drought definitions involve the physical process like precipitation soil moisture and water storage 53 65 106 however operational drought definitions focus on the drought episodes and drought severity 65 106 therefore numerous drought definitions cause large uncertainties and complexities for the stakeholders and end users 9 44 43 65 106 many countries adopted the conceptual drought definition using the regional rainfall pattern 90 india meteorological department imd defines drought in any area when rainfall deficiency is more than 25 with respect to the long term mean moreover if the area averaged rainfall of india is less than 10 of the long term mean with 20 areal extent the entire country is considered under drought drought normally starts with the deficit in precipitation called meteorological drought which further propagates into various types of droughts i e soil moisture agriculture streamflow hydrological drought and groundwater drought as time increases 10 however the interconnections among various types of droughts are difficult to monitor for any region therefore previous studies 1 86 used separate drought indices to estimate the different droughts like meteorological agriculture hydrological groundwater and socio economic drought for instance the two most common drought indices standardized precipitation index spi 48 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei 100 have been used to monitor meteorological drought similarly standardized runoff index sri 86 standardized soil moisture index ssi 25 and standardized groundwater index sgi 35 are commonly used for hydrological agriculture and groundwaterdrought respectively however the use of multiple drought indices shows different drought characteristics intensity severity and duration in an area at a time which causes difficulty in the identification and declaration of drought 9 65 83 we analyzed the meteorological drought using the two different spi and spei drought indices fig 1 fig 2 in the observed and future periods to determine the differences in drought estimates we find that spi underestimates the drought coverage compared to spei in observed and future warming climate fig 1 fig 2 since spi does not consider the role of atmospheric water demands 100 the areal extent of drought is less during the observed climate fig 1 moreover the area under drought based on spi is significantly lesser than spei in the projected future climate fig 2 which questions the reliability of drought projections based on spi under the warming climate like spi other drought indices may also show different drought estimations under the observed and projected future climate therefore a proper understanding of existing drought indices in drought assessment and monitoring is crucial for the identification and declaration of drought previously mukherjee et al 65 discussed the application and limitation of existing drought indices in the drought assessment moreover a joint drought index based on the multiple drought indices 26 47 has also been proposed 30 42 78 91 to consider the role of all type of droughts meteorological hydrological and agriculture in the drought assessment and monitoring d shah mishra 83 demonstrated that the integrated drought index idi based on the multiple drought indices could be used for drought monitoring and assessment over india moreover the joint drought index which captures the drought variability well can overcome the limitation of the existing drought indices 3 data related uncertainty besides the complexity of drought identification and declaration drought monitoring and assessment have also been a challenge due to the lack of long term observations over india data unavailability limits a complete description and understanding of the drought events and associated mechanisms the long term real time datasets of various hydrological variables are required for real time drought monitoring and assessment 1 86 apart from the data unavailability good quality datasets are also crucial for the drought assessment 90 usually observational datasets contain measurement preparation and instrumental errors 32 67 101 which influence temporal and spatial information of climatic extremes such as drought therefore data selection for the drought assessment and monitoring is crucial for a better understanding of drought various hydrological and climate datasets have been used for drought assessment during the current and future climate for instance either only precipitation for spi or a combination of multiple climate variables i e precipitation temperature wind and humidity for spei are used for the meteorological drought assessment similarly soil moisture runoff and groundwater data are used for agricultural hydrological and groundwater droughts respectively at present multiple global and regional observed datasets are available for india 29 71 88 94 104 107 which have been widely used for drought monitoring and assessment 1 3 60 83 to demonstrate the data related uncertainty in drought assessment during the observed climate figure 1 figure s1 section 3 1 we obtained long term observed precipitation and temperature from imd 71 94 climatic research unit cru v4 02 29 princeton data 88 university of delaware udel v5 01 38 and watch forcing data era interim wfdei 104 for the period 1951 2016 these observed datasets are developed using different interpolation and regriding methods considering the station reanalysis and satellite products 6 58 72 more information about observational datasets can be obtained from previous studies 29 38 71 88 94 104 107 the gridded precipitation and temperature datasets can also be used for the real time drought monitoring system 86 over india to provide drought early warning however long term observed streamflow soil moisture and groundwater datasets are unavailable in india to obtain the long term streamflow soil moisture and groundwater datasets land surface or hydrological models are used with the inputs of precipitation temperature and other static variable datasets however simulated variables using hydrological models can have limitations for drought monitoring and assessment 6 45 86 other than observed datasets we also obtained monthly precipitation pr

confidence in the drought assessment and monitoring based on a single dataset aadhar mishra 6 suggested to opt all the available observation datasets for the drought assessment and consider maximum

the projection of drought frequency and areal extent based on the thornthwaite method was significantly higher than the other methods moreover hargreaves samani and penman monteith methods also

period 1951 2016 h08 model simulated the lowest drought frequency over india during the observed period 1951 2016 while cwatm simulated the highest drought frequency overall the hydrological model showed large uncertainty in the drought intensity and areal extent over india fig 4 to tackle the uncertainty from different hydrological models novel calibration strategies are needed moreover hydrological models should be selected based on their performance to simulate the drought conditions 5 human influence a majority of hydrological and land surface models individual and in gcms do not consider the role of human activities i e reservoir operation groundwater abstraction land use land cover change in estimating water budget components which can have a significant impact on the drought assessment and monitoring in the region during the observed and future climate for instance h l shah et al 85 showed that reservoir operations and irrigation had modulated the water budget components in india these modulations in the water budget cause contrasting influences on the hydrological and agriculture droughts 84 due to human activities the intensity of agricultural droughts has decreased over india however hydrological droughts have increased 84 the increased human activities have also affected the groundwater level across india 8 50 asoka mishra 8 showed that anthropogenic activities are the major contributor to groundwater changes over most parts of the country which could modulate the drought conditions in the region to understand the influence of human activities on groundwater drought we used the groundwater level data from the natural system using the vic simgm simulation and the human water system to obtain the groundwater data in the natural system we performed the simulations in the variable infiltration capacity simple groundwater model vic simgm 68 76 using the meteorological forcing precipitation temperature and wind however groundwater data for the coupled human water system were obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite using the groundwater levels from the vic simgm and grace we estimated the standardized groundwater index sgi for the drought assessment fig 5 we found that the drought frequency and areal extent based on the vic simgm and grace are significantly different during 2002 2019 for instance drought frequency and areal extent based on the grace data are higher than the drought condition based on vic simgm in the recent period which suggests an intensification of drought conditions in the recent climate due to the increased human activities fig 5 overall the increased human activities have significantly changed the drought condition in the region therefore it is necessary to include human influence in the hydrological modeling 6 summary and future directions india is vulnerable to droughts due to its large population and agriculture driven economy in the last few decades the frequency of severe droughts has increased in india causing several challenges to agricultural production and water availability moreover intense and long lasting droughts are likely to occur in the future climate severe droughts that occurred during the observed climate had considerable impacts on india s surface and groundwater resources agricultural production and economic growth therefore understanding the drought monitoring and assessment challenges in the observed and projected future warming climate is essential to obtain reliable information on drought and minimize the negative impact our study discusses the four major challenges associated with drought monitoring and assessment those challenges are related to drought identification data methods and modeling and human influence on drought characteristics additionally we also discuss the potential ways to reduce these challenges in india identification and declaration of drought pose several difficulties in the drought assessment and monitoring due to the multiple drought indices using the joint drought indices like integrated drought index we can better understand the drought characteristics additional to the drought identification limited data availability and uncertainty among datasets also make drought assessment inconsistent in the observed and future climate limited data availability restricts the understanding of drought propagation and occurrence to address the drought risk uncertainty in the observed datasets we must include the uncertainty of available reliable datasets by considering the minimum and maximum severity values during the infrastructure design and water management moreover data quality and availability during the observational period can be improved using the new satellite datasets crowdsourcing and data sharing between different agencies unlike observed datasets for the future datasets we need to identify the better performing gcms based on the performance during the historical climate for the drought assessment moreover more efforts are required to improve the physical mechanisms of cloud formation monsoon features and convection schemes in the gcms the feedback and interaction between land and atmosphere in gcms can be improved by considering anthropogenic factors in future climate modeling through land surface models other than future datasets an appropriate method i e modified penman monteith method or energy based method should be used to estimate pet in the warming climate which does not overestimate the drought risk in the future climate we need to develop a framework for selecting a reliable hydrological model that can capture the drought mechanism well during the observed and future climate also the hydrological model should be able to represent human activity often we neglect the coupled behavior of human water systems due to data unavailability however we need to explore new datasets using remote sensing or any advanced methods for the proper representation of human activities disclosure statement given their role as guest editor vimal mishra had no involvement in the peer review of

20102,in india artificial recharge ar of aquifers is considered a primary supply side measure to combat the widespread over exploitation of groundwater as a major collateral benefit of rainwater harvesting rwh is aquifer rejuvenation both rainwater harvesting and ar are planned and executed as a set of coherent interventions the central and state governments have brought in several schemes involving ar and rwh moreover a number of researches are being conducted on how to select the sites for structure construction the types of structure and their designs depending upon the local hydrogeology groundwater flow regime terrain condition and demand of water and how they impact on resource rejuvenation and improvement in water quality various researches are also available on how such endeavors are translating into socio economic benefits the paper reviews the researches that have been done in india on these issues and related government policies and schemes under execution the critical issues like source water availability for recharge upstream downstream conflicts and the rising awareness of different demand side interventions for sustainable management of groundwater resources have also been discussed keywords artificial recharge rainwater harvesting aquifer groundwater overexploitation india 1 introduction india s dependency on groundwater is unprecedented and a critical component for food and drinking water security as per the latest estimates by the government of india the country extracted 248 7 billion cubic meters bcm of groundwater in 2017 which is the highest in the world and more than the combined extraction of both the usa and china 65 about 17 of the assessment units in india are over exploited where annual extraction exceeds recharge to aquifers 67 45 from 6 2 million wells for irrigation in the country in 1986 87 the number stood at 20 5 million in 2013 14 this massive overexploitation of groundwater has led to a steep decline in water levels and depleting groundwater resources in many parts of the country 65 rodell velicogna and famigliettil 60 highlighted this at the international level where they used grace data to assess the overexploitation of groundwater resources in the north western part of india covering the states of punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh in india and the adjoining punjab region in pakistan further analysis reveals that irrigation consumes 90 of total extraction 65 while wada et al 85 worked out the non renewable extraction for irrigation in india is to the tune of 68 km3 year it is argued that beside rising demand the other major reason for the increasing extraction of groundwater in the country is the variability of rainfall owing to climate change 6 as this critical resource is depleting fast building groundwater resilience through enhanced recharge and reduce extraction by water demand management has become critical to sustaining indian agriculture and drinking water security 3 artificial recharge ar has been accepted worldwide as a major intervention to augment groundwater resources it is a process that increases infiltration either through faster rates or due to the availability of source water in a longer time domain the source water can be rainwater harvested on the surface or from other sources such as canals and treated wastewater as this recharge is additional to natural recharge it results in increased availability of groundwater in the spatial temporal domain the natural recharge is a slow process and is estimated as generally between 0 1 and 5 of long term average annual rainfall in semiarid and arid areas of the world 72 this is true for india as well but regions like the indus ganga brahmaputra plains are marked with higher recharge rate mainly because of higher rainfall better permeability and storage capacity of aquifers 9 there is evidence that due to increased flood irrigation based agriculture natural recharge is increasing however such areas are often marked by a decline in water level caused by uncontrolled pumping of groundwater for irrigation 72 in india both ar and rwh are mentioned together with an understanding that they are organically connected however ar is technically distinct from rwh the primary objective of ar is to enhance groundwater recharge while rwh aims to store water on the surface for various societal uses during non monsoon period and or during the intervening period of dry spells within the monsoon season depending on the local hydrogeology and design of the structure rwh bodies also act as recharge structures the collateral benefit of rwh is the percolation of water to aquifers for a prolonged period beyond monsoon thus increasing the volume of recharge experts believe that both ar and rwh should be used as a potential local supply side intervention 78 the interventions need to be planned and adopted carefully because if run off is captured in upstream areas of a watershed or subbasin without considering the issues of the downstream areas then it might result in undesirable impacts in downstream areas resulting in strife and conflicts since ages india has been harvesting rainwater to recharge aquifers through this practice the people have been able to support drinking and irrigation needs in the arid and semi arid regions of the country 24 various practices with locally adaptive designs can be found in the country for instance ghul is a traditional water harvesting structure in the high hills of western himalayas while the bodo tribe in assam have been building dongs a traditional form of tank to harvest rainwater for irrigation 10 since approximately 500 bce ahar and pyne systems have been in use in the gently sloping marginal alluvial plains of south bihar 41 the ahars are rectangular tanks with three sided embankments constructed at the end of an artificial channel pyne to divert river water into agricultural fields 26 bhattacharya 10 has highlighted the age old water harvesting structures found in arid rajasthan like kuis dug wells which are generally 10 12 m deep the top part of the kuis made narrow so as to minimize evaporation loss the khadin system is practiced in the jaisalmer district of western rajasthan in this system run off from the high slopes is harvested by constructing bunds on the lower valley floor this helps in recharging the groundwater and making the soil moist johad is a stone or mud barrier built along the contours to arrest run off in tamil nadu eri a five century old engineering tradition is a system of tanks fed by the channels of ephemeral rivers during the monsoon such tanks recharge groundwater and remain a source of drinking water 2 in the western ghat s lateritic terrain of kerala horizontal tunnels known as surangam are dug over lithomarge these tunnels collect seepage from laterite walls and bring the water to the point of use under gravity 39 this practice was initiated at least four centuries ago by the visiting arab traders from the middle east the low rainfall region of kutch gujarat started magnificent water harvesting system several centuries ago and is still active in many places one example is the interconnected hamisar and pragsar tanks created in bhuj town the streams in the catchment of the tanks are inter connected through canals or by tunnels so as to enable collection of maximum run off the locations are chosen such that the tanks also recharge the bhuj sandstone formation the major freshwater aquifer in the region 63 it is argued that in ar more emphasis is given to volumetric gain of water while less attention is paid to the quality issues 27 some researchers believe that managed aquifer recharge mar represents a wider scope while in ar the primary target is the volumetric enhancement of groundwater resources mar puts equal importance to both quantity and quality through a series of steps a mar maintains enhances and secures groundwater systems under stress according to dillon et al 27 since the 1970s the central and state government agencies in india have been emphasizing on volumetric benefits with little thought on quality issues however the statement is partially true in the artificial recharge manual issued by cgwb in 2007 along with various other guidelines issued by central ground water authority cgwa for ar concerns have been raised on the quality of source water to be recharged india does not permit using treated wastewater for ar in practice the distinction between ar and mar is blur in india 1 1 trajectory of growth of ar and rwh in india the increasing importance of ar can be attributed to the rising extraction of groundwater and can be grouped into four phases in india phase i relates to the pre mid 1960s before the onset of the green revolution during this period groundwater had limited use local communities practiced traditional water harvesting that was financed or supported by the local kings or wealthy people phase ii is between mid1960 and 1990 and is marked by the massive increase in groundwater extraction for irrigation and also for domestic and industrial usage the chief reason for the increase in groundwater extraction can be credited to the arrival of cheap drilling and pumping technologies and the government providing energy subsidy to the users during this period the importance of recharging aquifers was also felt and started mentioning in policy document phase iii is from 1990 to 2010 marked by the exponential increase in groundwater extraction during this period large areas have come under overexploitation of groundwater resources declining water levels and chemical quality deterioration emphasis on ar and rwh has increased manyfold government agencies conducted pilot studies on ar to demonstrate their efficiencies and run awareness generation and capacity building campaigns for the general public in its massive rural poverty alleviation programme mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme mgnregs the government of india put major emphasis on rwh related activities and recharging aquifers 17 in 1987 the government initiated a national watershed development programme for the effective use of natural and social capital including land water vegetation livestock and human resources 78 with time these programmes put more emphasis on rwh and ar with a major objective to increase groundwater availability and thus agriculture productivity many state governments have also launched schemes on water conservation like mission kakatia in telengana to clean and desilt hundreds of tanks which will collaterally rejuvenate aquifers 74 the importance of sensitize and involving communities in implementing ar and rwh and their maintenance is realized by the govt agencies 73 the central and state governments formed the ground water authorities to keep a control on groundwater extraction these authorities emphasized and made ar mandatory for providing no objection certificates noc for groundwater extraction to industries infrastructure projects mines etc 21 phase iv is the post 2012 period during this time a qualitative change in perception policy and action in combating overexploitation is witnessed such that the government now gives equal importance to both supply side and demand side interventions the massive national aquifer mapping and management program naquim was initiated in 2012 by the central ground water board cgwb 64 to map 25 9 lakh km2 hydrogeologically mappable area in the country to facilitate sustainable management of groundwater resources the objective of naquim is to map the aquifers in three dimensional environment and generate a comprehensive understanding of the geometry of the aquifers resource availability hydraulic characters and the chemical quality of groundwater in an aquifer specific environment the output of the programme will help in demarcating suitable areas that can be taken up for ar the type of structures to be adopted and their designs the aim of this paper is to review the available research reports on the executed projects various related policies and other documents on different aspects of ar and rwh in india fig 1 2 researches reports and documents on ar and rwh publications on ar and rwh can be grouped into three broad categories i suitability of an area for ar and rwh and site selection for construction of structures ii water quality issues and iii post construction impact assessment including the socio economic impact of ar and rwh structures 2 1 suitability of an area for ar and rwh and site selection sizeable publications are available on how geomorphology drainage pattern morphometry soil lineaments and various geophysical surveys are used for selecting sites for ar and rwh structures cgwb has prepared a master plan for artificial recharge 15 for the entire country where a 0 9415 105 km2 area is delineated as suitable for artificial recharge to groundwater factors like aquifer types and characteristics decadal mean of post monsoon water levels and non committed surface water availability as source water were considered while framing the plan according to the master plan about 85 6 km3 of water can be recharged and stored through 11 1 million structures of different kinds such as percolations tanks check dams nala bunds gully plugs gabion structures recharge shafts and wells contour bunds sub surface dykes etc suitable to local hydrogeology and groundwater regime zaidi 86 used quantitative morphometry and hydrogeological investigation for the selection of sites for ar and rwh in the almorah district of uttarakhand satellite data along with gis analysis can be used to assess the volume of run off and while selecting sites in different terrains in both soft rock and hard rock areas 76 fractures delineated by surface resistivity survey and water level maps were superimposed to demarcate suitable sites for ar in hard rock areas of tamil nadu 4 andrade 5 used electrical resistance tomography in granitic terrain of peninsular india for site selection for ar kumar et al 42 have used environmental isotopes 3h and 18o in conjunction with water level and hydrogeological framework to delineate suitable areas for ar in delhi urban area sreedevi et al 79 studied a small watershed of 55 km2 in a typical granitic terrain in peninsular india that was experiencing extensive overexploitation and opined that defunct dug wells because of deep water level are the most technically feasible and cost effective structures for recharge structure mondal and singh 47 proposed a method using cross correlation between rising water levels after monsoon and precipitation for the selection of sites for ar for unconfined aquifers in hard rock terrain narjary et al 51 analysed declining water levels and highlighted the importance of ar in haryana they reported a 2 3 3 16 m rise in water level during 2009 2010 in karnal district in response to ar according to islam and talukdar 36 ar and rwh can be integrated into the urban water supply they developed a mathematical model for the simulation of 3 d transient groundwater flow in a multi aquifer system where the lower confined aquifer was recharged with rooftop rainwater harvesting the model was then applied to examine the efficiency of working of ar and rwh structures for different volumes of recharge and extraction samadder kumar and gupta 70 delineated the paleochannels in the western ganga plain with permeability as 30 75 m day against 13 22 m day in the adjoining flood plain areas natural groundwater recharge determined by the tritium tagging technique in such paleochannel areas is 19 29 of annual rainfall against 6 9 in the flood plain area indicating the suitability of paleo channels for ar similar isotopic and hydro chemical techniques are used for the identification of suitable sites for ar and rwh interventions in hard rock areas marked by depleting groundwater resources saha dwivedi and singh 62 in one such study used electrical conductivity ec chloride cl heavy oxygen isotope δ18o and deuterium δd to identify the pathways of groundwater recharge and clubbed it with hydrogeological sections delineating the lineaments where the adequate volume of groundwater can be stored through ar in granitic aquifers of ranchi urban area 2 2 water quality issues it is generally believed that ar improves groundwater quality but evidences are also reported on how the percolating water deteriorates chemical quality in aquifers through rock water interaction concerns have been raised on the quality of source water and the extent of improvement of quality when water travels through the vadose zone before joining the water level several guidelines exist dealing with water quality for drinking and irrigation uses in india like the bureau of indian standard bis specification for drinking water 14 and guidelines on quality for irrigation 13 besides central pollution control board cpcb also specifies guidelines on water quality monitoring protocol 20 and wellhead protection for the construction of drinking water wells however no such guidelines have been developed dealing with the quality of source water or the vulnerability of the aquifer vis à vis protective measures to be taken for ar and rwh some guidelines on quality of source water have been developed and circulated by cgwb and advisories by cgwa 15 25 dillon et al 28 has proposed a viability assessment to deal with water quality issues for mar these include four steps a intended water use b source of water availability and right to access c hydrogeological characteristics d space for water capture and treatment according to them a sanitary survey should precede the construction of structures to identify hazards and hazardous events that may occur in the catchment area this should be followed by an aquifer assessment that includes the design and safer operation of the recharge facility they also recommended preventive measures to be taken corrective steps to be adopted and finally draw a proposed water safety plan improvement of water quality by ar was reported in various parts of india saharawat et al 68 studied recharge to and subsequent recovery from alluvial aquifer with saline groundwater in semi arid north western india they reported that though during the post recharge period the pumped out water showed lower salinity however the concentration of two parameters potassium and borate increased because of their release from clay minerals where they remain adsorbed thangamani 81 studied the impact of the check dam at amaravathi basin and reported improvement in water quality as the ussl class u s salinity laboratory classes developed on hardness salinity and sodium hazards improved from the c2s2 class medium salinity medium sodium to c2s1 class medium salinity low sodium stiefel et al 80 have reported considerable improvement in electrical conductivity and sulphate concentration in post ar construction period in arid areas of rajasthan kumar et al 43 used environmental isotopes like δ18o 3h and δd in a basaltic aquifer in maharashtra and reported improvement in the chemical quality of groundwater in the ozar watershed gowrisankar et al 35 reported a considerable decrease in fluoride concentration of groundwater in the downstream areas as a result of dilution of fresh water recharge from a check dam constructed in krishnagiri district of tamil nadu while satheeshkumar venkateswaran and kannan 71 reported similar improvement in vaniyar sub basin in the same state research at the pamber river basin in peninsular india 40 reported two types of impacts at shallow level 20 m below ground dilution and reduction of fluoride concentration while at a deeper level up to 90 m below ground the concentration increased as the fluoride rich salt deposited in the unsaturated zone owing to evaporation during summer got flushed during recharge brindha et al 12 have reported the same phenomena in the nalgonda district of telangana and pombar and vaniyar river basins in tamil nadu according to them ar cannot be taken up in a fluoride affected area without first considering hydrogeology moreover they recommend a constant monitoring of fluoride concentration of groundwater ar is an effective means to combat seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers owing to freshwater pumping nair renganayaki and elango 50 studied cl and br ratio in groundwater of coastal aquifers in the north of chennai city and detected saline water intrusion up to 10 km inside the land a check dam has resulted in about a 37 increase in recharge indicating the effectiveness in stalling saline water ingress as mentioned earlier treated wastewater cannot be used yet for ar nijhawan et al 52 conducted an opinion study of professionals in parts of central india on using treated municipal wastewater for ar on how the soil water treatment sot improves water quality about 64 of the respondents were in favour of using treated wastewater for ar while 28 opposed it 50 remained doubtful about the quality of source water wastewater before putting it into the aquifer though it is used after secondary treatment unintended recharge from leakage of water supply pipelines occurs in many urban areas saha marwaha and mukherjee 65 have found that leakage from domestic pipelines has neutralized the groundwater extraction and stabilized the water levels of the shallow unconfined aquifer in the patna urban area of bihar mortin 48 studied hubli dharwad twin city of karnataka where the leakage is estimated as 20 5 million cubic meters per year mcm year while the net recharge is assessed as 15 24 mcm year the leakage has helped in raising the groundwater level and improving the water quality 2 3 post construction impact assessment one of the moot questions that arises while studying the impact of ar and rwh is at what scale should the impact on groundwater resource be assessed most of the publications have assessed the impact at the local scale i e the impact of a standalone structure these publications used the following parameters in the assessment rise in water level area benefitted assessing the volume of recharge and how much of this volume is available for subsequent irrigation however very few research data is available on the impact on a sub basin or watershed scale considering multiple and distributed structures to make such a watershed or subbasin scale assessment the researchers have to observe for a prolonged period the spatio temporal variability of land use land cover climatic factor depth to water level groundwater flow regime aquifer hydraulic properties changes in groundwater quality among others remotely sensed data is a common tool used for impact assessment it can be used for the analyses of increase in crop area irrigated area and improvement in soil moisture becker 8 has explained how various remote sensing techniques are used to assess the impact of groundwater recharge satellite data can also be used to assess the water storage of rwh structures which further used to assess recharge from such bodies 83 it can be used for large areas too as it has the advantage of temporal resolution chinnasamy maheshwari and prathapar 19 used grace data to assess the scope for recharge in rajasthan and found that there is ample possibility for the same in the state however more detailed studies are needed to ascertain the suitable techniques of recharge their design and to pinpoint locations stiefel et al 80 used isotopes like 3h δ18o and cl and a geochemical mixing model in arid areas of rajasthan and found that the wells in the around the structures contain 75 of its total volume of water is contributed by recharge in the piedmont zone of himalayan foothills israel singhal and kumar 37 observed a linear relationship between the resistivity of the top unsaturated layer and the recharge by employing the tritium tagging technique they concluded that this relationship can be used to assess the rate of recharge in similar areas the rise in water level is considered an important parameter to assess the impact of recharge raju reddy and munirathnam 57 observed a 2 m rise in the groundwater level in the downstream of a subsurface dam in the swarnamukhi river basin of chittoor district in andhra pradesh the river basin is marked by 3 7 5 m thick alluvium underlain by hard rocks such as granite and granitic gneisses in an analysis on the water levels around four check dams in the aravalli formation of udaipur district of rajasthan dashora et al 22 reported that the volume of recharge was twice the combined capacity of the structures during the average rainfall years sharda et al 75 reported that 34 of the run off recharged in parts of gujarat while a higher recharge of 63 period 2004 06 was reported by abraham and mohan 1 parimalarenganayaki and elango 54 assessed the impact of ar structures in different parts of tamil nadu from 2010 to 12 and reported an enhanced recharge up to 79 of the cumulative volume of source water used a study by dashora et al 23 reveals that 70 of the run off generated is recharged in arid areas of rajasthan while glendenning and vervoort 32 estimated a much lower value boisson et al 11 highlighted considerable evaporation loss from the percolation tanks and assessed that the recharge from such a tank in the crystalline terrain of andhra pradesh 10 000 m3 annually is of the same order of evaporation loss 8000 m3 annually in the hard rock region of tamil nadu thiyagarajan et al 82 measured a rise in water level during the post construction phase of ar as 4 7 m against the normal increase of 1 5 m in groundwater level during monsoon they estimated the rate of recharge per month as 0 27 m3 m2 and 0 54 m3 m2 of ponding area from a check dam and a recharge shaft constructed in a percolation tank respectively venkateswaran satheeshkumar and kannan 84 have reported a considerable rise in the water level 3 5 m after ar structure construction in the vaniyar sub basin of ponnaiyar basin in tamil nadu parimalarenganayaki and elango 54 studied the impact of a check dam across the arani river in the north of chennai marked by alluvial formation they found that 63 of water stored is recharged with a rise in water level of 3 5 to 1 0 m till a distance of 2 0 km in another study on 10 recharge wells 25 30 m deep that were installed in an unused village pond in the ramganga basin of uttar pradesh alam et al 3 found that from 2015 to 2018 26 000 m3 to 62 000 m3 of unused run off was recharged in 62 to 85 days this volume is equivalent to 1 3 3 6 of total village recharge massuel et al 46 presented another study in a semi arid hard rock region of andhra pradesh as per the result of the study recharge from a percolation tank has enhanced the groundwater resource as a result of which the wells located within 100 m downstream were able to sustain up to 50 additional extraction for irrigation during 2007 08 thangamani 81 studied the impact of the check dam at the udumalpet block within the amaravathi basin and reported a 5 m rise in the water level jain et al 38 reported that 32 7 of the run off volume could be diverted into the aquifer of a micro watershed of 1 78 ha by a series of pits 1 7 m 1 8 m 1 4 m in madhya pradesh gore et al 34 modelled groundwater resources of the wagarwadi watershed in the parbhani district of maharashtra and observed a 16 increase in recharge from rwh which is equivalent to 2 of the total annual rainfall palanisami and suresh kumar 53 reported that rwh structures created under the watershed development programme have increased the recharge rate of groundwater level by 16 39 in tamil nadu in another study by sikka et al 77 the recharge from the percolation tank was noticed to be 500 600 m away from the tank in different watersheds in tamil nadu 3 how effective are they in improving the socio economic condition one major issue related to the positive impacts of ar and rwh lies beyond the science and technology domain this is regarding how the impacts are translated into socio economic benefits an accurate estimation of socio economic benefit also requires an elaborate analysis of related parameters in a watershed or sub basin scale the issue is complex because with the increasing incidents of high intensity short duration rainfall the run off collection efficiency of an ar structure gets effectively reduced 7 on the contrary if large structures are built to capture high intensity run off then the cost per unit volume of water captured increases it has been opined that often the proponents of ar underestimate its cost and inflate the recharge benefit 42 moreover the cost analysis does not include the additional expenditure required for post recharge pumping of groundwater for societal uses another argument is that such a cost benefit analysis is mostly done for a standalone structure without giving proper attention to the entire watershed sub basin or possible adverse hydrological impact in the lower catchment areas 58 dashora et al 23 in an elaborate cost benefit analysis of check dams in the hard rock terrains of udaipur district rajasthan estimated that after accounting average annual maintenance cost of 2 9 of the capital cost the average benefit cost ratio of four check dams is 400 the unit cost of recharge is inr 0 56 m3 while the crop production benefit is inr 2 36 m3 of water however the authors pointed out that further work is required to evaluate the impact of check dams in the downstream areas of the watershed to understand the catchment wise benefit cost ratio diwakara and chandrakanth 29 recommend the intervention of ar and rwh in whole watershed in a planned manner to help in reducing the negative externalities owing to frequent well failure and increasing access to groundwater resources the authors recommended that such programmes should be embedded in the national water policy of india 4 need for watershed scale impact assessment the planning execution and impact assessment of ar and rwh should be done on a watershed or sub basin scale mostly stand alone or at best few structures are constructed in a small area and the impact assessments focus on local scale hydrological impact such impact studies fall short of watershed or sub basin scale analyses including tradeoff between upstream and downstream stakeholders 75 duraiswami krishnamurthy and maskare 30 emphasized the need for impact analysis that consider the hydrogeology hydrology and also the ecosystem they have accepted that such analyses are difficult given the data has to be generated on a long term basis and spatial variability of various parameters reena et al 59 analysed the impact of ten structures in the parasai sind watershed 1246 ha in bundelkhand region uttar pradesh they noted that post implementation the net recharge had increased by 71 8 and the yield of wells had also improved considerably the recharged water provided assured irrigation to rabi season in the entire treated area of the watershed a similar impact in a watershed in the eastern rajasthan has been observed where the average irrigated area per dug well during the rabi season increased from 0 5 to 1 4 ha because of enhanced availability of water 55 chatterjee et al 18 highlighted the critically depleted groundwater resource in the baswa bandikui watershed in rajasthan and recommended an urgent action to be taken to prevent further deterioration the upstream downstream conflict was dealt in a study by sakthivadivel and scott 69 which concluded that the reservoir from which the water supply is made for rajkot town of gujarat was severely affected because of a large number of rwh structures constructed in the upstream part of the catchment the city municipality ultimately had to eventually make an alternative arrangement for water supply the climate change factor should also be considered carefully while assessing the impacts of ar and rwh like in the arvari river basin of rajasthan after the implementation of ar and rwh the flow has increased which has been argued by glendenning et al 33 on whether increased rainfall during the period is responsible for the increased flow modelling of a watershed on a gis platform using digital remotely sensed data offers a cheaper and faster way against field monitoring based estimation of assessing the watershed scale hydrological impact this is particularly useful while estimating the impact of ar on streamflow and assessing the run off volume that can be captured by rwh 33 rather than assessing the impact of groundwater particularly if it occurs in anisotropic hard rock aquifers perrin et al 56 studied the gaiwel watershed in hard rock terrain of andhra pradesh and applied the swat model soil water assessment tool for calibration of run off volumes and storage in 29 percolation tanks they observed that 23 of the annual recharge was provided by the tanks during the normal monsoon year they also noted that further construction of structures was not feasible because the depleted run off could affect the downstream areas 4 1 conclusion dependence on groundwater is increasing rapidly and so are the consequent stress on aquifers gleeson et al 31 estimate that the size of the global groundwater footprint is currently about 3 5 times the actual area of aquifers while about 1 7 billion people stay in areas marked with groundwater resource depletion and or groundwater dependent ecosystems under threat a similar groundwater resources stress has been noticed in the northwestern part of the indian subcontinent 49 various studies have also highlighted that the aquifers in the country are depleting fast particularly in arid and semi arid regions saha and gor 63 found that in the kutch region of gujarat the freshwater bearing bhuj sandstone aquifer is tapped by more than 25 500 wells for drinking and irrigation and is resulting in a rapid decline in the water levels in the area the annual extraction for 2018 from the bhuj sandstone aquifer was estimated as 1059 mcm while the recharge from rainfall was 10 of extraction rwh and ar are thus considered as the major interventions to enhance the groundwater resources but are such supply side interventions enough to drive the groundwater utilization more sustainably the findings of the naquim programme which is dwelling in detail on how the supply side ar and rwh and demand side crop diversification enhancing water use

20102,in india artificial recharge ar of aquifers is considered a primary supply side measure to combat the widespread over exploitation of groundwater as a major collateral benefit of rainwater harvesting rwh is aquifer rejuvenation both rainwater harvesting and ar are planned and executed as a set of coherent interventions the central and state governments have brought in several schemes involving ar and rwh moreover a number of researches are being conducted on how to select the sites for structure construction the types of structure and their designs depending upon the local hydrogeology groundwater flow regime terrain condition and demand of water and how they impact on resource rejuvenation and improvement in water quality various researches are also available on how such endeavors are translating into socio economic benefits the paper reviews the researches that have been done in india on these issues and related government policies and schemes under execution the critical issues like source water availability for recharge upstream downstream conflicts and the rising awareness of different demand side interventions for sustainable management of groundwater resources have also been discussed keywords artificial recharge rainwater harvesting aquifer groundwater overexploitation india 1 introduction india s dependency on groundwater is unprecedented and a critical component for food and drinking water security as per the latest estimates by the government of india the country extracted 248 7 billion cubic meters bcm of groundwater in 2017 which is the highest in the world and more than the combined extraction of both the usa and china 65 about 17 of the assessment units in india are over exploited where annual extraction exceeds recharge to aquifers 67 45 from 6 2 million wells for irrigation in the country in 1986 87 the number stood at 20 5 million in 2013 14 this massive overexploitation of groundwater has led to a steep decline in water levels and depleting groundwater resources in many parts of the country 65 rodell velicogna and famigliettil 60 highlighted this at the international level where they used grace data to assess the overexploitation of groundwater resources in the north western part of india covering the states of punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh in india and the adjoining punjab region in pakistan further analysis reveals that irrigation consumes 90 of total extraction 65 while wada et al 85 worked out the non renewable extraction for irrigation in india is to the tune of 68 km3 year it is argued that beside rising demand the other major reason for the increasing extraction of groundwater in the country is the variability of rainfall owing to climate change 6 as this critical resource is depleting fast building groundwater resilience through enhanced recharge and reduce extraction by water demand management has become critical to sustaining indian agriculture and drinking water security 3 artificial recharge ar has been accepted worldwide as a major intervention to augment groundwater resources it is a process that increases infiltration either through faster rates or due to the availability of source water in a longer time domain the source water can be rainwater harvested on the surface or from other sources such as canals and treated wastewater as this recharge is additional to natural recharge it results in increased availability of groundwater in the spatial temporal domain the natural recharge is a slow process and is estimated as generally between 0 1 and 5 of long term average annual rainfall in semiarid and arid areas of the world 72 this is true for india as well but regions like the indus ganga brahmaputra plains are marked with higher recharge rate mainly because of higher rainfall better permeability and storage capacity of aquifers 9 there is evidence that due to increased flood irrigation based agriculture natural recharge is increasing however such areas are often marked by a decline in water level caused by uncontrolled pumping of groundwater for irrigation 72 in india both ar and rwh are mentioned together with an understanding that they are organically connected however ar is technically distinct from rwh the primary objective of ar is to enhance groundwater recharge while rwh aims to store water on the surface for various societal uses during non monsoon period and or during the intervening period of dry spells within the monsoon season depending on the local hydrogeology and design of the structure rwh bodies also act as recharge structures the collateral benefit of rwh is the percolation of water to aquifers for a prolonged period beyond monsoon thus increasing the volume of recharge experts believe that both ar and rwh should be used as a potential local supply side intervention 78 the interventions need to be planned and adopted carefully because if run off is captured in upstream areas of a watershed or subbasin without considering the issues of the downstream areas then it might result in undesirable impacts in downstream areas resulting in strife and conflicts since ages india has been harvesting rainwater to recharge aquifers through this practice the people have been able to support drinking and irrigation needs in the arid and semi arid regions of the country 24 various practices with locally adaptive designs can be found in the country for instance ghul is a traditional water harvesting structure in the high hills of western himalayas while the bodo tribe in assam have been building dongs a traditional form of tank to harvest rainwater for irrigation 10 since approximately 500 bce ahar and pyne systems have been in use in the gently sloping marginal alluvial plains of south bihar 41 the ahars are rectangular tanks with three sided embankments constructed at the end of an artificial channel pyne to divert river water into agricultural fields 26 bhattacharya 10 has highlighted the age old water harvesting structures found in arid rajasthan like kuis dug wells which are generally 10 12 m deep the top part of the kuis made narrow so as to minimize evaporation loss the khadin system is practiced in the jaisalmer district of western rajasthan in this system run off from the high slopes is harvested by constructing bunds on the lower valley floor this helps in recharging the groundwater and making the soil moist johad is a stone or mud barrier built along the contours to arrest run off in tamil nadu eri a five century old engineering tradition is a system of tanks fed by the channels of ephemeral rivers during the monsoon such tanks recharge groundwater and remain a source of drinking water 2 in the western ghat s lateritic terrain of kerala horizontal tunnels known as surangam are dug over lithomarge these tunnels collect seepage from laterite walls and bring the water to the point of use under gravity 39 this practice was initiated at least four centuries ago by the visiting arab traders from the middle east the low rainfall region of kutch gujarat started magnificent water harvesting system several centuries ago and is still active in many places one example is the interconnected hamisar and pragsar tanks created in bhuj town the streams in the catchment of the tanks are inter connected through canals or by tunnels so as to enable collection of maximum run off the locations are chosen such that the tanks also recharge the bhuj sandstone formation the major freshwater aquifer in the region 63 it is argued that in ar more emphasis is given to volumetric gain of water while less attention is paid to the quality issues 27 some researchers believe that managed aquifer recharge mar represents a wider scope while in ar the primary target is the volumetric enhancement of groundwater resources mar puts equal importance to both quantity and quality through a series of steps a mar maintains enhances and secures groundwater systems under stress according to dillon et al 27 since the 1970s the central and state government agencies in india have been emphasizing on volumetric benefits with little thought on quality issues however the statement is partially true in the artificial recharge manual issued by cgwb in 2007 along with various other guidelines issued by central ground water authority cgwa for ar concerns have been raised on the quality of source water to be recharged india does not permit using treated wastewater for ar in practice the distinction between ar and mar is blur in india 1 1 trajectory of growth of ar and rwh in india the increasing importance of ar can be attributed to the rising extraction of groundwater and can be grouped into four phases in india phase i relates to the pre mid 1960s before the onset of the green revolution during this period groundwater had limited use local communities practiced traditional water harvesting that was financed or supported by the local kings or wealthy people phase ii is between mid1960 and 1990 and is marked by the massive increase in groundwater extraction for irrigation and also for domestic and industrial usage the chief reason for the increase in groundwater extraction can be credited to the arrival of cheap drilling and pumping technologies and the government providing energy subsidy to the users during this period the importance of recharging aquifers was also felt and started mentioning in policy document phase iii is from 1990 to 2010 marked by the exponential increase in groundwater extraction during this period large areas have come under overexploitation of groundwater resources declining water levels and chemical quality deterioration emphasis on ar and rwh has increased manyfold government agencies conducted pilot studies on ar to demonstrate their efficiencies and run awareness generation and capacity building campaigns for the general public in its massive rural poverty alleviation programme mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme mgnregs the government of india put major emphasis on rwh related activities and recharging aquifers 17 in 1987 the government initiated a national watershed development programme for the effective use of natural and social capital including land water vegetation livestock and human resources 78 with time these programmes put more emphasis on rwh and ar with a major objective to increase groundwater availability and thus agriculture productivity many state governments have also launched schemes on water conservation like mission kakatia in telengana to clean and desilt hundreds of tanks which will collaterally rejuvenate aquifers 74 the importance of sensitize and involving communities in implementing ar and rwh and their maintenance is realized by the govt agencies 73 the central and state governments formed the ground water authorities to keep a control on groundwater extraction these authorities emphasized and made ar mandatory for providing no objection certificates noc for groundwater extraction to industries infrastructure projects mines etc 21 phase iv is the post 2012 period during this time a qualitative change in perception policy and action in combating overexploitation is witnessed such that the government now gives equal importance to both supply side and demand side interventions the massive national aquifer mapping and management program naquim was initiated in 2012 by the central ground water board cgwb 64 to map 25 9 lakh km2 hydrogeologically mappable area in the country to facilitate sustainable management of groundwater resources the objective of naquim is to map the aquifers in three dimensional environment and generate a comprehensive understanding of the geometry of the aquifers resource availability hydraulic characters and the chemical quality of groundwater in an aquifer specific environment the output of the programme will help in demarcating suitable areas that can be taken up for ar the type of structures to be adopted and their designs the aim of this paper is to review the available research reports on the executed projects various related policies and other documents on different aspects of ar and rwh in india fig 1 2 researches reports and documents on ar and rwh publications on ar and rwh can be grouped into three broad categories i suitability of an area for ar and rwh and site selection for construction of structures ii water quality issues and iii post construction impact assessment including the socio economic impact of ar and rwh structures 2 1 suitability of an area for ar and rwh and site selection sizeable publications are available on how geomorphology drainage pattern morphometry soil lineaments and various geophysical surveys are used for selecting sites for ar and rwh structures cgwb has prepared a master plan for artificial recharge 15 for the entire country where a 0 9415 105 km2 area is delineated as suitable for artificial recharge to groundwater factors like aquifer types and characteristics decadal mean of post monsoon water levels and non committed surface water availability as source water were considered while framing the plan according to the master plan about 85 6 km3 of water can be recharged and stored through 11 1 million structures of different kinds such as percolations tanks check dams nala bunds gully plugs gabion structures recharge shafts and wells contour bunds sub surface dykes etc suitable to local hydrogeology and groundwater regime zaidi 86 used quantitative morphometry and hydrogeological investigation for the selection of sites for ar and rwh in the almorah district of uttarakhand satellite data along with gis analysis can be used to assess the volume of run off and while selecting sites in different terrains in both soft rock and hard rock areas 76 fractures delineated by surface resistivity survey and water level maps were superimposed to demarcate suitable sites for ar in hard rock areas of tamil nadu 4 andrade 5 used electrical resistance tomography in granitic terrain of peninsular india for site selection for ar kumar et al 42 have used environmental isotopes 3h and 18o in conjunction with water level and hydrogeological framework to delineate suitable areas for ar in delhi urban area sreedevi et al 79 studied a small watershed of 55 km2 in a typical granitic terrain in peninsular india that was experiencing extensive overexploitation and opined that defunct dug wells because of deep water level are the most technically feasible and cost effective structures for recharge structure mondal and singh 47 proposed a method using cross correlation between rising water levels after monsoon and precipitation for the selection of sites for ar for unconfined aquifers in hard rock terrain narjary et al 51 analysed declining water levels and highlighted the importance of ar in haryana they reported a 2 3 3 16 m rise in water level during 2009 2010 in karnal district in response to ar according to islam and talukdar 36 ar and rwh can be integrated into the urban water supply they developed a mathematical model for the simulation of 3 d transient groundwater flow in a multi aquifer system where the lower confined aquifer was recharged with rooftop rainwater harvesting the model was then applied to examine the efficiency of working of ar and rwh structures for different volumes of recharge and extraction samadder kumar and gupta 70 delineated the paleochannels in the western ganga plain with permeability as 30 75 m day against 13 22 m day in the adjoining flood plain areas natural groundwater recharge determined by the tritium tagging technique in such paleochannel areas is 19 29 of annual rainfall against 6 9 in the flood plain area indicating the suitability of paleo channels for ar similar isotopic and hydro chemical techniques are used for the identification of suitable sites for ar and rwh interventions in hard rock areas marked by depleting groundwater resources saha dwivedi and singh 62 in one such study used electrical conductivity ec chloride cl heavy oxygen isotope δ18o and deuterium δd to identify the pathways of groundwater recharge and clubbed it with hydrogeological sections delineating the lineaments where the adequate volume of groundwater can be stored through ar in granitic aquifers of ranchi urban area 2 2 water quality issues it is generally believed that ar improves groundwater quality but evidences are also reported on how the percolating water deteriorates chemical quality in aquifers through rock water interaction concerns have been raised on the quality of source water and the extent of improvement of quality when water travels through the vadose zone before joining the water level several guidelines exist dealing with water quality for drinking and irrigation uses in india like the bureau of indian standard bis specification for drinking water 14 and guidelines on quality for irrigation 13 besides central pollution control board cpcb also specifies guidelines on water quality monitoring protocol 20 and wellhead protection for the construction of drinking water wells however no such guidelines have been developed dealing with the quality of source water or the vulnerability of the aquifer vis à vis protective measures to be taken for ar and rwh some guidelines on quality of source water have been developed and circulated by cgwb and advisories by cgwa 15 25 dillon et al 28 has proposed a viability assessment to deal with water quality issues for mar these include four steps a intended water use b source of water availability and right to access c hydrogeological characteristics d space for water capture and treatment according to them a sanitary survey should precede the construction of structures to identify hazards and hazardous events that may occur in the catchment area this should be followed by an aquifer assessment that includes the design and safer operation of the recharge facility they also recommended preventive measures to be taken corrective steps to be adopted and finally draw a proposed water safety plan improvement of water quality by ar was reported in various parts of india saharawat et al 68 studied recharge to and subsequent recovery from alluvial aquifer with saline groundwater in semi arid north western india they reported that though during the post recharge period the pumped out water showed lower salinity however the concentration of two parameters potassium and borate increased because of their release from clay minerals where they remain adsorbed thangamani 81 studied the impact of the check dam at amaravathi basin and reported improvement in water quality as the ussl class u s salinity laboratory classes developed on hardness salinity and sodium hazards improved from the c2s2 class medium salinity medium sodium to c2s1 class medium salinity low sodium stiefel et al 80 have reported considerable improvement in electrical conductivity and sulphate concentration in post ar construction period in arid areas of rajasthan kumar et al 43 used environmental isotopes like δ18o 3h and δd in a basaltic aquifer in maharashtra and reported improvement in the chemical quality of groundwater in the ozar watershed gowrisankar et al 35 reported a considerable decrease in fluoride concentration of groundwater in the downstream areas as a result of dilution of fresh water recharge from a check dam constructed in krishnagiri district of tamil nadu while satheeshkumar venkateswaran and kannan 71 reported similar improvement in vaniyar sub basin in the same state research at the pamber river basin in peninsular india 40 reported two types of impacts at shallow level 20 m below ground dilution and reduction of fluoride concentration while at a deeper level up to 90 m below ground the concentration increased as the fluoride rich salt deposited in the unsaturated zone owing to evaporation during summer got flushed during recharge brindha et al 12 have reported the same phenomena in the nalgonda district of telangana and pombar and vaniyar river basins in tamil nadu according to them ar cannot be taken up in a fluoride affected area without first considering hydrogeology moreover they recommend a constant monitoring of fluoride concentration of groundwater ar is an effective means to combat seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers owing to freshwater pumping nair renganayaki and elango 50 studied cl and br ratio in groundwater of coastal aquifers in the north of chennai city and detected saline water intrusion up to 10 km inside the land a check dam has resulted in about a 37 increase in recharge indicating the effectiveness in stalling saline water ingress as mentioned earlier treated wastewater cannot be used yet for ar nijhawan et al 52 conducted an opinion study of professionals in parts of central india on using treated municipal wastewater for ar on how the soil water treatment sot improves water quality about 64 of the respondents were in favour of using treated wastewater for ar while 28 opposed it 50 remained doubtful about the quality of source water wastewater before putting it into the aquifer though it is used after secondary treatment unintended recharge from leakage of water supply pipelines occurs in many urban areas saha marwaha and mukherjee 65 have found that leakage from domestic pipelines has neutralized the groundwater extraction and stabilized the water levels of the shallow unconfined aquifer in the patna urban area of bihar mortin 48 studied hubli dharwad twin city of karnataka where the leakage is estimated as 20 5 million cubic meters per year mcm year while the net recharge is assessed as 15 24 mcm year the leakage has helped in raising the groundwater level and improving the water quality 2 3 post construction impact assessment one of the moot questions that arises while studying the impact of ar and rwh is at what scale should the impact on groundwater resource be assessed most of the publications have assessed the impact at the local scale i e the impact of a standalone structure these publications used the following parameters in the assessment rise in water level area benefitted assessing the volume of recharge and how much of this volume is available for subsequent irrigation however very few research data is available on the impact on a sub basin or watershed scale considering multiple and distributed structures to make such a watershed or subbasin scale assessment the researchers have to observe for a prolonged period the spatio temporal variability of land use land cover climatic factor depth to water level groundwater flow regime aquifer hydraulic properties changes in groundwater quality among others remotely sensed data is a common tool used for impact assessment it can be used for the analyses of increase in crop area irrigated area and improvement in soil moisture becker 8 has explained how various remote sensing techniques are used to assess the impact of groundwater recharge satellite data can also be used to assess the water storage of rwh structures which further used to assess recharge from such bodies 83 it can be used for large areas too as it has the advantage of temporal resolution chinnasamy maheshwari and prathapar 19 used grace data to assess the scope for recharge in rajasthan and found that there is ample possibility for the same in the state however more detailed studies are needed to ascertain the suitable techniques of recharge their design and to pinpoint locations stiefel et al 80 used isotopes like 3h δ18o and cl and a geochemical mixing model in arid areas of rajasthan and found that the wells in the around the structures contain 75 of its total volume of water is contributed by recharge in the piedmont zone of himalayan foothills israel singhal and kumar 37 observed a linear relationship between the resistivity of the top unsaturated layer and the recharge by employing the tritium tagging technique they concluded that this relationship can be used to assess the rate of recharge in similar areas the rise in water level is considered an important parameter to assess the impact of recharge raju reddy and munirathnam 57 observed a 2 m rise in the groundwater level in the downstream of a subsurface dam in the swarnamukhi river basin of chittoor district in andhra pradesh the river basin is marked by 3 7 5 m thick alluvium underlain by hard rocks such as granite and granitic gneisses in an analysis on the water levels around four check dams in the aravalli formation of udaipur district of rajasthan dashora et al 22 reported that the volume of recharge was twice the combined capacity of the structures during the average rainfall years sharda et al 75 reported that 34 of the run off recharged in parts of gujarat while a higher recharge of 63 period 2004 06 was reported by abraham and mohan 1 parimalarenganayaki and elango 54 assessed the impact of ar structures in different parts of tamil nadu from 2010 to 12 and reported an enhanced recharge up to 79 of the cumulative volume of source water used a study by dashora et al 23 reveals that 70 of the run off generated is recharged in arid areas of rajasthan while glendenning and vervoort 32 estimated a much lower value boisson et al 11 highlighted considerable evaporation loss from the percolation tanks and assessed that the recharge from such a tank in the crystalline terrain of andhra pradesh 10 000 m3 annually is of the same order of evaporation loss 8000 m3 annually in the hard rock region of tamil nadu thiyagarajan et al 82 measured a rise in water level during the post construction phase of ar as 4 7 m against the normal increase of 1 5 m in groundwater level during monsoon they estimated the rate of recharge per month as 0 27 m3 m2 and 0 54 m3 m2 of ponding area from a check dam and a recharge shaft constructed in a percolation tank respectively venkateswaran satheeshkumar and kannan 84 have reported a considerable rise in the water level 3 5 m after ar structure construction in the vaniyar sub basin of ponnaiyar basin in tamil nadu parimalarenganayaki and elango 54 studied the impact of a check dam across the arani river in the north of chennai marked by alluvial formation they found that 63 of water stored is recharged with a rise in water level of 3 5 to 1 0 m till a distance of 2 0 km in another study on 10 recharge wells 25 30 m deep that were installed in an unused village pond in the ramganga basin of uttar pradesh alam et al 3 found that from 2015 to 2018 26 000 m3 to 62 000 m3 of unused run off was recharged in 62 to 85 days this volume is equivalent to 1 3 3 6 of total village recharge massuel et al 46 presented another study in a semi arid hard rock region of andhra pradesh as per the result of the study recharge from a percolation tank has enhanced the groundwater resource as a result of which the wells located within 100 m downstream were able to sustain up to 50 additional extraction for irrigation during 2007 08 thangamani 81 studied the impact of the check dam at the udumalpet block within the amaravathi basin and reported a 5 m rise in the water level jain et al 38 reported that 32 7 of the run off volume could be diverted into the aquifer of a micro watershed of 1 78 ha by a series of pits 1 7 m 1 8 m 1 4 m in madhya pradesh gore et al 34 modelled groundwater resources of the wagarwadi watershed in the parbhani district of maharashtra and observed a 16 increase in recharge from rwh which is equivalent to 2 of the total annual rainfall palanisami and suresh kumar 53 reported that rwh structures created under the watershed development programme have increased the recharge rate of groundwater level by 16 39 in tamil nadu in another study by sikka et al 77 the recharge from the percolation tank was noticed to be 500 600 m away from the tank in different watersheds in tamil nadu 3 how effective are they in improving the socio economic condition one major issue related to the positive impacts of ar and rwh lies beyond the science and technology domain this is regarding how the impacts are translated into socio economic benefits an accurate estimation of socio economic benefit also requires an elaborate analysis of related parameters in a watershed or sub basin scale the issue is complex because with the increasing incidents of high intensity short duration rainfall the run off collection efficiency of an ar structure gets effectively reduced 7 on the contrary if large structures are built to capture high intensity run off then the cost per unit volume of water captured increases it has been opined that often the proponents of ar underestimate its cost and inflate the recharge benefit 42 moreover the cost analysis does not include the additional expenditure required for post recharge pumping of groundwater for societal uses another argument is that such a cost benefit analysis is mostly done for a standalone structure without giving proper attention to the entire watershed sub basin or possible adverse hydrological impact in the lower catchment areas 58 dashora et al 23 in an elaborate cost benefit analysis of check dams in the hard rock terrains of udaipur district rajasthan estimated that after accounting average annual maintenance cost of 2 9 of the capital cost the average benefit cost ratio of four check dams is 400 the unit cost of recharge is inr 0 56 m3 while the crop production benefit is inr 2 36 m3 of water however the authors pointed out that further work is required to evaluate the impact of check dams in the downstream areas of the watershed to understand the catchment wise benefit cost ratio diwakara and chandrakanth 29 recommend the intervention of ar and rwh in whole watershed in a planned manner to help in reducing the negative externalities owing to frequent well failure and increasing access to groundwater resources the authors recommended that such programmes should be embedded in the national water policy of india 4 need for watershed scale impact assessment the planning execution and impact assessment of ar and rwh should be done on a watershed or sub basin scale mostly stand alone or at best few structures are constructed in a small area and the impact assessments focus on local scale hydrological impact such impact studies fall short of watershed or sub basin scale analyses including tradeoff between upstream and downstream stakeholders 75 duraiswami krishnamurthy and maskare 30 emphasized the need for impact analysis that consider the hydrogeology hydrology and also the ecosystem they have accepted that such analyses are difficult given the data has to be generated on a long term basis and spatial variability of various parameters reena et al 59 analysed the impact of ten structures in the parasai sind watershed 1246 ha in bundelkhand region uttar pradesh they noted that post implementation the net recharge had increased by 71 8 and the yield of wells had also improved considerably the recharged water provided assured irrigation to rabi season in the entire treated area of the watershed a similar impact in a watershed in the eastern rajasthan has been observed where the average irrigated area per dug well during the rabi season increased from 0 5 to 1 4 ha because of enhanced availability of water 55 chatterjee et al 18 highlighted the critically depleted groundwater resource in the baswa bandikui watershed in rajasthan and recommended an urgent action to be taken to prevent further deterioration the upstream downstream conflict was dealt in a study by sakthivadivel and scott 69 which concluded that the reservoir from which the water supply is made for rajkot town of gujarat was severely affected because of a large number of rwh structures constructed in the upstream part of the catchment the city municipality ultimately had to eventually make an alternative arrangement for water supply the climate change factor should also be considered carefully while assessing the impacts of ar and rwh like in the arvari river basin of rajasthan after the implementation of ar and rwh the flow has increased which has been argued by glendenning et al 33 on whether increased rainfall during the period is responsible for the increased flow modelling of a watershed on a gis platform using digital remotely sensed data offers a cheaper and faster way against field monitoring based estimation of assessing the watershed scale hydrological impact this is particularly useful while estimating the impact of ar on streamflow and assessing the run off volume that can be captured by rwh 33 rather than assessing the impact of groundwater particularly if it occurs in anisotropic hard rock aquifers perrin et al 56 studied the gaiwel watershed in hard rock terrain of andhra pradesh and applied the swat model soil water assessment tool for calibration of run off volumes and storage in 29 percolation tanks they observed that 23 of the annual recharge was provided by the tanks during the normal monsoon year they also noted that further construction of structures was not feasible because the depleted run off could affect the downstream areas 4 1 conclusion dependence on groundwater is increasing rapidly and so are the consequent stress on aquifers gleeson et al 31 estimate that the size of the global groundwater footprint is currently about 3 5 times the actual area of aquifers while about 1 7 billion people stay in areas marked with groundwater resource depletion and or groundwater dependent ecosystems under threat a similar groundwater resources stress has been noticed in the northwestern part of the indian subcontinent 49 various studies have also highlighted that the aquifers in the country are depleting fast particularly in arid and semi arid regions saha and gor 63 found that in the kutch region of gujarat the freshwater bearing bhuj sandstone aquifer is tapped by more than 25 500 wells for drinking and irrigation and is resulting in a rapid decline in the water levels in the area the annual extraction for 2018 from the bhuj sandstone aquifer was estimated as 1059 mcm while the recharge from rainfall was 10 of extraction rwh and ar are thus considered as the major interventions to enhance the groundwater resources but are such supply side interventions enough to drive the groundwater utilization more sustainably the findings of the naquim programme which is dwelling in detail on how the supply side ar and rwh and demand side crop diversification enhancing water use efficiency better agronomic practices changing cropping calendar etc interventions can help in the sustainable use of groundwater resource of an area naquim studies reveal that in arid and semi arid areas ar and rwh has a limiting value primarily because of lack of source water which is non committed surface run off 65 the researchers professionals and policymakers are thus highlighting the role and importance of demand side interventions in the irrigation sector as it consumes 90 of total groundwater extraction in india to promote sustainable groundwater use by adopting supply and demand side measures government of india in 2018 initiated the atal bhujal yojana in which inr 60 000 million will be invested in overexploited areas and incentives will be provided to save groundwater https mowr gov in schemes atal bhujal yojana in recent years the central and the state governments are promoting micro irrigation through generous subsidies and has initiated a substantial increase in the minimum support price of less water guzzling cereals so that the farmers can shift from the rice wheat cycle as ar and rwh are still considered to be the most important interventions to rejuvenate groundwater resources their planning and execution should be performed with a proper understanding of aquifers their hydraulic characters groundwater flow regime hydrogeochemical processes and availability of source water the importance of ar and rwh is reemphasized given changing rainfall patterns due to climate change the socio economic issues are also required to be considered carefully particularly obviating the possible conflict between upstream downstream of the structures in a watershed as reported from various parts of india 53 the plans and execution of ar and rwh should be dovetailed based on hydrogeology aspiration of the users and the competitive demands on recharged water where watershed sub basin is considered as a unit credit authorship contribution statement

20103,this article starts with the archaeology of justice in an attempt to get to the historical roots of the iranians conception of justice justice has been founded on two conceptual pillars social order and divine legitimacy that were synthesized into the iranian form of justice water justice has not meant equal distribution of water resources but it has been more of an allocation system that distributed water among different territories according to their dissimilar geopolitical values this article explains how a causal relationship between justice production system and political power could bring about the idea of the circle of justice however the circle of justice was an ideal model that could not find expression in real world due to the taxation system whose inevitable malfunction led to the formation of another cycle called the circle of water justice this article draws an analogy between the historical polities and the present iranian government in terms of the circle of water justice after the 1979 revolution this circle was based on an amalgamation between the traditional conception of justice and modern political philosophies which prescribed socio economic inequalities in favor of the least advantaged classes although the circle of water justice served to reinforce the political power it fueled ecological degradation and social conflicts in the long run this article concludes that iran s hydraulic mission is not the cause of their water crisis but it is only the result of a subtle mechanism named the circle of water justice iran s growing water crisis cannot be defused in the absence of a structural reform in the circle of water justice keywords water justice water resources political power water allocation hydraulic mission data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in an agrarian society like iran s where irrigated agriculture has always been the main source of wealth water is a sensitive factor of production which always revolves around the question of justice 32 literally water should be distributed justly but it is only the government that has the authority to determine how much water each region or group can get based on its own interpretation of the divine plan however the physical geography and natural hydrological cycles were not always to the liking of the iranian governments therefore they had to put a great portion of their energy and budget into the hydraulic projects that could manipulate and reorganize the natural order of water reserves many rivers were dammed and transferred to faraway places irrigation canals were branched off from the rivers seasonal runoffs were harvested and drinking water was stored all for the sake of justice sometimes those who deserved more water happened to live farther from water resources justice entailed their satisfaction and their satisfaction in turn contributed to the government s stability hence water justice usually gravitated toward the benefit of those who enjoyed maximum alignment with the ruling class this research seeks to pave the way for a better understanding of water justice in today s iran rather than an absolute historical argument we cannot imagine water out of its historical context as swyngedouw 53 says that hydro social cycles elude any formulation if divested of their historical geographical origins to understand water justice first of all we need to delve into the general concept of justice in iranian history we come across a dichotomy between justice and equity which was rooted in a social stratification used to justify some people s advantage and some others deprivation iran s history is laden with frequent social movements that called into question the established definition of justice through challenging at least some parts of the social stratification 22 such a justice that recognizes an intrinsic difference between the social classes always teeters on the brink of rebellion and revolution thus a costly military backed polity is needed to ensure the administration of justice based on the budget obtained through a taxation system this tax is highly dependent on the water that can be metabolized into money in the agricultural units such causal relations form the circle of justice which has served as the central premise of justice for most of the iranian polities this research will show that the same historical circle has evolved into a modern structure that prevails over water allocation system in today s iran 2 iranians conception of justice according to ancient persians justice comes within the purview of gods 39 and this notion seems to have originated from mesopotamia 60 35 the most important pillar of mesopotamian justice was god s will which served to protect the weak against the strong and the poor against the rich later on persians added another pillar that was order to provide protection not only for the weak and the poor against the strong and the rich but also vice versa persians built upon the mesopotamian idea of justice and then took a step further and put more emphasis on social order achaemenid king darius 522 486 bce invoked zoroastrian supreme god ahura mazda to reinstate justice that meant to him a social order by putting everyone in their own places by the grace of ahura mazda i restored everyone to their places darius s inscription reads 19 the idea of asha or cosmological order turned out to be very helpful to substantiate their argument about the necessity of social order in a way that not only the poor would be safe from the rich but the rich would be also spared from the poor 12 the significance of order in persians attitude toward justice may have come from a hierarchical tribal structure that underlay their layered society when they came in contact with mesopotamians in such a hierarchical social structure the static social classes and their organic relationships were of vital importance if a class stepped out of line with the hierarchical order the whole social system slipped into chaos since a change in a class could move other classes out of their conventional positions to different extents and accordingly the managerial communication between different layers of the society would be severed al jāhiz a 9th century arab writer has quoted ardeshir the founder of the sasanian empire as saying that no disaster is more destructive than the social classes mixing up and nothing can topple a government as quickly as does a disorder where the commoners would seize an opportunity to take the place of the nobles 36 this interpretation of justice proved to be at the service of a social caste system in which order simply meant a constitutional segregation pattern for this reason king khusrau i 512 579 ce rose to fame as dispenser of justice when he ardently restored the social order by subduing mazdak and his followers who intended to upend the established social caste system 6 10 11 13 14 27 28 in the 7th century ce islam came to iran with promises of establishing an equitable classless society 8 the zoroastrian clergymen lost their superior status and they were replaced by both persian and arab feudal lords who together formed a new upper class at the top of iran s social stratification 41 the arab political system perpetuated the same concept of justice according to which justice meant social order that should be secured in keeping with god s priorities 45 what changed in the new system was god s priority and the muslim rulers continued to define justice as the act of restoring everyone to their own places in the name of allah the same as did darius and his zoroastrian successors in the name of ahura mazda the order oriented approach was well reflected in imam ali s sermons in the 7th century ce in a famous statement as he said that justice puts everything in its own place 4 3 the circle of justice justice is historically based on social order and divine legitimacy and then plays a functional role in a loop of political economic relations which is called the circle of justice in the eyes of medieval persian rulers an ideal relation among a set of economic political social and military bodies underlies the circle of justice 34 which describes how any polity needs military power to ensure justice and how military needs a budget provided by agricultural taxes and why agriculture is impossible in the absence of justice 23 this circle has been formulated in a quotation from the sasanian king khusrau i 512 579 ce as saying royal power rests upon the army the army depends on finance finance on taxes taxes on irrigated cultivation and cultivation on justice 61 although the sasanians with their zoroastrian ideology seemingly sank into oblivion in the 7th century ce their political tradition including the same circle of justice stayed alive in their muslim successors for centuries about two centuries after khusrau i al mansur 714 775 ce the second abbasid caliph rehashed the same argument 2 the logic behind the circle of justice is a causal relation among at least seven elements fig 1a where the function of each element entails the other irrigated agriculture gives rise to a hierarchical taxation system that originates in the agricultural units and ends in the central government taxation begets royal budget and budget sets the stage for army for the first time a class of specialized warriors came into existence through such an agricultural economy whose considerable production surplus could support an organized taxation system 21 the military body assures the political power that its interpretation of justice is not challenged by the less advantaged classes the administration of justice brings about stability that is necessary for agricultural production as shah manuchehr says that the unjust treatment of people causes them to become disillusioned with the king and then more farmlands would be left uncultivated and then the king s profits would plummet down 9 justice was perceived as a force that puts everyone in their own places and this force could not be exerted without a costly army the stronger army the more justice the more stability and the higher agricultural production al hajjaj 661 714 ce governor of mesopotamia who showed no mercy to those questioning his interpretation of justice managed to raise the government s annual revenues to a total amount of 18 000 000 000 dirham through a taxation reform in mesopotamia compared to 128 000 000 dirham at the time of umar bin khattab al hajjaj s income was a stunning leap 5 saffah 721 754 ce first caliph of the abbasid dynasty is quoted as saying the government s integrity is contingent on justice though his name became a byword for brutality and revenge 55 the circle of justice unfolds on a national scale where a relationship between central government and production systems has to be regulated however a byproduct of the circle of justice is the circle of water justice that comes into existence on a local scale fig 1b 4 the circle of water justice in the circle of justice water serves to reinstate the government s interpretation of justice by providing the financial sources that help to perpetuate class inequalities however another circle may form on a local scale which culminates in a redistribution of wealth in the course of iran s history local landlords who presided over rural agricultural units served to be the first ring of a taxation chain that ended up in the central government amassing water shares brought the landlords a bigger chunk of agricultural revenues on the one hand and widened the gap between the rich landlords and the poor mass of farmers on the other as a result when the social inequality crossed the environmental and social tolerance lines different backlashes from the grass roots brought the tycoons wealth to the brink of redistribution the water tycoons might put their wealth at the risk of a governmental confiscation if such a social gap reached a boiling point for two reasons the central government was likely to expropriate the noticeable wealth of a water tycoon first social discontent came within the purview of justice for which the government was responsible any social discontent that could potentially hamper the production systems finally became a detriment to the central government s economy second most of the iranian governments used to supplement their tax revenues with plunder economy when their expenditures surpassed their regular revenues therefore the rich might be stripped of their wealth overnight on a religious or political pretext and in the name of justice a surge in the number of charitable donations was usually expressive of a downturn in political economy which could lead the government into a plunder economy 15 for example when mahmud 971 1030 ce the first ghaznavid king was faced with a tight budget he expropriated the properties of many tycoons of whom ahmad esfarayeni ibid p 608 khajeh ahmad meymandi 43 and hasanak vazir 18 were among the most notable historical figures at the time many of the rich had a stronger tendency to endow their wealth lest it is coveted by the rapacious ghaznavid king 48 sometimes this fear was eased but never disappeared for the water tycoons in the 14th century ce seyyed rokn al din donated 40 qanats 1 1 qanat is a subterranean tunnel that taps groundwater mostly for irrigation of his to charitable purposes 40 for fear of mubariz al din muhammad who had newly established his own dynasty ibid p 167 shah abbas 1571 1629 ce the fifth safavid king ran the same campaign to confiscate the wealth of the local dignitaries in order to procure a budget he needed for his political and military ambitions 16 as a result more and more water tycoons resorted to the endowment of their lands and waters which is called waqf ibid p 74 20 the donors were not fully severed from their endowments but they could legally retain custody of what they had donated in order to ensure that the profit well reached the needy waqf and charity organization 2017 p 31 and they were allowed to take one tenth of the revenues of their endowments in return for their supervision 31 this tradition is still extant in the present day iranian civil law article 75 52 it is better than nothing for a water tycoon to surrender his property fully or partially to the public as an endowment on condition that he still has a share of its income hence a water tycoon s fear for losing his wealth to the royal coffer was finally to the benefit of the poor this fear increased as the growing social discontent could potentially draw the attention of central government to the local water tycoons at this stage the tycoons tended to opt for waqf strategy that could redistribute part of their wealth in order to appease the lower class waqf can in turn exalt the donor s social status as a benevolent man who follows quran that orders all believers to endow their best properties and share what they obtain from the earth with others 38 therefore such a donor is encouraged to invest more in hydraulic production systems and obtain more water shares where the poor working class view his wealth as an opportunity rather than an oppressive discrimination however his increasing investment gradually yields a noticeable wealth that can easily attract the central government and this circle continues fig 1b 5 the circle of water justice in iran s contemporary history as shown in fig 2 the historical circles figs 1a and 1b have evolved into a new circle of water justice that has incorporated some modern elements into the same historical pattern justice is the starting point of this circle which sets the stage for the other elements after the 1979 revolution a fusion between iranians traditional conception of justice and modern political philosophies gave rise to a variation of rawlsian justice that arranged socio economic inequalities to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society 62 the least advantaged members of society were called mostaz af in the political literature of the islamic republic who belonged to the working class most of the revolutionary forces had come from the same social origin with promises of retrieving justice for all mostaz af people nonetheless they later deviated from their own social origin and its associated values to the extent that iran s supreme leader had to change the vocabulary definition of the word mostaz af in one of his sermons 2 2 he proclaimed that some have misunderstood the meaning of mostaz af as the lower class but quran defines mostaz af as those who are heir to the earth and its wealth mostaz af is imam and the leader of people 44 after a widespread demonstration staged by the poor working class in november 2019 in protest against the governmental injustice 44 this interpretation of justice tried to reorganize the water resources which were believed to have been usurped by the former secular regime therefore a specific law entitled water just distribution was passed by iran s parliament in 1982 according to which iran s ministry of energy was assigned the task of storing rivers water in the reservoirs and building water transfer pipelines 59 at present 647 dams are operational across iran of which 628 dams have been built after the 1979 revolution 1 moreover 17 inter basin pipelines were built to transfer water from one basin to another table 1 water just distribution paved the way for many strategic industries to find a safe haven on the arid central plateau of iran through damming and transferring water from the western provinces every year more than 2 5 billion cubic meters of water is transferred to only 7 central cities that are appropriating about 56 percent of all transferred waters in the country 51 although at first drinking purpose and domestic sector were alleged to be the sole reasons behind those water transfer projects industries were never deprived of a good share the transferred water made it possible for the government to establish and develop such strategic industries as iron copper and petrochemical plants in those central arid cities that enjoyed more geopolitical security compared to the water abundant frontier regions fig 3 despite the high demand of such industries for water for example yazd s steel factory produces about 1000 tons of steel per day for which it consumes about 25 000 cubic meters of water 24 it seems that dam construction and water transfer programs are nearing their full capacity and the iranian government is resorting to another alternative seawater desalination and its transfer to the same central plateau the first megaproject of this kind is a 975 kilometer pipeline that is still under way this pipeline is to transfer water from a desalination plant in the coastal province of hormozgan to sarcheshmeh copper company in kerman and then the iron foundries in yazd 42 development of such strategic industries in the arid center earned the government a considerable income and reduced its dependence on oil economy only iron steel cast iron and copper constitute about 10 percent of the country s exports 57 which is beholden to the water transferred mostly from the western provinces such revenues in turn contributed to iran s political resilience during the international sanctions that almost paralyzed its oil economy water megaprojects helped iran s polity to diversify its economy by establishing its strategic industries in the safe arid center which could bring them the budget and power they needed to maintain their own version of justice however this circle of water justice resulted in the drying up of many inland lakes and swamps 50 submerged many historical heritages and eventually fomented water conflicts between the rivers upstream and downstream 46 the water transfer is taking place in the basins which have been populated by kurd lur arab and fars communities for centuries and a project that manipulates their territorial water resources can easily trigger multiple conflicts along the ethnic faults 3 the government s programs have instilled a sense of deprivation into the central communities such that they now conceive water justice as an equal distribution of iran s water resources among all provinces regardless of their geographical and ecological differences on the other hand the western provinces view such water transfer projects as the plunder of their water resources that are being taken away on the pretext of drinking water supply but in reality it is being used lavishly by the industries in the middle of a desert now both sides feel that water justice is withheld from them alike some areas have entered double conflicts like isfahan that brings water from the area of chahar mahal on the one hand and delivers part of its water to the area of yazd on the other 25 in 2013 and again in 2016 the farmers of isfahan staged a large demonstration that culminated in blowing up the isfahan yazd pipeline in the belief that yazd steals their water share 47 on the other hand the farmers of chahar mahal have repeatedly protested against transferring their water share to isfahan which may snowball into a social crisis 54 it seems that the domino of water protest is spreading to the other regions as in july 2021 angry residents of several cities and towns in khuzestan took to the streets to protest against severe water shortages caused by transferring water from their two rivers karun and karkheh to chahar mahal and isfahan 17 6 conclusion the historical circle of justice was anchored in a floating interpretation of justice that was always justified by social order and divine legitimacy such a circle gave the iranian polities a free rein to unequally distribute their water resources although the circle of justice served to reinforce the position of the ruling class through appropriating water resources it contributed to a political disintegration in the long run due to marginalizing a considerable part of society it was the same circle that made the sasanian empire build a number of irrigation canals on the eastern bank of the tigris to transfer water to the loyal persian communities who had come from the iranian plateau on the king s order to unbalance the region s ethnic composition and the same circle paved the way for the sasanians fall 21 when this canal system was made redundant by another canal branching off from the western bank of the tigris instead conveying water to the north of western baghdad 33 the circle of justice tends to allocate water to those who were expected to ensure a ceaseless flow of wealth into the royal treasury the sasanian s hydraulic mission was a systematic outcome of the circle of justice that have evolved into a modern circle of water justice in today s iran although this circle is structurally an amalgamation between the traditional conception of justice and modern policies its external expression is still reminiscent of the sasanians iran s government is transferring water from the western provinces to the arid center that is relatively far away from all frontiers and is geopolitically safer the center is populated mostly by persian shia muslims and also it has a history of relative loyalty to the islamic government unlike the western and southwestern provinces whose heterogenous ethnicities have always been under suspicion of rebellion therefore the government tends to concentrate its strategic industries on the central plateau the islamic republic of iran came to power with promises of redistributing water resources according to the circle of water justice that entailed damming and transferring hundreds of rivers however the negative impact of such water transfer is manifested in ecological disruption farmlands degradation poverty and massive outmigration in the western and southwestern provinces on the other hand the water transfer projects have made the central cities experience an alarming rate of population growth that they have never witnessed in their entire history we have learned from thomas malthus that population when unchecked increases in a geometrical ratio but subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio 37 for this simple reason water supply projects always lag behind the population growth in iran s central cities for example in the city of yazd the government carried out a megaproject that transferred water from zayandeh rood river that new source of water paved the way for many industries with a high water demand to flourish in yazd which drew a considerable population such that more than 37 percent of industrial workforce of yazd have migrated from other provinces 30 after one decade the population growth surpassed the available amount of water and the government had to build another pipeline that transferred more water from a tributary of karoon river to yazd however much the government conveys water to yazd it does not keep up with the cancerous growth of the industrial sites and residential areas which was triggered by water transfer in the first place such a growth in the region s population necessitated an increase in urban infrastructures giving rise to an unprecedented urban sprawl that is fully disproportional to yazd s ecological capacity the urban sprawl in turn becomes a further attraction for the next waves of migration this vicious cycle continues solely on the basis of an unsustainable water source that can be cut off at any time by a variety of factors from a simple blackout to a regional water conflict moreover the past experiences show that every new source for water transfer would be exhausted sooner or later and the search for another source of water transfer cannot be carried out for all eternity any disruption to such a water supply system would confront the government with a large population that vigorously demands for water justice a situation that heralds hydraulic collapse as a result iran s growing water crisis cannot be defused unless the circle of water justice is fundamentally reformed iran s hydraulic mission is not the culprit but it is only the outcome of a hidden mechanism named the circle of water justice this circle is rooted in history and is mostly premised on an anachronistic conception of justice we cannot convince the ruling class to adopt a sustainable water governance where their interpretation of justice inclines them to prioritize all water demands based on their proximity to the core of power and the degree of their contribution to political economy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

mubariz al din muhammad who had newly established his own dynasty ibid p 167 shah abbas 1571 1629 ce the fifth safavid king ran the same campaign to confiscate the wealth of the local dignitaries in order to procure a budget he needed for his political and military ambitions 16 as a result more and more water tycoons resorted to the endowment of their lands and waters which is called waqf ibid p 74 20 the donors were not fully severed from their endowments but they could legally retain custody of what they had donated in order to ensure that the profit well reached the needy waqf and charity organization 2017 p 31 and they were allowed to take one tenth of the revenues of their endowments in return for their supervision 31 this tradition is still extant in the present day iranian civil law article 75 52 it is better than nothing for a water tycoon to surrender his property fully or partially to the public as an endowment on condition that he still has a share of its income hence a water tycoon s fear for losing his wealth to the royal coffer was finally to the benefit of the poor this fear increased as the growing social discontent could potentially draw the attention of central government to the local water tycoons at this stage the tycoons tended to opt for waqf strategy that could redistribute part of their wealth in order to appease the lower class waqf can in turn exalt the donor s social status as a benevolent man who follows quran that orders all believers to endow their best properties and share what they obtain from the earth with others 38 therefore such a donor is encouraged to invest more in hydraulic production systems and obtain more water shares where the poor working class view his wealth as an opportunity rather than an oppressive discrimination however his increasing investment gradually yields a noticeable wealth that can easily attract the central government and this circle continues fig 1b 5 the circle of water justice in iran s contemporary history as shown in fig 2 the historical circles figs 1a and 1b have evolved into a new circle of water justice that has incorporated some modern elements into the same historical pattern justice is the starting point of this circle which sets the stage for the other elements after the 1979 revolution a fusion between iranians traditional conception of justice and modern political philosophies gave rise to a variation of rawlsian justice that arranged socio economic inequalities to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society 62 the least advantaged members of society were called mostaz af in the political literature of the islamic republic who belonged to the working class most of the revolutionary forces had come from the same social origin with promises of retrieving justice for all mostaz af people nonetheless they later deviated from their own social origin and its associated values to the extent that iran s supreme leader had to change the vocabulary definition of the word mostaz af in one of his sermons 2 2 he proclaimed that some have misunderstood the meaning of mostaz af as the lower class but quran defines mostaz af as those who are heir to the earth and its wealth mostaz af is imam and the leader of people 44 after a widespread demonstration staged by the poor working class in november 2019 in protest against the governmental injustice 44 this interpretation of justice tried to reorganize the water resources which were believed to have been usurped by the former secular regime therefore a specific law entitled water just distribution was passed by iran s parliament in 1982 according to which iran s ministry of energy was assigned the task of storing rivers water in the reservoirs and building water transfer pipelines 59 at present 647 dams are operational across iran of which 628 dams have been built after the 1979 revolution 1 moreover 17 inter basin pipelines were built to transfer water from one basin to another table 1 water just distribution paved the way for many strategic industries to find a safe haven on the arid central plateau of iran through damming and transferring water from the western provinces every year more than 2 5 billion cubic meters of water is transferred to only 7 central cities that are appropriating about 56 percent of all transferred waters in the country 51 although at first drinking purpose and domestic sector were alleged to be the sole reasons behind those water transfer projects industries were never deprived of a good share the transferred water made it possible for the government to establish and develop such strategic industries as iron copper and petrochemical plants in those central arid cities that enjoyed more geopolitical security compared to the water abundant frontier regions fig 3 despite the high demand of such industries for water for example yazd s steel factory produces about 1000 tons of steel per day for which it consumes about 25 000 cubic meters of water 24 it seems that dam construction and water transfer programs are nearing their full capacity and the iranian government is resorting to another alternative seawater desalination and its transfer to the same central plateau the first megaproject of this kind is a 975 kilometer pipeline that is still under way this pipeline is to transfer water from a desalination plant in the coastal province of hormozgan to sarcheshmeh copper company in kerman and then the iron foundries in yazd 42 development of such strategic industries in the arid center earned the government a considerable income and reduced its dependence on oil economy only iron steel cast iron and copper constitute about 10 percent of the country s exports 57 which is beholden to the water transferred mostly from the western provinces such revenues in turn contributed to iran s political resilience during the international sanctions that almost paralyzed its oil economy water megaprojects helped iran s polity to diversify its economy by establishing its strategic industries in the safe arid center which could bring them the budget and power they needed to maintain their own version of justice however this circle of water justice resulted in the drying up of many inland lakes and swamps 50 submerged many historical heritages and eventually fomented water conflicts between the rivers upstream and downstream 46 the water transfer is taking place in the basins which have been populated by kurd lur arab and fars communities for centuries and a project that manipulates their territorial water resources can easily trigger multiple conflicts along the ethnic faults 3 the government s programs have instilled a sense of deprivation into the central communities such that they now conceive water justice as an equal distribution of iran s water resources among all provinces regardless of their geographical and ecological differences on the other hand the western provinces view such water transfer projects as the plunder of their water resources that are being taken away on the pretext of drinking water supply but in reality it is being used lavishly by the industries in the middle of a desert now both sides feel that water justice is withheld from them alike some areas have entered double conflicts like isfahan that brings water from the area of chahar mahal on the one hand and delivers part of its water to the area of yazd on the other 25 in 2013 and again in 2016 the farmers of isfahan staged a large demonstration that culminated in blowing up the isfahan yazd pipeline in the belief that yazd steals their water share 47 on the other hand the farmers of chahar mahal have repeatedly protested against transferring their water share to isfahan which may snowball into a social crisis 54 it seems that the domino of water protest is spreading to the other regions as in july 2021 angry residents of several cities and towns in khuzestan took to the streets to protest against severe water shortages caused by transferring water from their two rivers karun and karkheh to chahar mahal and isfahan 17 6 conclusion the historical circle of justice was anchored in a floating interpretation of justice that was always justified by social order and divine legitimacy such a circle gave the iranian polities a free rein to unequally distribute their water resources although the circle of justice served to reinforce the position of the ruling class through appropriating water resources it contributed to a political disintegration in the long run due to marginalizing a considerable part of society it was the same circle that made the sasanian empire build a number of irrigation canals on the eastern bank of the tigris to transfer water to the loyal persian communities who had come from the iranian plateau on the king s order to unbalance the region s ethnic composition and the same circle paved the way for the sasanians fall 21 when this canal system was made redundant by another canal branching off from the western bank of the tigris instead conveying water to the north of western baghdad 33 the circle of justice tends to allocate water to those who were expected to ensure a ceaseless flow of wealth into the royal treasury the sasanian s hydraulic mission was a systematic outcome of the circle of justice that have evolved into a modern circle of water justice in today s iran although this circle is structurally an amalgamation between the traditional conception of justice and modern policies its external expression is still reminiscent of the sasanians iran s government is transferring water from the western provinces to the arid center that is relatively far away from all frontiers and is geopolitically safer the center is populated mostly by persian shia muslims and also it has a history of relative loyalty to the islamic government unlike the western and southwestern provinces whose heterogenous ethnicities have always been under suspicion of rebellion therefore the government tends to concentrate its strategic industries on the central plateau the islamic republic of iran came to power with promises of redistributing water resources according to the circle of water justice that entailed damming and transferring hundreds of rivers however the negative impact of such water transfer is manifested in ecological disruption farmlands degradation poverty and massive outmigration in the western and southwestern provinces on the other hand the water transfer projects have made the central cities experience an alarming rate of population growth that they have never witnessed in their entire history we have learned from thomas malthus that population when unchecked increases in a geometrical ratio but subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio 37 for this simple reason water supply projects always lag behind the population growth in iran s central cities for example in the city of yazd the government carried out a megaproject that transferred water from zayandeh rood river that new source of water paved the way for many industries with a high water demand to flourish in yazd which drew a considerable population such that more than 37 percent of industrial workforce of yazd have migrated from other provinces 30 after one decade the population growth surpassed the available amount of water and the government had to build another pipeline that transferred more water from a tributary of karoon river to yazd however much the government conveys water to yazd it does not keep up with the cancerous growth of the industrial sites and residential areas which was triggered by water transfer in the first place such a growth in the region s population necessitated an increase in urban infrastructures giving rise to an unprecedented urban sprawl that is fully disproportional to yazd s ecological capacity the urban sprawl in turn becomes a further attraction for the next waves of migration this vicious cycle continues solely on the basis of an unsustainable water source that can be cut off at any time by a variety of factors from a simple blackout to a regional water conflict moreover the past experiences show that every new source for water transfer would be exhausted sooner or later and the search for another source of water transfer cannot be carried out for all eternity any disruption to such a water supply system would confront the government with a large population that vigorously demands for water justice a situation that heralds hydraulic collapse as a result iran s growing water crisis cannot be defused unless the circle of water justice is fundamentally reformed iran s hydraulic mission is not the culprit but it is only the outcome of a hidden mechanism named the circle of water justice this circle is rooted in history and is mostly premised on an anachronistic conception of justice we cannot convince the ruling class to adopt a sustainable water governance where their interpretation of justice inclines them to prioritize all water demands based on their proximity to the core of power and the degree of their contribution to political economy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

20104,climate change is leading to increasing hydrological extremes and quicker shifts between wet and dry extremes in many regions these extremes and rapid shifts put pressure on reservoir operations decreasing the reliability of water supply flood control and other reservoir benefits decision makers across all levels from reservoir operators to flood plain residents turn to heuristics to simplify decisions when faced with complexity and uncertainty resulting in cognitive biases or systematic errors in decision making while cognitive biases are not new climate change is exacerbating their impact for two reasons 1 heuristics just as infrastructure are based on experience with historic conditions 2 fragilities created by these cognitive biases can go undetected until extreme events occur if not acknowledged and managed these cognitive biases can lead to catastrophic failures of reservoirs and other infrastructure to minimize risk of such catastrophic failure we propose a multi level approach to flood and drought management one that strikes a balance between centralized and decentralized approaches such an approach is better able to cope with uncertain and changing conditions because it creates overlaps and diversity which can respond to a wide range of conditions and builds checks and balances that mitigate cognitive biases latent in various decision making units keywords reservoir cognitive bias climate change flooding drought socio hydrology 1 the 2011 brisbane flood cognitive biases at multiple levels of decision making in january 2011 brisbane home to 2 5 million people and the capital of queensland australia flooded so catastrophically that a million people had to be evacuated it was the most severe flood event in over a century in brisbane and australia s most expensive natural disaster to date 1 brisbane built in the floodplain of the brisbane river is no stranger to flooding 2 3 intense summer monsoon rainfall is common in queensland particularly during the la nina phase of enso 4 the somerset dam was constructed in 1953 on the stanley river a tributary to the brisbane river to mitigate flooding and increase water supply reliability later the 1974 flood strengthened support for the planned wivenhoe dam on the brisbane river 2 with the construction of the wivenhoe dam the city of brisbane was considered flood proof 5 the january 2011 flood was the first large flood to test the dam how did the wivenhoe dam fail its first test with the flood crisis in the rearview mirror attention then turned to why and how such a disaster could have occurred while several days of intense rainfall was clearly a factor the flood operation decisions at the wivenhoe and somerset dams were also called into question causes and culpability were debated in the queensland floods commission of inquiry 6 the media 1 7 and the courts 8 the debate centered around dams and the dam operators 2 ultimately the court found that the flood operations engineers though with no malintent failed to fully comply with the flood control manual by disregarding forecast information and neglecting to lower reservoir levels below full supply level the water supply volume in advance of the flood wave 8 but why would the engineers make risky decisions in opposition to the flood control manual at the center of the ruling was the question of how the flood operation engineers weighed information including observed rainfall forecasted rain and the recent drought like many reservoirs globally somerset and wivenhoe dams provide water supply storage for the brisbane metropolitan region in addition to their role in flood control and these two objectives are in tension rules and regulations specify how these tradeoffs should be made but reservoir operators exercise their discretion within the bounds of these rules and can as seen in the brisbane case violate them the engineers with much to lose and nothing to gain in these decisions were not acting rationally in violating the flood control manual in this they are not alone people commonly use heuristics to simplify complex decisions particularly when operating under time constraints and uncertainty 9 10 these simplifying heuristics result in cognitive biases box 1 or systematic errors in decision making the 2011 flooding of brisbane australia occurred at the end of the decade long millennium drought a period in which dam operators struggled to meet water supply objectives and flood control was back of mind we posit that this experience may have led to a cognitive bias affecting decision making during the 2011 flood that is the operators recent experience with drought may have prompted them to under weight the risk of extreme flooding and over weight the risk of water supply deficit this bias toward recent easier to recall experiences when assessing probabilities is referred to as availability bias 9 availability bias is one of several cognitive biases that may shape decision making in reservoir operation and more broadly flood and drought management box 1 the perils of cognitive biases are not exclusive to dam operators the bias that the city of brisbane is flood proof became widely shared among the general public after construction of the wivenhoe dam although this was only an illusion in hindsight 5 theory suggests that such a false sense of security can lead to complacency and gradual withering of intangible societal level capacity that plays a critical role during emergencies 11 15 this may have been the case in brisbane with this collective sense of perceived flood security came decades of expansion into the flood plain simultaneously reducing natural flood control infrastructure downstream of the dam and increasing the population at risk 2 as observed in other cases the success of controlling variability through large centralized infrastructure e g reservoirs reduced the incentive to maintain capacity to manage such variability throughout the watershed 16 17 the case of brisbane is illustrative but not exemplary there are other examples of recent experiences shaping reservoir operators decisions from maintenance e g oroville dam 18 to releases e g lake mendocino see box 1 further there are numerous cases where the broader public s memory or awareness of hazards decreases as reservoirs and other large scale infrastructure control variability 17 19 20 understanding the implications of both biases dam operators bias toward more available experiences and societal level bias toward the myth of hazard immunity and the way these two biases interact with infrastructure built to control floods and droughts is particularly important in the context of climate change adaptation there is increasing evidence that climate change is intensifying extremes and accelerating the shift between dry and wet extremes worsening the perils of these two biases 21 24 here we review the challenges of climatic change and decision making biases for flood and drought management discuss the emerging technical and policy responses and make the case for a whole system perspective box 1 cognitive biases in dam operation as in the 2011 brisbane flood the combined cognitive biases of both operators and floodplain society may result in unpredicted catastrophic events 1 let us look at another multi purpose reservoir to explore the possible cognitive biases of operators lake mendocino reservoir coyote valley dam on the east fork of the russian river in mendocino county california provides water supply and flood control as seen in fig box 1 1 the operator did not strictly follow the operational rule in the transition period march to may from the flood season to the dry season to store excessive water refer to the observed reservoir storage black line in the water year 2007 this anomalous operation may have been in response to previous drought and may be helpful for mitigating water shortage but there is a chance of heavy rain during the transition period to avoid increased disaster risk it is necessary to know how the operator s memory of the previous disaster affects their decision making behavior in reservoir operation we developed a simple reservoir operation model and conducted scenario analysis to assess how different types of cognitive biases influence the decision making of a reservoir operator in the model the reservoir operator controls the discharge rate in consideration of the storage level state variable and the operational rule target using a proportional integral derivative pid controller which is widely used in engineering systems 25 pid controller is a kind of feedback control that uses the output of the system as a part of its control pid controller consists of three controls 1 proportional deviation of state variable from the target p control 2 integral deviation of state variable from the target i control and 3 derivative rate of change deviation of state variable from the target d control we created four scenarios concerning the operator s bias with different configurations of the pid controller box table1 1 as the baseline scenario we assume that the operator is perfectly rational no bias and their decisions are not affected by their past experiences because the operator strictly follows the operation rule the perfect rationality scenario uses only p and d control there are numerous types of cognitive biases documented in the psychological literature 26 28 we selected three representative types that are most relevant to disaster memory salience bias gambler s fallacy and availability bias for the following three scenarios we set the same period and implemented i control as the accumulated past disaster damages either flood or water shortage according to the assumption of each scenario in addition to p and d control salience bias predisposes individuals to focus on remarkable and emotionally striking events 29 for the salience bias scenario we posit that the operator believes that the most severe disaster in the past would happen again salience bias scenario uses the relative damage of the most severe disasters to inform the i control under the gambler s fallacy individuals believe that the probability of a random event in the future is influenced by that type of event in the past 30 in the gambler s fallacy scenario the operator believes that the most frequent disaster in the past would happen again this scenario uses the relative damage of the most frequent disasters as i control with availability bias people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward the latest information 31 in the availability bias scenario the operator believes that the most recent disaster would happen again this scenario uses the relative damage of the most recent disasters as i control the simulation results of each scenario and the goodness of fit compared to the observed data are shown in box figure1 1 here we are not aiming to prove a specific cognitive bias is present but instead explore what types of biases provide a better fit for observed patterns in lake mendocino perfect rationality shows the lowest goodness of fit which implies the operator was least likely to be strictly following the operational rule gambler s fallacy and availability bias return plausible explanatory power indicating that the operator is likely affected by the most frequent and recent events in the past these findings do not mean that one specific type of cognitive bias governs the decision making of operators reservoir operation can be affected by the combination of different types of cognitive biases instead these results demonstrate the importance of considering cognitive biases in reservoir operation box table1 1 reservoir operat or s biases

reservoir operator s biases of lake mendocino ca 1995 2020 and goodness of fit of each scenario 2 weather extremes and reservoir operation unintended consequences climate change is driving shifts in temporal and spatial hydrological patterns increases in extreme high precipitation are projected under climate change 5 10 c 23 32 33 higher temperatures have the potential to drive the acceleration of the hydrological cycle however the projected increase in global mean precipitation is modest around 3 c 34 because the increasing extreme high precipitation is offset by an increase in the number of dry days 35 and the frequency of dry spells 36 further increasing temperatures raise evapotranspiration exacerbating drought and further stressing water supply systems 37 38 due to their non linear processes watersheds themselves have the potential to amplify variability inherent in precipitation 39 even within particular regions the effect on individual rivers varies for example blöschl et al 40 found that changes in mean flood discharge varies between an 11 percent increase and a 23 percent decrease within europe between 1960 and 2010 beyond intensifying extreme precipitation increasingly quick shifts between dry and wet extremes referred to as weather whiplash are projected in some regions e g california u s and the mid western u s 21 24 41 and observed in others e g southern south america and northern asia 42 storage both natural and constructed helps to balance periods of extreme high and low precipitation increasing extreme drought and extreme wet weather require more storage space to meet water supply and flood control objectives yet the available storage volume can only serve one purpose at once declines in snowpack with rising temperatures 43 44 and groundwater due to unsustainable pumping 45 46 lower natural storage putting greater pressure on reservoirs snow drought further exacerbates the tension between water supply and flood control storage in snow dominated systems 18 reservoirs play a key role in mitigating hydrological variability but their design and operating rules assume historic hydrological conditions which in many regions is no longer a valid assumption 47 traditionally operational plans for reservoirs that serve water supply and flood control objectives are developed based on historical streamflow current and projected demand and past performance of operational decisions while this approach to reservoir operation has been historically effective the ability to meet both water supply and flood control objectives declines as extremes intensify 48 this is due to both that the infrastructure and operations have been fit to past hydrological patterns and that operators consistent with other decision makers draw on heuristics to simplify complex decisions and these heuristics are constructed from past experiences 20 49 how and when to change reservoirs and their operating rules in response to changing conditions is not a straightforward question the potential for reservoir expansion or addition of reservoirs is in many regions limited by cost space and ecosystem concerns so attention is directed to changes in operations adaptive reservoir operations are one response that aims to improve performance without changes to physical infrastructure by incorporating current observations and forecasts to adjust system operations in response to changing conditions 50 over the past decade research has demonstrated the value of adaptive reservoir management across various climatic and socio economic settings 48 51 52 by institutionalizing adaptive controls based on current observations and forecasts this approach can also inhibit the availability bias by explicitly guiding how operators should incorporate new information however there are limits to the amount of additional variability that adaptive operations can enable reservoirs to mitigate for example in the russian river located in sonoma and mendocino counties in northern california where adaptive reservoir operations are already in place extreme drought is still resulting in water supply reductions 53 this suggests that additional layers of capacity or infrastructure should be in place across the watershed to absorb residual variability left by reservoirs building and maintaining such capacity throughout the watershed is therefore of critical importance to resilience at system level more importantly components of such capacity are often interdependent with the centralized infrastructure and one another affecting system level outcomes in subtle ways for example although adaptive operation of reservoirs can help to control additional variability this extra margin of adaptability and thus greater stability can come at the cost of reduced learning opportunities by individuals and groups distributed throughout the watershed thereby amplifying the myth of hazard immunity in ways that undermine system level resilience in the long run fig 1 neither the problems nor the solutions are solely in the realm of reservoirs instead watersheds are complex evolving systems comprised of interacting components governed through regulatory feedback a whole system perspective is therefore needed to both diagnose the problem and identify solutions 3 a systems perspective from reservoir to coupled infrastructure system a reservoir is part of a larger whole an interdependent system of watershed and society with many interacting components that respond and adapt to either too much or not enough water fig 2 here we interpret the qualitative behavior of the system by applying the lens of coupled infrastructure system cis a systems perspective that views the larger whole as a constellation of several different types of infrastructure or capacities that are distributed and adapted to deal with recurrent disturbances 54 these infrastructure types include hard infrastructure natural infrastructure soft infrastructure human infrastructure and social infrastructure the various elements of the watershed and society belong to these different types of capacities and these elements become well adapted over time to instill robustness to typical disturbances in the context of floods and droughts reservoirs represent a centralized hard infrastructure and are one way to manage streamflow variability in the overall system there are other elements in the system that have capacity to manage drought and flood periods for example the skills and knowledge of reservoir operators human infrastructure and the reservoir operating rules they follow soft infrastructure can influence the impacts of floods and droughts the capacity of floodplain residents to organize collective action social infrastructure in sandbagging evacuation and advocating for rule changes can affect flood impacts similarly farmers cooperation for water conservation and sustainable use of water resources social infrastructure can mitigate drought impacts policy from local to federal is also social infrastructure that influences whether and how these distributed practices are adopted and maintained 55 56 wetlands rain gardens and re opening flood plains natural infrastructure are distributed approaches for managing flooding 57 58 at the system level these different capacities work in concert to make the system robust to a set of disturbances and there are multiple decision makers involved in the process to influence how these capacities are modified fig 2 yet the system can still be fragile to different types of disturbances theory suggests that tradeoffs often arise among these different types of infrastructure across multiple scales 59 increasing the success of one infrastructure in mitigating a particular type of hydrological variability can undermine the coping capacity present in other types of infrastructure or the capacity of the same infrastructure to deal with a different variability fig 1 for example dam operators and their operating rules well adapted to drought conditions can undermine the human infrastructure for dealing with flood conditions in the form of cognitive biases such as the availability bias 9 in addition such tradeoffs in fragility are often hidden until revealed by catastrophic failures especially when adaptive feedback controls are present for example heavy reliance on hard infrastructures such as centralized reservoirs and levees or increased complexity in their operational rules can help to filter out additional variability and thus achieve greater stability 17 20 however this extra margin of stability reduces opportunities for individual and social learning and might lead to complacency erosion of collective memory about floods a form of cognitive bias and loss of social capacity to organize voluntary group actions for response and recovery social infrastructure resulting in greater vulnerability to rarer floods in the long run for example in the us a program to buy back land to re open flood plains natural infrastructure along the mississippi and missouri rivers was counteracted by social forgetfulness and increased downstream development in long protected flood plains 60 such tradeoffs can also arise with respect to droughts the reservoir effect is another socio hydrologic phenomenon that describes instances where over reliance on water infrastructure increases water dependence and demand and therefore increases the potential damage from water shortages 19 the reservoir effect is a particular case of the broader safe development paradox in which reduced risk increases settlement in vulnerable areas resulting in increased damage 61 this phenomenon of highly effective control of variability eroding capacity to manage different frequencies or types of shocks extends both to other infrastructure systems 62 and to social and ecological systems broadly 11 15 critically this eroded capacity is amplifying vulnerability to increasingly extreme floods and droughts however rebuilding this capacity is also an opportunity particularly in places with limited possibility for more robust reservoir storage to sum it up some fragilities are inevitable in a complex watershed system because of the inherent interdependencies and tradeoffs resilience lies in systematically managing such tradeoffs through proactive sensing and anticipatory management and in ways that mitigate cognitive biases of the infrastructure operators and the general public with this systems perspective we can now interpret the flooding of brisbane in 2011 as a coupled infrastructure system box 2 a key insight is that the catastrophic outcome of the event cannot be attributed only to the natural hazard the reservoir capacity hard infrastructure or the biases of dam operators and agencies human infrastructure because of the societal level bias about flood immunity and the economic and population growth in brisbane since the 1970s a large share of the population in the region were either new to the area or of a younger generation who did not directly experience the 1974 flood 2 it is likely the case that brisbane s social infrastructure of collective flood memory eroded substantially by 2011 as suggested by the fact that the general population chose to expand and settle in the floodplains 1 63 this collective forgetfulness and associated encroachment on the floodplains coupled with the availability bias of the dam operators likely set the stage for the catastrophic outcome of the 2011 flooding 64 65 awareness of the potential for cognitive biases to shape decision making in reservoir operators and the general public could have alerted regulators or other decision makers for the potential for catastrophic failures further a coupled infrastructure systems approach to managing floods and droughts could have identified ways to reduce the consequences of reservoir failure box 2 a system perspective on the 2011 brisbane flood the catastrophic 2011 flooding of brisbane unfolded through the interaction of hydrological events reservoir design and operations land use change and regional community flood awareness this web of interactions requires a broad systems perspective capable of capturing an interconnected system of social hydrological natural and technological components in which a reservoir and its operating organization are embedded box figure 2 1 brisbane river catchment and floodplain 66 we adopt the lens of cis to the brisbane watershed box figure 2 1 the cis is an approach characterized by four generic components resource resource users public infrastructure and public infrastructure providers their relationships and how these components and relationships influence the capacity of a cis to withstand internal stresses or external disturbances box figure 2 2a 67 these components represent different types of capacity or infrastructure hard infrastructure natural infrastructure soft infrastructure human infrastructure and social infrastructure that are distributed and fine tuned to deal with recurrent disturbances 54 below we apply the cis lens to the brisbane case by describing how different components and capacities that reside in brisbane s watershed can be interpreted in terms of the cis components we also map the linkages among them box figure 2 2b resource i e natural

seqwater 71 seqwater operates somerset and wivenhoe dams and follows the approved flood mitigation manual and other operational documents the operation of somerset and wivenhoe dams are subject to federal regulation under the water supply safety and reliability act of 2008 and changes to the flood mitigation manual require approval of the minster 3 4 preparing for a new abnormal while cognitive biases have long been present in infrastructure operation and the way the general public thinks about natural hazards the vulnerability caused by these cognitive biases can remain hidden until extreme events occur centralized infrastructure has performed well so well in fact that it has reduced impacts sufficiently to lower the incentives to develop and maintain all types of decentralized infrastructure 16 19 72 fig 1 this is in part a product of societal scale cognitive bias the combination of intensifying hydrological extremes operator cognitive biases and erosion of distributed capacity compounds vulnerability existing hard infrastructure designed to control historic hydrologic variability will not be able to attenuate all increased variability impacting water users and flood plain residents more frequent hydrological extremes under climate change will expose more of these vulnerabilities the hard way we suggest that preparing for a new abnormal in such changing environments requires a multi level approach to flood and drought management one that strikes a balance between centralized and decentralized approaches this feature referred to by many as polycentricity 73 74 is characterized by having multiple overlapping centers of oversight and decision making at higher and lower organizational levels e g the presence of flood or drought mitigation strategies at multiple levels ranging from household and community levels to local and federal agency levels systems with this multi level feature are known to be better able to cope with uncertain and changing conditions because of overlaps and diversity in response 73 75 in flood and drought management it signifies maintaining diversity in response and function through a balance among different cis components or between centralized infrastructure e g reservoirs and levees and coping capacities distributed throughout the watershed e g flood plain wetlands and organizational capacity for water conservation applying this way of thinking to management in the long term can help to build adaptability for the unknown and unknowable future at the centralized level increasing storage capacity of reservoirs through expansion e g heightening of roosevelt dam on the salt river 76 or new construction can be a measure to reducing vulnerability but this is infeasible or limited in many regions hard infrastructure particularly large and centralized water infrastructure have limited ability to adapt due their large scale rigidity and interconnections with other critical systems 77 in absence of opportunities for new infrastructure development or modification of existing hard infrastructure increasing the adaptability of reservoir operation rules a soft infrastructure can raise watershed system robustness 77 79 improved use of information and adaptive rules can make reservoir operations more agile enhancing the centralized capacity to deal with fluctuating conditions 80 81 the tradeoffs inherent in the cis components however suggest that cautions must be taken with an over reliance on adaptive operations of reservoirs centralized approaches alone are insufficient as outlined above a multi level polycentric effort is needed to promote and maintain complementary capacities across the watershed system measures such as effective public risk communication that reinforces collective flood memory establishment of green or natural infrastructure distributed across the watershed anticipatory land use and hazard mitigation plans by local municipalities household level strategies such as elevating buildings xeriscaping and drip irrigation and voluntary group actions activated in times of emergency all work to generate overlaps and diversity in response 73 this view is aligned with the observation that infrastructure design in a changing climate needs to shift from fail safe to safe to fail fail safe infrastructure is designed to avoid failure under specified operating conditions safe to fail infrastructure anticipates the potential for failure and designs to contain and learn from the impacts 82 83 we agree with ahern 82 and kim et al 83 that under a changing climate infrastructure has an increased risk of failure and there is a greater need to prepare for that failure in line with yu et al 73 we suggest that working across scales and space in the watershed not only increases redundancy but also diversity increasing the likelihood that the system can respond to unanticipated types of shocks as well as increasing magnitudes of familiar shocks for example decentralized infrastructure systems also have the added benefit of increased flexibility due modality and its smaller scale can enable piloting of new techniques and technologies 84 a polycentric system that manages extremes events through both large scale hard infrastructure and capacities distributed throughout the system will be better positioned to weather accelerating climate change we also argue that polycentric approach creates checks and balances that mitigate cognitive biases latent in various decision making units adaptive reservoir operation can provide an added benefit of preventing reservoir operators availability bias by explicitly guiding how operators should incorporate new information operational policies of centralized infrastructure can be made more adaptive to alert operators to potential biases particularly when conditions change rapidly to address cognitive biases in the general public we can invest in education to keep the awareness of natural hazards alive in an environment where we have minimized their impacts the presence and visibility of diverse coping capacities at the decentralized level can also help to prolong local knowledge of flood and drought events embedded in individual and collective behaviors acknowledging cognitive biases helps anticipate their consequences and find vulnerabilities not yet revealed by extreme events additionally research is needed to understand how the interaction of cognitive biases with hydrological extremes varies across hydroclimatic institutional and cultural settings and to inform the design of interventions synthesis across cases that allows for control of some variables e g seasonal streamflow patterns while deliberately varying others e g rules for water management is a promising way to build understanding the challenge of an increasingly variable and extreme climate extends beyond hydraulic infrastructure while climate change is in many respects water change 85 it will impact infrastructure across sectors revealing long existing cognitive biases if not acknowledged and managed these cognitive biases can lead to catastrophic failures of reservoirs and other infrastructure conventional infrastructure planning and management focuses on technical and economic considerations and seldom considers human cognition and biases polycentric control and feedback amongst these features of a complex system as climate change plays out we will need all available tools at our disposal to maintain critical services from flood control and water supply to power and transportation harnessing these tools requires collaborative interdisciplinary research and practice that can identify processes that span disciplinary boundaries and design interventions that target the system not merely its components while the 2011 brisbane flood is one case given the pace of climate change already observed and the further changes projected this type of failure could become

20104,climate change is leading to increasing hydrological extremes and quicker shifts between wet and dry extremes in many regions these extremes and rapid shifts put pressure on reservoir operations decreasing the reliability of water supply flood control and other reservoir benefits decision makers across all levels from reservoir operators to flood plain residents turn to heuristics to simplify decisions when faced with complexity and uncertainty resulting in cognitive biases or systematic errors in decision making while cognitive biases are not new climate change is exacerbating their impact for two reasons 1 heuristics just as infrastructure are based on experience with historic conditions 2 fragilities created by these cognitive biases can go undetected until extreme events occur if not acknowledged and managed these cognitive biases can lead to catastrophic failures of reservoirs and other infrastructure to minimize risk of such catastrophic failure we propose a multi level approach to flood and drought management one that strikes a balance between centralized and decentralized approaches such an approach is better able to cope with uncertain and changing conditions because it creates overlaps and diversity which can respond to a wide range of conditions and builds checks and balances that mitigate cognitive biases latent in various decision making units keywords reservoir cognitive bias climate change flooding drought socio hydrology 1 the 2011 brisbane flood cognitive biases at multiple levels of decision making in january 2011 brisbane home to 2 5 million people and the capital of queensland australia flooded so catastrophically that a million people had to be evacuated it was the most severe flood event in over a century in brisbane and australia s most expensive natural disaster to date 1 brisbane built in the floodplain of the brisbane river is no stranger to flooding 2 3 intense summer monsoon rainfall is common in queensland particularly during the la nina phase of enso 4 the somerset dam was constructed in 1953 on the stanley river a tributary to the brisbane river to mitigate flooding and increase water supply reliability later the 1974 flood strengthened support for the planned wivenhoe dam on the brisbane river 2 with the construction of the wivenhoe dam the city of brisbane was considered flood proof 5 the january 2011 flood was the first large flood to test the dam how did the wivenhoe dam fail its first test with the flood crisis in the rearview mirror attention then turned to why and how such a disaster could have occurred while several days of intense rainfall was clearly a factor the flood operation decisions at the wivenhoe and somerset dams were also called into question causes and culpability were debated in the queensland floods commission of inquiry 6 the media 1 7 and the courts 8 the debate centered around dams and the dam operators 2 ultimately the court found that the flood operations engineers though with no malintent failed to fully comply with the flood control manual by disregarding forecast information and neglecting to lower reservoir levels below full supply level the water supply volume in advance of the flood wave 8 but why would the engineers make risky decisions in opposition to the flood control manual at the center of the ruling was the question of how the flood operation engineers weighed information including observed rainfall forecasted rain and the recent drought like many reservoirs globally somerset and wivenhoe dams provide water supply storage for the brisbane metropolitan region in addition to their role in flood control and these two objectives are in tension rules and regulations specify how these tradeoffs should be made but reservoir operators exercise their discretion within the bounds of these rules and can as seen in the brisbane case violate them the engineers with much to lose and nothing to gain in these decisions were not acting rationally in violating the flood control manual in this they are not alone people commonly use heuristics to simplify complex decisions particularly when operating under time constraints and uncertainty 9 10 these simplifying heuristics result in cognitive biases box 1 or systematic errors in decision making the 2011 flooding of brisbane australia occurred at the end of the decade long millennium drought a period in which dam operators struggled to meet water supply objectives and flood control was back of mind we posit that this experience may have led to a cognitive bias affecting decision making during the 2011 flood that is the operators recent experience with drought may have prompted them to under weight the risk of extreme flooding and over weight the risk of water supply deficit this bias toward recent easier to recall experiences when assessing probabilities is referred to as availability bias 9 availability bias is one of several cognitive biases that may shape decision making in reservoir operation and more broadly flood and drought management box 1 the perils of cognitive biases are not exclusive to dam operators the bias that the city of brisbane is flood proof became widely shared among the general public after construction of the wivenhoe dam although this was only an illusion in hindsight 5 theory suggests that such a false sense of security can lead to complacency and gradual withering of intangible societal level capacity that plays a critical role during emergencies 11 15 this may have been the case in brisbane with this collective sense of perceived flood security came decades of expansion into the flood plain simultaneously reducing natural flood control infrastructure downstream of the dam and increasing the population at risk 2 as observed in other cases the success of controlling variability through large centralized infrastructure e g reservoirs reduced the incentive to maintain capacity to manage such variability throughout the watershed 16 17 the case of brisbane is illustrative but not exemplary there are other examples of recent experiences shaping reservoir operators decisions from maintenance e g oroville dam 18 to releases e g lake mendocino see box 1 further there are numerous cases where the broader public s memory or awareness of hazards decreases as reservoirs and other large scale infrastructure control variability 17 19 20 understanding the implications of both biases dam operators bias toward more available experiences and societal level bias toward the myth of hazard immunity and the way these two biases interact with infrastructure built to control floods and droughts is particularly important in the context of climate change adaptation there is increasing evidence that climate change is intensifying extremes and accelerating the shift between dry and wet extremes worsening the perils of these two biases 21 24 here we review the challenges of climatic change and decision making biases for flood and drought management discuss the emerging technical and policy responses and make the case for a whole system perspective box 1 cognitive biases in dam operation as in the 2011 brisbane flood the combined cognitive biases of both operators and floodplain society may result in unpredicted catastrophic events 1 let us look at another multi purpose reservoir to explore the possible cognitive biases of operators lake mendocino reservoir coyote valley dam on the east fork of the russian river in mendocino county california provides water supply and flood control as seen in fig box 1 1 the operator did not strictly follow the operational rule in the transition period march to may from the flood season to the dry season to store excessive water refer to the observed reservoir storage black line in the water year 2007 this anomalous operation may have been in response to previous drought and may be helpful for mitigating water shortage but there is a chance of heavy rain during the transition period to avoid increased disaster risk it is necessary to know how the operator s memory of the previous disaster affects their decision making behavior in reservoir operation we developed a simple reservoir operation model and conducted scenario analysis to assess how different types of cognitive biases influence the decision making of a reservoir operator in the model the reservoir operator controls the discharge rate in consideration of the storage level state variable and the operational rule target using a proportional integral derivative pid controller which is widely used in engineering systems 25 pid controller is a kind of feedback control that uses the output of the system as a part of its control pid controller consists of three controls 1 proportional deviation of state variable from the target p control 2 integral deviation of state variable from the target i control and 3 derivative rate of change deviation of state variable from the target d control we created four scenarios concerning the operator s bias with different configurations of the pid controller box table1 1 as the baseline scenario we assume that the operator is perfectly rational no bias and their decisions are not affected by their past experiences because the operator strictly follows the operation rule the perfect rationality scenario uses only p and d control there are numerous types of cognitive biases documented in the psychological literature 26 28 we selected three representative types that are most relevant to disaster memory salience bias gambler s fallacy and availability bias for the following three scenarios we set the same period and implemented i control as the accumulated past disaster damages either flood or water shortage according to the assumption of each scenario in addition to p and d control salience bias predisposes individuals to focus on remarkable and emotionally striking events 29 for the salience bias scenario we posit that the operator believes that the most severe disaster in the past would happen again salience bias scenario uses the relative damage of the most severe disasters to inform the i control under the gambler s fallacy individuals believe that the probability of a random event in the future is influenced by that type of event in the past 30 in the gambler s fallacy scenario the operator believes that the most frequent disaster in the past would happen again this scenario uses the relative damage of the most frequent disasters as i control with availability bias people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward the latest information 31 in the availability bias scenario the operator believes that the most recent disaster would happen again this scenario uses the relative damage of the most recent disasters as i control the simulation results of each scenario and the goodness of fit compared to the observed data are shown in box figure1 1 here we are not aiming to prove a specific cognitive bias is present but instead explore what types of biases provide a better fit for observed patterns in lake mendocino perfect rationality shows the lowest goodness of fit which implies the operator was least likely to be strictly following the operational rule gambler s fallacy and availability bias return plausible explanatory power indicating that the operator is likely affected by the most frequent and recent events in the past these findings do not mean that one specific type of cognitive bias governs the decision making of operators reservoir operation can be affected by the combination of different types of cognitive biases instead these results demonstrate the importance of considering cognitive biases in reservoir operation box table1 1 reservoir operat or s biases

reservoir operator s biases of lake mendocino ca 1995 2020 and goodness of fit of each scenario 2 weather extremes and reservoir operation unintended consequences climate change is driving shifts in temporal and spatial hydrological patterns increases in extreme high precipitation are projected under climate change 5 10 c 23 32 33 higher temperatures have the potential to drive the acceleration of the hydrological cycle however the projected increase in global mean precipitation is modest around 3 c 34 because the increasing extreme high precipitation is offset by an increase in the number of dry days 35 and the frequency of dry spells 36 further increasing temperatures raise evapotranspiration exacerbating drought and further stressing water supply systems 37 38 due to their non linear processes watersheds themselves have the potential to amplify variability inherent in precipitation 39 even within particular regions the effect on individual rivers varies for example blöschl et al 40 found that changes in mean flood discharge varies between an 11 percent increase and a 23 percent decrease within europe between 1960 and 2010 beyond intensifying extreme precipitation increasingly quick shifts between dry and wet extremes referred to as weather whiplash are projected in some regions e g california u s and the mid western u s 21 24 41 and observed in others e g southern south america and northern asia 42 storage both natural and constructed helps to balance periods of extreme high and low precipitation increasing extreme drought and extreme wet weather require more storage space to meet water supply and flood control objectives yet the available storage volume can only serve one purpose at once declines in snowpack with rising temperatures 43 44 and groundwater due to unsustainable pumping 45 46 lower natural storage putting greater pressure on reservoirs snow drought further exacerbates the tension between water supply and flood control storage in snow dominated systems 18 reservoirs play a key role in mitigating hydrological variability but their design and operating rules assume historic hydrological conditions which in many regions is no longer a valid assumption 47 traditionally operational plans for reservoirs that serve water supply and flood control objectives are developed based on historical streamflow current and projected demand and past performance of operational decisions while this approach to reservoir operation has been historically effective the ability to meet both water supply and flood control objectives declines as extremes intensify 48 this is due to both that the infrastructure and operations have been fit to past hydrological patterns and that operators consistent with other decision makers draw on heuristics to simplify complex decisions and these heuristics are constructed from past experiences 20 49 how and when to change reservoirs and their operating rules in response to changing conditions is not a straightforward question the potential for reservoir expansion or addition of reservoirs is in many regions limited by cost space and ecosystem concerns so attention is directed to changes in operations adaptive reservoir operations are one response that aims to improve performance without changes to physical infrastructure by incorporating current observations and forecasts to adjust system operations in response to changing conditions 50 over the past decade research has demonstrated the value of adaptive reservoir management across various climatic and socio economic settings 48 51 52 by institutionalizing adaptive controls based on current observations and forecasts this approach can also inhibit the availability bias by explicitly guiding how operators should incorporate new information however there are limits to the amount of additional variability that adaptive operations can enable reservoirs to mitigate for example in the russian river located in sonoma and mendocino counties in northern california where adaptive reservoir operations are already in place extreme drought is still resulting in water supply reductions 53 this suggests that additional layers of capacity or infrastructure should be in place across the watershed to absorb residual variability left by reservoirs building and maintaining such capacity throughout the watershed is therefore of critical importance to resilience at system level more importantly components of such capacity are often interdependent with the centralized infrastructure and one another affecting system level outcomes in subtle ways for example although adaptive operation of reservoirs can help to control additional variability this extra margin of adaptability and thus greater stability can come at the cost of reduced learning opportunities by individuals and groups distributed throughout the watershed thereby amplifying the myth of hazard immunity in ways that undermine system level resilience in the long run fig 1 neither the problems nor the solutions are solely in the realm of reservoirs instead watersheds are complex evolving systems comprised of interacting components governed through regulatory feedback a whole system perspective is therefore needed to both diagnose the problem and identify solutions 3 a systems perspective from reservoir to coupled infrastructure system a reservoir is part of a larger whole an interdependent system of watershed and society with many interacting components that respond and adapt to either too much or not enough water fig 2 here we interpret the qualitative behavior of the system by applying the lens of coupled infrastructure system cis a systems perspective that views the larger whole as a constellation of several different types of infrastructure or capacities that are distributed and adapted to deal with recurrent disturbances 54 these infrastructure types include hard infrastructure natural infrastructure soft infrastructure human infrastructure and social infrastructure the various elements of the watershed and society belong to these different types of capacities and these elements become well adapted over time to instill robustness to typical disturbances in the context of floods and droughts reservoirs represent a centralized hard infrastructure and are one way to manage streamflow variability in the overall system there are other elements in the system that have capacity to manage drought and flood periods for example the skills and knowledge of reservoir operators human infrastructure and the reservoir operating rules they follow soft infrastructure can influence the impacts of floods and droughts the capacity of floodplain residents to organize collective action social infrastructure in sandbagging evacuation and advocating for rule changes can affect flood impacts similarly farmers cooperation for water conservation and sustainable use of water resources social infrastructure can mitigate drought impacts policy from local to federal is also social infrastructure that influences whether and how these distributed practices are adopted and maintained 55 56 wetlands rain gardens and re opening flood plains natural infrastructure are distributed approaches for managing flooding 57 58 at the system level these different capacities work in concert to make the system robust to a set of disturbances and there are multiple decision makers involved in the process to influence how these capacities are modified fig 2 yet the system can still be fragile to different types of disturbances theory suggests that tradeoffs often arise among these different types of infrastructure across multiple scales 59 increasing the success of one infrastructure in mitigating a particular type of hydrological variability can undermine the coping capacity present in other types of infrastructure or the capacity of the same infrastructure to deal with a different variability fig 1 for example dam operators and their operating rules well adapted to drought conditions can undermine the human infrastructure for dealing with flood conditions in the form of cognitive biases such as the availability bias 9 in addition such tradeoffs in fragility are often hidden until revealed by catastrophic failures especially when adaptive feedback controls are present for example heavy reliance on hard infrastructures such as centralized reservoirs and levees or increased complexity in their operational rules can help to filter out additional variability and thus achieve greater stability 17 20 however this extra margin of stability reduces opportunities for individual and social learning and might lead to complacency erosion of collective memory about floods a form of cognitive bias and loss of social capacity to organize voluntary group actions for response and recovery social infrastructure resulting in greater vulnerability to rarer floods in the long run for example in the us a program to buy back land to re open flood plains natural infrastructure along the mississippi and missouri rivers was counteracted by social forgetfulness and increased downstream development in long protected flood plains 60 such tradeoffs can also arise with respect to droughts the reservoir effect is another socio hydrologic phenomenon that describes instances where over reliance on water infrastructure increases water dependence and demand and therefore increases the potential damage from water shortages 19 the reservoir effect is a particular case of the broader safe development paradox in which reduced risk increases settlement in vulnerable areas resulting in increased damage 61 this phenomenon of highly effective control of variability eroding capacity to manage different frequencies or types of shocks extends both to other infrastructure systems 62 and to social and ecological systems broadly 11 15 critically this eroded capacity is amplifying vulnerability to increasingly extreme floods and droughts however rebuilding this capacity is also an opportunity particularly in places with limited possibility for more robust reservoir storage to sum it up some fragilities are inevitable in a complex watershed system because of the inherent interdependencies and tradeoffs resilience lies in systematically managing such tradeoffs through proactive sensing and anticipatory management and in ways that mitigate cognitive biases of the infrastructure operators and the general public with this systems perspective we can now interpret the flooding of brisbane in 2011 as a coupled infrastructure system box 2 a key insight is that the catastrophic outcome of the event cannot be attributed only to the natural hazard the reservoir capacity hard infrastructure or the biases of dam operators and agencies human infrastructure because of the societal level bias about flood immunity and the economic and population growth in brisbane since the 1970s a large share of the population in the region were either new to the area or of a younger generation who did not directly experience the 1974 flood 2 it is likely the case that brisbane s social infrastructure of collective flood memory eroded substantially by 2011 as suggested by the fact that the general population chose to expand and settle in the floodplains 1 63 this collective forgetfulness and associated encroachment on the floodplains coupled with the availability bias of the dam operators likely set the stage for the catastrophic outcome of the 2011 flooding 64 65 awareness of the potential for cognitive biases to shape decision making in reservoir operators and the general public could have alerted regulators or other decision makers for the potential for catastrophic failures further a coupled infrastructure systems approach to managing floods and droughts could have identified ways to reduce the consequences of reservoir failure box 2 a system perspective on the 2011 brisbane flood the catastrophic 2011 flooding of brisbane unfolded through the interaction of hydrological events reservoir design and operations land use change and regional community flood awareness this web of interactions requires a broad systems perspective capable of capturing an interconnected system of social hydrological natural and technological components in which a reservoir and its operating organization are embedded box figure 2 1 brisbane river catchment and floodplain 66 we adopt the lens of cis to the brisbane watershed box figure 2 1 the cis is an approach characterized by four generic components resource resource users public infrastructure and public infrastructure providers their relationships and how these components and relationships influence the capacity of a cis to withstand internal stresses or external disturbances box figure 2 2a 67 these components represent different types of capacity or infrastructure hard infrastructure natural infrastructure soft infrastructure human infrastructure and social infrastructure that are distributed and fine tuned to deal with recurrent disturbances 54 below we apply the cis lens to the brisbane case by describing how different components and capacities that reside in brisbane s watershed can be interpreted in terms of the cis components we also map the linkages among them box figure 2 2b resource i e natural

institutional arrangements such as state and regional plans and climate adaptation strategies define interactions between local and government sectors in the brisbane watershed additionally a review of flood resilience activities since the 2011 floods resulted in 2019 the brisbane river strategic floodplain management plan this plan aims to strengthen the flood resilience of the region including

federal regulation under the water supply safety and reliability act of 2008 and changes to the flood mitigation manual require approval of the minster 3 4 preparing for a new abnormal while cognitive biases have long been present in infrastructure operation and the way the general public thinks about natural hazards the vulnerability caused by these cognitive biases can remain hidden until extreme events occur centralized infrastructure has performed well so well in fact that it has reduced impacts sufficiently to lower the incentives to develop and maintain all types of decentralized infrastructure 16 19 72 fig 1 this is in part a product of societal scale cognitive bias the combination of intensifying hydrological extremes operator cognitive biases and erosion of distributed

regions hard infrastructure particularly large and centralized water infrastructure have limited ability to adapt due their large scale rigidity and interconnections with other critical systems 77 in absence of opportunities for new infrastructure development or modification of existing hard infrastructure increasing the adaptability of reservoir operation rules a soft infrastructure can raise watershed system robustness 77 79 improved use of information and adaptive rules can make reservoir operations more agile enhancing the centralized capacity to deal with fluctuating conditions 80 81 the tradeoffs inherent in the cis components however suggest that cautions must be taken with an over reliance on adaptive operations of reservoirs centralized approaches alone are insufficient as outlined above a multi level polycentric effort is needed to promote and maintain complementary capacities across the watershed system measures such as effective public risk communication that reinforces collective flood memory establishment of green or natural infrastructure distributed across the watershed anticipatory land use and hazard mitigation plans by local municipalities household level strategies such as elevating buildings xeriscaping and drip irrigation and voluntary group actions activated in times of emergency all work to generate overlaps and diversity in response 73 this view is aligned with the observation that infrastructure design in a changing climate needs to shift from fail safe to safe to fail fail safe infrastructure is designed to avoid failure under specified operating conditions safe to fail infrastructure anticipates the potential for failure and designs to contain and learn from the impacts 82 83 we agree with ahern 82 and kim et al 83 that under a changing climate infrastructure has an increased risk of failure and there is a greater need to prepare for that failure in line with yu et al 73 we suggest that working across scales and

local knowledge of flood and drought events embedded in individual and collective behaviors acknowledging cognitive biases helps anticipate their consequences and find vulnerabilities not yet revealed

amongst these features of a complex system as climate change plays out we will need all available tools at our disposal to maintain critical services from flood control and water supply to power and transportation harnessing these tools requires collaborative interdisciplinary research and practice that can identify processes that span disciplinary boundaries and design interventions that target the system not merely its components while the 2011 brisbane flood is one case given the pace of climate change already observed and the further changes projected this type of failure could become more common as infrastructure is pushed beyond its design conditions if we do not act declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
