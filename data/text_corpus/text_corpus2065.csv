10325,the accurate calculation of potential evapotranspiration pet is a critical step in researching evapotranspiration hydrology and many other fields numerous models have been developed to quantify pet from standard meteorological observations and combination methods are usually considered the most physically reasonable however adequate observations of meteorological variables for combination methods are unavailable in many locations making it necessary to select alternative pet models with fewer data requirements here a set of 18 models including four aerodynamic methods five temperature based methods six radiation based methods and three combination methods were evaluated using meteorological measurements from 789 stations in four climatic zones in china the mountain plateau zone mpz temperate monsoon zone tmz temperate continental zone tcz and subtropical monsoon zone smz the annual pet calculated in each of the four climatic zones showed large discrepancies among the 18 models and the largest disparity nationwide was 2 95 fold the combination models performed best for calculating pet in all four climatic zones followed by the radiation based models and both categories outperformed the aerodynamic and temperature based methods the rohwer model was the only recommended aerodynamic method and the romanenko model was the only recommended temperature based method for calculating pet in china the turc model was marginally the best radiation based model in the smz tmz and tcz and the hargreaves model in the mpz but both should be applied with caution in cold months the penman model was the recommended combination method in all four zones further comparison of the best models from each category showed that the rohwer model might overestimate pet in the tmz and tcz and underestimate it in the mpz and smz the romanenko model overestimated pet and the turc and hargreaves models both underestimated pet in all four zones especially in the mpz the empirical coefficients of the five recommended models were regional calibrated to meet the requirements of pet calculation in different climatic zones keywords potential evapotranspiration pan evaporation aerodynamic method temperature based method radiation based method combination method 1 introduction evapotranspiration et the combination of interception evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration from plants allen et al 1998 is a central process in the climate system a nexus of the water energy and carbon cycles jung et al 2010 and an important indicator of regional climate change and water cycle status wang et al 2013 sörensson and ruscica 2018 however direct observations of actual evapotranspiration eta remain unavailable in many locations around the globe kim et al 2019 liu et al 2019b and atmospheric evaporative demand must be expressed by other variables such as pan evaporation epan reference crop evapotranspiration et0 and potential evapotranspiration pet anabalón and sharma 2017 zheng et al 2017 of these variables pet has been applied frequently in hydrology environmental science and meteorology xiang et al 2020 the use of pet to estimate eta has been a common approach in hydrology for many years anabalón and sharma 2017 pet is a necessary input of the water balance for hydrological models to estimate runoff bai et al 2016 and an important parameter to calculate drought severity indices um et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 it is also used as an index to represent the available environmental energies and ecosystem productivity lu et al 2005 and its long term changes have been used to diagnose the influence of climate change on ecosystems based on climate model projections milly and dunne 2016 therefore accurate calculation of pet is a critical step in research into et hydrology and many other fields numerous methods have been proposed to estimate pet in recent decades mcmahon et al 2016 xiang et al 2020 which can be classified generally into four categories 1 aerodynamic or mass transfer based methods 2 temperature based methods 3 radiation based methods and 4 combination methods bormann 2011 li et al 2016 these methods can behave differently due to their different assumptions and input data requirements lu et al 2005 bai et al 2016 maes et al 2019 the review papers of mcmahon et al 2016 and xiang et al 2020 both systematically described the historical development of the assumptions and definitions of pet the term potential evapotranspiration was first put forward by thornthwaite 1948 representing the maximum value of evaporation that would occur under ideal conditions since then scientists have defined pet in many different ways anon 1956 penman 1956 van bavel 1966 morton 1983 byrne et al 1988 granger 1989 dingman 1992 shuttleworth 1992 lhomme 1997 sometimes even confusing pet with the definition of reference evapotranspiration xiang et al 2020 in the review paper by mcmahon et al 2016 the concept of potential evaporation is defined as follows the upper limit of evaporation under constant meteorological and surface temperature conditions from a surface vegetation bare soil or open water that is saturated and of such extent to negate effects of local advection the aerodynamic category of pet methods originated from the dalton s equation of evaporation singh and xu 1997 these methods played important roles several decades ago in researching pet however because of the large deviations of the estimated results and the incorrectness of their inherent mechanisms according to the current understanding of pet most aerodynamic methods have been abandoned bormann 2011 xiang et al 2020 since thornthwaite 1948 first proposed a temperature based method to estimate pet the thornthwaite method and other proposed temperature based methods e g blaney and criddle 1950 hamon 1961 romanenko 1961 linacre 1977 oudin et al 2005 have been applied extensively worldwide because of their acceptable performance and ease of data acquisition xu and singh 2001 xiang et al 2020 the radiation based methods depend upon the empirical relationship between radiation and pet of which the priestley and taylor 1972 equation is the most widely used method worldwide xiang et al 2020 other proposed radiation based methods have been well used in specific regions e g makkink 1957 turc 1961 jensen and haise 1963 stephens and stewart 1963 penman 1948 was the first to derive a combination method to estimate pet and the penman equation is still considered the most physically reasonable by many hydrologists e g shuttleworth 1992 oudin et al 2005 donohue et al 2010 zheng et al 2017 the penman equation has been modified for different conditions by various researchers e g rijtema 1965 van bavel 1966 wright and jensen 1972 thom and oliver 1977 and the most widely used variant has been the penman monteith equation which incorporates a new coefficient r s to represent the variable surface resistance monteith 1965 by defining the reference crop surface the penman monteith equation was recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao as a standardised method for estimating et0 allen et al 1998 the performance of these pet models for calculating pet under different climate conditions and underlying surface types has been evaluated on many occasions e g grace and quick 1988 xu and singh 2002 lu et al 2005 douglas et al 2009 donohue et al 2010 bormann 2011 li et al 2016 song et al 2017 valipour et al 2017a maes et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 and most of these researchers have concluded that the combination models are optimal followed by radiation based temperature based and aerodynamic models li et al 2016 however the combination models usually depend on adequate inputs of meteorological variables such as net radiation soil heat flux density air temperature wind speed and relative humidity these data may not be fully available in some study regions and the use of models that require fewer meteorological variables as inputs therefore becomes necessary given the wide array of pet models with less demanding input requirements it can be difficult to choose the most suitable model for a specific climate zone as many models were developed for specific hydroclimatic conditions and their evaluation against measured data has been limited tegos et al 2015 liu et al 2017 some researchers have even suggested that temperature based and radiation based methods provided more accurate runoff simulations than combination methods according to validation with hydrological models oudin et al 2005 wang et al 2006 the climate across china varies considerably and the country can be divided into several climatic zones song et al 2011 in various climatic zones of china previous studies have shown large disparities between pet values calculated by different models bai et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to evaluate these models and identify the most suitable model for pet calculation among the four categories with different meteorological variables as inputs by definition pet is a theoretical concept that is difficult to measure prudhomme and williamson 2013 so hydrologists have used indirect techniques to validate to determine the performance of the pet methods some researchers have concluded that the penman equation was the best formula for calculating pet and nominated it as the basis of standardising other methods moges et al 2003 others have verified pet methods by reference to other evapotranspiration variables such as et0 calculated by the fao penman monteith equation tegos et al 2015 valipour et al 2017a eta measured by the lysimeter yarami et al 2011 herrnegger et al 2012 bowen ratio energy budget rosenberry et al 2007 douglas et al 2009 and eddy correlation methods li et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 maes et al 2019 and epan measured by pan xu and singh 2001 jacobs et al 2009 xu et al 2016 in addition some studies have verified pet methods at basin scale using the water balance method lu et al 2005 or hydrological models oudin et al 2005 bai et al 2016 in this study measurements of epan are chosen to evaluate pet methods not only because epan is easy to perform but also because it integrates the effects of radiation humidity wind and air temperature and so provides a proxy of open water evaporation that is conceptually similar to pet donohue et al 2010 maes et al 2019 it should be noted that epan is distinct from pet by definition and epan exhibits biases related to the location shape and composition of the instrument maes et al 2019 to evaluate the performance of the pet methods the following two assumptions are made that the values of calculated pet should be less than the measured epan and that a significant correlation exists between pet and epan consequently using meteorological data from the china meteorological administration the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to calculate pet in different climatic zones of china by 18 different methods from four categories 2 to evaluate pet methods with measured epan values 3 to recommend the most suitable pet model in each category and 4 to calibrate the recommended pet models in different climatic zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in general china can be divided into five climatic zones the mountain plateau zone mpz temperate monsoon zone tmz temperate continental zone tcz subtropical monsoon zone smz and tropical monsoon zone fig 1 song et al 2011 in consideration of the significantly smaller land area compared with the other climatic zones the tropical monsoon zone was incorporated into the adjacent smz for data analysis fan et al 2016 feng et al 2018 hong kong macao and taiwan were not considered in this study due to the insufficient data availability the study used data from 789 meteorological stations including 82 in the mpz 351 in the smz 202 in the tmz and 154 in the tcz fig 1 the average elevations of the meteorological stations in the mpz smz tmz and tcz are 3515 6 m 430 6 m 392 4 m and 1076 4 m respectively the annual mean precipitation air temperature pan evaporation and aridity index unep 1997 1991 2000 in the four climatic zones can be seen in table 1 and the mpz smz tmz and tcz can be generally considered as semi humid humid semi arid and arid regions respectively fan et al 2016 feng et al 2018 the annual distribution indicates low epan in the qinghai tibet plateau sichuan basin and northeast china and high epan in the southeast coastal areas northwest and southwest china fig 1 the precipitation epan and air temperature showed similar significant seasonality in the four climatic zones and the values in summer were significantly higher than those in winter the sunshine durations in summer were higher than those in winter in four climatic zones and the sunshine duration in the smz was significantly lower than other climatic zones the maximum wind speeds in the four climatic zones generally occurred in spring and the wind speeds in the smz were lower than those of the other three zones the relative humidity in the smz was significantly higher than those of the other three climatic zones and the seasonal variation was not significant the relative humidity in the mpz tmz and tcz showed different seasonal variation fig 2 2 2 data collection daily meteorological data collected from the 789 stations were obtained from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn the variables measured from the meteorological stations are air temperature c relative humidity at 2 m height wind speed at 10 m height m s and sunshine duration h wind speed at 2 m and 8 m height radiation and other variables required for the

a physical means to measure the atmospheric evaporative demand it is a simple and robust instrument that integrates related physical factors namely radiation temperature humidity and wind speed into a single measurement of evaporation demand roderick et al 2007 lim et al 2013 due to its simplicity low cost and wide variety of applications stanhill 2002 the evaporator pan has been applied in many countries for more than half a century and the most common types are class a chinese d20 and e601b pans ggi3000 and the colorado evaporation pan mozny et al 2020 the epan measurements used to evaluate the pet models in this study were acquired using the d20 pan with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 10 cm the d20 pan has been widely used in china since the 1950s and more details of the d20 pan can be found in yang and yang 2012 since the 1980s another type of pan e 601 61 8 cm in diameter has gradually come into use in china since 2001 most meteorological stations have used both the d20 and the e 601 depending on the season chen et al 2005 feng et al 2018 however some stations lack long time series epan data to maintain instrument consistency and include as many meteorological stations as possible the research period of this study was restricted to 1991 2000 the daily pet values were calculated from the daily meteorological data and then processed to monthly and annual values 2 3 selected pet models a total of 18 pet models were selected comprising four categories four aerodynamic methods five temperature based methods six radiation based methods and three combination methods table 2 these models were selected not only because of the theoretical differences in their calculation formulas but also because they represent the full range of key input meteorological variables e g radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed to be processed the data required for the aerodynamic models were relative humidity and wind speed the temperature based models employed temperature and extraterrestrial radiation inputs the radiation based models mainly utilized radiation and temperature inputs and the inputs for the combination models were radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed the 18 pet models and their equations are briefly presented in table 2 and their detailed information can be found in the references therein 2 4 evaluation criteria and statistical analysis statistical indices were used for quantitative analysis of the pet modelling performance the pet values calculated by the 18 models and epan measured by the d20 were compared using a series of statistical criteria as follows 8 r 2 cov p e t e p a n σ p e t σ e p a n 2 9 m a e 1 n i 1 n p e t i e p a n i 10 r m s e i 1 n p e t i e p a n i 2 n 11 n s e 1 i 1 n p e t i e p a n i 2 i 1 n e p a n i e p a n i 2 where r 2 mae rmse and nse are the coefficient of determination mean absolute error mm day 1 root mean square error mm day 1 and nash sutcliffe efficiency respectively n is the number of statistical days and cov and σ are the covariance and standard deviation respectively note that measured epan values are not equivalent to pet but in theory the two variables should have a significant correlation liu et al 2010 pan evaporimeters integrate the effects of radiation humidity wind and air temperature on wet surface evaporation rates stanhill 2002 and so provide measurements of evaporation that are conceptually similar to pet rates mcvicar et al 2007 donohue et al 2010 the coefficient of determination r 2 was chosen as the most important evaluation index and the other criteria included the nse mae and rmse were used as reference evaluation indices the statistical analysis was conducted both for the overall time period and for each of the 12 months the classical statistics of the mean and standard deviation sd were obtained 12 x 1 n i 1 n x i 13 r x i x x 14 s 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 where x r and s are the mean relative deviation and sd of the data set respectively all analyses were performed using matlab v r2017b the mathworks inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 the pet values calculated by the 18 models the annual pet values at each meteorological stations by 18 models were calculated and then the average annual pet values of meteorological stations in each climatic zones were regarded as the area averaged annual pet values in different climatic zones the area averaged annual pet values calculated over china for 1991 2000 showed large disparities among the methods the greatest disparity across china as a whole was 2 95 fold between the maximum of 1265 9 mm from the brockamp wenner model and the minimum of 428 7 mm from the harbeck model in terms of the magnitude of pet the models fell in the following order brockamp wenner albrecht romanenko wright jensen penman hamon rohwer schendel milly dunne priestley taylor baier robertson oudin hargreaves rijtema jensen haise turc stephens stewart harbeck the maximum disparities of annual pet within the mpz smz tmz and tcz were 3 42 4 14 2 89 and 3 64 fold respectively the maximum values of annual pet in those four zones were 1057 1 mm from the wright jensen model 1352 9 mm from the schendel model 1254 8 mm from the brockamp wenner model and 1803 5 mm from the brockamp wenner model the harbeck model calculated the minimum annual pet values in the mpz smz and tmz which were 309 3 mm 326 7 mm and 434 5 mm respectively and the stephens stewart model calculated the minimum pet in the tcz i e 465 5 mm fig 3 the spatial distribution of annual pet over china calculated by most of the 18 models were similar to that of epan fig 4 however a few models showed different spatial distributions for example for the baier robertson hamon oudin and stephens stewart models the spatial distributions of annual pet seemed to be related to latitude except for a few meteorological stations in northwest china fig 4 in short the annual pet over china differed substantially in both values and spatial distributions among the 18 selected models highlighting the need to evaluate the models applicability 3 2 cross comparison of aerodynamic models during the study period the daily mean pet values calculated by the albrecht brockamp wenner harbeck and rohwer models across china as a whole were 3 21 mm day 1 3 41 mm day 1 1 13 mm day 1 and 2 53 mm day 1 respectively and the daily mean measured epan was 4 38 mm day 1 of the four aerodynamic pet models the rohwer model showed the strongest correlation between the calculated daily pet and epan across china as a whole during the overall time period with a mean r 2 of 0 80 followed by the brockamp wenner albrecht and harbeck models table 3 figs 5a 5b 5c and 5d in terms of the mean of r 2 the models fell in the same order in all four climatic zones rohwer brockamp wenner albrecht harbeck table 3 figs 6a 6b 6c and 6d the mean of r 2 when plotted against epan in different months in the four climatic zones showed similar seasonality for all four aerodynamic pet models figs 7a 7b 7c and 7d in the four climatic zones the mean of r 2 reached its maximum in early spring began to decrease in summer and reached its minimum in autumn the wind speed over china is higher in the spring with peaks in april but lower in autumn and lowest in august liu et al 2019a wind speed was an important variable input in all four aerodynamic pet models and the seasonality of the mean of r 2 might indicate a correlation with the seasonality of wind speed of the four climatic zones the mean of r 2 in the tcz was slightly higher than that in the tmz and both were higher than those in the smz and mpz a large number of the daily pet values calculated by the albrecht and brockamp wenner models greatly exceeded epan figs 5a and 5b and cannot be considered reasonable descriptions of the actual conditions the r 2 values between the daily pet calculated by the harbeck model against epan were significantly lower than those for the other three models in all months in all four climatic zones possibly because the harbeck model requires a wind speed measurement at 8 m above the soil surface table 2 and this value was estimated by the wind profile relationship following the procedure described in fao 56 allen et al 1998 with the highest values of r 2 combined with other evaluation indices the rohwer model can be regarded as the most suitable aerodynamic model for calculating pet and the other three aerodynamic models are not recommended for calculating pet in any climatic zones in china this is consistent with the results of singh and xu 1997 who evaluated thirteen aerodynamic models by comparison with pan evaporation at four climatological stations in north western ontario canada and recommended the rohwer model as the best aerodynamic model to calculate pet 3 3 cross comparison of temperature based models during the study period the daily mean pets calculated by the baier robertson hamon romanenko schendel and oudin models across china as a whole were 2 36 mm day 1 3 02 mm day 1 3 25 mm day 1 2 94 mm day 1 and 2 47 mm day 1 respectively and the daily mean measured epan was 4 38 mm day 1 of the five temperature based pet models the romanenko model showed the strongest correlation between the calculated daily pet and epan across china as a whole during the overall time period with a mean r 2 of 0 81 followed by the schendel baier robertson hamon and oudin models table 4 figs 5e 5f 5g 5h and 5i in the mpz and smz the models fell in the same order as for china as a whole in terms of the mean of r 2 and the order in the tmz and tcz was romanenko schendel baier robertson oudin hamon table 4 figs 6e 6f 6g 6h and 6i when comparing months the mean of r 2 between the pet from the five temperature based models and epan showed different seasonality in the four climatic zones figs 7e 7f 7g 7h and 7i the monthly variability of the mean of r 2 from both the oudin and hamon models was erratic and their values were significantly lower than the other three models indicating that these two models might not be suitable to calculate daily pet in china the mean of r 2 from the baier robertson and schendel models in the four climatic zones presented similar and significant seasonality specifically the mean of r 2 from these two models in warm months were significantly higher than those in cold months the daily temperature was an important input variable in both models and the seasonality of the temperature might account for this monthly variability of the mean of r 2 therefore the baier robertson model may be suitable to calculate pet in warm months but not in cold months like the albrecht and brockamp wenner models a large number of the daily pet values calculated by the schendel model were higher than epan fig 5h implying that this model might not be suitable to calculate daily pet in china although like the baier robertson model the relationship between its calculated pet and epan showed high r 2 in the warm months the romanenko model showed an impressively high r 2 in all months in the four climatic zones and the variability between months was much smaller than for the other temperature based models fig 7g with the highest r 2 and combined with other evaluation indexes the romanenko model can be regarded as the most suitable temperature based model for calculating pet in all climatic zones in china of the four climatic zones the mean of r 2 from the romanenko model was slightly higher in the tcz than in the tmz and both were significantly higher than those in the smz and mpz xu and singh 2001 evaluated seven temperature based models at two climatological stations in northwestern ontario canada finding that the romanenko method yielded the smallest error at both stations when the mean total differences were considered studies elsewhere however have suggested that other temperature based models were better choices for example lu et al 2005 compared six temperature based and radiation based methods in the southeastern united states and recommended the hamon model as the best temperature based method which performed relatively poorly in this study three possible reasons for this difference can be considered first the studies compared different sets of models second the evaporation variables used for evaluation were different the measured epan was used in this study and the actual evapotranspiration calculated by the water balance method was used in lu et al 2005 third the evaluation time scales were different daily in this study and annual in lu et al 2005 3 4 cross comparison of radiation based models during the study period the daily mean pet values calculated by the turc jensen haise stephens stewart hargreaves milly dunne and priestley taylor models across china as a whole were 1 98 mm day 1 2 17 mm day 1 1 39 mm day 1 2 14 mm day 1 2 16 mm day 1 and 2 22 mm day 1 respectively and the daily mean measured epan was 4 38 mm day 1 of the six radiation based pet models the turc model showed the strongest correlation between the calculated daily pet and epan across china as a whole during the overall time period with a mean r 2 of 0 78 followed by the hargreaves stephens stewart jensen haise priestley taylor and milly dunne models table 5 figs 5j 5k 5l 5m 5n and 5o the mean of r 2 in the smz tmz and tcz fell in the same order as in the whole nation and the order in the mpz was hargreaves priestley taylor stephens stewart milly dunne jensen haise turc table 5 figs 6j 6k 6l 6m 6n and 6o the mean of r 2 from all six radiation based pet models against epan in all months in the four climatic zones showed similar seasonality figs 7j 7k 7l 7m 7n and 7o in general the mean of r 2 increased in the spring reached its maximum in the early summer decreased in the autumn and reached its minimum in the winter temperature and radiation were input variables in the radiation based pet models and their seasonality might account for this monthly variability of the mean of r 2 the formula used by the stephens stewart model to calculate pet is similar to the jensen haise model and the milly dunne model can be seen as a simplified version of the priestley taylor model table 2 considering all evaluation indices the jensen haise and stephens stewart models performed similarly in pet calculation and the priestley taylor model was more suitable than the milly dunne model table 5 therefore in the following monthly cross comparison only the turc jensen haise hargreaves and priestley taylor models were selected in terms of the mean r 2 in the four climatic zones the ranking of the models differed between months fig 8 in all four climatic zones the priestley taylor model never showed the highest r 2 in any of 12 months in the mpz the turc model showed the highest r 2 from may to august and the hargreaves model showed the highest r 2 for the remaining months in the smz the turc model showed the highest r 2 in march april september and october the hargreaves model showed the highest r 2 from november to february and the jensen haise model from may to august in the tmz the turc model showed the highest r 2 in april may june and september the hargreaves model showed the highest r 2 from october to march and the jensen haise model in july and august in the tcz the turc model showed the highest r 2 from march to november and the hargreaves model showed the highest r 2 for the remaining months in summary unlike in the two categories of models analysed earlier of the radiation based models no model was significantly better than any other the turc model can be regarded as the most suitable radiation based model for calculating pet in the smz tmz and tcz and the hargreaves model in the mpz in the separate monthly calculations in the four climatic zones the turc model was the most suitable in the warm months and the hargreaves model in the cold months consistent with the results of this study many studies have recommended the turc and hargreaves models as the best radiation based methods for calculating pet e g trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 liu et al 2017 gharbia et al 2018 in the work of xu and singh 2000 the performance of the turc model showed a significant bias in cold months and this monthly variability was also observed in this study due to the differences in selected models variables used to validate evaporation evaluation criteria or evaluation scales some studies have reached different conclusions regarding the best radiation based models e g douglas et al 2009 valipour 2014 3 5 cross comparison of combination methods during the study period the daily mean pet values calculated by the rijtema wright jensen and penman models across china as a whole were 1 98 mm day 1 2 90 mm day 1 and 2 64 mm day 1 respectively and the daily mean measured epan was 4 38 mm day 1 comparing the three combination pet models all evaluation indices differed only slightly between the wright jensen and penman models during the overall time period across china as a whole as well as the four climatic zones and both models were significantly better than the rijtema model in calculating pet table 6 figs 5p 5q and 5r figs 6p 6q and 6r unlike the former three categories in all three combination models which take the largest number of meteorological variables as inputs the mean of r 2 for pet against epan in the four climatic zones showed only weak seasonality the means of r 2 in the cold months were slightly smaller than those in the warm months especially in the wright jensen and penman models figs 7p 7q and 7r in terms of the mean of r 2 the ranking of the three combination models in the four climatic zones differed slightly between months the rijtema model showed the lowest r 2 for all 12 months in all four climatic zones and the penman model showed the highest r 2 for all 12 months in the mpz and tcz the wright jensen model showed the highest r 2 in june and july in the smz and in july and august in the tmz and the penman model showed the highest r 2 in the remaining months in the smz and tmz in summary the penman model is slightly better than the wright jensen model in calculating pet and both models are significantly better than the rijtema model the main difference between the various combination models lies in the empirical wind functions liu et al 2017 which are modified based on the penman model for specific locations rosenberry et al 2004 the highest r 2 against epan in different months in this study was achieved by the penman model which can therefore be deemed the best combination model for calculating pet in all climatic zones the suitability of the penman model for calculating pet has been reported in many studies li et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 and it has even been used as a benchmark to verify other models moges et al 2003 li et al 2016 and is now the first choice for calculating pet in regions with available meteorological variables as inputs xiang et al 2020 3 6 cross comparison of four categories of the four categories of pet models across china as a whole and the four different climatic zones the highest means of r 2 for the calculated pet against epan during the overall time period were all achieved by combination methods followed by radiation based aerodynamic and temperature based methods tables 3 4 5 and 6 this ranking was valid not just for the values of r 2 but also for their stabilities fig 9 the stabilities of the categories were reflected in three aspects the first stability measure was the calculated sds of r 2 for each model individually which were significantly lower for the three combination models than for the other categories the second stability measure was the correlation of models within each category the mean values of r 2 of the three combination models were very close and differed less than those of the other three categories the third stability measure was the correlation between models in each climatic zone again the mean values of r 2 of the three combination models were very close in each zone and differed less than those of the other three categories during the overall time period the four climatic zones ranked as follows in terms of the mean of r 2 between epan and the pet calculated by the combination and aerodynamic methods tcz tmz smz mpz the corresponding rankings for the radiation based were tcz smz tmz mpz and for the temperature based methods were tcz tmz mpz smz pet is driven primarily by four key meteorological variables including radiation wind speed temperature and vapor pressure donohue et al 2010 the combination methods considered all four influencing factors while the radiation based methods ignored the aerodynamic components and the aerodynamic models ignored the energy term in the pet processes shiri 2018 shiri et al 2019 consistent with the results of this study many other studies have concluded that combination methods were optimal for calculating pet followed by radiation based models both of which usually performed better than the other two categories donohue et al 2010 li et al 2016 in this study the aerodynamic methods slightly outperformed the temperature based methods with respect to the mean of r 2 but some previous investigations have revealed the opposite xu and singh 2002 this can be attributed to differences in the selected methods for comparison and the variables used for validation xu and singh 2002 selected the best model from each category for cross comparison and used the reference crop evapotranspiration estimated from the fao penman monteith model as the variable to evaluate pet models in the present study the mean of r 2 from the four aerodynamic methods in four climatic zones was close to that from the five temperature based methods thus the choice of models for inter category comparison may have a significant impact on the mean r 2 values of each category to eliminate the bias that may therefore result the best models from each category were selected for further comparison as reported in the next section 3 7 cross comparison of the rohwer romanenko turc hargreaves and penman models on the basis of the above results the rohwer romanenko and penman models can be recommended as the optimal aerodynamic temperature based and combination methods respectively to calculate pet in all four climatic zones of the radiation based methods the turc model was the best choice in the smz tmz and tcz and the hargreaves model in the mpz therefore the above five models were selected for comparison the correlations between the pet calculated by the models against the measured epan were analysed in the former sections now we focus on the actual values of the calculated pet potential evapotranspiration is a theoretical value that is difficult to determine by combining a number of models multi model averaging can overcome the limitations of a single model diks and vrugt 2010 parrish et al 2012 the equally weighted averaged values of the five selected models were taken as the pet benchmark petb fig 10 shows the variability of the mean monthly pet calculated by the five different models and petb in the four climatic zones and fig 11 shows the relative deviations between the annual pet calculated by the five models and petb at meteorological stations on the annual and monthly scales the relationships between the calculated pet and petb showed the same pattern the pet values calculated by the rohwer model were lower than petb in the mpz and smz but higher than petb in the tmz and tcz the pet values from the romanenko model were higher than petb and those from the turc and hargreaves models were lower than petb in all four climatic zones the pet values from the penman model were very close to petb in the smz tmz and tcz which further supports the validity and accuracy of the penman model for pet calculation however it is worth noting that the pet values calculated by the penman model were higher than petb in the mpz the reason for this anomaly might be not that the penman method overestimated pet in the mpz but that the turc and hargreaves models greatly underestimated it radiation and temperature are two important input variables in the turc and hargreaves models the radiation data used in this study were estimated following the procedure described in fao 56 allen et al 1998 with constant as and bs across the whole of china as bs is the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the earth on clear days as 0 25 and bs 0 50 in this study the mpz mainly consists of to the qinghai tibet plateau where the as and bs are in fact different from other regions chen et al 2004 and measured data show that the radiation in the mpz is significantly stronger than in other areas tang et al 2013 low temperature is another feature of the mpz when the temperature was lower than the threshold value 0 for the turc model and 17 8 for the hargreaves model see the formulae in table 2 the daily pet calculated by the two models would be lower than zero implying an underestimation of pet indeed the pet values calculated by the turc and hargreaves models were underestimated across china figs 11e 11f the low temperature and underestimation of radiation in the mpz might have led to an underestimation of pet and in turn an underestimation of petb moreover the ratio of petb to epan in the mpz was significantly lower than those in the other three zones fig 11b this is further evidence that the calculated petb was underestimated in the mpz 3 8 calibration of the rohwer romanenko turc hargreaves and penman models if the averaged values of the five selected models were taken as petb the empirical coefficients in those five pet models can be local calibrated in four different climatic zones table 7 showed the original and calibrated coefficients of the rohwer romanenko turc hargreaves and penman models in different climatic zones compared the calculation pet values of fives original models the calculation pet values of fives pet models with calibrated coefficients were closer to petb fig 12 the evaluation criteria showed that the calibrated pet models could be used to calculate pet more accurately with higher r 2 and nse and lower mae and rmse table 7 among all five models the rohwer model had the largest coefficients adjustment and provided the most significant improvement fig 12 most of aerodynamic models have developed for specific region and might be more applicable for regions with same conditions shiri 2018 calibration of the coefficients in the rohwer model could effectively improve its ability to calculate pet table 7 the combination methods considered all meteorological factors and the original penman model could calculate pet well so the calibrated penman model did not progress as much as other models of the four climate zones the regional calibrated models had the best improvement in the tcz because the pet values calculated by the five original models in this climate zone differed the most the improvement of the five calibrated models in the smz was the least significant indicating that the original models could calculate pet well in the smz 4 conclusions meteorological data from 789 meteorological stations in four different climatic zones in china were used to evaluate 18 methods for calculating daily pet including four aerodynamic five temperature based six radiation based and three combination methods both within the four climatic zones and across china as a whole the area averaged annual pet showed large disparities between models and the maximum disparity of annual pet across china was 2 95 fold between the maximum of 1265 9 mm from the brockamp wenner model and the minimum of 428 7 mm from the harbeck model the values and spatial distributions of annual pet over china calculated by the 18 models also showed significant differences the combination models were the most optimal methods for calculating daily pet in the four climatic zones followed by the radiation based models and both categories performed better than the aerodynamic and temperature based methods the rohwer model was the only recommended aerodynamic method for calculating daily pet in china and the romanenko model was the only recommended temperature based method these two models both showed better performance in the tcz and tmz than in the smz and mpz the remaining aerodynamic and temperature based methods analysed in this study are arguably not suitable for calculating daily pet in china s four climatic zones all six radiation based methods seemed able to estimate pet in china but proved markedly more suitable in the warm months of the radiation based methods the turc model slightly outperformed the other models in the smz tmz and tcz and the hargreaves model showed marginally the best performance in the mpz both recommended radiation based methods need to be used with caution in the cold months all three combination methods were suitable for calculating pet in china and the penman model was the optimal choice in all four climatic zones the best models from each category were selected for further cross comparison and the mean pet values from those models were taken as the pet benchmark the pet values calculated by the rohwer model were higher than the benchmark in the tmz and tcz but lower than the benchmark in the mpz and smz the pet values calculated by the rohwer model were higher than the benchmark in all four climatic zones the pet values calculated by the penman model were closest to the benchmark in the smz tmz and tcz although the hargreaves model was closest in the mpz the turc and hargreaves models were both lower than the benchmark in all four climatic zones and due to low temperature and their estimated radiation inputs the two models might greatly underestimate pet in the mpz the equally weighted averaged values of the rohwer romanenko turc hargreaves and penman models were taken as pet benchmark and the empirical coefficients in those five pet models were local calibrated in four different climatic zones the regional calibration can improve the accuracy of these models to calculate pet and provide an important reference for the study on pet evapotranspiration and hydrological processes in different climatic zones declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10325,the accurate calculation of potential evapotranspiration pet is a critical step in researching evapotranspiration hydrology and many other fields numerous models have been developed to quantify pet from standard meteorological observations and combination methods are usually considered the most physically reasonable however adequate observations of meteorological variables for combination methods are unavailable in many locations making it necessary to select alternative pet models with fewer data requirements here a set of 18 models including four aerodynamic methods five temperature based methods six radiation based methods and three combination methods were evaluated using meteorological measurements from 789 stations in four climatic zones in china the mountain plateau zone mpz temperate monsoon zone tmz temperate continental zone tcz and subtropical monsoon zone smz the annual pet calculated in each of the four climatic zones showed large discrepancies among the 18 models and the largest disparity nationwide was 2 95 fold the combination models performed best for calculating pet in all four climatic zones followed by the radiation based models and both categories outperformed the aerodynamic and temperature based methods the rohwer model was the only recommended aerodynamic method and the romanenko model was the only recommended temperature based method for calculating pet in china the turc model was marginally the best radiation based model in the smz tmz and tcz and the hargreaves model in the mpz but both should be applied with caution in cold months the penman model was the recommended combination method in all four zones further comparison of the best models from each category showed that the rohwer model might overestimate pet in the tmz and tcz and underestimate it in the mpz and smz the romanenko model overestimated pet and the turc and hargreaves models both underestimated pet in all four zones especially in the mpz the empirical coefficients of the five recommended models were regional calibrated to meet the requirements of pet calculation in different climatic zones keywords potential evapotranspiration pan evaporation

change and water cycle status wang et al 2013 sörensson and ruscica 2018 however direct observations of actual evapotranspiration eta remain unavailable in many locations around the globe kim et al 2019 liu et al 2019b and atmospheric evaporative demand must be expressed by other variables such as pan evaporation epan reference crop evapotranspiration et0 and potential evapotranspiration pet anabalón and sharma 2017 zheng et al 2017 of these variables pet has been applied frequently in hydrology environmental science and meteorology xiang et al 2020 the use of pet to estimate eta has been a common approach in hydrology for many years anabalón and sharma 2017 pet is a necessary input of the water balance for hydrological models to estimate runoff bai et al 2016 and an important parameter to calculate drought severity indices um et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 it is also used as an index to represent the available environmental energies and ecosystem productivity lu et al 2005 and its long term changes have been used to diagnose the influence of climate change on ecosystems based on climate model projections milly and dunne 2016 therefore accurate calculation of pet is a critical step in research into et hydrology and many other fields numerous methods have been proposed to estimate pet in recent decades mcmahon et al 2016 xiang et al 2020 which can be classified generally into four categories 1 aerodynamic or mass transfer based methods 2 temperature based methods 3 radiation based methods and 4 combination methods bormann 2011 li et al 2016 these methods can behave differently due to their different assumptions and input data requirements lu et al 2005 bai et al 2016 maes et al 2019 the review papers of mcmahon et al 2016 and xiang et al 2020 both systematically described the historical development of the assumptions and definitions of pet the term potential evapotranspiration was first put forward by thornthwaite 1948 representing the maximum value of evaporation that would occur under ideal conditions since then scientists have defined pet in many different ways anon 1956 penman 1956 van bavel 1966 morton 1983 byrne et al 1988 granger 1989 dingman 1992 shuttleworth 1992 lhomme 1997 sometimes even confusing pet with the definition of reference evapotranspiration xiang et al 2020 in the review paper by mcmahon et al 2016 the concept of potential evaporation is defined as follows the upper limit of evaporation under constant meteorological and surface temperature conditions from a surface vegetation bare soil or open water that is saturated and of such extent to negate effects of local advection the aerodynamic category of pet methods originated from the dalton s equation of evaporation singh and xu 1997 these methods played important roles several decades ago in researching pet however because of the large deviations of the estimated results and the incorrectness of their inherent mechanisms according to the current understanding of pet most aerodynamic methods have been abandoned bormann 2011 xiang et al 2020 since thornthwaite 1948 first proposed a temperature based method to estimate pet the thornthwaite method and other proposed temperature based methods e g blaney and criddle 1950 hamon 1961 romanenko 1961 linacre 1977 oudin et al 2005 have been applied extensively worldwide because of their acceptable performance and ease of data acquisition xu and singh 2001 xiang et al 2020 the radiation based methods depend upon the empirical relationship between radiation and pet of which the priestley and taylor 1972 equation is the most widely used method worldwide xiang et al 2020 other proposed radiation based methods have been well used in specific regions e g makkink 1957 turc 1961 jensen and haise 1963 stephens and stewart 1963 penman 1948 was the first to derive a combination method to estimate pet and the penman equation is still considered the most physically reasonable by many hydrologists e g shuttleworth 1992 oudin et al 2005 donohue et al 2010 zheng et al 2017 the penman equation has been modified for different conditions by various researchers e g rijtema 1965 van bavel 1966 wright and jensen 1972 thom and oliver 1977 and the most widely used variant has been the penman monteith equation which incorporates a new coefficient r s to represent the variable surface resistance monteith 1965 by defining the reference crop surface the penman monteith equation was recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao as a standardised method for estimating et0 allen et al 1998 the performance of these pet models for calculating pet under different climate conditions and underlying surface types has been evaluated on many occasions e g grace and quick 1988 xu and singh 2002 lu et al 2005 douglas et al 2009 donohue et al 2010 bormann 2011 li et al 2016 song et al 2017 valipour et al 2017a maes et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 and most of these researchers have concluded that the combination models are optimal followed by radiation based temperature based and aerodynamic models li et al 2016 however the combination models usually depend on adequate inputs of meteorological variables such as net radiation soil heat flux density air temperature wind speed and relative humidity these data may not be fully available in some study regions and the use of models that require fewer meteorological variables as inputs therefore becomes necessary given the wide array of pet models with less demanding input requirements it can be difficult to choose the most suitable model for a specific climate zone as many models were developed for specific hydroclimatic conditions and their evaluation against measured data has been limited tegos et al 2015 liu et al 2017 some researchers have even suggested that temperature based and radiation based methods provided more accurate runoff simulations than combination methods according to validation with hydrological models oudin et al 2005 wang et al 2006 the climate across china varies considerably and the country can be divided into several climatic zones song et al 2011 in various climatic zones of china previous studies have shown large disparities between pet values calculated by different models bai et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to evaluate these models and identify the most suitable model for pet calculation among the four categories with different meteorological variables as inputs by definition pet is a theoretical concept that is difficult to measure prudhomme and williamson 2013 so hydrologists have used indirect techniques to validate to determine the performance of the pet methods some researchers have concluded that the penman equation was the best formula for calculating pet and nominated it as the basis of standardising other methods moges et al 2003 others have verified pet methods by reference to other evapotranspiration variables such as et0 calculated by the fao penman monteith equation tegos et al 2015 valipour et al 2017a eta measured by the lysimeter yarami et al 2011 herrnegger et al 2012 bowen ratio energy budget rosenberry et al 2007 douglas et al 2009 and eddy correlation methods li et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 maes et al 2019 and epan measured by pan xu and singh 2001 jacobs et al 2009 xu et al 2016 in addition some studies have verified pet methods at basin scale using the water balance method lu et al 2005 or hydrological models oudin et al 2005 bai et al 2016 in this study measurements of epan are chosen to evaluate pet methods not only because epan is easy to perform but also because it integrates the effects of radiation humidity wind and air temperature and so provides a proxy of open water evaporation that is conceptually similar to pet donohue et al 2010 maes et al 2019 it should be noted that epan is distinct from pet by definition and epan exhibits biases related to the location shape and composition of the instrument maes et al 2019 to evaluate the performance of the pet methods the following two assumptions are made that the values of calculated pet should be less than the measured epan and that a significant correlation exists between pet and epan consequently using meteorological data from the china meteorological administration the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to calculate pet in different climatic zones of china by 18 different methods from four categories 2 to evaluate pet methods with measured epan values 3 to recommend the most suitable pet model in each category and 4 to calibrate the recommended pet models in different climatic zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in general china can be divided into five climatic zones the mountain plateau zone mpz temperate monsoon zone tmz temperate continental zone tcz subtropical monsoon zone smz and tropical monsoon zone fig 1 song et al 2011 in consideration of the significantly smaller land area compared with the other climatic zones the tropical monsoon zone was incorporated into the adjacent smz for data analysis fan et al 2016 feng et al 2018 hong kong macao and taiwan were not considered in this study due to the insufficient data availability the study used data from 789 meteorological stations including 82 in the mpz 351 in the smz 202 in the tmz and 154 in the tcz fig 1 the average elevations of the meteorological stations in the mpz smz tmz and tcz are 3515 6 m 430 6 m 392 4 m and 1076 4 m respectively the annual mean precipitation air temperature pan evaporation and aridity index unep 1997 1991 2000 in the four climatic zones can be seen in table 1 and the mpz smz tmz and tcz can be generally considered as semi humid humid semi arid and arid regions respectively fan et al 2016 feng et al 2018 the annual distribution indicates low epan in the qinghai tibet plateau sichuan basin and northeast china and high epan in the southeast coastal areas northwest and southwest china fig 1 the precipitation epan and air temperature showed similar significant seasonality in the four climatic zones and the values in summer were significantly higher than those in winter the sunshine durations in summer were higher than those in winter in four climatic zones and the sunshine duration in the smz was significantly lower than other climatic zones the maximum wind speeds in the four climatic zones generally occurred in spring and the wind speeds in the smz were lower than those of the other three zones the relative humidity in the smz was significantly higher than those of the other three climatic zones and the seasonal variation was not significant the relative humidity in the mpz tmz and tcz showed different seasonal variation fig 2

a physical means to measure the atmospheric evaporative demand it is a simple and robust instrument that integrates related physical factors namely radiation temperature humidity and wind speed into a single measurement of evaporation demand roderick et al 2007 lim et al 2013 due to its simplicity low cost and wide variety of applications stanhill 2002 the evaporator pan has been applied in many countries for more than half a century and the most common types are class a chinese d20 and e601b pans ggi3000 and the colorado evaporation pan mozny et al 2020 the epan measurements used to evaluate the pet models in this study were acquired using the d20 pan with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 10 cm the d20 pan has been widely used in china since the 1950s and more details of the d20 pan can be found in yang and yang 2012 since the 1980s another type of pan e 601 61 8 cm in diameter has gradually come into use in china since 2001 most meteorological stations have used both the d20 and the e 601 depending on the season chen et al 2005 feng et al 2018 however some stations lack long time series epan data to maintain instrument consistency and include as many meteorological stations as possible the research period of this study was restricted to 1991 2000 the daily pet values were calculated from the daily meteorological data and then processed to monthly and annual values 2 3 selected pet models a total of 18 pet models were selected comprising four categories four aerodynamic methods five temperature based methods six radiation based methods and three combination methods table 2 these models were selected not only because of the theoretical differences in their calculation formulas but also because they represent the full range of key input meteorological variables e g radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed to be processed the data required for the aerodynamic models were relative humidity and wind speed the temperature based models employed temperature and extraterrestrial radiation inputs the radiation based models mainly utilized radiation and temperature inputs and the inputs for the combination models were radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed the 18 pet models and their equations are briefly presented in table 2 and their detailed information can be found in the references therein 2 4 evaluation criteria and statistical analysis statistical indices were used for quantitative analysis of the pet modelling performance the pet values calculated by the 18 models and epan measured by the d20 were compared using a series of statistical criteria as follows 8 r 2 cov p e t e p a n σ p e t σ e p a n 2 9 m a e 1 n i 1 n p e t i e p a n i 10 r m s e i 1 n p e t i e p a n i 2 n 11 n s e 1 i 1 n p e t i e p a

respectively n is the number of statistical days and cov and σ are the covariance and standard deviation respectively note that measured epan values are not equivalent to pet but in theory the two variables should have a significant correlation liu et al 2010 pan evaporimeters integrate the effects of radiation humidity wind and air temperature on wet surface evaporation rates stanhill 2002 and so provide measurements of evaporation that are conceptually similar to pet rates mcvicar et al 2007 donohue et al 2010 the coefficient of determination r 2 was chosen as the most important evaluation index and the other criteria included the nse mae and rmse were used as reference evaluation indices the statistical analysis was conducted both for the overall time period and for each of the 12 months the classical statistics of the mean and standard deviation sd were obtained 12 x 1 n i 1 n x i 13 r x i x x 14 s 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 where x r and s are the mean relative deviation and sd of the data set respectively all analyses were performed using matlab v r2017b the mathworks inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 the pet values calculated by the 18 models the annual pet values at each meteorological stations by 18 models were calculated and then the average annual pet values of meteorological stations in each climatic zones were regarded as the area averaged annual pet values in different climatic zones the area averaged annual pet values calculated over china for 1991 2000 showed large disparities among the methods the greatest disparity across china as a whole was 2 95 fold between the maximum of 1265 9 mm from the brockamp wenner model and the minimum of 428 7 mm from the harbeck model in terms of the magnitude of pet the models fell in the following order brockamp wenner albrecht romanenko wright jensen penman hamon rohwer schendel milly dunne priestley taylor baier robertson oudin hargreaves rijtema jensen haise turc stephens stewart harbeck the maximum disparities of annual pet within the mpz smz tmz and tcz were 3 42 4 14 2 89 and 3 64 fold respectively the maximum values of annual pet in those four zones were 1057 1 mm from the wright jensen model 1352 9 mm from the schendel model 1254 8 mm from the brockamp wenner model and 1803 5 mm from the brockamp wenner model the harbeck model calculated the minimum annual pet values in the mpz smz and tmz which were 309 3 mm 326 7 mm and 434 5 mm respectively and the stephens stewart model calculated the minimum pet in the tcz i e 465 5 mm fig 3 the spatial distribution of annual pet over china calculated by most of the 18 models were similar to that of epan fig 4 however a few models showed different spatial distributions for example for the baier robertson hamon oudin and stephens stewart models the spatial distributions of annual pet seemed to be related to latitude except for a few meteorological stations in northwest china fig 4 in short the annual pet over china differed substantially in both values and spatial distributions among the 18 selected models highlighting the need to evaluate the models applicability 3 2 cross comparison of aerodynamic models during the study period the daily mean pet values calculated by the albrecht brockamp wenner harbeck and rohwer models across china as a whole were 3 21 mm day 1 3 41 mm day 1 1 13 mm day 1 and 2 53 mm day 1 respectively and the daily mean measured epan was 4 38 mm day 1 of the four aerodynamic pet models the rohwer model showed the strongest correlation between the calculated daily pet and epan across china as a whole during the overall time period with a mean r 2 of 0 80 followed by the brockamp wenner albrecht and harbeck models table 3 figs 5a 5b 5c and 5d in terms of the mean of r 2 the models fell in the same order in all four climatic zones rohwer brockamp wenner albrecht harbeck table 3 figs 6a 6b 6c and 6d the mean of r 2 when plotted against epan in different months in the four climatic zones showed similar seasonality for all four aerodynamic pet models figs 7a 7b 7c and 7d in the four climatic zones the mean of r 2 reached its maximum in early spring began to decrease in summer and reached its minimum in autumn the wind speed over china is higher in the spring with peaks in april but lower in autumn and lowest in august liu et al 2019a wind speed was an important variable input in all four aerodynamic pet models and the seasonality of the mean of r 2 might indicate a correlation with the seasonality of wind speed of the four climatic zones the mean of r 2 in the tcz was slightly higher than that in the tmz and both were higher than those in the smz and mpz a large number of the daily pet values calculated by the albrecht and brockamp wenner models greatly exceeded epan figs 5a and 5b and cannot be considered reasonable descriptions of the actual conditions the r 2 values between the daily pet calculated by the harbeck model against epan were significantly lower than those for the other three models in all months in all four climatic zones possibly because the harbeck model requires a wind speed measurement at 8 m above the soil surface table 2 and this value was estimated by the wind profile relationship following the procedure described in fao 56 allen et al 1998 with the highest values of r 2 combined with other evaluation indices the rohwer model can be regarded as the most suitable aerodynamic model for calculating pet and the other three aerodynamic models are not recommended for calculating pet in any climatic zones in china this is consistent with the results of singh and xu 1997 who evaluated thirteen aerodynamic models by comparison with pan evaporation at four climatological stations in north western ontario canada and recommended the rohwer model as the best aerodynamic model to calculate pet 3 3 cross comparison of temperature based models during the study period the daily mean pets calculated by the baier robertson hamon romanenko schendel and oudin models across china as a whole were 2 36 mm day 1 3 02 mm day 1 3 25 mm day 1 2 94 mm day 1 and 2 47 mm day 1 respectively and the daily mean measured epan was 4 38 mm day 1 of the five temperature based pet models the romanenko model showed the strongest correlation between the calculated daily pet and epan across china as a whole during the overall time period with a mean r 2 of 0 81 followed by the schendel baier robertson hamon and oudin models table 4 figs 5e 5f 5g 5h and 5i in the mpz and smz the models fell in the same order as for china as a whole in terms of the mean of r 2 and the order in the tmz and tcz was romanenko schendel baier robertson oudin hamon table 4 figs 6e 6f 6g 6h and 6i when comparing months the mean of r 2 between the pet from the five temperature based models and epan showed different seasonality in the four climatic zones figs 7e 7f 7g 7h and 7i the monthly variability of the mean of r 2 from both the oudin and hamon models was erratic and their values were significantly lower than the other three models indicating that these two models might not be suitable to calculate daily pet in china the mean of r 2 from the baier robertson and schendel models in the four climatic zones presented similar and significant seasonality specifically the mean of r 2 from these two models in warm months were significantly higher than those in cold months the daily temperature was an important input variable in both models and the seasonality of the temperature might account for this monthly variability of the mean of r 2 therefore the baier robertson model may be suitable to calculate pet in warm months but not in cold months like the albrecht and brockamp wenner models a large number of the daily pet values calculated by the schendel model were higher than epan fig 5h implying that this model might not be suitable to calculate daily pet in china although like the baier robertson model the relationship between its calculated pet and epan showed high r 2 in the warm months the romanenko model showed an impressively high r 2 in all months in the four climatic zones and the variability between months was much smaller than for the other temperature based models fig 7g with the highest r 2 and combined with other evaluation indexes the romanenko model can be regarded as the most suitable temperature based model for calculating pet in all climatic zones in china of the four climatic zones the mean of r 2 from the romanenko model was slightly higher in the tcz than in the tmz and both were significantly higher than those in the smz and mpz xu and singh 2001 evaluated seven temperature based models at two climatological stations in northwestern ontario canada finding that the romanenko method yielded the smallest error at both stations when the mean total differences were considered studies elsewhere however have suggested that other temperature based models were better choices for example lu et al 2005 compared six temperature based and radiation based methods in the southeastern united states and recommended the hamon model as the best temperature based method which performed relatively poorly in this study three possible reasons for this difference can be considered first the studies compared different sets of models second the evaporation variables used for evaluation were different the measured epan was used in this study and the actual evapotranspiration calculated by the water balance method was used in lu et al 2005 third the evaluation time scales were different daily in this study and annual in lu et al 2005 3 4 cross comparison of radiation based models during the study period the daily mean pet values calculated by the turc jensen haise stephens stewart hargreaves milly dunne and priestley taylor models across china as a whole were 1 98 mm day 1 2 17 mm day 1 1 39 mm day 1 2 14 mm day 1 2 16 mm day 1 and 2 22 mm day 1 respectively and the daily mean measured epan was 4 38 mm day 1 of the six radiation based pet models the turc model showed the strongest correlation between the calculated daily pet and epan across china as a whole during the overall time period with a mean r 2 of 0 78 followed by the hargreaves stephens stewart jensen haise priestley taylor and milly dunne models table 5 figs 5j 5k 5l 5m 5n and 5o the mean of r 2 in the smz tmz and tcz fell in the same order as in the whole nation and the order in the mpz was hargreaves priestley taylor stephens stewart milly dunne jensen haise turc table 5 figs 6j 6k 6l 6m 6n and 6o the mean of r 2 from all six radiation based pet models against epan in all months in the four climatic zones showed similar seasonality figs 7j 7k 7l 7m 7n and 7o in general the mean of r 2 increased in the spring reached its maximum in the early summer decreased in the autumn and reached its minimum in the winter temperature and radiation were input variables in the radiation based pet models and their seasonality might account for this monthly variability of the mean of r 2 the formula used by the stephens stewart model to calculate pet is similar to the jensen haise model and the milly dunne model can be seen as a simplified version of the priestley taylor model table 2 considering all evaluation indices the jensen haise and stephens stewart models performed similarly in pet calculation and the priestley taylor model was more suitable than the milly dunne model table 5 therefore in the following monthly cross comparison only the turc jensen haise hargreaves and priestley taylor models were selected in terms of the mean r 2 in the four climatic zones the ranking of the models differed between months fig 8 in all four climatic zones the priestley taylor model never showed the highest r 2 in any of 12 months in the mpz the turc model showed the highest r 2 from may to august and the hargreaves model showed the highest r 2 for the remaining months in the smz the turc model showed the highest r 2 in march april september and october the hargreaves model showed the highest r 2 from november to february and the jensen haise model from may to august in the tmz the turc model showed the highest r 2 in april may june and september the hargreaves model showed the highest r 2 from october to march and the jensen haise model in july and august in the tcz the turc model showed the highest r 2 from march to november and the hargreaves model showed the highest r 2 for the remaining months in summary unlike in the two categories of models analysed earlier of the radiation based models no model was significantly better than any other the turc model can be regarded as the most suitable radiation based model for calculating pet in the smz tmz and tcz and the hargreaves model in the mpz in the separate monthly calculations in the four climatic zones the turc model was the most suitable in the warm months and the hargreaves model in the cold months consistent with the results of this study many studies have recommended the turc and hargreaves models as the best radiation based methods for calculating pet e g trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 liu et al 2017 gharbia et al 2018 in the work of xu and singh 2000 the performance of the turc model showed a significant bias in cold months and this monthly variability was also observed in this study due to the differences in selected models variables used to validate evaporation evaluation criteria or evaluation scales some studies have reached different conclusions regarding the best radiation based models e g douglas et al 2009 valipour 2014 3 5 cross comparison of combination methods during the study period the daily mean pet values calculated by the rijtema wright jensen and penman models across china as a whole were 1 98 mm day 1 2 90 mm day 1 and 2 64 mm day 1 respectively and the daily mean measured epan was 4 38 mm day 1 comparing the three combination pet models all evaluation indices differed only slightly between the wright jensen and penman models during the overall time period across china as a whole as well as the four climatic zones and both models were significantly better than the rijtema model in calculating pet table 6 figs 5p 5q and 5r figs 6p 6q and 6r unlike the former three categories in all three combination models which take the largest number of meteorological variables as inputs the mean of r 2 for pet against epan in the four climatic zones showed only weak seasonality the means of r 2 in the cold months were slightly smaller than those in the warm months especially in the wright jensen and penman models figs 7p 7q and 7r in terms of the mean of r 2 the ranking of the three combination models in the four climatic zones differed slightly between months the rijtema model showed the lowest r 2 for all 12 months in all four climatic zones and the penman model showed the highest r 2 for all 12 months in the mpz and tcz the wright jensen model showed the highest r 2 in june and july in the smz and in july and august in the tmz and the penman model showed the highest r 2 in the remaining months in the smz and tmz in summary the penman model is slightly better than the wright jensen model in calculating pet and both models are significantly better than the rijtema model the main difference between the various combination models lies in the empirical wind functions liu et al 2017 which are modified based on the penman model for specific locations rosenberry et al 2004 the highest r 2 against epan in different months in this study was achieved by the penman model which can therefore be deemed the best combination model for calculating pet in all climatic zones the suitability of the penman model for calculating pet has been reported in many studies li et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 and it has even been used as a benchmark to verify other models moges et al 2003 li et al 2016 and is now the first choice for calculating pet in regions with available meteorological variables as inputs xiang et al 2020 3 6 cross comparison of four categories of the four categories of pet models across china as a whole and the four different climatic zones the highest means of r 2 for the calculated pet against epan during the overall time period were all achieved by combination methods followed by radiation based aerodynamic and temperature based methods tables 3 4 5 and 6 this ranking was valid not just for the values of r 2 but also for their stabilities fig 9 the stabilities of the categories were reflected in three aspects the first stability measure was the calculated sds of r 2 for each model individually which were significantly lower for the three combination models than for the other categories the second stability measure was the correlation of models within each category the mean values of r 2 of the three combination models were very close and differed less than those of the other three categories the third stability measure was the correlation between models in each climatic zone again the mean values of r 2 of the three combination models were very close in each zone and differed less than those of the other three categories during the overall time period the four climatic zones ranked as follows in terms of the mean of r 2 between epan and the pet calculated by the combination and aerodynamic methods tcz tmz smz mpz the corresponding rankings for the radiation based were tcz smz tmz mpz and for the temperature based methods were tcz tmz mpz smz pet is driven primarily by four key meteorological variables including radiation wind speed temperature and vapor pressure donohue et al 2010 the combination methods considered all four influencing factors while the radiation based methods ignored the aerodynamic components and the aerodynamic models ignored the energy term in the pet processes shiri 2018 shiri et al 2019 consistent with the results of this study many other studies have concluded that combination methods were optimal for calculating pet followed by radiation based models both of which usually performed better than the other two categories donohue et al 2010 li et al 2016 in this study the aerodynamic methods slightly outperformed the temperature based methods with respect to the mean of r 2 but some previous investigations have revealed the opposite xu and singh 2002 this can be attributed to differences in the selected methods for comparison and the variables used for validation xu and singh 2002 selected the best model from each category for cross comparison and used the reference crop evapotranspiration estimated from the fao penman monteith model as the variable to evaluate pet models in the present study the mean of r 2 from the four aerodynamic methods in four climatic zones was close to that from the five temperature based methods thus the choice of models for inter category comparison may have a significant impact on the mean r 2 values of each category to eliminate the bias that may therefore result the best models from each category were selected for further comparison as reported in the next section 3 7 cross comparison of the rohwer romanenko turc hargreaves and penman models on the basis of the above results the rohwer romanenko and penman models can be recommended as the optimal aerodynamic temperature based and combination methods respectively to calculate pet in all four climatic zones of the radiation based methods the turc model was the best choice in the smz tmz and tcz and the hargreaves model in the mpz therefore the above five models were selected for comparison the correlations between the pet calculated by the models against the measured epan were analysed in the former sections now we focus on the actual values of the calculated pet potential evapotranspiration is a theoretical value that is difficult to determine by combining a number of models multi model averaging can overcome the limitations of a single model diks and vrugt 2010 parrish et al 2012 the equally weighted averaged values of the five selected models were taken as the pet benchmark petb fig 10 shows the variability of the mean monthly pet calculated by the five different models and petb in the four climatic zones and fig 11 shows the relative deviations between the annual pet calculated by the five models and petb at meteorological stations on the annual and monthly scales the relationships between the calculated pet and petb showed the same pattern the pet values calculated by the rohwer model were lower than petb in the mpz and smz but higher than petb in the tmz and tcz the pet values from the romanenko model were higher than petb and those from the turc and hargreaves models were lower than petb in all four climatic zones the pet values from the penman model were very close to petb in the smz tmz and tcz which further supports the validity and accuracy of the penman model for pet calculation however it is worth noting that the pet values calculated by the penman model were higher than petb in the mpz the reason for this anomaly might be not that the penman method overestimated pet in the mpz but that the turc and hargreaves models greatly underestimated it radiation and temperature are two important input variables in the turc and hargreaves models the radiation data used in this study were estimated following the procedure described in fao 56 allen et al 1998 with constant as and bs across the whole of china as bs is the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the earth on clear days as 0 25 and bs 0 50 in this study the mpz mainly consists of to the qinghai tibet plateau where the as and bs are in fact different from other regions chen et al 2004 and measured data show that the radiation in the mpz is significantly stronger than in other areas tang et al 2013 low temperature is another feature of the mpz when the temperature was lower than the threshold value 0 for the turc model and 17 8 for the hargreaves model see the formulae in table 2 the daily pet calculated by the two models would be lower than zero implying an underestimation of pet indeed the pet values calculated by the turc and hargreaves models were underestimated across china figs 11e 11f the low temperature and underestimation of radiation in the mpz might have led to an underestimation of pet and in turn an underestimation of petb moreover the ratio of petb to epan in the mpz was significantly lower than those in the other three zones fig 11b this is further evidence that the calculated petb was underestimated in the mpz 3 8 calibration of the rohwer romanenko turc hargreaves and penman models if the averaged values of the five selected models were taken as petb the empirical coefficients in those five pet models can be local calibrated in four different climatic zones table 7 showed the original and calibrated coefficients of the rohwer romanenko turc hargreaves and penman models in different climatic zones compared the calculation pet values of fives original models the calculation pet values of fives pet models with calibrated coefficients were closer to petb fig 12 the evaluation criteria showed that the calibrated pet models could be used to calculate pet more accurately with higher r 2 and nse and lower mae and rmse table 7 among all five models the rohwer model had the largest coefficients adjustment and provided the most significant improvement fig 12 most of aerodynamic models have developed for specific region and might be more applicable for regions with same conditions shiri 2018 calibration of the coefficients in the rohwer model could effectively improve its ability to calculate pet table 7 the combination methods considered all meteorological factors and the original penman model could calculate pet well so the calibrated penman model did not progress as much as other models of the four climate zones the regional calibrated models had the best improvement in the tcz because the pet values calculated by the five original models in this climate zone differed the most the improvement of the five calibrated models in the smz was the least significant indicating that the original models could calculate pet well in the smz 4 conclusions meteorological data from 789 meteorological stations in four different climatic zones in china were used to evaluate 18 methods for calculating daily pet including four aerodynamic five temperature based six radiation based and three combination methods both within the four climatic zones and across china as a whole the area averaged annual pet showed large disparities between models and the maximum disparity of annual pet across china was 2 95 fold between the maximum of 1265 9 mm from the brockamp wenner model and the minimum of 428 7 mm from the harbeck model the values and spatial distributions of annual pet over china calculated by the 18 models also showed significant differences the combination models were the most optimal methods for calculating daily pet in the four climatic zones followed by the radiation based models and both categories performed better than the aerodynamic and temperature based methods the rohwer model was the only recommended aerodynamic method for calculating daily pet in china and the romanenko model was the only recommended temperature based method these two models both showed better performance in the tcz and tmz than in the smz and mpz the remaining aerodynamic and temperature based methods analysed in this study are arguably not suitable for calculating daily pet in china s four climatic zones all six radiation based methods seemed able to estimate pet in china but proved markedly more suitable in the warm months of the radiation based methods the turc model slightly outperformed the other models in the smz tmz and tcz and the hargreaves model showed marginally the best performance in the mpz both recommended radiation based methods need to be used with caution in the cold months all three combination methods were suitable for calculating pet in china and the penman model was the optimal choice in all four climatic zones the best models from each category were selected for further cross comparison and the mean pet values from those models were taken as the pet benchmark the pet values calculated by the rohwer model were higher than the benchmark in the tmz and tcz but lower than the benchmark in the mpz and smz the pet values calculated by the rohwer model were higher than the benchmark in all four climatic zones the pet values calculated by the penman model were closest to the benchmark in the smz tmz and tcz although the hargreaves model was closest in the mpz the turc and hargreaves models were both lower than the benchmark in all four climatic zones and due to low temperature and their estimated radiation inputs the two models might greatly underestimate pet in the mpz the equally weighted averaged values of the rohwer romanenko turc hargreaves and penman models were taken as pet benchmark and the empirical coefficients in those five pet models were local calibrated in four different climatic zones the regional calibration can improve the accuracy of these models to calculate pet and provide an important reference for the study on pet evapotranspiration and hydrological processes in different climatic zones declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10326,adoption of suitable irrigation scheduling planting technique and mulching can be very useful to improve the growth yield and quality of field mustard crop which is mainly grown in winter season with residual moisture a field experiment was carried out in winter seasons of 2014 15 and 2015 16 at crop research farm of pantnagar india to evaluate the effect of irrigation levels planting methods and mulching on nutrient uptake yield quality water and fertilizer productivity of field mustard brassica rapa l var trilocularis roxb kitam at sandy loam soil results revealed that irrigation at 1 2 irrigation water cumulative pan evaporation ratio iw cpe ratio resulted in higher yield n p k and s uptake by plant oil quality and fertilizer productivity and this irrigation level was at par with 0 9 iw cpe ratio during 1st year of study when there was good amount of winter rainfall among different planting methods and mulching practices raised bed planting and mulching with rice straw at 5000 kg ha 1 exhibited significantly higher yield nutrient uptake oil quality water and fertilizer productivity of the crop than that of in flat bed planting and no mulch however it was also recorded that water productivity was reduced by increasing the irrigation levels from this study it was evaluated that in a normal winter rainfall year field mustard could be irrigated at 0 9 iw cpe ratio to achieve higher yield quality and fertilizer productivity of the crop in sandy loam soil while irrigation should be given at 1 2 iw cpe ratio if there is scarcity in winter rainfall keywords irrigation scheduling raised bed planting straw mulching yield quality field mustard 1 introduction india contributes world s 28 acreage and 20 production of rapeseed mustard shekhawat et al 2012 being third largest producer after canada and china india plays a crucial role in global rapeseed mustard industry the area production and productivity of this crop in india are 6 9 m ha 8 78 mt and 1281 kg ha 1 respectively goi government of india 2019 this crop is mainly grown during winter season in india as a rainfed crop on residual soil moisture under marginal and sub marginal soils hence the productivity of this crop is much lower in india and this should be addressed with suitable agronomic management at the same time production of premium quality of mustard oil is also a prime concern besides getting higher yield only as this oil is rich in mufa monounsaturated fatty acids which is very essential for our health it is good for the heart lightens skin helps in hair growth prevents premature graying of hair etc medical news today 2019 although water requirement of mustard is not so high but to exploit its full potential it is essential to provide sufficient water balance during critical crop growth stages which are sensitive to moisture stress conditions maintenance of optimum moisture condition in the root zone depth is crucial for proper growth as well as development of plant and for mitigating moisture stress at critical crop growth stages bodner et al 2015 it can be achieved through adoption of the irrigation scheduling at right time and good conservation practices moreover suitable irrigation scheduling to the crop can improve its yield and overall quality also rai et al 2017 alamin et al 2019 reported that optimum irrigation scheduling and time of sowing is important to achieve higher yield of mustard some previous findings also reported that providing irrigation at right time can improve the nutrient uptake and oil quality of rapeseed and mustard besides increasing its growth and yield meena 2011 singh et al 2007 comparing various sowing methods raised bed planting method found to be superior for raising the mustard crop as it maintains the proper aeration and nutrition in soil solution the raised bed planting method has emerged as a viable practice in minimizing the water losses and utilizing conserved soil moisture during crop growth period jat et al 2016 this planting method plays a significant role in better seed germination and root proliferation reduces the mechanical resistance to plant roots increases soil porosity and encourages crop growth and prevention of water stagnation after irrigation results in enhancing the water use efficiency of crop ahmad and mahmood 2005 khan et al 2012 bed planting recorded 35 of water saving and resulted in 32 higher water use efficiency buttar et al 2006 broad bed and furrow ridge sowing are also adopted for sowing of mustard to get better crop stand and yield singh et al 2017 in intensive rice mustard cropping system in india sowing of winter season mustard is often delayed due to late harvest of previous crop rice under such condition growth of mustard is affected mainly because of low temperature and seasonal drought in winter resulting in poor yield of mustard large amounts of rice straw are produced in rice based cropping systems residue burning is one of the major issues these days gupta et al 2004 farmers have to burn these surplus amounts of rice straw to sow the winter crop timely and this is resulting in waste of resources as well as environmental pollution bhuvaneshwari et al 2019 considering this mulching with rice straw in winter mustard may be a potential practice which can improve the micro climate thereby improve productivity of winter oilseed in order to boost the productivity of rapeseed mustard adoption of suitable management practices that mitigate the negative effects resulting from the late planting are the major area of concern and research the practice of straw mulching in crop fields has been widely applied across the globe ghosh et al 2006 mulching with crop straw can improve the availability of soil water for longer period by improving infiltration rate as well as reducing the evaporation loss of water from top soil layer qin et al 2006 straw mulching also plays a vital role in keeping the soil warmer in winter that results in better mineralization process in soil and cooler in summer as well as reduces soil temperature oscillation blanco canqui and lal 2009 therefore use of rice straw mulch in winter rapeseed mustard crop can reduce the burning of these surplus amounts of straw moreover this practice can increase the productivity of the winter crops considering its advantages towards soil micro climate su et al 2014 singh et al 2019 reported that application of rice straw mulch can improve the yield of mustard to the tune of 11 12 over no mulching jat et al 2017 also confirmed that the mulching with rice straw can boost the protein and oil content of mustard oil however the research findings on the effect of varied planting methods along with mulching under different irrigation scheduling on quality nutrient uptake and fertilizer productivity of field mustard crop are scarce considering all of the above the present experiment was designed keeping the scientific question in mind whether frequent irrigation in raised bed planting combined with rice straw mulching in field mustard can improve its yield quality nutrient uptake water as well as fertilizer productivity or not hence the focal objectives of this research were to study the effect of different irrigation levels planting methods and mulching on nutrient uptake yield and quality of field mustard in the sandy loam soil of tarai region of uttarakhand 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental details the field experiment was conducted at c5 block of water management section of n e borlaug crop research centre g b pant university of agriculture and technology pantnagar india 29 n 79 3 e and 243 8 m above msl during 2014 15 and 2015 16 the experimental area was characterised by sub humid sub tropical climate

permanent wilting point were around 18 20 and 8 10 gravimetric water contents respectively the experiment was laid out in a split plot design having three replications main plot comprised of four levels of irrigation scheduling on the basis of iw cpe ratio viz 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 while different planting methods viz flat bed and ridge bed sowing as well as different mulching i e mulch and no

top dressed into two equal splits at 30 and 45 das for effective weed management pre emergence application of pendimethalin at 1 0 kg a i ha 1 was used foliar spray of monocrotophos at 0 5 kg ha 1 was done to prevent aphid infestation at flowering stage harvesting of the crop was done on 10th february 2015 and 25th january 2016 2 3 irrigation scheduling planting and mulching a common irrigation was applied at 10 and 9 das during 2014 15 and 2015 16 respectively to ensure proper germination as well as establishment of the crop irrespective of cumulative pan evaporation readings afterward irrigations were given as per irrigation water iw cumulative pan evaporation cpe ratio iw cpe ratio this is a climatological approach of scheduling irrigation in this approach a known amount of irrigation water iw is applied when cumulative pan evaporation cpe reaches a predetermined level pan evaporation denoted the water loss because of evaporation from an open pan evaporimeter the total amount of irrigation water iw was applied in each irrigation was 50 mm during both the years therefore the cumulative pan evaporation cpe values were 167 83 56 and 42 mm at iw cpe ratio of 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 correspondingly irrigation frequency was varied at same level of iw cpe ratio due to variation in rainfall in crop duration during 2014 15 there was good amount of effective rainfall of 81 mm in crop duration so numbers of irrigations at iw cpe ratio of 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 were 1 10 das 1 10 das 2 10 and 31 das and 3 10 26 and 39 das respectively including a common irrigation at 10 das in the next year of study rainfall was much lesser 7 mm than year 1 therefore the numbers of irrigations were at iw cpe ratio of 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 were 1 9 das 2 9 and 43 das 3 9 32 and 57 das and 4 9 26 41 and 68 das respectively including a common irrigation at 9 das details of irrigation scheduling are listed in table 1 raised beds having top width of 40 cm were prepared manually inverted furrows of 20 cm in between two raised bed were utilized for irrigation purpose two rows of field mustard were sown on the raised bed at a spacing of 30 cm in between the rows sowing of seeds in flat and raised beds was done in rows having spacing of 30 cm row row and 10 cm plant plant rice straw at 5000 kg ha 1 was applied in both flat bed and raised bed plots under mulching treatment at 25 das while under no mulch in both flat and ridge bed planting no such rice straw was applied mulch was uniformly spread in between the rows of crop in flat bed and in between rows and furrows under raised bed planting method details of the experimental design are presented in fig 2 2 4 nutrient uptake plant samples were collected from each plot at the time of harvesting and these samples were dried at

productivity oil content oil yield and protein yield during both the years of study supplementary tables s1 s2 while the abovementioned interaction effects were significant for k uptake water productivity and protein content during 2nd year of the study interaction effects of irrigations mulching planting mulching and irrigation planting mulching were found to be non significant during both the years 3 1 nutrient uptake n p k and s uptake by the crop were influenced significantly due to different irrigation levels planting methods and mulching table 2 the increasing trend of nutrients uptake by the plant was observed with the increase in irrigation frequency during both the years of study the maximum amounts of n p k and s uptake were recorded in irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio and this irrigation level was superior to all other irrigation levels concerning nutrient uptake by the plant it was also recorded that the nutrient uptake was more in year 2 than year 1 during 2015 16 almost 22 more n uptake and 15 more p k and s uptake were recorded over the 1st year of study concerning various planting methods and mulching it was observed that raised bed planting and mulching exhibited higher n p k and s uptake than flat bed and no mulching respectively the interaction effects of irrigation levels and planting methods were found to be significant in case of n and s uptake for both the years of study while interaction effect of k uptake was significant only in 2015 16 table 3 irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio in raised bed system exhibited the highest uptake of n k and s irrigation at 0 9 iw cpe ratio in raised bed system also showed considerably higher nutrient uptake by the crop over any other treatment combinations except irrigation at 1 2 tw cpe ratio flat bed planting it was also witnessed that the rate of augmentation of n and s uptake by the plant was higher by increasing the irrigation levels under raised bed system in the 2nd year of study than the 1st year 3 2 yield the seed and stover yields of field mustard were differed significantly owing to different irrigation levels planting methods and mulching during both the years table 4 the maximum amounts of both seed and stover yield were recorded in irrigation level of 1 2 iw cpe ratio however this level of irrigation was statistically at par with 0 9 iw cpe ratio regarding seed yield it was also observed that the yield was a bit higher in year 2 that the yield of year 1 when irrigation was given at iw cpe ratio of 0 6 or above there was a considerable rise of almost 20 in the seed yield by increasing the irrigation level from 0 6 to 0 9 iw cpe ratio various planting methods and mulching significantly influenced the yield of the crop during both the years of study raised bed planting resulted in about 7 12 more seed yield than flat bed planting similar result was recorded in case of mulching as well mulching exhibited almost 17 and 10 more seed and stover yield respectively than no mulch the interaction effects between irrigation levels and planting methods were found to be significant concerning seed yield of field mustard during both the years of the study fig 3 during year 1 the maximum amount of seed yield was recorded under 1 2 iw cpe raised bed planting being at par with irrigation at 0 9 iw cpe raised bed planting however in year 2 seed yield under irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe raised bed planting was superior to all other interaction effects 3 3 quality the quality parameters viz oil content and yield as well as protein content and yield were estimated and the results are depicted in table 5 in both the years of study oil contents as well as oil yield were significantly increased with irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio over 0 6 iw cpe and 0 3 iw cpe ratio however there was no such significant difference in the oil content under irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio and 0 9 iw cpe ratio concerning protein content and protein yield irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio found to be the superior over all other irrigation levels during both the years of study except in case of protein content in 2014 15 where irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio and 0 9 iw cpe ratio were at par considerable augmentation in oil and protein yield was observed by increasing the level of irrigation from iw cpe ratio of 0 6 0 9 concerning different planting methods it was observed that raised bed planting increased oil and protein content as well as oil and protein yield to the tune of almost 1 1 4 4 5 5 5 13 13 5 and 19 19 5 respectively over flat bed planting application of mulching exhibited significant influence on quality parameters during both the years this practice increased oil content and yield about 1 1 4 and 13 13 5 over no mulch interaction effects between irrigation levels and planting methods on oil content as well as yield was found to be significant during both the years table 6 application of irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio in raised bed planting method showed the maximum amount of oil content as well as yield of the crop during both the years of study and this treatment combination was at par with irrigation level at 0 9 iw cpe ratio in raised bed planting concerning oil content during both the years and oil yield in 2014 15 concerning protein yield the interaction effects were significant during both the years fig 4b however the interaction effects were found to be significant only in year 2 for protein content in seed fig 4a the variations in the results about protein content in the seeds were less in year 2 the maximum protein content in the seeds was found in irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe raised bed planting being at par with irrigation at 0 9 iw cpe raised bed planting 3 4 glucosinolate and fatty acid profiles glucosinolate content and fatty acid profiles in seed of field mustard were significantly influenced by varied irrigation levels and mulching methods during both years of experimentations table 7 however different planting methods had no significant effect on glucosinolate content fatty acid profiles were significantly influenced owing to practicing different planting methods except erucic acid during both the years higher glucosinolate content in seed was found at irrigation level of 1 2 iw cpe ratio being at par with irrigation at 0 9 iw cpe ratio the minimum glucosinolate content in seed was recorded in 0 3 iw cpe ratio application of mulch exhibited significantly higher glucosinolate content in seed as compared to no mulch during both the years concerning fatty acid profiles the highest amounts of saturated fatty acid oleic acid linoleic acid linolenic acid and eicosenoic acid contents in the seed were recorded under irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio being at par with 0 9 iw cpe ratio during both the years increasing irrigation level from 0 6 to 0 9 iw cpe ratio showed increase in saturated fatty acid oleic acid linoleic acid linolenic acid eicosenoic acid and erucic acid contents in the seed of field mustard about 3 12 5 11 5 6 6 9 7 and 2 respectively it was observed that rate of increment in the fatty acid profiles was higher in year 1 than year 2 due increase in irrigation frequency it was also observed that the deviations in the erucic acid content were the minimum owing to changes in the irrigation levels concerning planting methods and mulching it was observed that raised bed planting and mulching significantly improved the fatty acid profiles except erucic acid content which was varied significantly due to different planting methods raised bed system increased all the fatty acid profiles to the tune of about 3 14 over flat bed while mulching escalated fatty acid compositions almost 2 5 14 over no mulching 3 5 water and fertilizer productivity the water productivity was significantly influenced by varied irrigation levels planting methods and mulching fig 5a c the values of water productivity owing to various irrigation levels planting methods and mulching were much higher in 2nd year of study than 1st year in general it was found in this study that the yield was augmented with increasing the level of irrigation however water productivity was considerably decreased with the increasing in the irrigation level during 2015 16 during 2014 15 there was a little increase in the water productivity by increasing irrigation level from 0 3 to 0 6 iw cpe ratio however the water productivity was decreased about 17 9 and 18 4 by increasing irrigation level from 0 6 0 9 iw cpe ratio and 0 9 1 2 iw cpe ratio respectively during 2014 15 in 2nd year of study there was sharp fall of water productivity about 26 15 and 17 when irrigation levels were increased from 0 3 to 0 6 0 6 0 9 and 0 9 1 2 iw cpe ration respectively raised bed planting method resulted in significantly higher water productivity of 9 4 and 10 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2014 15 and 2015 16 respectively over flat bed planting similar trend of water productivity was also found in case of mulching application of mulch resulted in significantly higher water productivity as compared to no mulch during both the years of study concerning interaction effects between irrigation and planting it was observed that the interaction was significant only in the 2nd year of the study the maximum water productivity was recorded under irrigation at 0 3 iw cpe raised bed planting being at par with irrigation at 0 3 iw cpe flat bed planting fig 6 fertilizer productivity was evaluated in terms of partial factor of productivity pfp pfp of n p and s fertilizers pfpnps were increased significantly with augmenting the irrigation levels table 8 it was also observed that the variation in the pfpnps was higher during 2nd year of study than the variations recorded in 1st year it was also evaluated that the pfps was much higher than that of pfpn and pfpp similar trends in the pfp of n p and s fertilizers as influenced by irrigation levels planting methods and mulching were found as the trend were recorded in case of seed yield of field mustard as fertilizer productivity was calculated by dividing the yield to the amount of fertilizer used to produce that yield concerning the interaction effects between different irrigations and planting methods on pfp again the same trend was recorded like the trend observed in case of yield of the crop table 9 here we did not mention the pfpk as the values of pfpk and pfps were same because the application rate of both k and s fertilizer was 30 kg ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient uptake higher nutrient uptake through the increasing of irrigation frequency can be attributed to better availability of moisture with application of irrigation which is helpful in increase in the nutrient contents in plant silber 2005 silber et al 2003 described that frequent irrigation improved the uptake of less mobile nutrients such as p and k the soluble fraction of nutrients present in the soil solution flow to the roots as water is taken up k is absorbed strongly by soils and only present in small quantities in the soil solution k moves to the root by diffusion which was further facilitated by the presence of sufficient moisture in the root zone verma et al 2014 reported significantly higher n uptake by plant with increase in irrigation frequency xu et al 2004 also found that p uptake by plant was significantly increased in irrigated condition over no irrigation it was also found that nutrient uptake was higher in the 2nd year than that of 1st year of study the rainfall was normal 81 mm during the growing period of 1st year and deficit 7 mm during 2nd year therefore impact of irrigation was higher in the 2nd year of study better nutrient uptake in raised bed planting might be due to the fact that bed planting resulted in better utilization of available resources like water nutrients and sunlight due to favorable microclimate similar findings were also illustrated by kantwa et al 2005 parihar et al 2009 and dodwadiya and sharma 2012 similarly mulching also reduced the water loss thereby increasing the availability of moisture to the plant so higher nutrient uptake was attained along with water moreover mulching reduces weed population nwosisi et al 2019 which might be the reason behind higher uptake of nutrients as well the results also confirmed the findings of hariom et al 2013 tetarwal et al 2013 parihar et al 2009 and dodwadiya and sharma 2012 4 2 yield in normal rainfall winter season of 2014 15 seed yield was significantly enhanced up to irrigation at 0 9 iw cpe ratio however further appliance of irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio exhibited higher yield over irrigation at 0 9 iw cpe ratio however there was no statistical difference in the seed yield table 4 on the other hand winter season of 2015 16 was deficient in rainfall here seed yield was significantly increased up to irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio this could be describes as applying timely irrigation to the critical stages of the crop ensured sufficient moisture availability helping in proper utilization of nutrients and also a formulation and partitioning of photosynthates to the sink similar findings were also illustrated by piri 2012 hergert et al 2016 and gupta et al 2017 significantly higher seed yield with the increase in irrigation frequency was also reported by them higher yield at raised bed planting system might be due to the fact that this method helped in drainage of excess water in addition to ensured proper aeration when there was excess rainfall and also facilitated moisture conservation similar effects of planting methods have also been reported by kuotsu et al 2014 mulch had significant influenced on seed yield in both the years mulch slowed down the energy exchange at soil surface thermal diffusion and provided treat insulation making uniform soil temperature that minimized evaporation losses regar et al 2007 the higher seed yield was recorded under paddy straw mulch in this study conformed to earlier results reported by regar et al 2007 and sharma et al 2014 4 3 quality oil content and oil yields of field mustard were varies from 41 6 to 43 1 and 388 690 kg ha 1 respectively during two years of study owing to changes in the irrigation scheduling from 0 3 to 1 2 iw cpe ratio although the variations in the oil content with varied irrigation levels were not wide but the oil content was increased a bit with increasing the irrigation frequency shekhawat et al 2012 also reported significantly higher oil content in the indian mustard seed with the increase in irrigation frequency better meristematic activity due to enhanced turgidity and cell division resulted in higher p and s uptake by the plant this might be the reason behind the augmentation in oil content under higher irrigation frequency fig 7a b also depicts the strong relationship between s uptake and oil content in the seed during both the years yadav et al 2010 and verma et al 2014 also reported in similar way from their previous experiments raised bed planting and mulching also increased both p and s uptake by the crop than flat sowing or no mulching thus oil content and oil yield was higher under such methods similar results also reported by tetarwal et al 2013 considerable n uptake was recorded through the better irrigation management raised bed planting and mulching therefore higher protein content and protein yields were observed in these management practices fig 8a b also represents strong relationship between n uptake and protein content in the seed during 2014 15 and 2015 16 similar findings were also reported by verma et al 2014 glucosinolate content was increased by increasing irrigation frequencies and mulching during both the years of study the exact reason behind such increase in glucosinolate content though the increasing irrigation levels and mulching was not clear however better s nutrition through improved irrigation management and mulching might improve the glucosinolate content as they are s containing water soluble compounds aires et al 2006 higher correlation between s uptake and glucosinolate content during both the years also confirmed the above statement tables 10 and 11 different irrigation levels planting methods and mulching significantly altered the saturated fatty acid as well as major fatty acid profiles pavlista et al 2016 also reported that providing irrigations during critical stages of canola improved the fatty acid profiles champolivier and merrien 1996 also discussed that water stress during flowering resulted in decrease in oil as well as fatty acids profile in this present study also irrigation at 0 3 or 0 6 iw cpe ration might resulted in water stress to the field mustard as a result fatty acid profiles were reduced to the tune of almost 2 12 when irrigation level was reduced from 1 2 or 0 9 iw cpe ratio to 0 6 or 0 3 iw cpe ratio during both the years of study strong correlations amongst fatty acid profiles and s uptake was also found tables 10 and 11 thus higher s uptake with increased irrigation frequency raised bed planting and mulching might be another rationale behind escalation of fatty acid profiles 4 4 water productivity water productivity of field mustard was ranged from 7 1 to 10 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 7 7 14 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 during 1st and 2nd year of study respectively due to different irrigation levels fig 5a it was observed that increasing the irrigation frequency decreased water productivity in general mustard is a crop that needs less amount of water compared to cereals like rice wheat etc subsequently at lower level of irrigation water iw cpe ratio of 0 3 or 0 6 there was still some productivity of the crop this might be the reason behind higher water productivity at less frequency of irrigation particularly in the rainfall deficit 2nd year of study the water consumption was increased at a higher proportion by increasing the irrigation frequency than the normal rainfall year 1 however the yield was not augmented proportionately to the higher water consumption which might be the reason behind lower water productivity this might be the reason behind higher reduction in water productivity by increasing irrigation frequency in the year 2 similar results were also reported by gupta et al 2017 raised bed system showed higher water productivity than flat sowing this might be attributed to supply of adequate amount of irrigation water for longer period through the furrows in between two beds parihar et al 2017 mulching with rice straw reduced evaporation loss of water from the soil surface thereby moisture availability was increased which ultimately reflected through higher yield of the crop along with improved water productivity than no mulch this finding is in accordance with aggarwal and goswami 2003 and jat et al 2013 higher water productivity in low rainfall year during 2015 16 supports the previous findings reported by thierfelder and wall 2010 4 5 fertilizer productivity partial factor productivity pfp of n p and s fertilizers were found to be increased with the increasing in irrigation levels however the best response of pfpnps was found upto irrigation level at 0 9 iw cpe ratio during year 1 while in year 2 the response was upto 1 2 iw cpe ratio maintaining adequate moisture in the soil profile during critical crop growing stages ultimately improved yield as well as nutrient use efficiency of the crop ierna et al 2011 this was probable cause behind higher pfp of n p and s with better irrigation management practices such increase in pfpnps with increasing irrigations validates the importance of water availability that can improve the ability of plant to use the soil available nutrients proficiently ierna et al 2011 this finding is corroborated with the findings previously reported by di paola and rinaldi 2008 and ierna et al 2011 higher pfp in raised bed planting and mulching might be ascribed to higher nutrient uptake as well as use efficiency in these management practices than flat sowing and no mulch all these are in accordance with the findings reported by wang et al 2019 5 conclusion based on the findings of this study it can be stated that the yield of field mustard can be improved with the adoption of suitable irrigation scheduling as well as planting method along with largely available straw mulching concerning irrigation it can be concluded that the irrigation can be scheduled at 0 9 iw cpe ratio when there is good amount of winter rainfall in sandy loam soil on the other hand irrigation should be given at 1 2 iw cpe ratio when there is moisture stress owing to having negligible winter rainfall proper irrigation managements raised bed plating and mulching with rice straw at 5000 kg ha 1 were not only improved the yield of the mustard crop such management practices proved to augment the overall quality of the seed as well as oil however it was observed that water productivity of the crop was decreased by increasing irrigation frequency particularly in the low rainfall year in contrast raised bed plating and mulching exhibited improved water productivity than flat sowing and no mulch fertilizer productivity was increased to a good extent with the increased irrigation frequency raised bed planting and

10326,adoption of suitable irrigation scheduling planting technique and mulching can be very useful to improve the growth yield and quality of field mustard crop which is mainly grown in winter season with residual moisture a field experiment was carried out in winter seasons of 2014 15 and 2015 16 at crop research farm of pantnagar india to evaluate the effect of irrigation levels planting methods and mulching on nutrient uptake yield quality water and fertilizer productivity of field mustard brassica rapa l var trilocularis roxb kitam at sandy loam soil results revealed that irrigation at 1 2 irrigation water cumulative pan evaporation ratio iw cpe ratio resulted in higher yield n p k and s uptake by plant oil quality and fertilizer productivity and this irrigation level was at par with 0 9 iw cpe ratio during 1st year of study when there was good amount of winter rainfall among different planting methods and mulching practices raised bed planting and mulching with rice straw at 5000 kg ha 1 exhibited significantly higher yield nutrient uptake oil quality water and fertilizer productivity of the crop than that of in flat bed planting and no mulch however it was also recorded that water productivity was reduced by increasing the irrigation levels from this study it was evaluated that in a normal winter rainfall year field mustard could be irrigated at 0 9 iw cpe ratio to achieve higher yield quality and fertilizer productivity of the crop in sandy loam soil while irrigation should be given at 1 2 iw cpe ratio if there is scarcity in winter rainfall keywords irrigation scheduling raised bed planting straw mulching yield quality field mustard 1 introduction india contributes world s 28 acreage and 20 production of rapeseed mustard shekhawat et al 2012 being third largest producer after canada and china india plays a crucial role in global rapeseed mustard industry the area production and productivity of this crop in india are 6 9 m ha 8 78 mt and 1281 kg ha 1 respectively goi government of india 2019 this crop is mainly grown during winter season in india as a rainfed crop on residual soil moisture under marginal and sub marginal soils hence the productivity of this crop is much lower in india and this should be addressed with suitable agronomic management at the same time production of premium quality of mustard oil is also a prime concern besides getting higher yield only as this oil is rich in mufa monounsaturated fatty acids which is very essential for our health it is good for the heart lightens skin helps in hair growth prevents premature graying of hair etc medical news today 2019 although water requirement of mustard is not so high but to exploit its full potential it is essential to provide sufficient water balance during critical crop growth stages which are sensitive to moisture stress conditions maintenance of optimum moisture condition in the root zone depth is crucial for proper growth as well as development of plant and for mitigating moisture stress at critical crop growth stages bodner et al 2015 it can be achieved through adoption of the irrigation scheduling at right time and good conservation practices moreover suitable irrigation scheduling to the crop can improve its yield and overall quality also rai et al 2017 alamin et al 2019 reported that optimum irrigation scheduling and time of sowing is important to achieve higher yield of mustard some previous findings also reported that providing irrigation at right time can improve the nutrient uptake and oil quality of rapeseed and mustard besides increasing its growth and yield meena 2011 singh et al 2007 comparing various sowing methods raised bed planting method found to be superior for raising the mustard crop as it maintains the proper aeration and nutrition in soil solution the raised bed planting method has emerged as a viable practice in minimizing the water losses and utilizing conserved soil moisture during crop growth period jat et al 2016 this planting method plays a significant role in better seed germination and root proliferation reduces the mechanical resistance to plant roots increases soil porosity and encourages crop growth and prevention of water stagnation after irrigation results in enhancing the water use efficiency of crop ahmad and mahmood 2005 khan et al 2012 bed planting recorded 35 of water saving and resulted in 32 higher water use efficiency buttar et al 2006 broad bed and furrow ridge sowing are also adopted for sowing of mustard to get better crop stand and yield singh et al 2017 in intensive rice mustard cropping system in india sowing of winter season mustard is often delayed due to late harvest of previous crop rice under such condition growth of mustard is affected mainly because of low temperature and seasonal drought in winter resulting in poor yield of mustard large amounts of rice straw are produced in rice based cropping systems residue burning is one of the major issues these days gupta et al 2004 farmers have to burn these surplus amounts of rice straw to sow the winter crop timely and this is resulting in waste of resources as well as environmental pollution bhuvaneshwari et al 2019 considering this mulching with rice straw in winter mustard may be a potential practice which can improve the micro climate thereby improve productivity of winter oilseed in order to boost the productivity of rapeseed mustard adoption of suitable management practices that mitigate the negative effects resulting from the late planting are the major area of concern and research the practice of straw mulching in crop fields has been widely applied across the globe ghosh et al 2006 mulching with crop straw can improve the availability of soil water for longer period by improving infiltration rate as well as reducing the evaporation loss of water from top soil layer qin et al 2006 straw mulching also plays a vital role in keeping the soil warmer in winter that results in better mineralization process in soil and cooler in summer as well as reduces soil temperature oscillation blanco canqui and lal 2009 therefore use of rice straw mulch in winter rapeseed mustard crop can reduce the burning of these surplus amounts of straw moreover this practice can increase the productivity of the winter crops considering its advantages towards soil micro climate su et al 2014 singh et al 2019 reported that application of rice straw mulch can improve the yield of mustard to the tune of 11 12 over no mulching jat et al 2017 also confirmed that the mulching with rice straw can boost the protein and oil content of mustard oil however the research findings on the effect of varied planting methods along with mulching under different irrigation scheduling on quality nutrient uptake and fertilizer productivity of field mustard crop are scarce considering all of the above the present experiment was designed keeping the scientific question in mind whether frequent irrigation in raised bed planting combined with rice straw mulching in field mustard can improve its yield quality nutrient uptake water as well as fertilizer productivity or not hence the focal objectives of this research were to study the effect of different irrigation levels planting methods and mulching on nutrient uptake yield and quality of field mustard in the sandy loam soil of tarai region of uttarakhand 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental details the field experiment was conducted at c5 block of water management section of n e borlaug crop research centre

top dressed into two equal splits at 30 and 45 das for effective weed management pre emergence application of pendimethalin at 1 0 kg a i ha 1 was used foliar spray of monocrotophos at 0 5 kg ha 1 was done to prevent aphid infestation at flowering stage harvesting of the crop was done on 10th february 2015 and 25th january 2016 2 3 irrigation scheduling planting and mulching a common irrigation was applied at 10 and 9 das during 2014 15 and 2015 16 respectively to ensure proper germination as well as establishment of the crop irrespective of cumulative pan evaporation readings afterward irrigations were given as per irrigation water iw cumulative pan evaporation cpe ratio iw cpe ratio this is a climatological approach of scheduling irrigation in this approach a known amount of irrigation water iw is applied when cumulative pan evaporation cpe reaches a predetermined level pan evaporation denoted the water loss because of evaporation from an open pan evaporimeter the total amount of irrigation water iw was applied in each irrigation was 50 mm during both the years therefore the cumulative pan evaporation cpe values were 167 83 56 and 42 mm at iw cpe ratio of 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 correspondingly irrigation frequency was varied at same level of iw cpe ratio due to variation in rainfall in crop duration during 2014 15 there was good amount of effective rainfall of 81 mm in crop duration so numbers of irrigations at iw cpe ratio of 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 were 1 10 das 1 10 das 2 10 and 31 das and 3 10 26 and 39 das respectively including a common irrigation at 10 das in the next year of study rainfall was much lesser 7 mm than year 1 therefore the numbers of irrigations were at iw cpe ratio of 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 were 1 9 das 2 9 and 43 das 3 9 32 and 57 das and 4 9 26 41 and 68 das respectively including a common irrigation at 9 das details of irrigation scheduling are listed in table 1 raised beds having top width of 40 cm were prepared manually inverted

of experiment supplementary tables s1 s2 the interaction effects between irrigation levels and planting methods irrigation planting were significant for total n s uptake seed yield fertilizer productivity oil content oil yield and protein yield during both the years of study supplementary tables s1 s2 while the abovementioned interaction effects were significant for k uptake water productivity and protein content during 2nd year of the study interaction effects of irrigations mulching planting mulching and irrigation planting mulching were found to be non significant during both the years 3 1 nutrient uptake n p k and s uptake by the crop were influenced significantly due to different irrigation levels planting methods and mulching table 2 the increasing trend of nutrients uptake by the plant was observed with the increase in irrigation frequency during both the years of study the maximum amounts of n p k and s uptake were recorded in irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio and this irrigation level was superior to all other irrigation levels concerning nutrient uptake by the plant it was also recorded that the nutrient uptake was more in year 2 than year 1 during 2015 16 almost 22 more n uptake and 15 more p k and s uptake were recorded over the 1st year of study concerning various planting methods and mulching it was observed that raised bed planting and mulching exhibited higher n p k and s uptake than flat bed and no mulching respectively the interaction effects of irrigation levels and planting methods were found to be significant in case of n and s uptake for both the years of study while interaction effect of k uptake was significant only in 2015 16 table 3 irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio in raised bed system exhibited the highest uptake of n k and s irrigation at 0 9 iw cpe ratio in raised bed system also showed considerably higher nutrient uptake by the crop over any other treatment combinations except irrigation at 1 2 tw cpe ratio flat bed planting it was also witnessed that the rate of augmentation of n and s uptake by the plant was higher by increasing the irrigation levels under raised bed system in the 2nd year of study than the 1st year 3 2 yield the seed and stover yields of field mustard were differed significantly owing to different irrigation levels planting methods and mulching during both the years table 4 the maximum amounts of both seed and stover yield were recorded in irrigation level of 1 2 iw cpe ratio however this level of irrigation was statistically at par with 0 9 iw cpe ratio regarding seed yield it was also observed that the yield was a bit higher in year 2 that the yield of year 1 when irrigation was given at iw cpe ratio of 0 6 or above there was a considerable rise of almost 20 in the seed yield by increasing the irrigation level from 0 6 to 0 9 iw cpe ratio various planting methods and mulching significantly influenced the yield of the crop during both the years of study raised bed planting resulted in about 7 12 more seed yield than flat bed planting similar result was recorded in case of mulching as well mulching exhibited almost 17 and 10 more seed and stover yield respectively than no mulch the interaction effects between irrigation levels and planting methods were found to be significant concerning seed yield of field mustard during both the years of the study fig 3 during year 1 the maximum amount of seed yield was recorded under 1 2 iw cpe raised bed planting being at par with irrigation at 0 9 iw cpe raised bed planting however in year 2 seed yield under irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe raised bed planting was superior to all other interaction effects 3 3 quality the quality parameters viz oil content and yield as well as protein content and yield were estimated and the results are depicted in table 5 in both the years of study oil contents as well as oil yield were significantly increased with irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio over 0 6 iw cpe and 0 3 iw cpe ratio however there was no such significant difference in the oil content under irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio and 0 9 iw cpe ratio concerning protein content and protein yield irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio found to be the superior over all other irrigation levels during both the years of study except in case of protein content in 2014 15 where irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio and 0 9 iw cpe ratio were at par considerable augmentation in oil and protein yield was observed by increasing the level of irrigation from iw cpe ratio of 0 6 0 9 concerning different planting methods it was observed that raised bed planting increased oil and protein content as well as oil and protein yield to the tune of almost 1 1 4 4 5 5 5 13 13 5 and 19 19 5 respectively over flat bed planting application of mulching exhibited significant influence on quality parameters during both the years this practice increased oil content and yield about 1 1 4 and 13 13 5 over no mulch interaction effects between irrigation levels and planting methods on oil content as well as yield was found to be significant during both the years table 6 application of irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio in raised bed planting method showed the maximum amount of oil content as well as yield of the crop during both the years of study and this treatment combination was at par with irrigation level at 0 9 iw cpe ratio in raised bed planting concerning oil content during both the years and oil yield in 2014 15 concerning protein yield the interaction effects were significant during both the years fig 4b however the interaction effects were found to be significant only in year 2 for protein content in seed fig 4a the variations in the results about protein content in the seeds were less in year 2 the maximum protein content in the seeds was found in irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe raised bed planting being at par with irrigation at 0 9 iw cpe raised bed planting 3 4 glucosinolate and fatty acid profiles glucosinolate content and fatty acid profiles in seed of field mustard were significantly influenced by varied irrigation levels and mulching methods during both years of experimentations table 7 however different planting methods had no significant effect on glucosinolate content fatty acid profiles were significantly influenced owing to practicing different planting methods except erucic acid during both the years higher glucosinolate content in seed was found at irrigation level of 1 2 iw cpe ratio being at par with irrigation at 0 9 iw cpe ratio the minimum glucosinolate content in seed was recorded in 0 3 iw cpe ratio application of mulch exhibited significantly higher glucosinolate content in seed as compared to no mulch during both the years concerning fatty acid profiles the highest amounts of saturated fatty acid oleic acid linoleic acid linolenic acid and eicosenoic acid contents in the seed were recorded under irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio being at par with 0 9 iw cpe ratio during both the years increasing irrigation level from 0 6 to 0 9 iw cpe ratio showed increase in saturated fatty acid oleic acid linoleic acid linolenic acid eicosenoic acid and erucic acid contents in the seed of field mustard about 3 12 5 11 5 6 6 9 7 and 2 respectively it was observed that rate of increment in the fatty acid profiles was higher in year 1 than year 2 due increase in irrigation frequency it was also observed that the deviations in the erucic acid content were the minimum owing to changes in the irrigation levels concerning planting methods and mulching it was observed that raised bed planting and mulching significantly improved the fatty acid profiles except erucic acid content which was varied significantly due to different planting methods raised bed system increased all the fatty acid profiles to the tune of about 3 14 over flat bed while mulching escalated fatty acid compositions almost 2 5 14 over no mulching 3 5 water and fertilizer productivity the water productivity was significantly influenced by varied irrigation levels planting methods and mulching fig 5a c the values of water productivity owing to various irrigation levels planting methods and mulching were much higher in 2nd year of study than 1st year in general it was found in this study that the yield was augmented with increasing the level of irrigation however water productivity was considerably decreased with the increasing in the irrigation level during 2015 16 during 2014 15 there was a little increase in the water productivity by increasing irrigation level from 0 3 to 0 6 iw cpe ratio however the water productivity was decreased about 17 9 and 18 4 by increasing irrigation level from 0 6 0 9 iw cpe ratio and 0 9 1 2 iw cpe ratio respectively during 2014 15 in 2nd year of study there was sharp fall of water productivity about 26 15 and 17 when irrigation levels were increased from 0 3 to 0 6 0 6 0 9 and 0 9 1 2 iw cpe ration respectively raised bed planting method resulted in significantly higher water productivity of 9 4 and 10 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2014 15 and 2015 16 respectively over flat bed planting similar trend of water productivity was also found in case of mulching application of mulch resulted in significantly higher water productivity as compared to no mulch during both the years of study concerning interaction effects between irrigation and planting it was observed that the interaction was significant only in the 2nd year of the study the maximum water productivity was recorded under irrigation at 0 3 iw cpe raised bed planting being at par with irrigation at 0 3 iw cpe flat bed planting fig 6 fertilizer productivity was evaluated in terms of partial factor of productivity pfp pfp of n p and s fertilizers pfpnps were increased significantly with augmenting the irrigation levels table 8 it was also observed that the variation in the pfpnps was higher during 2nd year of study than the variations recorded in 1st year it was also evaluated that the pfps was much higher than that of pfpn and pfpp similar trends in the pfp of n p and s fertilizers as influenced by irrigation levels planting methods and mulching were found as the trend were recorded in case of seed yield of field mustard as fertilizer productivity was calculated by dividing the yield to the amount of fertilizer used to produce that yield concerning the interaction effects between different irrigations and planting methods on pfp again the same trend was recorded like the trend observed in case of yield of the crop table 9 here we did not mention the pfpk as the values of pfpk and pfps were same because the application rate of both k and s fertilizer was 30 kg ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient uptake higher nutrient uptake through the increasing of irrigation frequency can be attributed to better availability of moisture with application of irrigation which is helpful in increase in the nutrient contents in plant silber 2005 silber et al 2003 described that frequent irrigation improved the uptake of less mobile nutrients such as p and k the soluble fraction of nutrients present in the soil solution flow to the roots as water is taken up k is absorbed strongly by soils and only present in small quantities in the soil solution k moves to the root by diffusion which was further facilitated by the presence of sufficient moisture in the root zone verma et al 2014 reported significantly higher n uptake by plant with increase in irrigation frequency xu et al 2004 also found that p uptake by plant was significantly increased in irrigated condition over no irrigation it was also found that nutrient uptake was higher in the 2nd year than that of 1st year of study the rainfall was normal 81 mm during the growing period of 1st year and deficit 7 mm during 2nd year therefore impact of irrigation was higher in the 2nd year of study better nutrient uptake in raised bed planting might be due to the fact that bed planting resulted in better utilization of available resources like water nutrients and sunlight due to favorable microclimate similar findings were also illustrated by kantwa et al 2005 parihar et al 2009 and dodwadiya and sharma 2012 similarly mulching also reduced the water loss thereby increasing the availability of moisture to the plant so higher nutrient uptake was attained along with water moreover mulching reduces weed population nwosisi et al 2019 which might be the reason behind higher uptake of nutrients as well the results also confirmed the findings of hariom et al 2013 tetarwal et al 2013 parihar et al 2009 and dodwadiya and sharma 2012 4 2 yield in normal rainfall winter season of 2014 15 seed yield was significantly enhanced up to irrigation at 0 9 iw cpe ratio however further appliance of irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio exhibited higher yield over irrigation at 0 9 iw cpe ratio however there was no statistical difference in the seed yield table 4 on the other hand winter season of 2015 16 was deficient in rainfall here seed yield was significantly increased up to irrigation at 1 2 iw cpe ratio this could be describes as applying timely irrigation to the critical stages of the crop ensured sufficient moisture availability helping in proper utilization of nutrients and also a formulation and partitioning of photosynthates to the sink similar findings were also illustrated by piri 2012 hergert et al 2016 and gupta et al 2017 significantly higher seed yield with the increase in irrigation frequency was also reported by them higher yield at raised bed planting system might be due to the fact that this method helped in drainage of excess water in addition to ensured proper aeration when there was excess rainfall and also facilitated moisture conservation similar effects of planting methods have also been reported by kuotsu et al 2014 mulch had significant influenced on seed yield in both the years mulch slowed down the energy exchange at soil surface thermal diffusion and provided treat insulation making uniform soil temperature that minimized evaporation losses regar et al 2007 the higher seed yield was recorded under paddy straw mulch in this study conformed to earlier results reported by regar et al 2007 and sharma et al 2014 4 3 quality oil content and oil yields of field mustard were varies from 41 6 to 43 1 and 388 690 kg ha 1 respectively during two years of study owing to changes in the irrigation scheduling from 0 3 to 1 2 iw cpe ratio although the variations in the oil content with varied irrigation levels were not wide but the oil content was increased a bit with increasing the irrigation frequency shekhawat et al 2012 also reported significantly higher oil content in the indian mustard seed with the increase in irrigation frequency better meristematic activity due to enhanced turgidity and cell division resulted in higher p and s uptake by the plant this might be the reason behind the augmentation in oil content under higher irrigation frequency fig 7a b also depicts the strong relationship between s uptake and oil content in the seed during both the years yadav et al 2010 and verma et al 2014 also reported in similar way from their previous experiments raised bed planting and mulching also increased both p and s uptake by the crop than flat sowing or no mulching thus oil content and oil yield was higher under such methods similar results also reported by tetarwal et al 2013 considerable n uptake was recorded through the better irrigation management raised bed planting and mulching therefore higher protein content and protein yields were observed in these management practices fig 8a b also represents strong relationship between n uptake and protein content in the seed during 2014 15 and 2015 16 similar findings were also reported by verma et al 2014 glucosinolate content was increased by increasing irrigation frequencies and mulching during both the years of study the exact reason behind such increase in glucosinolate content though the increasing irrigation levels and mulching was not clear however better s nutrition through improved irrigation management and mulching might improve the glucosinolate content as they are s containing water soluble compounds aires et al 2006 higher correlation between s uptake and glucosinolate content during both the years also confirmed the above statement tables 10 and 11 different irrigation levels planting methods and mulching significantly altered the saturated fatty acid as well as major fatty acid profiles pavlista et al 2016 also reported that providing irrigations during critical stages of canola improved the fatty acid profiles champolivier and merrien 1996 also discussed that water stress during flowering resulted in decrease in oil as well as fatty acids profile in this present study also irrigation at 0 3 or 0 6 iw cpe ration might resulted in water stress to the field mustard as a result fatty acid profiles were reduced to the tune of almost 2 12 when irrigation level was reduced from 1 2 or 0 9 iw cpe ratio to 0 6 or 0 3 iw cpe ratio during both the years of study strong correlations amongst fatty acid profiles and s uptake was also found tables 10 and 11 thus higher s uptake with increased irrigation frequency raised bed planting and mulching might be another rationale behind escalation of fatty acid profiles 4 4 water productivity water productivity of field mustard was ranged from 7 1 to 10 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 7 7 14 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 during 1st and 2nd year of study respectively due to different irrigation levels fig 5a it was observed that increasing the irrigation frequency decreased water productivity in general mustard is a crop that needs less amount of water compared to cereals like rice wheat etc subsequently at lower level of irrigation water iw cpe ratio of 0 3 or 0 6 there was still some productivity of the crop this might be the reason behind higher water productivity at less frequency of irrigation particularly in the rainfall deficit 2nd year of study the water consumption was increased at a higher proportion by increasing the irrigation frequency than the normal rainfall year 1 however the yield was not augmented proportionately to the higher water consumption which might be the reason behind lower water productivity this might be the reason behind higher reduction in water productivity by increasing irrigation frequency in the year 2 similar results were also reported by gupta et al 2017 raised bed system showed higher water productivity than flat sowing this might be attributed to supply of adequate amount of irrigation water for longer period through the furrows in between two beds parihar et al 2017 mulching with rice straw reduced evaporation loss of water from the soil surface thereby moisture availability was increased which ultimately reflected through higher yield of the crop along with improved water productivity than no mulch this finding is in accordance with aggarwal and goswami 2003 and jat et al 2013 higher water productivity in low rainfall year during 2015 16 supports the previous findings reported by thierfelder and wall 2010 4 5 fertilizer productivity partial factor productivity pfp of n p and s fertilizers were found to be increased with the increasing in irrigation levels however the best response of pfpnps was found upto irrigation level at 0 9 iw cpe ratio during year 1 while in year 2 the response was upto 1 2 iw cpe ratio maintaining adequate moisture in the soil profile during critical crop growing stages ultimately improved yield as well as nutrient use efficiency of the crop ierna et al 2011 this was probable cause behind higher pfp of n p and s with better irrigation management practices such increase in pfpnps with increasing irrigations validates the importance of water availability that can improve the ability of plant to use the soil available nutrients proficiently ierna et al 2011 this finding is corroborated with the findings previously reported by di paola and rinaldi 2008 and ierna et al 2011 higher pfp in raised bed planting and mulching might be ascribed to higher nutrient uptake as well as use efficiency in these management practices than flat sowing and no mulch all these are in accordance with the findings reported by wang et al 2019 5 conclusion based on the findings of this study it can be stated that the yield of field mustard can be improved with the adoption of suitable irrigation scheduling as well as planting method along with largely available straw mulching concerning irrigation it can be concluded that the irrigation can be scheduled at 0 9 iw cpe ratio when there is good amount of winter rainfall in sandy loam soil on the other hand irrigation should be given at 1 2 iw cpe ratio when there is moisture stress owing to having negligible winter rainfall proper irrigation managements raised bed plating and mulching with rice straw at 5000 kg ha 1 were not only improved the yield of the mustard crop such management practices proved to augment the overall quality of the seed as well as oil however it was observed that water productivity of the crop was decreased by increasing irrigation frequency particularly in the low rainfall year in contrast raised bed plating and mulching exhibited improved water productivity than flat sowing and no mulch fertilizer productivity was increased to a good extent with the increased irrigation frequency raised bed planting and

10327,agricultural water management system are subject to a variety of uncertainties and nonlinearity which complicate the decision making process and exaggerate water shortage risks previously few studies could tackle multiple uncertainties and the associated system risks in nonlinear problems in this paper a novel risk averse optimization model was developed for supporting irrigation water management to mitigate these problems based on a risk measurement tool conditional value at risk cvar a cvar based interval fuzzy two stage stochastic quadratic programming ciftsqp was proposed ciftsqp could not only provide risk averse solutions with recourse in response to extreme economic risk quantified as cvar and water shortage risk expressed as fuzzy credibility level but also handle and quantify the nonlinearity in a stochastic program caused by the economy of scale effects of facilities the proposed method has been applied to an irrigation water management case in the northern china results suggested that in response to severe water shortage sunflowers would be preferred meanwhile groundwater use in wuyuan county and surface water consumption of urad qianqi and urad zhongqi should be reduced moreover desired water allocation strategies with varied risk aversion levels were generated under different water inflow levels results reveal that the highest economic benefits could be achieved when risk aversion degree reaches 30 40 and 70 under the low medium and high inflow levels respectively results reveal that higher risks would bring higher returns under the low and medium inflow levels and the highest economic benefits could be achieved when risk aversion degree reaches 70 under the high inflow level reveal that higher would bring higher returnsunder the low and medium inflow levels andthe highest economic benefits could be achieved when risk aversion degree reaches 70 under the high inflow level the developed ciftsqp method provided valuable insights into informed irrigation decision making with respect to economy of scale effects risk aversion and recourse in an agricultural water allocation system it can also be applied to address other resource allocation problems under uncertainty and risk keywords water resources allocation irrigation optimization uncertainty analysis risk analysis conditional value at risk 1 introduction water is the lifeline of agricultural food production in some areas of arid northwest china the amount of agricultural water accounted for more than 90 of the total water consumption zhang et al 2018a 2018b especially in arid areas water shortage is getting increasingly grim with increasing demand for food production and economic development so it is decisively significant to improve water use efficiency through optimal management of limited irrigation water to ensure food security and sustain development tan and zhang 2018 irrigation water systems are fraught with lots of uncertain factors due to a variety of variations such as random inﬂow water demand and extreme weather events during the growth cycle the inherent variability complicates the decision problems and aggravate water shortage risks which may cause severe damages such as drought and crop yield reduction therefore in order to obtain risk controllable water use plans it is essential to integrate risk analysis into the optimization efforts of irrigation water management systems previously many research efforts have been dedicated to the optimization of water resources allocation as the conflicts between the supply and demand ends are becoming prominent fu et al 2017 mathematical programming has been one of the most commonly used approaches to meet water demands and improve water use efficiency in irrigation systems one of the major challenges accompanying the mathematical programming of irrigation systems arose from a variety of uncertainties which are ubiquitous in planning problems cai et al 2011 tan et al 2016 to make irrigation systems more resilient to uncertainties it is effective and essential to integrate uncertainty analysis into the optimization methods accordingly many programming methods were developed to handle uncertainties expressed as interval fuzzy and stochastic programming approaches zhang et al 2017 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 in agricultural water management systems some parameters may only be available as fuzzy membership functions because their values are judged by human beings zhang et al 2020 accordingly fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp one of the typical fuzzy programming methods was proposed originating from the concept of credibility that covers both possibility and necessity dai et al 2018 fccp has been widely used to deal with fuzzy parameters in credibility constraints and improve the satisfaction over system performance yue et al 2020 in addition water inflows are normally available as random variables and managers must make decisions in advance of random events there usually exists a dilemma between economic benefits from allocated water and economic losses due to water shortage in agricultural water management problems two stage stochastic programming tsp can be effective for addressing the above problem behind which the fundamental idea is recourse recently the combination of tsp and other optimization methods has been widely used for water resources management cai et al 2019 khosrojerdi et al 2019 guo et al 2019 for example niu et al 2016 developed an interactive two stage fuzzy stochastic programming itfsp method and applied to hetao irrigation district li et al 2019 constructed a market based two stage stochastic model for water resources planning in arid regions yan et al 2020 developed an interval two stage fuzzy differential water price model for agricultural irrigation system and li et al 2020 proposed a simulation optimization framework under uncertainty and applied it to an irrigation district of northern china the above optimization methods were effective for dealing with uncertainties but their inherent assumption on the linearity of all the system components has impeded them from tackling real world problems possessing nonlinear properties for instance influenced by economy of scale effects benefit and cost functions of water works are mostly power functions sauer 2005 tan et al 2013 simplifying the nonlinear problems to the linearity would not only reduce the robustness of the system but also impair the practicality of the results in fact quadratic programming qp would be able to reflect and tackle nonlinearity in the objective functions for optimized system costs or benefits huang et al 2012 researchers coupled uncertainty analysis with qp to deal with uncertainties in nonlinear problems for instance chen and huang 2001 developed an interval quadratic programming iqp method and a derivative algorithm through introducing imp to the qp framework li and huang 2008 combined tsp and iqp to handle economies of scale effects and uncertainties tan et al 2013 introduced the iqp method to deal with the nonlinear problems caused by reflection of economies of scale li et al 2014 employed iqp to reflect the nonlinear and uncertain problems in water quality management generally risk is usually closely linked to uncertainty but the existing programming methods were mostly risk neutral in this sense for sake of higher returns it may provide more water for users with higher benefits while ignoring the fairness wang et al 2017 they were incapable of measuring and controlling water related economic risks associated with extreme low probability but high damage random events such as water shortages exacerbated by climate change in complex agricultural water systems yamout et al 2007 therefore it is of decisive necessity to introduce risk averse approaches to ensure the coordinated development of water resources and economy in fact value at risk var is one of the risk averse approaches to incorporate risk in decision modeling artzner et al 1999 var is defined as the maximum possible economic loss at a given level of distribution probability in spite of its wide applications in investment portfolio in finance shao et al 2011 var was deemed to have limitations var is not subadditive and coherent moreover var is a certain percentile at a given probability of the loss distribution function so it does not tell much about the nature of extreme losses exceeding it wu et al 2006 to remedy these shortcomings of var conditional value at risk cvar as a consistent investment risk measurement method was proposed with consideration of the average losses in the tail that was greater than the var value uryasev and rockafellar 2001 it has been widely used in inexact optimization models for quantifying extreme economic risk losses caused by the worst water shortage events xu et al 2018 in applications water management studies utilizing cvar principles could be mainly divided into three categories to control the risks derived from the variations in water availability in the first category cvar was a part of the objective function such as the maximization of a utility function that balances cvar against loss li et al 2015 xu et al 2018 li et al 2020 fu et al 2018 in the second category cvar was incorporated within the model constraints shao et al 2011 hu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a 2018b in the third category minimized cvar was the objective function bakhtiari et al 2020 tayebikhorami et al 2020 however previous studies were incapable of dealing with multiple uncertainties or controlling associated system risks in nonlinear irrigation water management problems therefore a cvar based interval fuzzy two stage stochastic quadratic programming ciftsqp was proposed through incorporating techniques of tsp cvar fccp and iqp into a general optimization framework comparing to a traditional risk neutral tsp approach ciftsqp could provide more robust solutions considering the extreme economic risk quantified as cvar and water shortage risk expressed as fuzzy credibility level moreover it could handle and quantify nonlinearities in stochastic programs caused by economy of scale effects of facilities in response to the risks arising from randomness and fuzziness prevalent in water management systems ciftsqp could provide decision makers with retroactive water allocation plans tailored to their preferences in a word it could provide valuable insights into informed irrigation decision making with respect to economy of scale effects risk aversion and recourse under multiple uncertainties the proposed method has been applied to an irrigation water management case in the northern china 2 methodological development 2 1 formulation of ciftsqp model in agricultural water management problems there usually exists a dilemma between economic benefits and economic losses due to water shortage moreover water inflows are random variables frequently and decisions must to be made in advance of random events tsp can be effective for addressing the above problems and formulated as follows wang et al 2017 1a max f e f x ω c x k 1 k p k d k y k subject to 1b a l x b l l 1 2 m 1 1c h s x q s k y k ω s k s 1 2 m 2 k 1d x 0 1e y k 0 k where a ﬁrst stage decision x is water allocation target y k is a second stage recourse decision which made after a random event occurred c and d k is the coefficients of x and y k respectively a l and b l are the coefficients in constraint l h s and q s k are the coefficients in constraint s p k is the occurrence probability of scenario k and k 1 k p k 1 and ω k is the random variable with respective probability of occurrence p k unfortunately the tsp model is a risk neutral model with the optimization of an expectation objective shao et al 2011 users with large profits tend to allocate more targeted water ignoring fair allocation but the corresponding risk of punishment is greater the competition for water among different users become more intense leading to a higher risk of water system violation tsp method usually provides planning schemes under several representative probabilities without considerations over high variability of the second stage stochastic information or economic loss under extreme conditions in real world water management case extreme events such as serious water shortages may also occur therefore cvar as a risk measurement model is applied to quantify the tail risk loss of random variables caused by the worst water shortage events xu et al 2018 moreover incorporating cvar into the traditional tsp method can better analyze the trade offs between the system benefits and risk tailored to decision makers risk preferences the risk averse model ctsp can be established as follows 2a max e f x ω γ c v a r β q x ω where β presents the confidence level and γ denotes the trade off between penalty and risk to achieve risk control and aversion which represents the importance of economic risk value to the decision maker generally when γ is set to be less than 0 5 decision makers are more optimistic conversely when γ is greater than 0 5 decision makers are more conservative q x ω presents the continuous loss function associated with variable x and random vector ω the formulas of v a r β and c v a r β are respectively as follows 2b v a r β η β x min η r φ x ω β 2c c v a r β 1 1 β q x ω η β x q x ω p ω d ω since the analytical formula v a r β is difficult to find and c v a r β is often a discrete problem in practice through introducing an auxiliary variable v k c v a r β is replaced by a linear function and a linear constraint of eqs 2d and 2e thereby converting the nonlinear function into a linear function 2d c v a r β η β x 1 1 β k 1 k p k v k 2e subject to v k q x ω η β x model 2a can deal with random variables and associated system economic risk however it is unable to handle uncertain parameters expressed as interval numbers as well as the non linear characteristics in the decision making process caused by economy of scale effects iqp can be proposed to deal with the above problems and expressed as follows chen and huang 2001 3a max f j 1 n c j x j 2 d j x j subject to 3b j 1 n a i j x j b i i 1 2 m 3c x j 0 j 1 2 n where a i j b i c i d i and x j are interval numbers and the and represents the upper and lower bound respectively notably in this study there are some uncertain information expressed as fuzzy number such as the available water in irrigation system fccp can deal with uncertainty identified as fuzzy sets within a fuzzy credibility level λ which belongs to 0 1 dai et al 2014 the credibility measure c λ is an average of possibility measure and necessity liu et al 2015 for the general fuzzy constraint a x b the right hand side parameter b is expressed as a triangular fuzzy set b 0 b 0 5 b 1 and b 0 b 0 5 and b 1 represents the smallest possible value the most likely value and the maximum possible value of the variable respectively the definition of the credibility of fuzzy constraints is zeng et al 2014 4 c λ a x b 1 a x b 0 2 b 0 5 b 0 a x 2 b 0 5 b 0 b 0 a x b 0 5 b 1 a x 2 b 1 b 0 5 b 0 5 a x b 1 0 a x b 1 in fccp credibility constraints can be described as follows 5 c λ a x b λ therefore by integrating the iqp and fccp into the ctsp the ciftsqp model can be constructed as follows 6a max f j 1 n c j x j 2 d j x j j 1 n k 1 k p k e j y j k 2 g j y j k γ η 1 1 β k 1 k p k v k subject to 6b j 1 n a l j

algorithm such a problem with interval parameters can be transformed into two deterministic sub models based on an interactive algorithm chen and huang 2001 however the ciftsqp model contains a variety of uncertainties that cannot be solved directly in the face of random uncertainty water allocation target x j needs to be determined before disclosing random variables but it is difficult to determine whether x j or x j will correspond to a higher benefit li et al 2020 therefore introduce auxiliary decision variable z j to make x j x j δ x j z j where δ x j x j x j and z j 0 1 to balance benefits and penalties when dealing with fuzzy credibility constraint the key is to convert it into regular interval constraints moreover an important step of an interactive algorithm is to judge the correspondence of the decision variables in the two sub models chen and huang 2001 for ciftsqp model there may be two situations as explained below if cost coefficients e j k g j k 0 the upper bound

combining the solutions from two sub model obtain the optimal values however if e j k g j k 0 it is hard to identify the correspondence of y j k in upper bound sub model a mid value model 9 can then

and f o p t 3 application to irrigation water management 3 1 study area the proposed method is applied to bayan nur city to demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness bayan nur city 40 19 41 18 n and 106 20 109 19 e is one of the most major agricultural areas in inner mongolia northern china the city consists of seven administrative divisions including linhe district lh dengkou county dk hangjin houqi hh wuyuan county wy urad qianqi uq urad zhongqi uz and urad houqi uh fig 2 the city is 378 km long horizontally and 238 km wide vertically the total land area is about 6578 km2 of which more than 6467 km2 is cultivated as an important commercial grain base the city has large areas of grain and oil bearing crops the proportion of agricultural irrigation water in bayan nur city is nearly 90 of the total water consumption it is decisively significant to improve water use efficiency and realize scientific and reasonable management of agricultural water resources to ensure food security and sustain development 3 2 problem identification bayan nur city is mainly based on agricultural production and irrigation water occupies a large proportion of water consumption agricultural water management of bayan nur city is facing severe water shortage where the available water resources are difficult to support irrigation water demands on the one hand natural available water resources are limited this city has scare precipitation but high temperature and evaporation groundwater is utilized for agricultural irrigation whereas the groundwater utilization amount is almost close to recoverable amount at present in particular over exploitation occurred in the uq uz and hh over pumping of groundwater trigger problems such as higher pumping costs and increased soil salinity liu and li 2018 in order to ensure water demand for irrigation channels have been excavated and maintained to divert water from the yellow river since ancient time to be specific hetao irrigation district located in bayan nur city is one of the largest irrigation districts of china which is fed by the yellow river primarily surface water is basically used for irrigation and its development and utilization degree is about 84 3 on the other hand quota for agricultural use is being squeezed for instance water diverted from the yellow river is capped to 4 billion m3 per year which is expected to be further reduced with the emphasis on ecological and environmental protection the water structure has changed as well the proportion of farmland irrigation water has shown a downward trend from 97 9 in 2005 to 89 31 in 2015 which is furthering the difficulty for promoting the food security therefore it is of great significance to optimize agricultural water in bayan nur city to alleviate water shortage there are many complexities in agricultural water management systems owing to the uneven distributions of surface runoff the inflow water resources present a remarkable pattern of seasonal variations decision makers need to make decisions in advance under different runoff conditions when devising agricultural water allocation schemes and the government has introduced progressive markups for water used in excess of planned or quota requirements more pre regulated water allocation means greater potential economic benefits whereas more economic losses may be induced by water shortage in dry seasons besides the system faces two kinds of risks caused by uncertain factors further complicating the system the first is the water shortage risk due to the fuzzy uncertainty of the available water related to environmental load capacity the amount of water availability for agriculture will also be constrained by the judgement of decision makers the second is the system economic risk caused by the random variability of inflow water in the case of extreme water shortage event in complex agricultural water systems the corresponding risk loss needs to be measured in real world problems the economies of scale effects may also lead to the nonlinear characteristics of optimal allocation of water resources and associated decisions further aggravating the complexity of the system thus it is crucial to introduce advanced optimization model and risk measurement model into agricultural water management to handle water use conflicts and the complexities of the system in order to realize best compromise by recourse and minimize economic penalty when formulating water resources allocation schemes with random inflow water tsp is used as an effective way for addressing the above problem to deal with the risks arising from the fuzzy and random uncertainties existing in the system fccp and cvar methods are selected moreover to reflect and handle the imprecise parameters and impacts of scale effects on water resources optimization decision iqp is the appropriate approach therefore by incorporating optimization techniques and risk analysis the proposed ciftsqp method was deemed suitable for supporting agricultural water management in the study area 3 3 data collection the main crops in the study area were wheat corn and sunflowers the water sources consisted of surface water and groundwater three levels of inﬂow with different probabilities of occurrence were considered which were named as low l medium m and high h levels respectively according to the historical records of the water inflow to bayan nur city the probability of occurrence for the high and low level flow was almost the same and lower than that of medium level flow respectively the volume of water inflow conformed to the normal distribution on the whole therefore in this study it was assumed that the probabilities of occurrence were 0 2 0 6 and 0 2 the related data such as irrigation area irrigation quota available water resources crop water requirements and related economic data were collected and complied from multiple sources such as the statistical yearbooks of bayan nur city the water resources bulletin of bayan nur city local government reports and policy surveys and field survey data the planting areas of the main crops from 2000 to 2016 were taken as the baseline conditions with an assumption that the typical crop patterns in the planning years would remain unchanged in real world problems the planting areas of main crops vary from year to year to realistically reflect such uncertainty the planting areas were expressed as interval parameters rather than deterministic values data from the past seventeen years were used to obtain the interval numbers for planting areas in detail the historical peak value was set as the upper bound of an interval number while the lower bound took the minimum value of all data observed from 2000 to 2016 data were displayed in tables 1 3 table 1 provided crop water requirements table 2 presented the per regulated water allocation of subareas and the available irrigation water under different inflow levels which were triangular fuzzy numbers q0 q0 5 and q1 related economic data were presented in table 3 3 4 model formulation for agricultural water management in general this study aimed at answering the following questions 1 how to optimally allocate limited surface water and groundwater to different crops in different subareas under uncertain conditions to achieve maximum system benefits 2 how to allocate irrigation water under varied risk aversion levels and 3 how to establish an effective linkage between the economic implications caused by the economy of scale effects and the possible risk losses therefore a ciftsqp model incorporating tsp fccp cvar and iqp methods was formulated for the study case in this study the inflow water was obtained as random variable water availability was expressed as fuzzy set and other parameters were given as interval numbers the amount of per regulated water allocation target was the first stage decision variable and water deficit was the second stage decision variable the objective function was to maximize the comprehensive benefits considering risk control including system benefits of the first stage when allocating targeted water penalties of the second stage when not delivering the promised water and risk losses constraints such as water resources availability and food production demands were considered a general ciftsqp model for agricultural water management was established as follows objective function 12a max f i 1 7 j 1 3 t 1 2 a i j t w i j t 2 b i j t w i j t i 1 7 j 1 3 t 1 2 k 1 3 p k c i j t k s i j

maximum possible values which would belong to 0 5 1 in terms of cvar the value of confidence level β would need to be determined beforehand usually it could be set as 0 90 0 95 and 0 99 a series of analyses found that the distribution of cvar was uniform ji et al 2015 thus the model was solved under the condition that the confidence level β was 0 95 in this paper in addition the risk indicator γ was the weight of cvar assigning different γ values could reflect the risk aversion degree of decision makers results obtained under scenario 1 λ 0 5 β 0 95 and γ 0 5 was used as an example to illustrate the pre regulated water allocation target and recourse related to two stage water allocation decisions and provide the optimal agricultural water allocation plans based on maximizing system economic benefits in addition the whole process of risk management includes risk identification measurement decision making and control there are two kinds of risks tackled in this study they are system economic loss risk caused by the random variability of the inflow water and the water shortage risk due to fuzzy uncertainty of the available water measured as cvar and fuzzy credibility level respectively then risk control could be realized by setting different risk levels optimal solutions generated from the model were demonstrated under five fuzzy credibility levels λ 0 9 0 8 0 7 0 6 and 0 5 eleven weighting levels γ 0 0 1 0 2 0 9 and 1 and three inflow levels low medium and high the system economic benefits and water allocation plans were analyzed under different combinations of risk levels finally the developed model was compared with the other two alternative models the optimal results and discussion were analyzed as below 4 1 water allocation plans fig 3 shows the per regulated and optimal water allocation target for the three crops in seven areas under scenario 1 optimal water allocation target w i j t w i j t δ w i j t z i j t was automatically obtained by the first stage decision which would help reach the highest possible system benefits when z i j t 1 water allocation target reached the upper bound of the pre regulated water allocation and system could obtain the highest benefit along with serious economic penalty risk conversely when z i j t 0 reach the lower bound the optimal value of zijtopt automatically searched by ciftsqp could be used to obtain the optimal water allocation target in the first stage decision for surface water except for uz the sunflowers optimal water allocation target in all other areas would draw near the lower bound for instance in lh the optimal surface water allocation target of sunflowers would equal 39 51 106 m3 while the wheat and corn would equal 49 83 106 m3 and 146 67 106 m3 for groundwater apart from lh and wy the optimal water allocation targets of the other three crops would be close to the upper bound of targeted values it could also be seen from fig 3 that optimal water allocation target of corn would be much higher than those of wheat and sunflowers the results indicate that decision makers would be more optimistic for water supply to sunflowers in addition surface water would be the main irrigation source and decision makers are optimistic about using groundwater as a supplementary water source for agricultural irrigation fig 4 shows the optimal water allocation plans under different inflow levels if available water could not meet the optimal allocation targets deficits would occur and penalties were accepted with recourse in the second stage of decision making the actual optimal water allocation under different inflow levels would be obtained by subtracting the optimal water deficits s i j t k from the optimal water allocation target w i j t for instance under low inflow level cumulative surface water deficits for wheat corn and sunflowers would be 48 59 58 67 106 55 36 79 23 106 and 2 35 4 75 106 m3 respectively groundwater shortage for wheat corn and sunflowers would be 18 24 21 55 106 15 21 24 09 106 and 0 00 1 09 106 m3 respectively under high inflow level surface water and groundwater shortage for wheat would be 1 75 9 28 106 and 3 29 11 91 106 m3 respectively while corn and sunflowers would not suffer any shortage under medium and high inflow levels from the perspective of crops water allocation of wheat and corn would respond most strongly to water shortages which may be mainly due to their lower benefits and penalties in contrast irrigation of sunflowers would not have significant changes under all different inflows from a regional perspective groundwater in wy would be relatively scarce and the water shortage would be 24 49 27 40 106 m3 under low inflow level moreover surface water would be deficient in uq and uz the water shortage in these sub areas would be 63 03 76 36 106 and 42 35 49 31 106 m3 under low inflow level respectively consequently the results could guide managers to give priority to making aggressive water allocation plans for economic crops like sunflowers under all inflow levels meanwhile under low inflow level decision makers would reduce the water allocation of wheat and corn under medium and high inflow level decision makers would give priority to meet the water demand of corn and reduce the water allocation to wheat moreover it would be the most economical option to reduce groundwater allocation to wy and surface water consumption of uq and uz when facing severe water shortage the maximum benefit of the irrigation system with the optimal water allocation planning would be 65 49 88 12 108 rmb different values in intervals would correspond to different risk preferences of decision makers decision makers willing to accept higher risks could pursue higher economic benefits corresponding to the upper bound of system benefits if decision makers focus more on water saving with the lower penalty costs of recourse they would tend to be reward by the lower bound of system benefits 4 2 economic benefits and risk analysis fig 5 reveals the system benefits and uncertainty degree of solutions under different combinations of risk indicator γ and fuzzy credibility level λ uncertainty degree of solutions was defined as the difference between the upper and lower bound divided by the lower bound the λ value of 0 5 means that the risk of violating the fuzzy constraint was less than 50 in other words water shortage risk was less than 50 results show that the system benefits would decrease as the lower fuzzy credibility level λ increased under different risk indicator γ for example system benefits would reduce from 79 31 97 14 108 to 74 01 94 83 108 rmb as the value of λ increased from 0 5 to 0 9 when γ equal to 0 3 the reason may be that the higher the credibility level the lower water shortage risk and the smaller the amount of available water resources under the premise of the same optimal water allocation target the actual allocated amount of water resources allocation would decrease thereby the system s benefit would correspondingly decline moreover fig 5 also shows that when the risk indicator γ was greater than 0 5 the uncertainty degree of the model results would reach a minimum and the lower bound of system benefits would reach a maximum when the credibility level λ was 0 6 therefore results could help decision makers to analyze the effect of the combination of two risk measures on system benefits in the planning year to obtain higher system benefit lower γ and λ values should be selected which correspond to higher risk levels to obtain lower uncertainty degree of solutions the risk of violating the fuzzy constraint was less than 50 in other words water shortage risk was less than 50 for the optimist γ 0 5 and less than 60 for a conservative decision maker γ 0 5 in order to explain and analyze the influence of decision makers attitudes toward system risk on the value of the objective function under different inflow levels fig 6 displays the system net benefit under different combinations of risk indicators and inflow levels under the low and medium inflow levels the objective function value would decrease with risk indicator increasing for instance system net benefit would decrease from 52 69 76 59 108 rmb to 7 03 38 93 108 rmb when γ increases from 0 1 to 1 under low inflow level similarly there would be a similar trend under medium inflow level with γ value increasing from 0 1 to 1 system net benefit would decrease from 97 89 116 17 108 rmb to 86 98 108 17 108 rmb generally the importance of the risk term would increase as γ value increasing it indicated that decision makers would choose conservative water allocation strategies to achieve risk aversion with γ increases under high inflow level the objective function value would show an upward trend before γ 0 7 the system net benefit would increase from 103 09 119 11 108 to 108 57 124 59 108 rmb as γ rising 0 1 to 0 7 the reason might be that the amount of water allocation would decrease with the increase of γ level under conditions of sufficient water the water allocation cost would reduce and thus the income would gradually increase when γ was greater than 0 7 with the increase of γ the objective function would gradually decrease the system net benefit would decrease from 108 57 124 59 108 to 73 29 98 46 108 rmb when γ increases from 0 7 to 1 consequently the system benefits would decrease as the degree of risk aversion increases under the low and medium inflow levels if the decision maker was aggressive an optimistic water allocation planning strategy could be made leading to higher system benefits while under the high inflow level system net benefit would reach to maximum when risk indicator γ was 0 7 the obtained optimal irrigation water allocation of different crops would be affected by changing the risk indicator γ surface water allocation scheme of three crops under different inflow levels and risk indicator shown in fig 7 were used for illustration under low inflow level irrigation water allocation would be sensitive to γ when γ was no more than 0 3 surface water allocated to sunflowers which would have high return and high risk would reduce from 21 20 106 to 17 46 106 m3 as γ rising from 0 1 to 0 3 on the contrary surface water allocated to wheat and corn irrigation would increase from 40 45 41 60 106 to 44 47 42 58 106 m3 and 64 35 67 20 106 to 68 07 69 96 106 m3 respectively when γ was greater than 0 3 there would be no significant difference as γ increases under medium inflow level the irrigation water allocated to wheat corn and sunflowers would respectively be 45 92 46 84 106 to 46 95 47 82 106 m3 78 88 81 96 106 to 81 59 84 72 106 m3 and 21 20 21 20 106 to 17 46 17 46 106 m3 when γ increases from 0 3 to 0 4 when γ was greater than 0 4 there would be no significant difference as γ increases therefore irrigation water allocation would be significantly sensitive to γ when γ value was around 0 4 the abnormalities at γ 0 4 demonstrated that this model could avoid the allocation of overmuch water resources to sunflowers in pursuit of high returns resulting in too little production of food crops at the high inflow level there would be no significant change results could provide decision makers with retroactive water allocation plans under different inflow levels tailored to their risk preferences in general based on decision makers risk attitudes and different inflow levels in the planning year decision makers could control the system benefit and water allocation in the light of the actual situation under the low and medium inflow levels the results in fig 6 show that the greater the degree of risk aversion is the less the system benefits would be at the same time the results in fig 7 demonstrate that the allocation of irrigation water would no longer changes after the degree of risk aversion reaches 30 and 40 respectively under these two inflow scenarios for instance when the risk indicator increased from 0 1 to 0 3 decision makers could appropriately reduce 3 74 106 m3 of water allocated to sunflowers and appropriately increase 0 98 1 02 106 and 1 71 1 76 106 m3 of irrigation water allocated to wheat and corn respectively under the low inflow level such a scheme could avoid allocating excess water resources to sunflowers in pursuit of high returns which would hamper the production of cereal crops under the high inflow level the allocation of irrigation water would be no significant change under different degrees of risk aversion while the system benefit would reach to maximum when the risk indicator was 0 7 therefore the results could help risk averse decision makers to obtain reasonable and robust water allocation plans that may guarantee fairness avoid risk losses and maximize system benefits it was recommended that decision makers could adopt the optimal water allocation plans when the risk aversion degree reaches 30 40 and 70 under the low medium and high inflow levels respectively 4 3 discussions for comparisons the study problem was also solved by two alternatives rqpm that did not include quadratic programming model and rcm in which cvar was removed compared to the developed ciftsqp method rqpm did not consider the economy of scale effects rcm did not take into account risk aversion options which could be viewed as a special case of the ciftsqp one when γ takes 0 the objective function value obtained from the two alternatives as well as ciftsqp under scenario 1 λ 0 5 β 0 95 and γ 0 5 are presented in fig 8 it appeared that the interval width of three models was ciftsqp rqpm rcm in order to explain the influence of authorities attitudes towards system risk i e γ on the objective function value for rqpm and ciftsqp fig 9 shows the system benefit calculated by two models under different risk levels it demonstrated that the objective function value of both two models would decrease as risk indicator γ increases the net system benefit of ciftsqp would decrease from 87 15 106 58 108 to 40 09 67 21 108 rmb when γ changes from 0 1 to 1 while those of rqpm would drop from 78 82 137 26 108 rmb to 35 30 122 77 108 rmb moreover ciftsqp would have lower uncertainty degree as the risk indicator γ increases the system benefit would tend to fluctuate more intensively when ignoring the economy of scale effects compared to ciftsqp rcm could be considered as a particular or simplified case of the ciftsqp one when γ takes 0 which neglected risks of economic loss and only focused on obtaining the maximum benefit it could generate a higher target value to gain higher benefit nevertheless it was unable to analyze the trade offs between system benefit and economic risk ciftsqp was thus superior to rcm to analyze such trade offs through incorporating cvar in terms of rqpm the objective function of rqpm was linear with the economy of scale effects being neglected if multiple users compete for limited irrigation water resources the influences of economy of scale effects might be significant due to over simplification of the economic relationship rqpm model would be less appropriate and realistic simplifying the nonlinear problem to the linearity would not only reduce the robustness of the system but also have a negative effect on the practicality of the results in fact ciftsqp can effectively solve the problem that nonlinearity affected by the economy of scale in mathematical programming as shown in fig 9 the gap between the upper and lower bound of the system benefit obtained from ciftsqp would always be smaller than that of rqpm indicating ciftsqp would greatly reduce the uncertainty degree of the feasible solutions meanwhile the increase in uncertainty degree of rqpm would even be sharper as the degree of risk aversion increases moreover the lower bound of the system benefit obtained by ciftsqp would always be higher than that of rqpm generally planning for the lower bound of the system benefits would result in conservative water allocation targets and less water shortage risk therefore optimization results of ciftsqp are more friendly to conservative decision makers to sum up optimal solution proposed by ciftsqp is more robust with lower uncertainty degree and its lower bound of system benefit would be higher for risk averse decision makers generally there are both specific merits and limitations in the rqpm model and rcm model and their integration performs better on the one hand ciftsqp could provide risk averse solutions with recourse in response to system economic risk quantified as cvar and water shortage risk handled by fuzzy credibility level on the other hand it was able to reflect nonlinearity and establish an effective linkage between the associated economic implications caused by the economy of scale effects of facilities and the possible risk losses 5 conclusions agricultural water management system is subject to a variety of uncertainties and nonlinearity which complicate the decision making process and exaggerate water shortage risks previously few studies could tackle multiple uncertainties and the associated system risks in nonlinear problems making it hard to achieve fair and risk controllable water allocation in this paper a novel irrigation water management model was established a cvar based interval fuzzy two stage stochastic quadratic programming ciftsqp was proposed ciftsqp could provide decision makers with retroactive water allocation plans tailored to their preferences to cope with the risks arising from randomness and fuzziness prevalent in water management systems in a word it provided valuable insights into informed irrigation decision making with respect to economy of scale effects risk aversion and recourse under multiple uncertainties the proposed method has been applied to an irrigation water management case in bayan nur city located in the northern china the results from the case study could guide the managers to formulate the optimal retroactive water allocation plans in irrigation systems economic crops such as sunflowers would be preferred surface water would be the main irrigation source moreover it is recommended to reduce groundwater allocation in wuyuan county and reduce surface water consumption of urad qianqi and urad zhongqi in response to severe water shortage in response to the risks arising from randomness and fuzziness prevalent in water management systems the risk indicator and fuzzy credibility level could reflect decision makers risk preferences and water shortage risk levels under different scenarios results revealed that the combination of different risk scenarios would lead to changed system benefits and irrigation water allocation plans lower risk indicator and fuzzy credibility level corresponding to higher risk levels could obtain higher system benefits under the low and medium inflow levels higher risks would bring higher returns moreover the highest system economic benefits would be achieved when risk aversion degree reaches 70 under the high inflow level compared against the other two alternative models ciftsqp would result in lower uncertainty degree and higher lower bound of system benefit ciftsqp could not only provide risk averse solutions with recourse in response to system economic risk quantified as cvar and water shortage risk handled by fuzzy credibility level but also handle nonlinearity and establish an effective linkage between economic implications and possible risk losses caused by the economy of scale effects of facilities this paper attempted to construct a novel method to handle multiple uncertainties and quantify the associated risks in nonlinear environment although this proposed model was first applied to an irrigation water management problem it could also be applied to other resource allocation problems under uncertainty and risk

10327,agricultural water management system are subject to a variety of uncertainties and nonlinearity which complicate the decision making process and exaggerate water shortage risks previously few studies could tackle multiple uncertainties and the associated system risks in nonlinear problems in this paper a novel risk averse optimization model was developed for supporting irrigation water management to mitigate these problems based on a risk measurement tool conditional value at risk cvar a cvar based interval fuzzy two stage stochastic quadratic programming ciftsqp was proposed ciftsqp could not only provide risk averse solutions with recourse in response to extreme economic risk quantified as cvar and water shortage risk expressed as fuzzy credibility level but also handle and quantify the nonlinearity in a stochastic program caused by the economy of scale effects of facilities the proposed method has been applied to an irrigation water management case in the northern china results suggested that in response to severe water shortage sunflowers would be preferred meanwhile groundwater use in wuyuan county and surface water consumption of urad qianqi and urad zhongqi should be reduced moreover desired water allocation strategies with varied risk aversion levels were generated under different water inflow levels results reveal that the highest economic benefits could be achieved when risk aversion degree reaches 30 40 and 70 under the low medium and high inflow levels respectively results reveal that higher risks would bring higher returns under the low and medium inflow levels and the highest economic benefits could be achieved when risk aversion degree reaches 70 under the high inflow level reveal that higher would bring higher returnsunder the low and medium inflow levels andthe highest economic benefits could be achieved when risk aversion degree reaches 70 under the high inflow level the developed ciftsqp method provided valuable insights into informed irrigation decision making with respect to economy of scale effects risk aversion and recourse in an agricultural water allocation system it can also be applied to address other resource allocation problems under uncertainty and risk keywords water resources allocation irrigation optimization uncertainty analysis risk analysis conditional value at risk 1 introduction water is the lifeline of agricultural food production in some areas of arid northwest china the amount of agricultural water accounted for more than 90 of the total water consumption zhang et al 2018a 2018b especially in arid areas water shortage is getting increasingly grim with increasing demand for food production and economic development so it is decisively significant to improve water use efficiency through optimal management of limited irrigation water to ensure food security and sustain development tan and zhang 2018 irrigation water systems are fraught with lots of uncertain factors due to a variety of variations such as random inﬂow water demand and extreme weather events during the growth cycle the inherent variability complicates the decision problems and aggravate water shortage risks which may cause severe damages such as drought and crop yield reduction therefore in order to obtain risk controllable water use plans it is essential to integrate risk analysis into the optimization efforts of irrigation water management systems previously many research efforts have been dedicated to the optimization of water resources allocation as the conflicts between the supply and demand ends are becoming prominent fu et al 2017 mathematical programming has been one of the most commonly used approaches to meet water demands and improve water use efficiency in irrigation systems one of the major challenges accompanying the mathematical programming of irrigation systems arose from a variety of uncertainties which are ubiquitous in planning problems cai et al 2011 tan et al 2016 to make irrigation systems more resilient to uncertainties it is effective and essential to integrate uncertainty analysis into the optimization methods accordingly many programming methods were developed to handle uncertainties expressed as interval fuzzy and stochastic programming approaches zhang et al 2017 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 in agricultural water management systems some parameters may only be available as fuzzy membership functions because their values are judged by human beings zhang et al 2020 accordingly fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp one of the typical fuzzy programming methods was proposed originating from the concept of credibility that covers both possibility and necessity dai et al 2018 fccp has been widely used to deal with fuzzy parameters in credibility constraints and improve the satisfaction over system performance yue et al 2020 in addition water inflows are normally available as random variables and managers must make decisions in advance of random events there usually exists a dilemma between economic benefits from allocated water and economic losses due to water shortage in agricultural water management problems two stage stochastic programming tsp can be effective for addressing the above problem behind which the fundamental idea is recourse recently the combination of tsp and other optimization methods has been widely used for water resources management cai et al 2019 khosrojerdi et al 2019 guo et al 2019 for example niu et al 2016 developed an interactive two stage fuzzy stochastic programming itfsp method and applied to hetao irrigation district li et al 2019 constructed a market based two stage stochastic model for water resources planning in arid regions yan et al 2020 developed an interval two stage fuzzy differential water price model for agricultural irrigation system and li et al 2020 proposed a simulation optimization framework under uncertainty and applied it to an irrigation district of northern china the above optimization methods were effective for dealing with uncertainties but their inherent assumption on the linearity of all the system components has impeded them from tackling real world problems possessing nonlinear properties for instance influenced by economy of scale effects benefit and cost functions of water works are mostly power functions sauer 2005 tan et al 2013 simplifying the nonlinear problems to the linearity would not only reduce the robustness of the system but also impair the practicality of the results in fact quadratic programming qp would be able to reflect and tackle nonlinearity in the objective functions for optimized system costs or benefits huang et al 2012 researchers coupled uncertainty analysis with qp to deal with uncertainties in nonlinear problems for instance chen and huang 2001 developed an interval quadratic programming iqp method and a derivative algorithm through introducing imp to the qp framework li and huang 2008 combined tsp and iqp to handle economies of scale effects and uncertainties tan et al 2013 introduced the iqp method to deal with the nonlinear problems caused by reflection of economies of scale li et al 2014 employed iqp to reflect the nonlinear and uncertain problems in water quality management generally risk is usually closely linked to uncertainty but the existing programming methods were mostly risk neutral in this sense for sake of higher returns it may provide more water for users with higher benefits while ignoring the fairness wang et al 2017 they were incapable of measuring and controlling water related economic risks associated with extreme low probability but high damage random events such as water shortages exacerbated by climate change in complex agricultural water systems yamout et al 2007 therefore it is of decisive necessity to introduce risk averse approaches to ensure the coordinated development of water resources and economy in fact value at risk var is one of the risk averse approaches to incorporate risk in decision modeling artzner et al 1999 var is defined as the maximum possible economic loss at a given level of distribution probability in spite of its wide applications in investment portfolio in finance shao et al 2011 var was deemed to have limitations var is not subadditive and coherent moreover var is a certain percentile at a given probability of the loss distribution function so it does not tell much about the nature of extreme losses exceeding it wu et al 2006 to remedy these shortcomings of var conditional value at risk cvar as a consistent investment risk measurement method was proposed with consideration of the average losses in the tail that was greater than the var value uryasev and rockafellar 2001 it has been widely used in inexact optimization models for quantifying extreme economic risk losses caused by the worst water shortage events xu et al 2018 in applications water management studies utilizing cvar principles could be mainly divided into three categories to control the risks derived from the variations in water availability in the first category cvar was a part of the objective function such as the maximization of a utility function that balances cvar against loss li et al 2015 xu et al 2018 li et al 2020 fu et al 2018 in the second category cvar was incorporated within the model constraints shao et al 2011 hu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a 2018b in the third category minimized cvar was the objective function bakhtiari et al 2020 tayebikhorami et al 2020 however previous studies were incapable of dealing with multiple uncertainties or controlling associated system risks in nonlinear irrigation water management problems therefore a cvar based interval fuzzy two stage stochastic quadratic programming ciftsqp was proposed through incorporating techniques of tsp cvar fccp and iqp into a general optimization framework comparing to a traditional risk neutral tsp approach ciftsqp could provide more robust solutions considering the extreme economic risk quantified as cvar and water shortage risk expressed as fuzzy credibility level moreover it could handle and quantify nonlinearities in stochastic programs caused by economy of scale effects of facilities in response to the risks arising from randomness and fuzziness prevalent in water management systems ciftsqp could provide decision makers with retroactive water allocation plans tailored to their preferences in a word it could provide valuable insights into informed irrigation decision making with respect to economy of scale effects risk aversion and recourse under multiple uncertainties the proposed method has been applied to an irrigation water management case in the northern china 2 methodological development 2 1 formulation of ciftsqp model in agricultural water management problems there usually exists a dilemma between economic benefits and economic losses due to water shortage moreover water inflows are random variables frequently and decisions must to be made in advance of random events tsp can be effective for addressing the above problems and formulated as follows wang et al 2017 1a max f e f x ω c x k 1 k p k d k y k subject to 1b a l x b l l 1 2 m 1 1c h s x q s k y k ω s k s 1 2 m 2 k 1d x 0 1e y k 0 k where a ﬁrst stage decision x is water allocation target y k is a second stage recourse decision which made after a random event occurred c and d k is the coefficients of x and y k respectively a l and b l are the coefficients in constraint l h s and q s k are the coefficients in constraint s p k is the occurrence probability of scenario k and k 1 k p k 1 and ω k is the random variable with respective probability of occurrence p k unfortunately the tsp model is a risk neutral model with the optimization of an expectation objective shao et al 2011 users with large profits tend to allocate more targeted water ignoring fair allocation but the corresponding risk of punishment is greater the competition for water among different users become more intense leading to a higher risk of water system violation tsp method usually provides planning schemes under several representative probabilities without considerations over high variability of the second stage stochastic information or economic loss under extreme conditions in real world water management case extreme events such as serious water shortages may also occur therefore cvar as a risk measurement model is applied to quantify the tail risk loss of random variables caused by the worst water shortage events xu et al 2018 moreover incorporating cvar into the traditional tsp method can better analyze the trade offs between the system benefits and risk tailored to decision makers risk preferences the risk averse model ctsp can be established as follows 2a max e f x ω γ c v a r β q x ω where β presents the confidence level and γ denotes the trade off between penalty and risk to achieve risk control and aversion which represents the importance of economic risk value to the decision maker generally when γ is set to be less than 0 5 decision makers are more optimistic conversely when γ is greater than 0 5 decision makers are more conservative q x ω presents the continuous loss function associated with variable x and random vector ω the formulas of v a r β and c v a r β are respectively as follows 2b v a r β η β x min η r φ x ω β 2c c v a r β 1 1 β q x ω η β x q x ω p ω d ω since the analytical formula v a r β is difficult to find and c v a r β is often a discrete problem in practice through introducing an auxiliary variable v k c v a r β is replaced by a linear function and a linear constraint of eqs 2d and 2e thereby converting the nonlinear function into a linear function 2d c v a r β η β x 1 1 β k 1 k p k v k 2e subject to v k q x ω η β x model 2a can deal with random variables and associated system economic risk however it is unable to handle uncertain parameters expressed as interval numbers as well as the non linear characteristics in the decision making process caused by economy of scale effects iqp can be proposed to deal with the above problems and expressed as follows chen and huang 2001 3a max f j 1 n c j x j 2 d j x j subject to 3b j 1 n a i j x j b i i 1 2 m 3c x j 0 j 1 2 n where a i j b i c i d i and x j are interval numbers and the and represents the upper and lower bound respectively notably in this study there are some uncertain information expressed as fuzzy number such as the available water in irrigation system fccp can deal with uncertainty identified as fuzzy sets within a fuzzy credibility level λ which belongs to 0 1 dai et al 2014 the credibility measure c λ is an average of possibility measure and necessity liu et al 2015 for the general fuzzy constraint a x b the right hand side parameter b is expressed as a triangular fuzzy set b 0 b 0 5 b 1 and b 0 b 0 5 and b 1 represents the smallest possible value the most likely value and the maximum possible value of the variable respectively the definition of the credibility of fuzzy constraints is zeng et al 2014 4 c λ a x b 1 a x b 0 2 b 0 5 b 0 a x 2 b 0 5 b 0 b 0 a x b 0 5 b 1 a x 2 b 1 b 0 5 b 0 5 a x b 1 0 a x b 1 in fccp credibility constraints can be described as follows 5 c λ a x b λ therefore by integrating the iqp and fccp into the ctsp the ciftsqp model can be constructed as follows 6a max f j 1 n c j x j 2 d j x j j 1 n k 1 k p k e j y j k 2 g j y j k γ η 1 1 β k 1 k p k v k subject to 6b j 1 n a l j

algorithm such a problem with interval parameters can be transformed into two deterministic sub models based on an interactive algorithm chen and huang 2001 however the ciftsqp model contains a variety of uncertainties that cannot be solved directly in the face of random uncertainty water allocation target x j needs to be determined before disclosing random variables but it is difficult to determine whether x j or x j will correspond to a higher benefit li et al 2020 therefore introduce auxiliary decision variable z j to make x j x j δ x j z j where δ x j x j x j and z j 0 1 to balance benefits and penalties when dealing with fuzzy credibility constraint the key is to convert it into regular interval constraints moreover an important step of an interactive algorithm is to judge the correspondence of the decision variables in the two sub models chen and huang 2001 for ciftsqp model there may be two situations as explained below if cost coefficients e j k g j k 0 the upper bound

combining the solutions from two sub model obtain the optimal values however if e j k g j k 0 it is hard to identify the correspondence of y j k in upper bound sub model a mid value model 9 can then be formulated as follows li et al 2009 9a max f m v j 1 n c j m v x j δ x j z j o p t 2 d j m v x j δ x j z j o p t j 1 n k 1 k p k e j k m v y j k m v g j k m v y j k m v 2 γ η 1 1 β k 1 k p k v k m

and 106 20 109 19 e is one of the most major agricultural areas in inner mongolia northern china the city consists of seven administrative divisions including linhe district lh dengkou county dk hangjin houqi hh wuyuan county wy urad qianqi uq urad zhongqi uz and urad houqi uh fig 2 the city is 378 km long horizontally and 238 km wide vertically the total land area is about 6578 km2 of which more than 6467 km2 is cultivated as an important commercial grain base the city has large areas of grain and oil bearing crops the proportion of agricultural irrigation water in bayan nur city is nearly 90 of the total water consumption it is decisively significant to improve water use efficiency and realize scientific and reasonable management of agricultural water resources to ensure food security and sustain development 3 2 problem identification bayan nur city is mainly based on agricultural production and irrigation water occupies a large proportion of water consumption agricultural water management of bayan nur city is facing severe water shortage where the available water resources are difficult to support irrigation water demands on the one hand natural available water resources are limited this city has scare precipitation but high temperature and evaporation groundwater is utilized for agricultural irrigation whereas the groundwater utilization amount is almost close to recoverable amount at present in particular over exploitation occurred in the uq uz and hh over pumping of groundwater trigger problems such as higher pumping costs and increased soil salinity liu and li 2018 in order to ensure water demand for irrigation channels have been excavated and maintained to divert water from the yellow river since ancient time to be specific hetao irrigation district located in bayan nur city is one of the largest irrigation districts of china which is fed by the yellow river primarily surface water is basically used for irrigation and its development and utilization degree is about 84 3 on the other hand quota for agricultural use is being squeezed for instance water diverted from the yellow river is capped to 4 billion m3 per year which is expected to be further reduced with the emphasis on ecological and environmental protection the water structure has changed as well the proportion of farmland irrigation water has shown a downward trend from 97 9 in 2005 to 89 31 in 2015 which is furthering the difficulty for promoting the food security therefore it is of great significance to optimize agricultural water in bayan nur city to alleviate water shortage there are many complexities in agricultural water management systems owing to the uneven distributions of surface runoff the inflow water resources present a remarkable pattern of seasonal variations decision makers need to make decisions in advance under different runoff conditions when devising agricultural water allocation schemes and the government has introduced progressive markups for water used in excess of planned or quota requirements more pre regulated water allocation means greater potential economic benefits whereas more economic losses may be induced by water shortage in dry seasons besides the system faces two kinds of risks caused by uncertain factors further complicating the system the first is the water shortage risk due to the fuzzy uncertainty of the available water related to environmental load capacity the amount of water availability for agriculture will also be constrained by the judgement of decision makers the second is the system economic risk caused by the random variability of inflow water in the case of extreme water shortage event in complex agricultural water systems the corresponding risk loss needs to be measured in real world problems the economies of scale effects may also lead to the nonlinear characteristics of optimal allocation of water resources and associated decisions further aggravating the complexity of the system thus it is crucial to introduce advanced optimization model and risk measurement model into agricultural water management to handle water use conflicts and the complexities of the system in order to realize best compromise by recourse and minimize economic penalty when formulating water resources allocation schemes with random inflow water tsp is used as an effective way for addressing the above problem to deal with the risks arising from the fuzzy and random uncertainties existing in the system fccp and cvar methods are selected moreover to reflect and handle the imprecise parameters and impacts of scale effects on water resources optimization decision iqp is the appropriate approach therefore by incorporating optimization techniques and risk analysis the proposed ciftsqp method was deemed suitable for supporting agricultural water management in the study area 3 3 data collection the main crops in the study area were wheat corn and sunflowers the water sources consisted of surface water and groundwater three levels of inﬂow with different probabilities of occurrence were considered which were named as low l medium m and high h levels respectively according to the historical records of the water inflow to bayan nur city the probability of occurrence for the high and low level flow was almost the same and lower than that of medium level flow respectively the volume of water inflow conformed to the normal distribution on the whole therefore in this study it was assumed that the probabilities of occurrence were 0 2 0 6 and 0 2 the related data such as irrigation area irrigation quota available water resources crop water requirements and related economic data were collected and complied from multiple sources such as the statistical yearbooks of bayan nur city the water resources bulletin of bayan nur city local government reports and policy surveys and field survey data the planting areas of the main crops from 2000 to 2016 were taken as the baseline conditions with an assumption that the typical crop patterns in the planning years would remain unchanged in real world problems the planting areas of main crops vary from year to year to realistically reflect such uncertainty the planting areas were expressed as interval parameters rather than deterministic values data from the past seventeen years were used to obtain the interval numbers for planting areas in detail the historical peak value was set as the upper bound of an interval number while the lower bound took the minimum value of all data observed from 2000 to 2016 data were displayed in tables 1 3 table 1 provided crop water requirements table 2 presented the per regulated water allocation of subareas and the available irrigation water under different inflow levels which were triangular fuzzy numbers q0 q0 5 and q1 related economic data were presented in table 3 3 4 model formulation for agricultural water management in general this study aimed at answering the following questions 1 how to optimally allocate limited surface water and groundwater to different crops in different subareas under uncertain conditions to achieve maximum system benefits 2 how to allocate irrigation water under varied risk aversion levels and 3 how to establish an effective linkage between the economic implications caused by the economy of scale effects and the possible risk losses therefore a ciftsqp model incorporating tsp fccp cvar and iqp methods was formulated for the study case in this study the inflow water was obtained as random variable water availability was expressed as fuzzy set and other parameters were given as interval numbers the amount of per regulated water allocation target was the first stage decision variable and water deficit was the second stage decision variable the objective function was to maximize the comprehensive benefits considering risk control including system benefits of the first stage when allocating targeted water penalties of the second stage when not delivering the promised water and risk losses constraints such as water resources availability and food production demands were considered a general ciftsqp model for agricultural water management was established as follows objective function 12a max f i 1 7 j 1 3 t 1 2 a i j t w i j t 2 b i j t w i j t i 1 7 j 1 3 t 1 2 k 1 3 p k c i j t k s i j

maximum possible values which would belong to 0 5 1 in terms of cvar the value of confidence level β would need to be determined beforehand usually it could be set as 0 90 0 95 and 0 99 a series of analyses found that the distribution of cvar was uniform ji et al 2015 thus the model was solved under the condition that the confidence level β was 0 95 in this paper in addition the risk indicator γ was the weight of cvar assigning different γ values could reflect the risk aversion degree of decision makers results obtained under scenario 1 λ 0 5 β 0 95 and γ 0 5 was used as an example to illustrate the pre regulated water allocation target and recourse related to two stage water allocation decisions and provide the optimal agricultural water allocation plans based on maximizing system economic benefits in addition the whole process of risk management includes risk identification measurement decision making and control there are two kinds of risks tackled in this study they are system economic loss risk caused by the random variability of the inflow water and the water shortage risk due to fuzzy uncertainty of the available water measured as cvar and fuzzy credibility level respectively then risk control could be realized by setting different risk levels optimal solutions generated from the model were demonstrated under five fuzzy credibility levels λ 0 9 0 8 0 7 0 6 and 0 5 eleven weighting levels γ 0 0 1 0 2 0 9 and 1 and three inflow levels low medium and high the system economic benefits and water allocation plans were analyzed under different combinations of risk levels finally the developed model was compared with the other two alternative models the optimal results and discussion were analyzed as below 4 1 water allocation plans fig 3 shows the per regulated and optimal water allocation target for the three crops in seven areas under scenario 1 optimal water allocation target w i j t w i j t δ w i j t z i j t was automatically obtained by the first stage decision which would help reach the highest possible system benefits when z i j t 1 water allocation target reached the upper bound of the pre regulated water allocation and system could obtain the highest benefit along with serious economic penalty risk conversely when z i j t 0 reach the lower bound the optimal value of zijtopt automatically searched by ciftsqp could be used to obtain the optimal water allocation target in the first stage decision for surface water except for uz the sunflowers optimal water allocation target in all other areas would draw near the lower bound for instance in lh the optimal surface water allocation target of sunflowers would equal 39 51 106 m3 while the wheat and corn would equal 49 83 106 m3 and 146 67 106 m3 for groundwater apart from lh and wy the optimal water allocation targets of the other three crops would be close to the upper bound of targeted values it could also be seen from fig 3 that optimal water allocation target of corn would be much higher than those of wheat and sunflowers the results indicate that decision makers would be more optimistic for water supply to sunflowers in addition surface water would be the main irrigation source and decision makers are optimistic about using groundwater as a supplementary water source for agricultural irrigation fig 4 shows the optimal water allocation plans under different inflow levels if available water could not meet the optimal allocation targets deficits would occur and penalties were accepted with recourse in the second stage of decision making the actual optimal water allocation under different inflow levels would be obtained by subtracting the optimal water deficits s i j t k from the optimal water allocation target w i j t for instance under low inflow level cumulative surface water deficits for wheat corn and sunflowers would be 48 59 58 67 106 55 36 79 23 106 and 2 35 4 75 106 m3 respectively groundwater shortage for wheat corn and sunflowers would be 18 24 21 55 106 15 21 24 09 106 and 0 00 1 09 106 m3 respectively under high inflow level surface water and groundwater shortage for wheat would be 1 75 9 28 106 and 3 29 11 91 106 m3 respectively while corn and sunflowers would not suffer any shortage under medium and high inflow levels from the perspective of crops water allocation of wheat and corn would respond most strongly to water shortages which may be mainly due to their lower benefits and penalties in contrast irrigation of sunflowers would not have significant changes under all different inflows from a regional perspective groundwater in wy would be relatively scarce and the water shortage would be 24 49 27 40 106 m3 under low inflow level moreover surface water would be deficient in uq and uz the water shortage in these sub areas would be 63 03 76 36 106 and 42 35 49 31 106 m3 under low inflow level respectively consequently the results could guide managers to give priority to making aggressive water allocation plans for economic crops like sunflowers under all inflow levels meanwhile under low inflow level decision makers would reduce the water allocation of wheat and corn under medium and high inflow level decision makers would give priority to meet the water demand of corn and reduce the water allocation to wheat moreover it would be the most economical option to reduce groundwater allocation to wy and surface water consumption of uq and uz when facing severe water shortage the maximum benefit of the irrigation system with the optimal water allocation planning would be 65 49 88 12 108 rmb different values in intervals would correspond to different risk preferences of decision makers decision makers willing to accept higher risks could pursue higher economic benefits corresponding to the upper bound of system benefits if decision makers focus more on water saving with the lower penalty costs of recourse they would tend to be reward by the lower bound of system benefits 4 2 economic benefits and risk analysis fig 5 reveals the system benefits and uncertainty degree of solutions under different combinations of risk indicator γ and fuzzy credibility level λ uncertainty degree of solutions was defined as the difference between the upper and lower bound divided by the lower bound the λ value of 0 5 means that the risk of violating the fuzzy constraint was less than 50 in other words water shortage risk was less than 50 results show that the system benefits would decrease as the lower fuzzy credibility level λ increased under different risk indicator γ for example system benefits would reduce from 79 31 97 14 108 to 74 01 94 83 108 rmb as the value of λ increased from 0 5 to 0 9 when γ equal to 0 3 the reason may be that the higher the credibility level the lower water shortage risk and the smaller the amount of available water resources under the premise of the same optimal water allocation target the actual allocated amount of water resources allocation would decrease thereby the system s benefit would correspondingly decline moreover fig 5 also shows that when the risk indicator γ was greater than 0 5 the uncertainty degree of the model results would reach a minimum and the lower bound of system benefits would reach a maximum when the credibility level λ was 0 6 therefore results could help decision makers to analyze the effect of the combination of two risk measures on system benefits in the planning year to obtain higher system benefit lower γ and λ values should be selected which correspond to higher risk levels to obtain lower uncertainty degree of solutions the risk of violating the fuzzy constraint was less than 50 in other words water shortage risk was less than 50 for the optimist γ 0 5 and less than 60 for a conservative decision maker γ 0 5 in order to explain and analyze the influence of decision makers attitudes toward system risk on the value of the objective function under different inflow levels fig 6 displays the system net benefit under different combinations of risk indicators and inflow levels under the low and medium inflow levels the objective function value would decrease with risk indicator increasing for instance system net benefit would decrease from 52 69 76 59 108 rmb to 7 03 38 93 108 rmb when γ increases from 0 1 to 1 under low inflow level similarly there would be a similar trend under medium inflow level with γ value increasing from 0 1 to 1 system net benefit would decrease from 97 89 116 17 108 rmb to 86 98 108 17 108 rmb generally the importance of the risk term would increase as γ value increasing it indicated that decision makers would choose conservative water allocation strategies to achieve risk aversion with γ increases under high inflow level the objective function value would show an upward trend before γ 0 7 the system net benefit would increase from 103 09 119 11 108 to 108 57 124 59 108 rmb as γ rising 0 1 to 0 7 the reason might be that the amount of water allocation would decrease with the increase of γ level under conditions of sufficient water the water allocation cost would reduce and thus the income would gradually increase when γ was greater than 0 7 with the increase of γ the objective function would gradually decrease the system net benefit would decrease from 108 57 124 59 108 to 73 29 98 46 108 rmb when γ increases from 0 7 to 1 consequently the system benefits would decrease as the degree of risk aversion increases under the low and medium inflow levels if the decision maker was aggressive an optimistic water allocation planning strategy could be made leading to higher system benefits while under the high inflow level system net benefit would reach to maximum when risk indicator γ was 0 7 the obtained optimal irrigation water allocation of different crops would be affected by changing the risk indicator γ surface water allocation scheme of three crops under different inflow levels and risk indicator shown in fig 7 were used for illustration under low inflow level irrigation water allocation would be sensitive to γ when γ was no more than 0 3 surface water allocated to sunflowers which would have high return and high risk would reduce from 21 20 106 to 17 46 106 m3 as γ rising from 0 1 to 0 3 on the contrary surface water allocated to wheat and corn irrigation would increase from 40 45 41 60 106 to 44 47 42 58 106 m3 and 64 35 67 20 106 to 68 07 69 96 106 m3 respectively when γ was greater than 0 3 there would be no significant difference as γ increases under medium inflow level the irrigation water allocated to wheat corn and sunflowers would respectively be 45 92 46 84 106 to 46 95 47 82 106 m3 78 88 81 96 106 to 81 59 84 72 106 m3 and 21 20 21 20 106 to 17 46 17 46 106 m3 when γ increases from 0 3 to 0 4 when γ was greater than 0 4 there would be no significant difference as γ increases therefore irrigation water allocation would be significantly sensitive to γ when γ value was around 0 4 the abnormalities at γ 0 4 demonstrated that this model could avoid the allocation of overmuch water resources to sunflowers in pursuit of high returns resulting in too little production of food crops at the high inflow level there would be no significant change results could provide decision makers with retroactive water allocation plans under different inflow levels tailored to their risk preferences in general based on decision makers risk attitudes and different inflow levels in the planning year decision makers could control the system benefit and water allocation in the light of the actual situation under the low and medium inflow levels the results in fig 6 show that the greater the degree of risk aversion is the less the system benefits would be at the same time the results in fig 7 demonstrate that the allocation of irrigation water would no longer changes after the degree of risk aversion reaches 30 and 40 respectively under these two inflow scenarios for instance when the risk indicator increased from 0 1 to 0 3 decision makers could appropriately reduce 3 74 106 m3 of water allocated to sunflowers and appropriately increase 0 98 1 02 106 and 1 71 1 76 106 m3 of irrigation water allocated to wheat and corn respectively under the low inflow level such a scheme could avoid allocating excess water resources to sunflowers in pursuit of high returns which would hamper the production of cereal crops under the high inflow level the allocation of irrigation water would be no significant change under different degrees of risk aversion while the system benefit would reach to maximum when the risk indicator was 0 7 therefore the results could help risk averse decision makers to obtain reasonable and robust water allocation plans that may guarantee fairness avoid risk losses and maximize system benefits it was recommended that decision makers could adopt the optimal water allocation plans when the risk aversion degree reaches 30 40 and 70 under the low medium and high inflow levels respectively 4 3 discussions for comparisons the study problem was also solved by two alternatives rqpm that did not include quadratic programming model and rcm in which cvar was removed compared to the developed ciftsqp method rqpm did not consider the economy of scale effects rcm did not take into account risk aversion options which could be viewed as a special case of the ciftsqp one when γ takes 0 the objective function value obtained from the two alternatives as well as ciftsqp under scenario 1 λ 0 5 β 0 95 and γ 0 5 are presented in fig 8 it appeared that the interval width of three models was ciftsqp rqpm rcm in order to explain the influence of authorities attitudes towards system risk i e γ on the objective function value for rqpm and ciftsqp fig 9 shows the system benefit calculated by two models under different risk levels it demonstrated that the objective function value of both two models would decrease as risk indicator γ increases the net system benefit of ciftsqp would decrease from 87 15 106 58 108 to 40 09 67 21 108 rmb when γ changes from 0 1 to 1 while those of rqpm would drop from 78 82 137 26 108 rmb to 35 30 122 77 108 rmb moreover ciftsqp would have lower uncertainty degree as the risk indicator γ increases the system benefit would tend to fluctuate more intensively when ignoring the economy of scale effects compared to ciftsqp rcm could be considered as a particular or simplified case of the ciftsqp one when γ takes 0 which neglected risks of economic loss and only focused on obtaining the maximum benefit it could generate a higher target value to gain higher benefit nevertheless it was unable to analyze the trade offs between system benefit and economic risk ciftsqp was thus superior to rcm to analyze such trade offs through incorporating cvar in terms of rqpm the objective function of rqpm was linear with the economy of scale effects being neglected if multiple users compete for limited irrigation water resources the influences of economy of scale effects might be significant due to over simplification of the economic relationship rqpm model would be less appropriate and realistic simplifying the nonlinear problem to the linearity would not only reduce the robustness of the system but also have a negative effect on the practicality of the results in fact ciftsqp can effectively solve the problem that nonlinearity affected by the economy of scale in mathematical programming as shown in fig 9 the gap between the upper and lower bound of the system benefit obtained from ciftsqp would always be smaller than that of rqpm indicating ciftsqp would greatly reduce the uncertainty degree of the feasible solutions meanwhile the increase in uncertainty degree of rqpm would even be sharper as the degree of risk aversion increases moreover the lower bound of the system benefit obtained by ciftsqp would always be higher than that of rqpm generally planning for the lower bound of the system benefits would result in conservative water allocation targets and less water shortage risk therefore optimization results of ciftsqp are more friendly to conservative decision makers to sum up optimal solution proposed by ciftsqp is more robust with lower uncertainty degree and its lower bound of system benefit would be higher for risk averse decision makers generally there are both specific merits and limitations in the rqpm model and rcm model and their integration performs better on the one hand ciftsqp could provide risk averse solutions with recourse in response to system economic risk quantified as cvar and water shortage risk handled by fuzzy credibility level on the other hand it was able to reflect nonlinearity and establish an effective linkage between the associated economic implications caused by the economy of scale effects of facilities and the possible risk losses 5 conclusions agricultural water management system is subject to a variety of uncertainties and nonlinearity which complicate the decision making process and exaggerate water shortage risks previously few studies could tackle multiple uncertainties and the associated system risks in nonlinear problems making it hard to achieve fair and risk controllable water allocation in this paper a novel irrigation water management model was established a cvar based interval fuzzy two stage stochastic quadratic programming ciftsqp was proposed ciftsqp could provide decision makers with retroactive water allocation plans tailored to their preferences to cope with the risks arising from randomness and fuzziness prevalent in water management systems in a word it provided valuable insights into informed irrigation decision making with respect to economy of scale effects risk aversion and recourse under multiple uncertainties the proposed method has been applied to an irrigation water management case in bayan nur city located in the northern china the results from the case study could guide the managers to formulate the optimal retroactive water allocation plans in irrigation systems economic crops such as sunflowers would be preferred surface water would be the main irrigation source moreover it is recommended to reduce groundwater allocation in wuyuan county and reduce surface water consumption of urad qianqi and urad zhongqi in response to severe water shortage in response to the risks arising from randomness and fuzziness prevalent in water management systems the risk indicator and fuzzy credibility level could reflect decision makers risk preferences and water shortage risk levels under different scenarios results revealed that the combination of different risk scenarios would lead to changed system benefits and irrigation water allocation plans lower risk indicator and fuzzy credibility level corresponding to higher risk levels could obtain higher system benefits under the low and medium inflow levels higher risks would bring higher returns moreover the highest system economic benefits would be achieved when risk aversion degree reaches 70 under the high inflow level compared against the other two alternative models ciftsqp would result in lower uncertainty degree and higher lower bound of system benefit ciftsqp could not only provide risk averse solutions with recourse in response to system economic risk quantified as cvar and water shortage risk handled by fuzzy credibility level but also handle nonlinearity and establish an effective linkage between economic implications and possible risk losses caused by the economy of scale effects of facilities this paper attempted to construct a novel method to handle multiple uncertainties and quantify the associated risks in nonlinear environment although this proposed model was first applied to an irrigation water management problem it could also be applied to other resource allocation problems under uncertainty and risk

10328,the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer cropping system model was used with an objective to evaluate maize zea mays l winter wheat triticum aestivum l and grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench yield crop water productivity cwp and return after variable cost ravc under different combinations of irrigation interval capacity and plant available soil water pasw thresholds on three soil types in southwestern kansas maize grain sorghum and winter wheat yields were maximized under irrigation capacity of 4 2 6 3 3 1 4 2 and 2 5 3 1 mm d respectively the lowest and highest

respectively the cwp of grain sorghum peaked at shorter irrigation interval 25 mm 6 8 d whereas high cwp of wheat was simulated even at longer irrigation interval 25 mm 26 d overall for winter wheat and grain sorghum irrigation strategy for attaining higher ravc values is different from irrigation strategy for attaining higher yield whereas for maize irrigation strategy for higher yield is the same as that irrigation strategy for higher ravc this study guides producers to identify and prioritize the most suitable irrigation strategy for optimizing yield cwp and or income while enhancing

and variations in crop management and climate keywords maize grain sorghum winter wheat dssat irrigation water management ogallala 1 introduction the ogallala aquifer is a shallow water table aquifer and utilized for irrigated agriculture in the great plains region of the united states the aquifer stretches over eight states and covers an area of about 450 000 km2 dail 2015 the withdrawal of irrigation water from the aquifer exceeds the rate of recharge and the aquifer will deplete in a few decades unless managed efficiently buchanan et al 2009 mcguire 2012 scanlon et al 2012 haacker et al 2016 at present many of the wells in major parts of western kansas have failed the minimum discharge rate to meet the evapotranspiration needs of crops for optimal production therefore there has been a significant push from policymakers across the ogallala aquifer for sustainable use of water and extending the life span of the aquafer while enhancing crop productivity and profitability peterson et al 2003 improving irrigation water application and water management for crop production could contribute to the sustainable use of water and extend the economic life of the aquifer many studies exist on quantifying irrigation water requirements based on cropping systems current irrigation technology and irrigation practices lamm et al 2006 rogers and lamm 2012 klocke et al 2014 kisekka et al 2016 however crop production systems and producers are dynamic and may adjust to changing biophysical and socioeconomic conditions many producers change their management over time depending on cropping systems available resources skill and economic capabilities precision farming technology is changing the agriculture industry in a way that optimal yield is met based on the variable inputs considering heterogeneity within fields in water limited areas irrigation water management requires improved understanding and robust evaluation of the crop soil water and climate relations and economic performances irrigation water requirement and scheduling could differ by soil type and water holding capacities in addition different seasons could differ in onset cessation distribution and amount of rainfall that affects irrigation scheduling studying how irrigation scheduling affects crop yield crop water productivity cwp and profits based on long term climate under different soil types could contribute to improving crop yields and economic returns in this paper we answer several key questions what would be the crop production scenario if all production inputs except water were non liming during any part of growing season what is the yield and cwp maximizing strategy based on combination of irrigation capacity interval and plant available soil water pasw irrigation thresholds for some of the major crops in the region under different soil types what maximum levels of yield and income could be obtained from irrigation water management practices what is the optimal irrigation water management from the perspectives of yield cwp and return after variable cost ravc assessing all combinations of irrigation intervals and plant available soil water pasw thresholds under conventional field experiment is costly and time consuming results based on conventional field experiment may give accurate representation for a specific site and a specific season but may not give accurate representation of the relationships for multiple sites and seasons crop simulation models can be calibrated and evaluated using short experimental data to simulate for multiple seasons and locations jones et al 2003 boote et al 2010 kisekka et al 2016 araya et al 2017a 2017b 2017c in this study we used the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer cropping

different combinations of irrigation interval irrigation capacity and pasw thresholds on three different soil types in southwestern kansas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site was located in finney county garden city southwestern kansas lat 38 01 20 87 n and long 100 49 26 95 w with an elevation of 887 m above mean sea level the major crops in the study site were maize winter wheat and grain sorghum ulysses silt loam valent fine sand and richfield silt loam soils are the major soils in the area rouhi rad et al 2020b the wilting point for ulysses silt loam richfield silt loam and valent fine sand soils was 0 16 0 2 0 17 0 26 0 10 0 12 m3 m3 whereas the field capacity and water content at saturation for the corresponding soils was 0 33 0 4 0 33 0 45 0 2 0 23 m3 m3 and

that the soil is suitable for maximizing crop productivity some of the chemical analysis results reported by the authors include a ph of 7 98 8 13 organic matter of 2 2 1 ca of 4588 5232 ppm mg of 499

recommendation based on organic matter content of the soils by crop type and yield goal is presented in leikam et al 2003 overall the soil is considered suitable for optimizing crop production with application of fertilizer based on leikam et al 2003 and foster et al 2017 the long term mean annual rainfall 1981 2010 for finney county garden city was about 488 mm fig 1a the highest and lowest average daily temperature occurred in july 25 5 ºc and january 0 95 ºc respectively the average long term 1981 2010 maximum and minimum temperature for the study site is presented in fig 1b 2 2 model

limit is considered as drainage while runoff are estimated based on curve number method williams 1991 ritchie et al 1998 drainage is limited by saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil hoogenboom

atmosphere sub module ritchie et al 1998 jones et al 2003 root water uptake is estimated based on ritchie 1998 the actual transpiration is a function of root water uptake which also determines the rate of photo assimilation hoogenboom et al 2019 2 3 model setup and irrigation scheduling the dssat family crop models ceres maize cropsim ceres and ceres sorghum jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2017 2019 were calibrated and validated for the selected maize grain sorghum and winter wheat genotypes in prior studies by araya et al 2017b 2018 the genetic coefficients used for the selected crop genotypes in this study are presented in table 1 the crops were set in the model on seasonal continuous cropping system mode not in sequential system and thus the same crop was grown continuously once each year over the long term period 1981 2010 accordingly the model was set to plant maize grain sorghum and winter wheat every year on may 10 may 15 and oct 10 respectively on separate independent fields the harvesting date of the corresponding crops slightly varied depending on climatic condition over the long term seasons the estimated harvesting dates based on the model were oct 10 30 for maize sep 1 15 for grain sorghum and may 20 to jun 15 for winter wheat which are within the ranges of harvesting time of the three crops in the study areas similarly the suggested planting dates are within the range recommended in kansas kansas crop planting guide https bookstore ksre ksu edu pubs l818 pdf the plant density for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat were 7 6 18 and 250 plants m2 respectively the model default priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 and the suleiman ritchie method ritchie et al 2009 were used for estimating evapotranspiration and soil evaporation jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 the pasw is estimated from the status of the actual available soil water relative to the maximum that the soil can hold at field capacity expressed in percentage soil organic matter and nitrogen dynamics were simulated based on godwin and singh 1998 given that the focus of our study is on the effect of irrigation management on productivity and returns the crops were grown under optimal or non limiting management conditions that include nitrogen fertilizer nutrients and pests and diseases except water the options in the model was set as non limiting except for water however for demonstration scenario analysis purposes we have also briefly presented based on prevalent management practices for one of the selected soils valent fine sand soils at finney county garden city southwestern kansas accordingly the model was set with nitrogen management based on practice for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat in western kansas as 250 kg n ha 150 kg n ha and 100 kg n ha respectively for maize and grain sorghum all the nitrogen fertilizer was applied at once five days before planting whereas for winter wheat a total amount of 14 kg n ha was applied on date of planting oct 10 each year and the other 86 kg n ha was applied around mid of april based on the prevailing practice the irrigation scheduling treatments implemented in the non limiting hereafter optimal nitrogen management described below were also implemented for crops treated with prevalent management practice yield and crop water productivities simulated under both scenarios were plotted and discussed in addition long term 2008 2019 measured crop performance yield data of maize grain sorghum and winter wheat was obtained from kansas state university performance trial website https www agronomy k state edu services crop performance tests the crops were grown under similar climate and nearly optimal crop management condition however some of the years with relatively low yield performance was left out due to suspect of external yield reducing factors or inappropriate management conditions while some of the years were missing because they were reported abandoned by the researchers the average yields of the crop performance test data was considered in this study as observational data for comparisons purpose sprinkler irrigation was set in the model in an automatic mode with fixed amount 25 mm and irrigation efficiency of 0 85 rouhi rad et al 2020a according to the prevailing practice most producers in southwestern kansas apply 25 mm irrigation depth per irrigation event rouhi rad et al 2020a and typical irrigation application efficiency for sprinkler irrigation in well managed field is estimated to be 0 75 0 85 irmak et al 2011 there were six plant available soil water pasw 25 35 45 55 65 and 75 and 13 irrigation intervals 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 and 26 d with a total of 78 irrigation treatment combinations the irrigation interval and pasw treatment combinations were implemented on three different crops maize grain sorghum and winter wheat each of the crop types were planted in a continuous system on three different soil types ulysses silt loam richfield silt loam and valent fine sand over 30 years 1981 2010 period the irrigation interval rules in the model come into effect only after the pasw was triggered producers might select any of the pasw irrigation trigger thresholds and irrigation interval combinations depending on climate soil and crop type well capacity and or irrigation method etc for example in practical sense setting the model based on pasw 75 at 6 d interval would mean the center pivot should start irrigating when pasw is slightly below 75 and irrigation depth of 25 mm must be applied within six days so that to continuously keep the pasw above 75 the center pivot will continue applying irrigation 24 h a day until the pasw threshold level is above 75 in the model irrigation interval can be translated into irrigation capacity when amount of irrigation applied per irrigation event 25 mm is divided by irrigation interval lamm et al 2006 2007 araya et al 2019b the model was run to simulate the irrigation applied crop evapotranspiration yield and other yield components under the given irrigation scheduling treatment the relationship of yield with pasw irrigation interval and irrigation capacity was presented for each crop for the different soils this analysis represents a theoretical crop production scenario to demonstrate how changes in irrigation scheduling and plant available soil water affect yield under different soil types this analysis can provide some insight into the relationships between pasw and irrigation interval and crop yields the relationship between average long term yield and irrigation were presented only for silt loam soils crop water productivity was calculated for each crop by soil type and irrigation treatments as simulated yield divided by the seasonal sum of crop evapotranspiration the cwp was used to evaluate the suitability of irrigation scheduling strategy based on each treatment return after variable cost ravc was calculated to evaluate the suitability of the scenario economically the information on ravc was obtained from kansas farm management association as documented on the kansas state university agmanager website https www agmanager info kfma enterprise reports for the period from 1995 to 2016 the ravc was calculated as presented in araya et al 2019a ravc is estimated as gross income minus variable cost the variable cost typically includes labor machinery repairs interest paid input expenses such as seeds herbicide insecticide fertilizer lime machinery rentals lease and other variable costs the difference from araya et al 2019a is that irrigation scheduling in this study was set to fixed automatic irrigation based on the specified interval when certain level of pasw was met in araya et al 2019a scheduling was set as fixed irrigation regardless of climate variability and pasw which was a simplifying assumption the second difference from araya et al 2019a is that nitrogen application was set in the model always to meet optimal requirement of the crop at any growth stage of the crop whereas this was not the case in araya et al 2019a where nitrogen application was fixed based on prevailing practices in addition unlike in araya et al 2019a which presented 64 years average values the 25 50 and 75 probability of exceedance of ravc value per hectare for 30 years period 1980 2010 are presented in this study 3 results 3 1 yield irrigation interval irrigation capacity pasw and their relationships this study showed that maize yield is highly sensitive to irrigation capacity or irrigation interval maize yield under the various irrigation capacities interval varied by at least 8 mg ha the lowest yield 9 mg ha was simulated for the lowest irrigation capacity 1 mm d or longest irrigation interval 26 d the highest yield 17 5 mg ha was simulated for the relatively higher irrigation capacity 4 2 6 3 mm d or shorter irrigation interval 4 6 d depending on soil type selected fig 2a c the model showed that maize was relatively more sensitive to irrigation capacity under fine sand than under silt loam fig 2a c in addition maize was relatively sensitive to irrigation capacity and irrigation interval compared to pasw fig 2a f for maize treated with optimal nitrogen management there were no substantial differences in terms of yield among maize treated with similar irrigation capacities under different pasw thresholds above 45 fig 2d f this shows that maize yield can be optimized with pasw thresholds above 45 as long as higher irrigation capacities up to 4 2 mm d are used however maize yield can substantially reduce when treated with pasw of 35 or below fig 2d f it should be noted that the variability in crop yield was higher under fine sandy soils fig 2f compared to silt loam soils fig 2d and e the yield response of grain sorghum to irrigation capacity interval varied by genotypic characteristics soils and n management not shown the grain sorghum genotype presented in this study was responsive to irrigation the average grain sorghum yield for one in two year could exceed 8 and 10 mg ha for irrigation capacity of 2 5 and 4 2 mm d respectively under 50 pasw or above fig 3a c however the increase in yield above 4 2 mm d was not substantial the lowest irrigation capacity 1 mm d generated the lowest yield 5 5 mg ha grain sorghum yield decreased substantially in silt loam soils when grown below pasw of 45 as a threshold for initiating irrigation fig 3a e however grain sorghum yield improved substantially when grown with a pasw of above 45 and yield increased with an increase in pasw there was also a substantial increase in yield under fine sand soils when irrigation trigger was set at pasw of 75 fig 3c and f in this case irrigating grain sorghum in 6 d intervals with an irrigation depth of 25 mm under irrigation trigger of 45 could produce a greater yield grain sorghum suffered from yield loss when grown below pasw of 45 winter wheat yield varied with irrigation capacity fig 4a c the minimum irrigation capacity for maximum yield on both silt loam and fine sand soils was approximately between 2 1 and 3 1 mm d depending the irrigation trigger the maximum yield ranged between 10 and 11 mg ha at high irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d for pasw of above 45 although there was a slight change yield did not substantially increase at irrigation capacity above this level the lowest wheat yield was simulated for the lowest pasw threshold 25 yield substantially improved with an increase in pasw thresholds however in silt loam soils fig 4d and e yield peaked at the threshold of 45 or above for irrigation interval of 8 d whereas yield improved at a slower rate as pasw increased from 45 to 75 on the contrary on fine sandy soils yield increased substantially with increase in pasw thresholds with highest yield at 75 pasw fig 4f for maize irrigation amount was more influenced by irrigation interval and less influenced by pasw thresholds fig 5a maize yield increased with the amount of irrigation fig 5b almost all irrigations based on different pasw triggers had similar trend in terms of yield irrigation relations fig 5b there was a curvilinear relationship between the amount of irrigation and maize yield fig 5b the lowest and highest irrigation amounts were 100 and 450 mm which corresponded to yield of 9 and 17 5 mg ha respectively fig 5b irrigation for grain sorghum was substantially influenced by pasw thresholds and irrigation interval fig 5c irrigation increased with a decrease in irrigation frequency fig 5c grain sorghum yield increased with an increase in the amount of irrigation fig 5d the yield was maximum at approximately 300 mm after which yield did not increase with further increase in irrigation the lowest yield 6 mg ha corresponded to the lowest irrigation amount 100 mm fig 5d irrigation requirement for wheat was substantially affected by pasw thresholds and irrigation interval fig 5e the lowest winter wheat yield was simulated at irrigation of 100 mm fig 5f winter wheat yield was maximized 11 mg ha at irrigation levels of 200 225 mm fig 5f the relationship between winter wheat yield and irrigation was curvilinear a declining increase in yield with an increase in irrigation and remains flat after some level comparing winter wheat and grain sorghum the yield response of grain sorghum and winter wheat to changes in pasw was similar for all soil types although the pattern was slightly different yield increased with an increase in pasw it was relatively steeper for winter wheat and it was less responsive to irrigation capacity at 25 pasw similarly grain sorghum was also less responsive to irrigation capacity at 25 pasw for both grain sorghum and winter wheat yield increased with an increase in pasw threshold and maximized at pasw above 55 long term 2008 2019 crop performance data for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat under nearly optimal management conditions in western kansas are shown in fig 6a c in some of the years the presented data showed that yield of maize grain sorghum and wheat under nearly optimal management condition could reach up to 18 13 and 8 mg ha respectively the crop performance yield data presented in this study for maize and grain sorghum in fig 6a and b closely matched with the simulated data for optimal management in this study figs 3 and 4 particularly for irrigation capacity 4 2 6 3 mm d 3 2 crop water productivity crop water productivity of maize under optimal nitrogen management peaked at 25 5 26 5 kg ha mm for all soils at irrigation interval of 2 8 d under all pasw irrigation triggers fig 7a c maize was more productive at irrigation trigger above pasw 45 fig 7a c the cwp of maize quickly declined under all pasw irrigation triggers and reached low level at 26 d interval under pasw of 25 fig 7a c cwp for grain sorghum ranged from 15 to 24 kg ha mm where cwp trends varied by irrigation interval and pasw irrigation triggers fig 7d f in all three soils cwp for grain sorghum increased 24 kg ha mm at irrigation interval of 6 d under irrigation trigger pasw 55 or above whereas the lowest was simulated 15 kg ha mm for pasw 25 fig 7d f winter wheat cwp ranged between 18 and 21 kg ha mm fig 7g i for winter wheat cwp trend is more uniform and consistent across various ranges of irrigation interval and psaw irrigation triggers and soil types however cwp by soil type for psaw 75 was low in silt loam fig 7g and h while slightly improved in fine sand fig 7i the lowest cwp was simulated for psaw 25 while the highest was for psaw 45 55 3 3 yield irrigation interval irrigation capacity pasw cwp and their relationships the relationship between yield and irrigation capacity and irrigation interval under different pasw for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat with prevalent nitrogen management 250 kg n ha on valent fine sand is presented in fig 8a d maize yield was substantially affected by change in nitrogen management fig 2a d vs fig 8a and d the maximum maize yield 16 mg ha was obtained under irrigation capacity of 6 3 mm d similarly maximum maize yield of 14 mg ha was simulated for silt loam under prevalent nitrogen management not shown these values were substantially lower than the yield simulated for optimal nitrogen management the lowest yield was not substantially affected by the change in nitrogen management like for optimal nitrogen management maize yield was more affected by irrigation capacity when compared to pasw thresholds increasing pasw irrigation triggers did not increase maize substantially when irrigation interval of more than 12 d was used fig 8d decreasing irrigation interval up to 4 d substantially increased maize yield the rate of yield increase substantially improved when pasw was increased from 25 to 75 under shorter irrigation interval 12 d fig 8d grain sorghum yield was substantially affected by change in nitrogen management fig 3c vs fig 8b and e yield substantially reduced under the prevailing 150 kg n ha nitrogen management practice fig 7b and e however like for optimal nitrogen management grain sorghum yield substantially increased with increase in irrigation capacity and pasw irrigation trigger the highest yield was simulated for pasw 65 under irrigation capacity of 4 2 mm d beyond which yield did not substantially increase simulated winter wheat yield substantially decreased under the prevailing nitrogen 100 kg n ha management 5 7 5 mg ha fig 8c and f when compared to that simulated under the optimal nitrogen management 7 11 mg ha fig 4e and f winter wheat yield increased with increase in irrigation capacity of up to 3 1 mm d and pasw of 55 beyond which yield did not substantially increased the crop performance test yield data for winter wheat closely matched with that simulated for prevalent management conditions presented in this study figs 6c and 8c and f crop water productivity for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat under the prevailing nitrogen management conditions ranged between 18 and 24 13 and 17 and 12 and 13 kg ha mm fig 8g i the highest cwp for maize sorghum and winter wheat was simulated at irrigation interval of 4 6 d 2 8 d and 2 26 d respectively all crops responded well when irrigation was initiated under pasw 55 65 the lowest cwp corresponded to psaw 25 there was no substantial difference in cwp between the longest 26 d and shortest 2 d irrigation interval for winter wheat implying that winter wheat can be productive under limited irrigation condition 3 4 the relationship between return after variable cost ravc and irrigation interval the average ravc for maize increased up to irrigation interval of 8 d and irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d there was a slight increase in ravc above irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d although it was not that substantial fig 9a c the average ravc varied by irrigation interval and by soil types fig 9a c with relatively higher and lower ravc under silt loam 600 710 ha and fine sand soils 400 700 ha respectively the shortest irrigation interval 2 8 d interval corresponded to approximately 630 710 ha and the longest irrigation interval 26 d corresponded to 400 500 ha the highest and lowest ravc corresponded to silt loam and fine sand respectively the 25 probabilities of exceedance for ravc also substantially increased with an increase in irrigation capacity up to 3 1 mm d or irrigation interval of 8 d it shows that optimal ravc for maize corresponds to 8 d irrigation interval which is different from the optimal irrigation interval for maximum maize yield for grain sorghum there was a small difference in ravc among the irrigation interval with an average range of 180 200 and 150 180 ha for silt loam and fine sand respectively fig 10a f these values corresponded to ranges of irrigation interval between 8 and 10 d irrigation capacity 2 5 3 1 mm d however when considering average 50 ravc values they were not substantially different from ravc values obtained based on longest irrigation interval the ravc values were also substantially different when considering one in four years 25 probability fig 10a f the maximum ravc value for grain sorghum did not correspond to the maximum irrigation capacity for maximum yield indicating lowest irrigated grain sorghum generates income as much as that of those with irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d the average ravc values for winter wheat ranged between 350 370 and 310 367 ha respectively for silt loam and fine sand the highest and lowest in both ranges corresponded to the shortest 2 4 d and longest 24 26 d irrigation intervals respectively fig 11a f however the difference between the highest and lowest ravc values simulated based on the shortest and longest irrigation intervals was not substantially different this can be further demonstrated when considering the ravc values in 1 out of 2 years 50 probability of exceedance level or 1 out of 4 years 25 probability of exceedance level fig 11a f this shows growing wheat based on the longest irrigation interval or under lower irrigation capacity might be appropriate 4 discussion 4 1 yield and irrigation maize yield increased with irrigation capacity up to 4 2 mm d in silt loam soils and 6 3 mm d in fine sand soils araya et al 2019a simulated maximum yield at irrigation capacity of 5 mm d for southwestern kansas which is in the range of values simulated in this study lamm et al 2007 estimated gross irrigation capacity of 6 4 mm d to meet a maximum maize yield for northwestern kansas also in the range of values obtained in this study in fine sand soils there was curve linear relationship between yield and irrigation capacity likewise lamm et al 2006 obtained a similar curve linear relationship between yield and irrigation capacity for maize in northwest kansas oker 2018 conducted an experiment in southwestern kansas near garden city during the 2016 and 2017 season obtaining a maize yield in the range of 12 13 13 14 and 13 15 mg ha in silt loam soils under irrigation capacity of 1 6 3 1 and 6 2 mm d respectively the yield values based on irrigation capacities of 3 1 and 6 2 mm d are slightly lower than our simulated yields for the corresponding irrigation capacities the yield value for irrigation capacity of 1 6 mm d in oker 2018 was close to our yield values obtained under pasw of 25 the yield values in most of our simulation treatments were slightly higher than the measured experimental yields at the study site because our simulation assumptions were set for optimal management conditions such as optimal nitrogen free of weeds insect pests and other weather hazards including hail and frost however these experimental yield values presented in oker 2018 were within the ranges of the simulated values based on prevailing n management briefly demonstrated in this study as well as those in prior studies presented in araya et al 2017b 2018 2019a 2019b long term 2008 2019 maize yield based on crop performance test conducted under nearly optimal condition https www agronomy k state edu services crop performance tests in western kansas showed similar yield 9 18 mg ha as that simulated in our study for optimal management similarly maize yield simulated for potential production in this study is within the range of yield presented for sprinkler irrigation under nearly optimal management condition in the western corn belt 9 17 2 mg ha sadras et al 2015 grain sorghum yield increased with irrigation capacity up to certain level in this study the minimum irrigation capacity to meet a yield of 9 mg ha at 50 pasw in both silt loam and fine sand in this study was 2 5 3 1 mm d which is consistent with previous study as presented in araya et al 2018 however there was a tendency of increase in yield with increase in pasw and decrease in irrigation interval due to difference in cultivar characteristics and assumptions used in the model such as meeting optimal nitrogen conditions throughout the growing period the grain sorghum genotype used in this study is relatively sensitive to initial pasw when compared to the one presented in araya et al 2017b in this study the irrigation capacity that corresponds to highest yield in both soils was 4 2 mm d as mentioned above for maize the grain sorghum yield simulated for potential yield based on optimal management is within the range of measured yield obtained in western kansas under crop performance test lamm et al 2006 obtained maximum yield at relatively higher irrigation capacity 4 8 mm d targeting optimal irrigation for a specific months july and august in northwest kansas similarly araya et al 2018 obtained slightly lower irrigation capacity 3 6 mm d for achieving a minimum targeted yield of 6 mg ha at 90 probability for a different grain sorghum genotype other source of disparity is that the irrigation scheduling model setup in this study automatically applies irrigation when minimum pasw was reached regardless of growth stage or months differences in soils genotype climate characteristics selected irrigation efficiency targeted yield and selected probability level to achieve the selected yield goal might have also contributed to these disparities furthermore in this study we have presented the minimum irrigation capacity based on optimum nitrogen that can achieve maximum yield instead of the optimal irrigation capacity based on prevailing nitrogen management practice as the focus is to save irrigation water maximum winter wheat yield between 10 and 11 mg ha was simulated at minimum irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d there was minor yield increase above 3 1 mm d but it was not that considerable araya et al 2019b reported highest yield at irrigation capacity of 5 mm d but that was not substantially different only 16 increase from that obtained at irrigation capacity of 2 5 mm d the irrigation capacities in current study are slightly higher because the yield levels goals are relatively higher due to meeting optimal management unlike the previous research the study presented here is based on automatically meeting optimal irrigation from planting to maturity previous studies presented in araya et al 2017b 2018 2019b indicated that setting minimum irrigation capacity depends on the targeted irrigable area pumping rate growth stage and yield goals in this study wheat was sensitive to irrigation triggers pasw especially there was a large variation 8 11 mg ha in wheat yield when grown under different pasw as a function of irrigation capacity for fine sandy soils this may be due to difference in the water holding capacity of the soil in which case wheat grown in fine sand low water holding capacity may require slightly shorter irrigation interval when compared to silt loam soils higher water holding capacity where relatively longer irrigation intervals are needed due to the higher water holding capacity however the difference in yield between the two soils was not substantially different when considering yield values once in two years 50 maize yield substantially increased with an increase in irrigation of up to 400 mm lamm et al 2006 conducted long term simulation study and found that maize needed on average of 375 mm per growing season for western kansas however maize yield was not substantially affected by pasw 35 for all soils pasw thresholds less than 35 decreased yields simulation studies by kisekka et al 2016 in western kansas verified that irrigation triggered by 50 pasw could enhance maize net return in western kansas other unpublished reports also found the pasw of 50 to be optimal when integrated with higher irrigation capacity 4 6 2 mm d 4 2 crop water productivity cwp crop water productivity of maize ranged between 18 and 27 kg ha mm these values are consistent with oker 2018 and araya et al 2017b the highest cwp corresponded to the shortest irrigation interval 8 d interval or highest irrigation capacity 3 1 mm d whereas the lowest cwp corresponded to the longest irrigation interval 26 d or lowest irrigation capacity 1 mm d to optimize yield maize requires an irrigation of 450 300 and 150 mm in dry normal and wet climate season of western kansas respectively araya et al 2017c yield can be optimized at seasonal crop evapotranspiration between 660 and 700 mm which may vary by soil type cultivar climatic season and planting date araya et al 2017c the cwp slightly decreased under the prevailing nitrogen management 18 24 kg ha mm although they were not substantially different from that presented for optimal nitrogen 18 27 kg ha mm several studies indicated that maize as the most sensitive cereal grain crop to water stress doorenbos and kassam 1979 cakir 2004 klocke et al 2011 2014 oker 2018 experiment on maize at tribune kansas showed that yield improved by 49 and 17 for an increase of irrigation from 127 mm to 245 mm and 245 381 mm respectively schlegel et al 2016 lamm et al 2007 reported a curvilinear relationship between irrigation water and yield although the most productive use of water is achieved by making sure that adequate soil water is available at time of tasseling and cob formation any water deficit during the maize growing period could cause substantial yield losses cakir 2004 however maize perform best if supplied with adequate nitrogen along with optimal soil water availability during the growing season paschalidis et al 2015 in addition maize water productivity increased when pasw of 55 or above was used as irrigation trigger in our study since there was no substantial difference between initiating irrigation at pasw 55 and 75 in terms of cwp applying pasw 55 would be the best strategy for saving irrigation water optimizing cost improving efficiency and productivity sharda et al 2019 reported maintaining pasw between 50 and 65 as irrigation trigger was optimal for soybean production in texas high plains the cwp for grain sorghum simulated based on no limiting nitrogen management ranged between 15 and 24 kg ha mm which is slightly larger than that simulated for grain sorghum based on prevailing nitrogen management 13 17 kg ha mm however the cwp values simulated based on prevailing nitrogen management are consistent with araya et al 2016 under optimal nitrogen management the highest cwp was simulated for irrigation interval of 6 d when initiated at psaw of 55 or above similarly under prevailing nitrogen management the highest cwp corresponded to irrigation interval of 6 d under 55 65 the difference between the two in terms of cwp was less clear but nitrogen might have partly contributed to this difference grain sorghum yield can be optimized on average at seasonal irrigation need of 150 275 mm although these irrigation requirement values could slightly vary by planting date climate cultivar and soil type araya et al 2016 water productivity of grain sorghum is consistent with other studies that reported sorghum is relatively less sensitive to irrigation water compared to maize for example in an experiment in kansas tribune grain sorghum yield increased by 19 for an increase of irrigation from 127 to 254 mm however no substantial difference in yield was observed with further additional irrigation of 127 mm over 254 mm schlegel et al 2016 this shows that grain sorghum is less responsive to irrigation when compared to maize schlegel et al 2016 in western kansas grain sorghum could produce high yield 6 mg ha with addition of only 200 mm at slightly lower than that supplied with irrigation of 350 400 mm 6 5 mg ha araya et al 2016 2017b grain sorghum yield and water productivity can be increased by diverting irrigation to reproductive growth stages targeting panicle initiation to end of grain filling araya et al 2018 reproductive stages of grain crops are more sensitive to limited water and high temperature stress prasad et al 2008 2011 2015 prasad and djanaguiraman 2014 cwp of grain sorghum was slightly higher in silt loam than fine sand soils probably due to difference in water holding capacity yield of winter wheat is highly related to crop evapotranspiration doorenbos and kassam 1979 crop evapotranspiration could vary by climate soil water availability and crop cultivar wider ranges of average wheat yield levels in us southern great plain from west 3 6 mg ha to east 6 9 mg ha were observed under dryland condition while 6 9 9 3 mg ha under field trial in well managed condition lollato et al 2017 these yield values are similar to those simulated under the prevailing nitrogen with irrigation management as presented in our study fig 8c winter wheat cwp simulated based on optimal nitrogen ranged between 18 and 21 kg ha mm which is higher than that of the cwp simulated based on prevailing practice 12 13 kg ha mm in this study wheat cwp showed consistent trend regardless of change in irrigation interval under various psaw irrigation triggers and soil types this was because the simulated yield was less responsive to irrigation when compared to maize the range of values simulated based on prevailing nitrogen management under irrigation condition are close to that reported in araya et al 2019b however wheat is grown under non irrigated condition in many areas of southern great plain lollato et al 2017 and in southwest kansas the cwp of wheat could increase or decrease depending on the management and climate conditions water productivity of wheat yield per water supply ranging from 15 to 18 kg ha mm was reported by lollato et al 2017 average long term continuous winter wheat yield supplied with 200 250 and 300 mm irrigation was simulated to produce 6 4 7 1 and 8 2 mg ha araya et al 2017b response of wheat to growth stage based irrigation water allocation was evaluated and found better cwp when irrigation is applied at booting and heading araya et al 2017a 4 3 economic performance yield has a direct impact on the economic performance of the crops accordingly the highest average ravc for maize corresponded to the highest yield likewise highest maize yield 17 mg ha and ravc 700 ha corresponded to irrigation capacity of 4 2 and 6 3 mm d for silt loam and fine sand soils respectively in another study araya et al 2019a obtained a slightly lower average ravc value 534 ha for a relatively lower 13 mg ha maize yield the disparity was perhaps due to the difference in irrigation techniques fixed automatic irrigation applied after meeting certain soil water thresholds and consideration of optimal nitrogen throughout the growing season compared to the previous study which was set based on prevailing practice in addition unlike the current study no further evaluation was carried out beyond irrigation capacity of 5 mm d in araya et al 2019a which could have resulted in different yields and ravc values for grain sorghum the highest average yield in the current study was at irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d however in silt loam soils the ravc value 180 200 ha for irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d was not substantially different from that of 2 1 2 5 mm d 180 190 ha the ranges of irrigation capacity values for the highest average yield were similar to that obtained in araya et al 2018 araya et al 2018 estimated grain sorghum yield of 6 mg ha in 3 out of 4 years at irrigation capacity of 3 6 mm d however when ravc values are used as evaluating criteria for setting irrigation scheduling there was no substantial difference in ravc between the highest 12 mm d and lowest irrigation capacity 1 mm d this shows grain sorghum may not generate substantially higher profit if grown under non limiting irrigation when compared to that limited irrigation lamm et al 2006 reported that dryland grain sorghum is more profitable compared to irrigated for winter wheat ravc value ranged between 350 370 ha and 310 367 ha for silt loam and fine sand soils respectively these ranges are not significantly different although applied irrigation may range from 50 to 350 mm under the various irrigation capacities in the current study yield increased with irrigation and peaked at 200 225 mm that corresponded to 2 5 mm d which is close to those reported in araya et al 2019b our study assumes that yield limiting factors do not exist except for water where irrigation application was designed in fixed automatic application mode after meeting certain plant available soil water for this reason yield and ravc values are higher than those reported values in araya et al 2019a in addition in the current study the ravc values were not substantially different across the irrigation capacities growing winter wheat under deficit irrigation could be the best strategy deficit irrigation strategy by growth stage depending on climate conditions as presented on araya et al 2017a may be a better strategy 4 4 limitations of the study cost of irrigation that includes cost of gas fuel oil and more presented in the https www agmanager info kfma enterprise reports is in terms of cost per bushel or cost per acre not in terms of cost per irrigation event while summarizing cost estimates in this way is helpful using cost factor per bushel for different irrigations scenario may affect the accuracy of the analysis in determining optimal irrigation based on economic performances especially for crops that are less responsive to irrigation average cost of irrigation per bushel can also underestimate costs of irrigation to those treatments with relatively higher irrigation applications frequent and shorter irrigation intervals and overestimate to those treatments with lower irrigation treatments less frequent and longer irrigation intervals in this study some of the simulation scenarios have limited practical implementation value under the prevalent irrigation practice for example extremely high irrigation capacity 12 5 mm d is not common under the present irrigation practice but is presented to demonstrate how increase in irrigation would affect yield and to show the implication of applying high irrigation in terms of water use water productivity and profitability for the different crop the simulation study focuses on achieving maximum yield and ravc based on selected irrigation scheduling option considering optimal agronomic management which could be valuable only for producers that operate based on precision agriculture technologies under present conditions for example the crops yielded high when the model was set to optimal n and non limiting environmental conditions no frost hail pest disease and weed which may not be the case under the majority of prevailing practice or conditions with the adoption and expansion of precision agriculture technology we assume that irrigation scheduling technology cropping systems and agronomic management practice might change however this work could also provide important information to producers that follow prevalent irrigation practice in addition continuous cropping for several years may not represent the current and future crop production system difference in cultivar characteristics may also cause difference in terms of irrigation water use and yield trade and federal agricultural policies in terms of incentives and insurance premiums may also affect the crop type to be planted which could influence the supply and demand and hence affect the price of product overall the work presented in this study based on combination of secondary data and modeling study is simplification of scenarios that explores options for optimizing irrigation while achieving targeted goals such as yield economic performance and water productivity not all the presented scenarios should necessarily fit in one farm as each of the scenarios may require specific suitable condition depending on many factors however such analysis could guide producers to take informed decisions considering available resources and targeted goal with some limitation it provides guidance for optimizing yield water use and income under the present and future water use it also allows producers to identify the most suitable irrigation strategy for sustainable income crop productivity and management of ground water and the environment 5 conclusions the optimal irrigation scheduling considering fixed depth of 25 mm per irrigation event based on yield for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat was 4 2 6 3 3 1 4 2 and 2 5 3 1 mm d respectively the lowest and highest values in the range corresponded to silt loam and fine sand soils respectively the maximum yield for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat were simulated at ranges of 400 450 300 325 and 200 225 mm respectively both pasw and irrigation intervals significantly affected grain sorghum and winter wheat yields depending on soil type highest ravc for potential maize grain sorghum and winter wheat yields were estimated to be 630 710 ha 150 200 ha and 310 370 ha respectively there was a small variation in ravc among soil types for maize irrigation strategy for higher ravc values is not different from irrigation strategy for higher yield and cwp cwp of maize peaked at 4 8 d interval 25 mm 4 8 d in contrast for grain sorghum and winter wheat irrigation strategy for higher ravc values is different from irrigation strategy for higher yield for example there was no substantial difference between highest and lowest irrigation in terms of ravc for wheat and grain sorghum which means only limited irrigation might be needed to meet higher ravc however the difference was that highest cwp of grain sorghum was attained at relatively higher irrigation capacity 4 6 mm d whereas there was no substantial difference in wheat cwp between the lowest and highest irrigation capacity implying that winter wheat is productive under limited irrigation although crop rotation systems are commonly practiced in the region the current study is limited only to continuous cropping system for major crops grown in western kansas future research should include rotation cropping systems majority of the work is also limited to non limiting conditions except for water this may not be the case under the prevailing conditions as there could be other yield limiting factors such as pests weeds nutrient deficiencies and other factors the presented information however can be used as a guide to estimate the economic benefits of optimal irrigation scheduling along with economic performances for crops grown under non limited conditions except water the presented results do not take into consideration the future changes to market conditions improvements in cultivar characteristics occurrence of extreme weather events e g drought flooding heat cold or frost limitation from other soil nutrients or adverse changes in crop management practices this study guides producers to identify and prioritize the most suitable irrigation strategy for optimizing yield cwp and or income while enhancing sustainability of environment and management of ground water

bicolor l moench yield crop water productivity cwp and return after variable cost ravc under different combinations of irrigation interval capacity and plant available soil water pasw thresholds on three soil types in southwestern kansas maize grain sorghum and winter wheat yields were maximized under irrigation capacity of 4 2 6 3 3 1 4 2 and 2 5 3 1 mm d respectively the lowest and highest values in the range corresponded to silt loam and fine sand soils respectively for maize maximum ravc 630 710 ha and cwp 25 27 kg ha mm were achieved with a relatively shorter irrigation interval 25 mm 4 8 d ravc values for grain sorghum and winter wheat were not substantially affected by irrigation interval the ravc for grain sorghum and winter wheat ranged from 150 to 200 ha and 310 to 370 ha respectively the cwp of grain sorghum peaked at shorter irrigation interval 25 mm 6 8 d whereas high cwp of wheat was simulated even at longer irrigation interval 25 mm 26 d overall for winter wheat and grain sorghum irrigation strategy for attaining higher ravc values is different from irrigation strategy for attaining higher yield whereas for maize irrigation strategy for higher yield is the same as that irrigation strategy for higher ravc this study guides producers to identify and prioritize the most suitable irrigation strategy for optimizing yield cwp and or income while enhancing sustainability of environment and management of ground water the present work assumes all factors except water are optimal and findings are sensitive to dynamics of price changes productivity levels and variations in crop management and climate keywords maize grain sorghum winter wheat dssat irrigation water management ogallala 1 introduction the ogallala aquifer is a shallow water table aquifer and utilized for irrigated agriculture in the great plains region of the united states the aquifer stretches over eight states and covers an area of about 450 000 km2 dail 2015 the withdrawal of irrigation water from the aquifer exceeds the rate of recharge and the aquifer will deplete in a few decades unless managed efficiently buchanan et al 2009 mcguire 2012 scanlon et al 2012 haacker et al 2016 at present many of the wells in major parts of western kansas have failed the minimum discharge rate to meet the evapotranspiration needs of crops for optimal production therefore there has been a significant push from policymakers across the ogallala aquifer for sustainable use of water and extending the life span of the aquafer while enhancing crop productivity and profitability peterson et al 2003 improving irrigation water application and water management for crop production could contribute to the sustainable use of water and extend the economic life of the aquifer many studies exist on quantifying irrigation water requirements based on cropping systems current irrigation technology and irrigation practices lamm et al 2006 rogers and lamm 2012 klocke et al 2014 kisekka et al 2016 however crop production systems and producers are dynamic and may adjust to changing biophysical and socioeconomic conditions many producers change their management over time depending on cropping systems available resources skill and economic capabilities precision farming technology is changing the agriculture industry in a way that optimal yield is met based on the variable inputs considering heterogeneity within fields in water limited areas irrigation water management requires improved understanding and robust evaluation of the crop soil water and climate relations and economic performances irrigation water requirement and scheduling could differ by soil type and water holding capacities in addition different seasons could differ in onset cessation distribution and amount of rainfall that affects irrigation scheduling studying how irrigation scheduling affects crop yield crop water productivity cwp and profits based on long term climate under different soil types could contribute to improving crop yields and economic returns in this paper we answer several key questions what would be the crop production scenario if all production inputs except water were non liming during any part of growing season what is the yield and cwp maximizing strategy based on combination of irrigation capacity interval and plant available soil water pasw irrigation thresholds for some of the major crops in the region under different soil types what maximum levels of yield and income could be obtained from irrigation water management practices what is the optimal irrigation water management from the perspectives of yield cwp and return after variable cost ravc assessing all combinations of irrigation intervals and plant available soil water pasw thresholds under conventional field experiment is costly and time consuming results based on conventional field experiment may give accurate representation for a specific site and a specific season but may not give accurate representation of the relationships for multiple sites and seasons crop simulation models can be calibrated and evaluated using short experimental data to simulate for multiple seasons and locations jones et al 2003 boote et al 2010 kisekka et al 2016 araya et al 2017a 2017b 2017c in this study we used the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer cropping

located in finney county garden city southwestern kansas lat 38 01 20 87 n and long 100 49 26 95 w with an elevation of 887 m above mean sea level the major crops in the study site were maize winter wheat and grain sorghum ulysses silt loam valent fine sand and richfield silt loam soils are the major soils in the area rouhi rad et al 2020b the wilting point for ulysses silt loam richfield silt

recommendation based on organic matter content of the soils by crop type and yield goal is presented in leikam et al 2003 overall the soil is considered suitable for optimizing crop production with application of fertilizer based on leikam et al 2003 and foster et al 2017 the long term mean annual rainfall 1981 2010 for finney county garden city was about 488 mm fig 1a the highest and lowest average daily temperature occurred in july 25 5 ºc and january 0 95 ºc respectively the average long term 1981 2010 maximum and minimum temperature for the study site is presented in fig 1b 2 2 model

limit is considered as drainage while runoff are estimated based on curve number method williams 1991 ritchie et al 1998 drainage is limited by saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil hoogenboom

atmosphere sub module ritchie et al 1998 jones et al 2003 root water uptake is estimated based on ritchie 1998 the actual transpiration is a function of root water uptake which also determines the rate of photo assimilation hoogenboom et al 2019 2 3 model setup and irrigation scheduling the dssat family crop models ceres maize cropsim ceres and ceres sorghum jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2017 2019 were calibrated and validated for the selected maize grain sorghum and winter wheat genotypes in prior studies by araya et al 2017b 2018 the genetic coefficients used for the selected crop genotypes in this study are presented in table 1 the crops were set in the model on seasonal continuous cropping system mode not in sequential system and thus the same crop was grown continuously once each year over the long term period 1981 2010 accordingly the model was set to plant maize grain sorghum and winter wheat every year on may 10 may 15 and oct 10 respectively on separate independent fields the harvesting date of the corresponding crops slightly varied depending on climatic condition over the long term seasons the estimated harvesting dates based on the model were oct 10 30 for maize sep 1 15 for grain sorghum and may 20 to jun 15 for winter wheat which are within the ranges of harvesting time of the three crops in the study areas similarly the suggested planting dates are within the range recommended in kansas kansas crop planting guide https bookstore ksre ksu edu pubs l818 pdf the plant density for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat were 7 6 18 and 250 plants m2 respectively the model default priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 and the suleiman ritchie method ritchie et al 2009 were used for estimating evapotranspiration and soil evaporation jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 the pasw is estimated from the status of the actual available soil water relative to the maximum that the soil can hold at field capacity expressed in percentage soil organic matter and nitrogen dynamics were simulated based on godwin and singh 1998 given that the focus of our study is on the effect of irrigation management on productivity and returns the crops were grown under optimal or non limiting management conditions that include nitrogen fertilizer nutrients and pests and diseases except water the options in the model was set as non limiting except for water however for demonstration scenario analysis purposes we have also briefly presented based on prevalent management practices for one of the selected soils valent fine sand soils at finney county garden city southwestern kansas accordingly the model was set with nitrogen management based on practice for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat in western kansas as 250 kg n ha 150 kg n ha and 100 kg n ha respectively for maize and grain sorghum all the nitrogen fertilizer was applied at once five days before planting whereas for winter wheat a total amount of 14 kg n ha was applied on date of planting oct 10 each year and the other 86 kg n ha was applied around mid of april based on the prevailing practice the irrigation scheduling treatments implemented in the non limiting hereafter optimal nitrogen management described below were also implemented for crops treated with prevalent management practice yield and crop water productivities simulated under both scenarios were plotted and discussed in addition long term 2008 2019 measured crop performance yield data of maize grain sorghum and winter wheat was obtained from kansas state university performance trial website https www agronomy k state edu services crop performance tests the crops were grown under similar climate and nearly optimal crop management condition however some of the years with relatively low yield performance was left out due to suspect of external yield reducing factors or inappropriate management conditions while some of the years were missing because they were reported abandoned by the researchers the average yields of the crop performance test data was considered in this study as observational data for comparisons purpose sprinkler irrigation was set in the model in an automatic mode with fixed amount 25 mm and irrigation efficiency of 0 85 rouhi rad et al 2020a according to the prevailing practice most producers in southwestern kansas apply 25 mm irrigation depth per irrigation event rouhi rad et al 2020a and typical irrigation application efficiency for sprinkler irrigation in well managed field is estimated to be 0 75 0 85 irmak et al 2011 there were six plant available soil water pasw 25 35 45 55 65 and 75 and 13 irrigation intervals 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 and 26 d with a total of 78 irrigation treatment combinations the irrigation interval and pasw treatment combinations were implemented on three different crops maize grain sorghum and winter wheat each of the crop types were planted in a continuous system on three different soil types ulysses silt loam richfield silt loam and valent fine sand over 30 years 1981 2010 period the irrigation interval rules in the model come into effect only after the pasw was triggered producers might select any of the pasw irrigation trigger thresholds and irrigation interval combinations depending on climate soil and crop type well capacity and or irrigation method etc for example in practical sense setting the model based on pasw 75 at 6 d interval would mean the center pivot should start irrigating when pasw is slightly below 75 and irrigation depth of 25 mm must be applied within six days so that to continuously keep the pasw above 75 the center pivot will continue applying irrigation 24 h a day until the pasw threshold level is above 75 in the model irrigation interval can be translated into irrigation capacity when amount of irrigation applied per irrigation event 25 mm is divided by irrigation interval lamm et al 2006 2007 araya et al 2019b the model was run to simulate the irrigation applied crop evapotranspiration yield and other yield components under the given irrigation scheduling treatment the relationship of yield with pasw irrigation interval and irrigation capacity was presented for each crop for the different soils this analysis represents a theoretical crop production scenario to demonstrate how changes in irrigation scheduling and plant available soil water affect yield under different soil types this analysis can provide some insight into the relationships between pasw and irrigation interval and crop yields the relationship between average long term yield and irrigation were presented only for silt loam soils crop water productivity was calculated for each crop by soil type and irrigation treatments as simulated yield divided by the seasonal sum of crop evapotranspiration the cwp was used to evaluate the suitability of irrigation scheduling strategy based on each treatment return after variable cost ravc was calculated to evaluate the suitability of the scenario economically the information on ravc was obtained from kansas farm management association as documented on the kansas state university agmanager website https www agmanager info kfma enterprise reports for the period from 1995 to 2016 the ravc was calculated as presented in araya et al 2019a ravc is estimated as gross income minus variable cost the variable cost typically includes labor machinery repairs interest paid input expenses such as seeds herbicide insecticide fertilizer lime machinery rentals lease and other variable costs the difference from araya et al 2019a is that irrigation scheduling in this study was set to fixed automatic irrigation based on the specified interval when certain level of pasw was met in araya et al 2019a scheduling was set as fixed irrigation regardless of climate variability and pasw which was a simplifying assumption the second difference from araya et al 2019a is that nitrogen application was set in the model always to meet optimal requirement of the crop at any growth stage of the crop whereas this was not the case in araya et al 2019a where nitrogen application was fixed based on prevailing practices in addition unlike in araya et al 2019a which presented 64 years average values the 25 50 and 75 probability of exceedance of ravc value per hectare for 30 years period 1980 2010 are presented in this study 3 results 3 1 yield irrigation interval irrigation capacity pasw and their relationships this study showed that maize yield is highly sensitive to irrigation capacity or irrigation interval maize yield under the various irrigation capacities interval varied by at least 8 mg ha the lowest yield 9 mg ha was simulated for the lowest irrigation capacity 1 mm d or longest irrigation interval 26 d the highest yield 17 5 mg ha was simulated for the relatively higher irrigation capacity 4 2 6 3 mm d or shorter irrigation interval 4 6 d depending on soil type selected fig 2a c the model showed that maize was relatively more sensitive to irrigation capacity under fine sand than under silt loam fig 2a c in addition maize was relatively sensitive to irrigation capacity and irrigation interval compared to pasw fig 2a f for maize treated with optimal nitrogen management there were no substantial differences in terms of yield among maize treated with similar irrigation capacities under different pasw thresholds above 45 fig 2d f this shows that maize yield can be optimized with pasw thresholds above 45 as long as higher irrigation capacities up to 4 2 mm d are used however maize yield can substantially reduce when treated with pasw of 35 or below fig 2d f it should be noted that the variability in crop yield was higher under fine sandy soils fig 2f compared to silt loam soils fig 2d and e the yield response of grain sorghum to irrigation capacity interval varied by genotypic characteristics soils and n management not shown the grain sorghum genotype presented in this study was responsive to irrigation the average grain sorghum yield for one in two year could exceed 8 and 10 mg ha for irrigation capacity of 2 5 and 4 2 mm d respectively under 50 pasw or above fig 3a c however the increase in yield above 4 2 mm d was not substantial the lowest irrigation capacity 1 mm d generated the lowest yield 5 5 mg ha grain sorghum yield decreased substantially in silt loam soils when grown below pasw of 45 as a threshold for initiating irrigation fig 3a e however grain sorghum yield improved substantially when grown with a pasw of above 45 and yield increased with an increase in pasw there was also a substantial increase in yield under fine sand soils when irrigation trigger was set at pasw of 75 fig 3c and f in this case irrigating grain sorghum in 6 d intervals with an irrigation depth of 25 mm under irrigation trigger of 45 could produce a greater yield grain sorghum suffered from yield loss when grown below pasw of 45 winter wheat yield varied with irrigation capacity fig 4a c the minimum irrigation capacity for maximum yield on both silt loam and fine sand soils was approximately between 2 1 and 3 1 mm d depending the irrigation trigger the maximum yield ranged between 10 and 11 mg ha at high irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d for pasw of above 45 although there was a slight change yield did not substantially increase at irrigation capacity above this level the lowest wheat yield was simulated for the lowest pasw threshold 25 yield substantially improved with an increase in pasw thresholds however in silt loam soils fig 4d and e yield peaked at the threshold of 45 or above for irrigation interval of 8 d whereas yield improved at a slower rate as pasw increased from 45 to 75 on the contrary on fine sandy soils yield increased substantially with increase in pasw thresholds with highest yield at 75 pasw fig 4f for maize irrigation amount was more influenced by irrigation interval and less influenced by pasw thresholds fig 5a maize yield increased with the amount of irrigation fig 5b almost all irrigations based on different pasw triggers had similar trend in terms of yield irrigation relations fig 5b there was a curvilinear relationship between the amount of irrigation and maize yield fig 5b the lowest and highest irrigation amounts were 100 and 450 mm which corresponded to yield of 9 and 17 5 mg ha respectively fig 5b irrigation for grain sorghum was substantially influenced by pasw thresholds and irrigation interval fig 5c irrigation increased with a decrease in irrigation frequency fig 5c grain sorghum yield increased with an increase in the amount of irrigation fig 5d the yield was maximum at approximately 300 mm after which yield did not increase with further increase in irrigation the lowest yield 6 mg ha corresponded to the lowest irrigation amount 100 mm fig 5d irrigation requirement for wheat was substantially affected by pasw thresholds and irrigation interval fig 5e the lowest winter wheat yield was simulated at irrigation of 100 mm fig 5f winter wheat yield was maximized 11 mg ha at irrigation levels of 200 225 mm fig 5f the relationship between winter wheat yield and irrigation was curvilinear a declining increase in yield with an increase in irrigation and remains flat after some level comparing winter wheat and grain sorghum the yield response of grain sorghum and winter wheat to changes in pasw was similar for all soil types although the pattern was slightly different yield increased with an increase in pasw it was relatively steeper for winter wheat and it was less responsive to irrigation capacity at 25 pasw similarly grain sorghum was also less responsive to irrigation capacity at 25 pasw for both grain sorghum and winter wheat yield increased with an increase in pasw threshold and maximized at pasw above 55 long term 2008 2019 crop performance data for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat under nearly optimal management conditions in western kansas are shown in fig 6a c in some of the years the presented data showed that yield of maize grain sorghum and wheat under nearly optimal management condition could reach up to 18 13 and 8 mg ha respectively the crop performance yield data presented in this study for maize and grain sorghum in fig 6a and b closely matched with the simulated data for optimal management in this study figs 3 and 4 particularly for irrigation capacity 4 2 6 3 mm d 3 2 crop water productivity crop water productivity of maize under optimal nitrogen management peaked at 25 5 26 5 kg ha mm for all soils at irrigation interval of 2 8 d under all pasw irrigation triggers fig 7a c maize was more productive at irrigation trigger above pasw 45 fig 7a c the cwp of maize quickly declined under all pasw irrigation triggers and reached low level at 26 d interval under pasw of 25 fig 7a c cwp for grain sorghum ranged from 15 to 24 kg ha mm where cwp trends varied by irrigation interval and pasw irrigation triggers fig 7d f in all three soils cwp for grain sorghum increased 24 kg ha mm at irrigation interval of 6 d under irrigation trigger pasw 55 or above whereas the lowest was simulated 15 kg ha mm for pasw 25 fig 7d f winter wheat cwp ranged between 18 and 21 kg ha mm fig 7g i for winter wheat cwp trend is more uniform and consistent across various ranges of irrigation interval and psaw irrigation triggers and soil types however cwp by soil type for psaw 75 was low in silt loam fig 7g and h while slightly improved in fine sand fig 7i the lowest cwp was simulated for psaw 25 while the highest was for psaw 45 55 3 3 yield irrigation interval irrigation capacity pasw cwp and their relationships the relationship between yield and irrigation capacity and irrigation interval under different pasw for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat with prevalent nitrogen management 250 kg n ha on valent fine sand is presented in fig 8a d maize yield was substantially affected by change in nitrogen management fig 2a d vs fig 8a and d the maximum maize yield 16 mg ha was obtained under irrigation capacity of 6 3 mm d similarly maximum maize yield of 14 mg ha was simulated for silt loam under prevalent nitrogen management not shown these values were substantially lower than the yield simulated for optimal nitrogen management the lowest yield was not substantially affected by the change in nitrogen management like for optimal nitrogen management maize yield was more affected by irrigation capacity when compared to pasw thresholds increasing pasw irrigation triggers did not increase maize substantially when irrigation interval of more than 12 d was used fig 8d decreasing irrigation interval up to 4 d substantially increased maize yield the rate of yield increase substantially improved when pasw was increased from 25 to 75 under shorter irrigation interval 12 d fig 8d grain sorghum yield was substantially affected by change in nitrogen management fig 3c vs fig 8b and e yield substantially reduced under the prevailing 150 kg n ha nitrogen management practice fig 7b and e however like for optimal nitrogen management grain sorghum yield substantially increased with increase in irrigation capacity and pasw irrigation trigger the highest yield was simulated for pasw 65 under irrigation capacity of 4 2 mm d beyond which yield did not substantially increase simulated winter wheat yield substantially decreased under the prevailing nitrogen 100 kg n ha management 5 7 5 mg ha fig 8c and f when compared to that simulated under the optimal nitrogen management 7 11 mg ha fig 4e and f winter wheat yield increased with increase in irrigation capacity of up to 3 1 mm d and pasw of 55 beyond which yield did not substantially increased the crop performance test yield data for winter wheat closely matched with that simulated for prevalent management conditions presented in this study figs 6c and 8c and f crop water productivity for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat under the prevailing nitrogen management conditions ranged between 18 and 24 13 and 17 and 12 and 13 kg ha mm fig 8g i the highest cwp for maize sorghum and winter wheat was simulated at irrigation interval of 4 6 d 2 8 d and 2 26 d respectively all crops responded well when irrigation was initiated under pasw 55 65 the lowest cwp corresponded to psaw 25 there was no substantial difference in cwp between the longest 26 d and shortest 2 d irrigation interval for winter wheat implying that winter wheat can be productive under limited irrigation condition 3 4 the relationship between return after variable cost ravc and irrigation interval the average ravc for maize increased up to irrigation interval of 8 d and irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d there was a slight increase in ravc above irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d although it was not that substantial fig 9a c the average ravc varied by irrigation interval and by soil types fig 9a c with relatively higher and lower ravc under silt loam 600 710 ha and fine sand soils 400 700 ha respectively the shortest irrigation interval 2 8 d interval corresponded to approximately 630 710 ha and the longest irrigation interval 26 d corresponded to 400 500 ha the highest and lowest ravc corresponded to silt loam and fine sand respectively the 25 probabilities of exceedance for ravc also substantially increased with an increase in irrigation capacity up to 3 1 mm d or irrigation interval of 8 d it shows that optimal ravc for maize corresponds to 8 d irrigation interval which is different from the optimal irrigation interval for maximum maize yield for grain sorghum there was a small difference in ravc among the irrigation interval with an average range of 180 200 and 150 180 ha for silt loam and fine sand respectively fig 10a f these values corresponded to ranges of irrigation interval between 8 and 10 d irrigation capacity 2 5 3 1 mm d however when considering average 50 ravc values they were not substantially different from ravc values obtained based on longest irrigation interval the ravc values were also substantially different when considering one in four years 25 probability fig 10a f the maximum ravc value for grain sorghum did not correspond to the maximum irrigation capacity for maximum yield indicating lowest irrigated grain sorghum generates income as much as that of those with irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d the average ravc values for winter wheat ranged between 350 370 and 310 367 ha respectively for silt loam and fine sand the highest and lowest in both ranges corresponded to the shortest 2 4 d and longest 24 26 d irrigation intervals respectively fig 11a f however the difference between the highest and lowest ravc values simulated based on the shortest and longest irrigation intervals was not substantially different this can be further demonstrated when considering the ravc values in 1 out of 2 years 50 probability of exceedance level or 1 out of 4 years 25 probability of exceedance level fig 11a f this shows growing wheat based on the longest irrigation interval or under lower irrigation capacity might be appropriate 4 discussion 4 1 yield and irrigation maize yield increased with irrigation capacity up to 4 2 mm d in silt loam soils and 6 3 mm d in fine sand soils araya et al 2019a simulated maximum yield at irrigation capacity of 5 mm d for southwestern kansas which is in the range of values simulated in this study lamm et al 2007 estimated gross irrigation capacity of 6 4 mm d to meet a maximum maize yield for northwestern kansas also in the range of values obtained in this study in fine sand soils there was curve linear relationship between yield and irrigation capacity likewise lamm et al 2006 obtained a similar curve linear relationship between yield and irrigation capacity for maize in northwest kansas oker 2018 conducted an experiment in southwestern kansas near garden city during the 2016 and 2017 season obtaining a maize yield in the range of 12 13 13 14 and 13 15 mg ha in silt loam soils under irrigation capacity of 1 6 3 1 and 6 2 mm d respectively the yield values based on irrigation capacities of 3 1 and 6 2 mm d are slightly lower than our simulated yields for the corresponding irrigation capacities the yield value for irrigation capacity of 1 6 mm d in oker 2018 was close to our yield values obtained under pasw of 25 the yield values in most of our simulation treatments were slightly higher than the measured experimental yields at the study site because our simulation assumptions were set for optimal management conditions such as optimal nitrogen free of weeds insect pests and other weather hazards including hail and frost however these experimental yield values presented in oker 2018 were within the ranges of the simulated values based on prevailing n management briefly demonstrated in this study as well as those in prior studies presented in araya et al 2017b 2018 2019a 2019b long term 2008 2019 maize yield based on crop performance test conducted under nearly optimal condition https www agronomy k state edu services crop performance tests in western kansas showed similar yield 9 18 mg ha as that simulated in our study for optimal management similarly maize yield simulated for potential production in this study is within the range of yield presented for sprinkler irrigation under nearly optimal management condition in the western corn belt 9 17 2 mg ha sadras et al 2015 grain sorghum yield increased with irrigation capacity up to certain level in this study the minimum irrigation capacity to meet a yield of 9 mg ha at 50 pasw in both silt loam and fine sand in this study was 2 5 3 1 mm d which is consistent with previous study as presented in araya et al 2018 however there was a tendency of increase in yield with increase in pasw and decrease in irrigation interval due to difference in cultivar characteristics and assumptions used in the model such as meeting optimal nitrogen conditions throughout the growing period the grain sorghum genotype used in this study is relatively sensitive to initial pasw when compared to the one presented in araya et al 2017b in this study the irrigation capacity that corresponds to highest yield in both soils was 4 2 mm d as mentioned above for maize the grain sorghum yield simulated for potential yield based on optimal management is within the range of measured yield obtained in western kansas under crop performance test lamm et al 2006 obtained maximum yield at relatively higher irrigation capacity 4 8 mm d targeting optimal irrigation for a specific months july and august in northwest kansas similarly araya et al 2018 obtained slightly lower irrigation capacity 3 6 mm d for achieving a minimum targeted yield of 6 mg ha at 90 probability for a different grain sorghum genotype other source of disparity is that the irrigation scheduling model setup in this study automatically applies irrigation when minimum pasw was reached regardless of growth stage or months differences in soils genotype climate characteristics selected irrigation efficiency targeted yield and selected probability level to achieve the selected yield goal might have also contributed to these disparities furthermore in this study we have presented the minimum irrigation capacity based on optimum nitrogen that can achieve maximum yield instead of the optimal irrigation capacity based on prevailing nitrogen management practice as the focus is to save irrigation water maximum winter wheat yield between 10 and 11 mg ha was simulated at minimum irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d there was minor yield increase above 3 1 mm d but it was not that considerable araya et al 2019b reported highest yield at irrigation capacity of 5 mm d but that was not substantially different only 16 increase from that obtained at irrigation capacity of 2 5 mm d the irrigation capacities in current study are slightly higher because the yield levels goals are relatively higher due to meeting optimal management unlike the previous research the study presented here is based on automatically meeting optimal irrigation from planting to maturity previous studies presented in araya et al 2017b 2018 2019b indicated that setting minimum irrigation capacity depends on the targeted irrigable area pumping rate growth stage and yield goals in this study wheat was sensitive to irrigation triggers pasw especially there was a large variation 8 11 mg ha in wheat yield when grown under different pasw as a function of irrigation capacity for fine sandy soils this may be due to difference in the water holding capacity of the soil in which case wheat grown in fine sand low water holding capacity may require slightly shorter irrigation interval when compared to silt loam soils higher water holding capacity where relatively longer irrigation intervals are needed due to the higher water holding capacity however the difference in yield between the two soils was not substantially different when considering yield values once in two years 50 maize yield substantially increased with an increase in irrigation of up to 400 mm lamm et al 2006 conducted long term simulation study and found that maize needed on average of 375 mm per growing season for western kansas however maize yield was not substantially affected by pasw 35 for all soils pasw thresholds less than 35 decreased yields simulation studies by kisekka et al 2016 in western kansas verified that irrigation triggered by 50 pasw could enhance maize net return in western kansas other unpublished reports also found the pasw of 50 to be optimal when integrated with higher irrigation capacity 4 6 2 mm d 4 2 crop water productivity cwp crop water productivity of maize ranged between 18 and 27 kg ha mm these values are consistent with oker 2018 and araya et al 2017b the highest cwp corresponded to the shortest irrigation interval 8 d interval or highest irrigation capacity 3 1 mm d whereas the lowest cwp corresponded to the longest irrigation interval 26 d or lowest irrigation capacity 1 mm d to optimize yield maize requires an irrigation of 450 300 and 150 mm in dry normal and wet climate season of western kansas respectively araya et al 2017c yield can be optimized at seasonal crop evapotranspiration between 660 and 700 mm which may vary by soil type cultivar climatic season and planting date araya et al 2017c the cwp slightly decreased under the prevailing nitrogen management 18 24 kg ha mm although they were not substantially different from that presented for optimal nitrogen 18 27 kg ha mm several studies indicated that maize as the most sensitive cereal grain crop to water stress doorenbos and kassam 1979 cakir 2004 klocke et al 2011 2014 oker 2018 experiment on maize at tribune kansas showed that yield improved by 49 and 17 for an increase of irrigation from 127 mm to 245 mm and 245 381 mm respectively schlegel et al 2016 lamm et al 2007 reported a curvilinear relationship between irrigation water and yield although the most productive use of water is achieved by making sure that adequate soil water is available at time of tasseling and cob formation any water deficit during the maize growing period could cause substantial yield losses cakir 2004 however maize perform best if supplied with adequate nitrogen along with optimal soil water availability during the growing season paschalidis et al 2015 in addition maize water productivity increased when pasw of 55 or above was used as irrigation trigger in our study since there was no substantial difference between initiating irrigation at pasw 55 and 75 in terms of cwp applying pasw 55 would be the best strategy for saving irrigation water optimizing cost improving efficiency and productivity sharda et al 2019 reported maintaining pasw between 50 and 65 as irrigation trigger was optimal for soybean production in texas high plains the cwp for grain sorghum simulated based on no limiting nitrogen management ranged between 15 and 24 kg ha mm which is slightly larger than that simulated for grain sorghum based on prevailing nitrogen management 13 17 kg ha mm however the cwp values simulated based on prevailing nitrogen management are consistent with araya et al 2016 under optimal nitrogen management the highest cwp was simulated for irrigation interval of 6 d when initiated at psaw of 55 or above similarly under prevailing nitrogen management the highest cwp corresponded to irrigation interval of 6 d under 55 65 the difference between the two in terms of cwp was less clear but nitrogen might have partly contributed to this difference grain sorghum yield can be optimized on average at seasonal irrigation need of 150 275 mm although these irrigation requirement values could slightly vary by planting date climate cultivar and soil type araya et al 2016 water productivity of grain sorghum is consistent with other studies that reported sorghum is relatively less sensitive to irrigation water compared to maize for example in an experiment in kansas tribune grain sorghum yield increased by 19 for an increase of irrigation from 127 to 254 mm however no substantial difference in yield was observed with further additional irrigation of 127 mm over 254 mm schlegel et al 2016 this shows that grain sorghum is less responsive to irrigation when compared to maize schlegel et al 2016 in western kansas grain sorghum could produce high yield 6 mg ha with addition of only 200 mm at slightly lower than that supplied with irrigation of 350 400 mm 6 5 mg ha araya et al 2016 2017b grain sorghum yield and water productivity can be increased by diverting irrigation to reproductive growth stages targeting panicle initiation to end of grain filling araya et al 2018 reproductive stages of grain crops are more sensitive to limited water and high temperature stress prasad et al 2008 2011 2015 prasad and djanaguiraman 2014 cwp of grain sorghum was slightly higher in silt loam than fine sand soils probably due to difference in water holding capacity yield of winter wheat is highly related to crop evapotranspiration doorenbos and kassam 1979 crop evapotranspiration could vary by climate soil water availability and crop cultivar wider ranges of average wheat yield levels in us southern great plain from west 3 6 mg ha to east 6 9 mg ha were observed under dryland condition while 6 9 9 3 mg ha under field trial in well managed condition lollato et al 2017 these yield values are similar to those simulated under the prevailing nitrogen with irrigation management as presented in our study fig 8c winter wheat cwp simulated based on optimal nitrogen ranged between 18 and 21 kg ha mm which is higher than that of the cwp simulated based on prevailing practice 12 13 kg ha mm in this study wheat cwp showed consistent trend regardless of change in irrigation interval under various psaw irrigation triggers and soil types this was because the simulated yield was less responsive to irrigation when compared to maize the range of values simulated based on prevailing nitrogen management under irrigation condition are close to that reported in araya et al 2019b however wheat is grown under non irrigated condition in many areas of southern great plain lollato et al 2017 and in southwest kansas the cwp of wheat could increase or decrease depending on the management and climate conditions water productivity of wheat yield per water supply ranging from 15 to 18 kg ha mm was reported by lollato et al 2017 average long term continuous winter wheat yield supplied with 200 250 and 300 mm irrigation was simulated to produce 6 4 7 1 and 8 2 mg ha araya et al 2017b response of wheat to growth stage based irrigation water allocation was evaluated and found better cwp when irrigation is applied at booting and heading araya et al 2017a 4 3 economic performance yield has a direct impact on the economic performance of the crops accordingly the highest average ravc for maize corresponded to the highest yield likewise highest maize yield 17 mg ha and ravc 700 ha corresponded to irrigation capacity of 4 2 and 6 3 mm d for silt loam and fine sand soils respectively in another study araya et al 2019a obtained a slightly lower average ravc value 534 ha for a relatively lower 13 mg ha maize yield the disparity was perhaps due to the difference in irrigation techniques fixed automatic irrigation applied after meeting certain soil water thresholds and consideration of optimal nitrogen throughout the growing season compared to the previous study which was set based on prevailing practice in addition unlike the current study no further evaluation was carried out beyond irrigation capacity of 5 mm d in araya et al 2019a which could have resulted in different yields and ravc values for grain sorghum the highest average yield in the current study was at irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d however in silt loam soils the ravc value 180 200 ha for irrigation capacity of 3 1 mm d was not substantially different from that of 2 1 2 5 mm d 180 190 ha the ranges of irrigation capacity values for the highest average yield were similar to that obtained in araya et al 2018 araya et al 2018 estimated grain sorghum yield of 6 mg ha in 3 out of 4 years at irrigation capacity of 3 6 mm d however when ravc values are used as evaluating criteria for setting irrigation scheduling there was no substantial difference in ravc between the highest 12 mm d and lowest irrigation capacity 1 mm d this shows grain sorghum may not generate substantially higher profit if grown under non limiting irrigation when compared to that limited irrigation lamm et al 2006 reported that dryland grain sorghum is more profitable compared to irrigated for winter wheat ravc value ranged between 350 370 ha and 310 367 ha for silt loam and fine sand soils respectively these ranges are not significantly different although applied irrigation may range from 50 to 350 mm under the various irrigation capacities in the current study yield increased with irrigation and peaked at 200 225 mm that corresponded to 2 5 mm d which is close to those reported in araya et al 2019b our study assumes that yield limiting factors do not exist except for water where irrigation application was designed in fixed automatic application mode after meeting certain plant available soil water for this reason yield and ravc values are higher than those reported values in araya et al 2019a in addition in the current study the ravc values were not substantially different across the irrigation capacities growing winter wheat under deficit irrigation could be the best strategy deficit irrigation strategy by growth stage depending on climate conditions as presented on araya et al 2017a may be a better strategy 4 4 limitations of the study cost of irrigation that includes cost of gas fuel oil and more presented in the https www agmanager info kfma enterprise reports is in terms of cost per bushel or cost per acre not in terms of cost per irrigation event while summarizing cost estimates in this way is helpful using cost factor per bushel for different irrigations scenario may affect the accuracy of the analysis in determining optimal irrigation based on economic performances especially for crops that are less responsive to irrigation average cost of irrigation per bushel can also underestimate costs of irrigation to those treatments with relatively higher irrigation applications frequent and shorter irrigation intervals and overestimate to those treatments with lower irrigation treatments less frequent and longer irrigation intervals in this study some of the simulation scenarios have limited practical implementation value under the prevalent irrigation practice for example extremely high irrigation capacity 12 5 mm d is not common under the present irrigation practice but is presented to demonstrate how increase in irrigation would affect yield and to show the implication of applying high irrigation in terms of water use water productivity and profitability for the different crop the simulation study focuses on achieving maximum yield and ravc based on selected irrigation scheduling option considering optimal agronomic management which could be valuable only for producers that operate based on precision agriculture technologies under present conditions for example the crops yielded high when the model was set to optimal n and non limiting environmental conditions no frost hail pest disease and weed which may not be the case under the majority of prevailing practice or conditions with the adoption and expansion of precision agriculture technology we assume that irrigation scheduling technology cropping systems and agronomic management practice might change however this work could also provide important information to producers that follow prevalent irrigation practice in addition continuous cropping for several years may not represent the current and future crop production system difference in cultivar characteristics may also cause difference in terms of irrigation water use and yield trade and federal agricultural policies in terms of incentives and insurance premiums may also affect the crop type to be planted which could influence the supply and demand and hence affect the price of product overall the work presented in this study based on combination of secondary data and modeling study is simplification of scenarios that explores options for optimizing irrigation while achieving targeted goals such as yield economic performance and water productivity not all the presented scenarios should necessarily fit in one farm as each of the scenarios may require specific suitable condition depending on many factors however such analysis could guide producers to take informed decisions considering available resources and targeted goal with some limitation it provides guidance for optimizing yield water use and income under the present and future water use it also allows producers to identify the most suitable irrigation strategy for sustainable income crop productivity and management of ground water and the environment 5 conclusions the optimal irrigation scheduling considering fixed depth of 25 mm per irrigation event based on yield for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat was 4 2 6 3 3 1 4 2 and 2 5 3 1 mm d respectively the lowest and highest values in the range corresponded to silt loam and fine sand soils respectively the maximum yield for maize grain sorghum and winter wheat were simulated at ranges of 400 450 300 325 and 200 225 mm respectively both pasw and irrigation intervals significantly affected grain sorghum and winter wheat yields depending on soil type highest ravc for potential maize grain sorghum and winter wheat yields were estimated to be 630 710 ha 150 200 ha and 310 370 ha respectively there was a small variation in ravc among soil types for maize irrigation strategy for higher ravc values is not different from irrigation strategy for higher yield and cwp cwp of maize peaked at 4 8 d interval 25 mm 4 8 d in contrast for grain sorghum and winter wheat irrigation strategy for higher ravc values is different from irrigation strategy for higher yield for example there was no substantial difference between highest and lowest irrigation in terms of ravc for wheat and grain sorghum which means only limited irrigation might be needed to meet higher ravc however the difference was that highest cwp of grain sorghum was attained at relatively higher irrigation capacity 4 6 mm d whereas there was no substantial difference in wheat cwp between the lowest and highest irrigation capacity implying that winter wheat is productive under limited irrigation although crop rotation systems are commonly practiced in the region the current study is limited only to continuous cropping system for major crops grown in western kansas future research should include rotation cropping systems majority of the work is also limited to non limiting conditions except for water this may not be the case under the prevailing conditions as there could be other yield limiting factors such as pests weeds nutrient deficiencies and other factors the presented information however can be used as a guide to estimate the economic benefits of optimal irrigation scheduling along with economic performances for crops grown under non limited conditions except water the presented results do not take into consideration the future changes to market conditions improvements in cultivar characteristics occurrence of extreme weather events e g drought flooding heat cold or frost limitation from other soil nutrients or adverse changes in crop management practices this study guides producers to identify and prioritize the most suitable irrigation strategy for optimizing yield cwp and or income while enhancing sustainability of environment and management of ground water

10329,in california and other agricultural regions that are facing challenges with water scarcity accurate estimates of crop evapotranspiration etc can support agricultural entities in ongoing efforts to improve on farm water use efficiency remote sensing approaches for calculating etc can be used to support wide area mapping of crop coefficients and etc with the goal of increasing access to spatially and temporally distributed information for these variables and advancing the use of evapotranspiration et data in irrigation scheduling and management we briefly review past work on the derivation of crop coefficients and etc data from satellite derived vegetation indices vi and evaluate the accuracy of a vi based approach for calculation of etc using a well instrumented drip irrigated sugar beet beta vulgaris field in the california central valley as a demonstration case sugar beets are grown around the world for sugar production and are also being evaluated in california as a potential biofuel crop as well as for their ability to scavenge nitrogen from the soil with important potential benefits for reduction of nitrate leaching from agricultural fields during the winter months in this study we evaluated the accuracy of etc data from the satellite irrigation management support sims framework for sugar beets using et data from a weighing lysimeter and a flux station instrumented with micrometeorological instrumentation we used the allen and pereira a p approach which was developed to estimate single and basal crop coefficients from crop fractional cover fc and height and combined with satellite derived fc data and grass reference et eto data as implemented within sims to estimate daily etc from sims etc sims for the sugar beet crop the accuracy of the daily etc sims data was evaluated against daily actual et data from the weighing lysimeter eta lys and actual et calculated using an energy balance approach from micrometeorological

california agricultural community is facing challenges related to the increasing interannual variability of precipitation and constraints on water resources in response to sustained declines in groundwater levels and the extreme drought that began in 2011 and extended through 2016 the sustainable groundwater management act sgma was passed by the california legislature in 2014 to regulate overdraft of aquifers and increase the sustainability of groundwater supplies additionally in 2012 groundwater regulations were added to the irrigated lands regulatory program in california to prevent agricultural runoff and leaching of fertilizers from irrigated fields from impacting surface and groundwater resources these policies have led to increased interest among the agricultural community in adopting new information technologies to support data driven approaches in irrigation management and scheduling with the goal of evaluating and potentially increasing on farm water use efficiency the food and agriculture organization irrigation and drainage paper 56 fao56 synthesized decades of research to provide a framework and methodology for computing crop water requirements though the integration of reference evapotranspiration calculated from meteorological data and crop coefficients allen et al 1998 fao56 provides look up tables and equations to support calculation of crop coefficients kc for a wide range of crops at different growth stages fao56 includes both single kc and dual kc approaches in the dual kc approach the kc value is determined through separate calculation of a basal crop coefficient kcb and a soil evaporation coefficient ke kcb is defined as evapotranspiration from a well watered crop with a dry soil surface kcb is used primarily to represent the transpiration component of et but also includes diffusive soil evaporation while ke is used to capture evaporation from exposed soil kcb and ke are summed to calculate the dual kc value which is then multiplied by the reference et calculated using the penman monteith equation from meteorological measurements obtained over a reference crop typically a well watered 0 12 m grass surface eto crop water stress can also be accounted for in this approach via incorporation of a stress coefficient ks calculated using a soil water balance model during the initial crop development period evaporation from exposed soil typically accounts for the majority of etc as the crop canopy develops evaporation from exposed soil decreases while the transpiration increases and eventually becomes the dominant process allen et al 1998 satellite observations enable estimation of crop water requirements on a regional scale with good spatial 30 m and temporal 5 8 days resolution kjaersgaard et al 2011 by providing near real time measurements of crop conditions through remote sensing at the scale of individual fields information can benefit growers by allowing them to accurately and easily monitor the crop canopy development and the crop water requirements trout et al 2008 previous studies have used remote sensing on various crops to estimate kc and kcb values from vegetation indices vis such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi calculated from satellite top of atmosphere toa reflectance or surface reflectance data and these results have demonstrated the potential value for the agricultural community of operational systems glenn etal 2007 pôças et al 2020 previous work related specifically to sugar beets using vis approach is limited however and includes a study by gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 that used satellite observed vis to obtain kcb values for sugar beets in spain their study concluded that there was value in using satellite vi data to estimate kcb values but did not evaluate the accuracy of the kcb or etc data instead the study focused on evaluation of crop yields and water productivity tasumi and allen 2007 also applied remote sensing and an energy balance model the mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric model to estimate kc values for sugar beets and other major crops grown in idaho in the u s sugar beet beta vulgaris is a valuable crop grown commercially with the purpose of producing sugar and biofuel panella et al 2015 kaffka et al 2014 described key factors in california that enable the suitability and potential of sugar beets for biofuel production under the energy independence and security act eisa of 2007 sugar beet was qualified as a potential feedstock for advanced biofuel production with the potential for greenhouse gas reductions of up to 50 110th congress 2007 due to the high sugar content beets could potentially double ethanol production compared to other feedstocks panella and kaffka 2010 furthermore sugar beet processing by products can serve as a soil amendment for nitrate reduction kumar et al 2002 as the use of satellite based models for estimating et becomes more common it is important to have robust ground based measurements across a range of crop types and growth forms that can be used to evaluate remotely sensed et surface reflectance based models typically use information in the visible and near infrared vnir wavelengths to estimate kc or kcb and then combine these values with daily eto values derived from meteorological data to calculate etc following the fao56 approach many previous studies have investigated the relationship between kc or kcb and vis bausch and neale 1987 bausch 1993 benedetti and rossini 1993 hunsaker et al 2003a 2003b 2005 glenn et al 2011 and pôças et al 2020 provide a recent review of the literature on this topic thermal based remote sensing approaches use thermal infrared tir measurements to solve energy balance equations to estimate et e g allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 kustas et al 2004 while there has been important recent progress on automation of energy balance models for field scale applications allen et al 2007 semmens et al 2016 sustained operational production of daily et estimates from energy balance approaches remains challenging vi based approaches for field scale etc mapping have a few key advantages for irrigation management applications first moderate resolution 10 300 m vnir measurements are available from a large constellation of satellite and airborne sources murray et al 2009 calera et al 2017 increasing the temporal resolution of the satellite measurements second the algorithms used in the models are computationally simpler and avoid the need for internal or scene by scene calibration rafn et al 2008 facilitating automated data processing over large areas and reducing data latency which is critical for irrigation management applications third vnir observations are available at higher spatial resolution compared to thermal based remote sensing for individual fields johnson and trout 2012 increasing the utility and accuracy for smaller fields without the need for pan sharpening or data fusion one important limitation of vi based approaches is that they typically estimate etc assuming well watered conditions and they are less sensitive to intermittent deficit irrigation and short term crop stress which can lead to overestimation of actual et for deficit irrigated crops glenn et al 2011 for irrigation management applications however estimation of etc assuming well watered conditions provides a consistent reference for the irrigator making it easier to adjust irrigation management to meet their production goals in contrast measurement of actual et eta requires the irrigator to use additional information to determine whether the eta represents stressed or unstressed conditions and then make corrections to calculate etc as the baseline for an intentional deficit irrigation regime a second limitation of vi based approaches is that they are less sensitive to evaporation from bare soil and require integration with a soil water balance model to estimate soil evaporation gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 melton et al 2012 while this can be an important limitation for estimation of evaporation from bare soil or sparsely covered fields during the winter the period during which soil evaporation is a significant percentage of total etc during active crop production is typically limited to a few weeks a key objective in this study was to determine how well etc from a vi based approach compared to ground based measurements and to characterize the overall impact of these two limitations on the accuracy of the etc estimates glenn et al 2011 evaluated different vi based methods used in et studies and provided evidence that this method can be applied to acquire accurate estimates of et of the various vis the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a widely used measure of vegetation density and condition goward et al 1991 one of the earliest applications of a vi based approach was described by bausch and neale 1987 and this study found that ndvi was highly correlated with leaf area index lai and fc these authors proposed a linear transformation between ndvi and kcb to represent a reflectance based crop coefficient kcb vi which tracked closely with kc measured by the weighing lysimeter this study concluded that the kcb vi approach could be used to schedule irrigation at field scales the kcb vi method has also been applied to numerous other crops yielding the conclusions that 1 the use of ndvi as a supplement to static kcb values can improve on farm water management hunsaker et al 2007a 2007b samani et al 2009 and 2 kcb vi also gave consistently accurate results and highlighted the potential to improve irrigation when plants are under aberrant conditions compared to those represented by conventional fao56 approaches hunsaker et al 2003a 2003b 2005 close correlation is commonly established between vegetation amount and transpiration where as vegetated cover increases transpiration increases glenn et al 2007 based on the strong relationship between ndvi and kcb trout et al 2008 and johnson and trout 2012 investigated the relationship between satellite derived ndvi and ground measured fractional cover fc the proportion of ground that is covered with green vegetation johnson and trout 2012 used a multispectral camera to measure the fc of 49 commercial fields that contained 18 different crop types over 11 landsat overpass dates they found that the landsat ndvi formed a strong linear relationship with measured fc supporting the use of satellite derived ndvi to calculate fc for agricultural crops due to the cost effectiveness and flexibility of satellite data remote sensing has been implemented to map kc and kcb values and estimate et on field and regional scales building on the studies described above melton et al 2012 developed the satellite irrigation management support sims framework which integrates satellite data and meteorological data from the california irrigation management information system cimis hart et al 2009 to provide data for ndvi fc kcb and et under well watered conditions with a dry soil surface which we notate as etc sims etc sims largely represents the transpiration component of et however sims does set kcb at a minimum of 0 15 to account for baseline evaporation from bare soil and includes diffusive soil evaporation melton et al 2012 in addition sims kcb values can be combined with a soil water balance model to calculate soil evaporation coefficients ke and crop stress coefficients ks following the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 sims was developed to support irrigation management and regional water accounting to help irrigators and water managers account for interannual variability and heterogeneity in field conditions various studies have discussed the importance of adjusting tabulated kc and kcb values provided by fao56 based on local conditions and climate variability pereira et al 2015 drerup et al 2017 a brief overview of sims is provided in section 2 2 and detailed information about the sims algorithms and workflow can be found in melton et al 2012 2020 and a full description of the allen and pereira a p equations encoded within sims is provided in pereira et al 2020 in a recent study melton et al 2018 described the improvements of sims summarized work to date quantifying the accuracy of etc sims and demonstrated the operational use of sims to improve irrigation management melton et al 2018 also conducted an accuracy assessment with in situ measurements over a dozen crop types in california results showed that seasonal etc sims estimates are within 9 mean absolute error mae of measured crop evapotranspiration for well watered crops and 15 mae across all crops studied including deficit irrigated crops such as wine grapes and cotton glenn et al 2011 found that discrepancies between et calculated from satellites and ground based instrumentation can range from 5 to 10 for lysimetry and 10 30 for open path eddy covariance here we refer to data from the satellite based approach as the modeled data and the et calculated from the ground based observations as the measurements recognizing that the et data from the ground based instrumentation also has errors and uncertainty and involves application of biophysical and micrometeorological models to calculate et values from the measurements collected on the ground glenn et al 2011 it is important to distinguish that actual et from weighing lysimeter eta lys and flux station eta eb stands for et calculated directly from measurements collected by instruments and includes soil evaporation and canopy transpiration as well as the impact of any crop water stress differently etc sims is determined from the combination of satellite vi derived kcb and eto etc sims does not account for soil evaporation and crop water stress unless it results in a reduction in biomass or crop geometry change hence a key question addressed by this study is the ability of etc sims to accurately estimate et despite these limitations as discussed by various studies when using vi based approaches for estimating and mapping etc a soil water balance model for the surface layer and the root zone may be utilized to further increase the accuracy of etc estimates if soil evaporation or crop water stress are major considerations campos et al 2013 mateos et al 2013 pôças et al 2015 odi lara et al 2016 the objective of this paper is to assess the accuracy and applicability of a vi based remote sensing model that incorporates the a p approach to estimate etc in sugar beets we also evaluated the accuracy of the eta eb measurements against eta lys measurements to evaluate the utility of using an energy balance residual approach for measurement of latent energy fluxes from a flux station our strategy in this assessment was to quantify each independently calibrated measurement that occurred simultaneously at the same location to evaluate the potential utility of the vi based remote sensing approach used by sims for estimation of etc for drip irrigated sugar beets 2 methods 2 1 study site the sugar beet field is located in five points ca lat 36 3379 long 120 1131 elev 82 0 m at the west side research and extension center wsrec with average annual precipitation of 175 mm the site has a flat terrain with a mediterranean climate of cool wet winters and warm dry summers the prevailing wind comes from the northwest fig 1 and the soil type at the site is panoche clay loam typic torriorthents the beets were planted on oct 22 2014 with a 0 15 m spacing between plants and a 0 02 m seeding depth the field was 106 m 348 ft long and 61 m 200 ft wide with 140 rows oriented 1 degree northwest the field was irrigated with sprinklers prior to planting through germination and the early stages of crop development and then the irrigation switched to surface drip irrigation on jan 2nd 2015 irrigation was measured in the field using flow meters badger meter milwaukee wi usa installed on two drip laterals in the field as well as from measurements recorded by the weighing lysimeter for the study period from jan 1st to june 30th 2015 the field was irrigated 2 3 times per week using the surface drip irrigation system and a total of 659 mm of water was applied fig 1 the wsrec staff managed the irrigation scheduling based on data from the weighing lysimeter located in the field california irrigation management information system cimis weather station 2 was used to obtain eto data this weather station lat 36 336222 long 120 112910 elev 86 9 m is located inside the wsrec field station and installed over a well watered grass field the field was harvested august 4th 2015 2 2 remotely sensed data the satellite irrigation management support sims system was developed to support mapping of crop development and crop water demand throughout california melton et al 2012 sims uses satellite derived surface reflectances to map ndvi fc and kcb basal crop coefficients to calculate the daily etc sims kcb is combined with daily eto data from the california department of water resources california irrigation management information system cimis sims can be driven with satellite data from multispectral instruments onboard satellites including landsat 5 landsat 7 landsat 8 sentinel 2a sentinel 2b and others that collect measurements in the vnir wavelengths for the comparisons with ground measurements of et described below atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data were obtained from the usgs landsat collection 1 for the operational land imager oli on landsat 8 landsat 7 and landsat 8 each have a 16 day revisit interval but since they are staggered one observation is available approximately every 8 days due to overlap in the scene boundaries landsat observations are available more frequently for some locations as was the case for our field site sims uses the highest quality cloud free observations for each pixel and composites them into a mosaic every eight days in cases where data is available from both landsat 7 and landsat 8 landsat 8 is given priority due to the fact that our study site is located within the overlap between path 42 and path 43 we were able to obtain one landsat 8 scene almost every 8 days excepting cloud cover landsat scenes used in this study can be found in table 1 2 3 calculation of etc sims from satellite data and cimis eto sims first calculates ndvi values from surface reflectance values as 1 ndvi nir r nir r where nir is the reflectance in the near infrared wavelengths and r is the reflectance in the red wavelengths ndvi is then linearly interpolated between cloud free satellite overpass dates to calculate a daily timeseries fig 2 next sims applies the equation described in trout et al 2008 and johnson and trout 2012 to map fc from ndvi at a spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m per pixel following eq 2 2 f c 1 26 ndvi 0 18 sims calculates kcb values via the fc values fig 2 calculated from the satellite observation using eq 2 and a density coefficient kd derived from a biophysical description of the canopy this approach follows allen and pereira 2009 eq 10 3 k d min 1 m l f c eff f c eff 1 1 h where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation h is the crop height fig 2 and ml is a canopy radiation transparency factor ranging from 1 5 to 2 0 allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020 kd links increase in kcb to increasing vegetation amount details of calculations of crop height are provided in pereira et al 2020 this issue and in the sims user manual melton et al 2020 for this study we used a ml of 2 0 for sugarbeet as a simplifying assumption to facilitate full automation the current release of sims assumes standard climate conditions kcb full which represents conditions at peak plant growth for conditions having nearly full ground cover is calculated as a simplified version of eq 7a of allen and pereira 2009 4 k cb full f r min 1 0 0 1h max 1 2 where fr range 0 1 is an adjustment factor related to stomatal regulation for annuals fr is assigned a standard value of 1 for perennials which tend to exhibit more stomatal control on transpiration fr is 1 and varies by crop type and seasonal growth stage allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020 for this study we used a fr of 1 0 for sugarbeet kcb is then derived following eq 5a from allen and pereira 2009 5 k cb sims k cb min k d k cb full k cb min where kcb min is set to 0 15 which is the minimum kcb value for bare soil under typical agricultural conditions allen and pereira 2009 values of hmax are drawn from table 12 of fao56 allen et al 1998 values for h are estimated for annual crops as a linear function of fc and hmax for tree and vine crops values from table 11 of fao56 are used for the late stage start and stop dates as a final step sims calculates etc sims following the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 as 6 et c sims k cb sims k e et o where kcb is the sims basal crop coefficient calculated from eq 5 ke is the soil evaporation coefficient and eto is the grass reference et due to the fact that reflectance based approaches are less sensitive to evaporation from exposed soil in eq 6 sims was originally developed to estimate kcb and currently must set the evaporation coefficient ke as equal to zero for wide area mapping et applications in a drip irrigated system with lines shaded by vegetation as in the present study this simplification is acceptable ongoing work will enhance sims to include a gridded soil water balance model to support calculation of ke for this study eto was obtained from spatial cimis hart et al 2009 operated by the california department of water resources while the spatial cimis data was used in this study outside of california sims utilizes eto data from gridmet abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 additional details on the a p approach and sims algorithms and documentation can be found in pereira et al 2020 and melton et al 2020 respectively 2 4 weighing lysimeter this site has a weighing lysimeter located in the center of the field consisting of a 2 m by 2 m by 2 25 m deep soil tank positioned on a mechanical tank scale model fs 4 cardinal scale manufacturing co webb city mo that is housed underground due to limitations on the lysimeter s accessibility by tractors the lysimeter plot was hand planted following the same scheme as the rest of the field the soil and plants in the lysimeter were irrigated from a supply tank located underneath the lysimeter each time the lysimeter weight decreased by 4 kg i e 1 mm of water on a daily basis et was monitored and computed through the weight change in the soil tank via the 91 kg capacity stainless steel s beam load cell omega engineering inc norwalk ct the data were logged onto a cr3000 datalogger campbell scientific inc logan ut once every 60 s the accuracy of the weighing lysimeter measurements is controlled through calibration in this study the calibration was done by using a known weight 40 200 kg on the surfaces of the lysimeter additionally two 0 3 kg weights were used to ensure detections of small changes the load cell then recorded and averaged three readings mv for each known weight last a linear regression between load cell readings x axis and weights y axis was determined and incorporated into the lysimeter s program besides the factory calibration in jan 2014 two additional calibrations were conducted on dec 23rd 2014 and feb 18th 2015 to validate and ensure the accuracy of the weighing lysimeter both calibrations produced very high coefficient of determination values r2 with 0 9999 for 2014 and 0 9998 for 2015 indicating a high level of accuracy of the weighing lysimeter the theory and details of the weighing lysimeter are well documented in the literature and details can be found in bryla et al 2010 specific details for the lysimeter used in this study are described in thao 2017 2 5 flux measurements open path eddy covariance opec is an approach that uses measurements collected by micrometeorological instrumentation to calculate et the opec approach has been extensively used to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration eta and validate remote sensing models moorhead et al 2019 full opec instrumentation includes both a 3d sonic anemometer and an infrared gas analyzer as a result it is quite expensive and many studies have also explored use of the residual of the energy balance reb approach which also uses a 3d sonic anemometer but does not require use of an infrared gas analyzer the reb approach applies the energy balance equation eq 8 to estimate latent heat flux density as the residual with a forced energy balance closure twine et al 2000 and this micrometeorological measurement is mainly implemented over vegetated regions pan et al 2017 anapalli et al 2018 used the reb approach in a cotton and a corn field in the cotton field which also had a large scale field lysimeter they found that et measured from the flux data compared well with et measured in the lysimeter yielding a rmse for daily et of 1 2 mm and a seasonal et error within 1 in the corn field they found a strong correlation between et measured from the flux data and reference et data for alfalfa and grass with pearson s correlation coefficients of 0 81 and 0 70 respectively their results demonstrated that the reb procedure is a possible alternative method for calculation of actual et from micrometeorological instrumentation and a cost effective alternative to eta measurements from lysimetry and opec systems flux measurements require enough fetch the horizontal distance from sensor to predominant wind direction to achieve representative measurements from an area of interest a general rule of thumb requires a fetch to measurement height ratio of 100 1 over a homogenous and flat surface with no sudden changes in landcover businger 1986 gash 1986 horst and weil 1994 tanner 1988 however burba 2001 conducted ec measurements over a tallgrass prairie and found that over 80 of the latent heat flux came from 80 m within the predominant wind for a measurement height of 1 5 m additionally they examined the effect of roughness on fetch and found that the largest contribution of latent heat flux came from 12 to 18 m and 30 35 m of predominant wind distance for high canopy height of 0 6 m and low canopy height 0 05 m roughness respectively in this study the reb station following the approach described by linquist et al 2015 was deployed to estimate latent heat flux density and calculate the eta eb from the residual of the energy balance one limitation of the reb approach is that it does not provide a direct measurement of latent heat fluxes via an infrared gas analyzer and a sonic anemometer and instead derives the latent heat flux through the residual as a result the energy balance closure as described in twine et al 2000 is not determinable our study site has a flat terrain with a predominant wind from the northwest with a secondary contribution from north northwest fig 1 due to the small size of the area of study a ratio of 100 1 is restricted to best ensure a sufficient fetch while avoiding edges of the field we placed the station about 90 m from the predominant wind as shown in fig 1 the assembly of the station was based on procedures described by mcelrone et al 2013 all data were logged and stored in a datalogger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut a data logger program was used for data acquisition and post processing following the steps described in shapland et al 2013 the station was maintained and adjusted weekly so that all sensors were clean and functioning properly 2 5 1 net radiation and ground heat flux density a two way net radiometer nr lite 2 net radiometer kipp zonen delft netherlands was maintained at 2 m above the canopy to measure net radiation rn the total incoming radiation minus the total outgoing radiation six soil heat flux plates rebs hft3 heat flux plate rebs inc seattle wa usa were buried at a depth of 5 cm each plate was paired with soil thermocouple probes tcav soil thermocouple probe campbell scientific inc logan ut usa installed on either side of the plate with one probe installed diagonally from a depth of 5 2 cm and the second probe installed diagonally from 2 cm to 5 cm six capacitance probes decagon 10hs meter group pullman wa usa were also installed near each soil heat flux sensor package at a depth of 5 cm to measure volumetric water content these sensors provided measurements of ground heat flux g that included the soil heat flux across the heat flow transducer gt and change in heat storage in the soil layer above the transducers s such that g gt s shapland et al 2013 2 5 2 sensible heat flux density from eddy covariance a three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer 81000 3d sonic anemometer rm young traverse city mi usa was maintained at 1 5 m above the canopy to collect wind velocity and sonic temperature with a sampling frequency of 10 hz to measure sensible heat flux density h from the sonic anemometer via the covariance of the vertical wind and the sonic temperature eq 7 swinbank 1951 7 h ρ a c p w t s where ρ a is the air density g m 3 cp is the specific heat of air at constant pressure j g 1 k 1 w is the speed of vertical wind component m s 1 and ts is the sonic temperature k w t s is the covariance between the vertical wind component and the sonic temperature with a two dimensional coordinate rotation tanner and thurtell 1969 a two dimensional rotation is also implemented within the logger program meyers and baldocchi 2005 2 5 3 latent heat flux density and evapotranspiration the latent heat flux density an indirect measurement is determined from the residual of the energy balance twine et al 2000 8 λ e r n g h where λe is the latent heat flux density mj m 2 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 g is the ground heat flux density mj m 2 and h is the sensible heat flux density mj m 2 all flux densities were converted from w m 2 to mj m 2 for the calculation above with gap filling via linear interpolation applied prior to being used in the calculation of λe these instantaneous half hourly λe were then computed into daily profiles the mass flux density of water vapor et mm is then determined as 9 et λ e λ where λ is the latent heat of evaporation which equals 2 45 mj per 0 0001 m3 3 results 3 1 energy balance components the hourly values 24 h profile for each of the individual energy balance components throughout the season were averaged to construct the seasonal mean hourly energy balance the flux densities rn and g usually increased around 6am and transitioned into stable conditions after 6pm during summer in the central valley as the daily average temperature increases throughout the season we would expect a positive trend in h similar to rn and g however we observed a decrease in h as the season moved towards summer suggesting that incoming radiant energy was not the only source of incoming energy on a finer resolution in fig 3 we observed low or negative daytime h cyan to light green hue from late may to the beginning of july which indicates an advection effect as additional energy other than radiation was added into the system to investigate this we evaluated ndvi data around the field throughout the season to examine the local environmental conditions and assess the potential for advection effects an example from a landsat 8 image acquired on june 2nd is shown in fig 4 the field is surrounded by pixels with low ndvi indicating bare dry soil in the fields adjacent to our study site one possible reason for the advection effect observed might be that in 2015 as a result of the exceptional drought in california most of the surrounding fields were left bare and the study field was one of the only irrigated fields at wsrec with a predominant wind from the nw the cooler environmental system in the field serves as a sink of energy as heat transfer will occur spontaneously from higher temperature bodies to lower temperature bodies during canopy development more areas were shaded resulting in cooler soil temperatures which further increased the field s ability to absorb heat consequentially the additional energy stimulated the growth of λe based on the energy balance presented in eq 8 for periods with negative daily h in order to avoid uncertainties associated with nighttime fluxes we used the daytime 6am 6pm inclusive h along with corresponding daytime rn and g to calculate the residual of the energy balance instead of using linear interpolation by using daytime fluxes when daytime h is below zero the possibility of the field serving as a daytime sink of energy is not neglected while avoiding the uncertainties with nighttime fluxes due to the fact that the closure was forced inherently by the reb approach it is important that we were able to compare the data from reb station against the weighing lysimeter this allowed us to assess the accuracy of λe via the comparison with the weighing lysimeter data which agreed well figs 5 and 6 3 2 daily evapotranspiration and intercomparison 3 2 1 comparisons between methods all daily et values collected during the growing season from the flux station weighing lysimeter and sims were plotted against each other to test the strength of the relationship between measurements fig 5 in addition statistical metrics for the comparison of daily etc sims against eta lys and eta eb were computed table 2 overall the results of the comparison between measurements showed good agreement with r2 values above 0 9 in all cases in the comparison between ground measurements the trendline suggests that a slight underestimation of eta eb relative to eta lys was observed for the lower values of eta while an overestimation occurred for the higher eta values the comparison of daily etc sims against eta lys also showed good agreement with model efficiency ef of 0 91 regression coefficient close to 1 mae of 0 56 mm day root mean squared error rmse of 0 73 mm day and mean bias error mbe of 0 31 mm day in the comparison between daily etc sims against eta eb etc sims had a small positive bias relative to eta eb mbe of 0 15 mm day the model ef was high 0 93 mae was only 0 47 mm day and rmse was 0 65 mm day table 2 3 2 2 intercomparison of evapotranspiration from the fc data shown in fig 2 we estimated the lengths of crop stages and plotted linear regressions representing each growth stage in the comparison between etc sims and eta lys a close relationship was obtained for both mid and late seasons while an underestimation of etc sims was observed in the initial and crop establishment stage the comparison between etc sims and eta eb showed that there was slight overestimation of etc sims for the mid season however closer relationships between the two sets of data were observed in the initial and crop establishment stage and late seasons fig 6 in figs 7 and 8 vertical lines were drawn to distinguish growth stages where the first section is the initial and crop development stage 01 01 2015 02 26 2015 the second section is the mid season 02 27 2015 06 02 2015 and the last section is the late season 06 03 2015 06 30 2015 on a daily timestep eta lys and eta eb tracked closely with each other fig 7 over the development stage the weighing lysimeter in general had the highest et and eta lys was consistently higher than eta eb and etc sims though agreement between these measurements increased as the crop reached maturity etc sims was generally the lowest likely due to the soil evaporation from exposed soil which is only considered to a limited extent in etc sims as the canopy develops transpiration becomes dominant and increased alignment among all measurements was observed e g during the mid season and towards the end of the crop cycle a max etc sims of 7 88 mm was observed on may 31st compared to 7 98 mm for eta lys and 7 28 mm for eta eb fig 7 during crop establishment daily etc sims underestimated eta lys and eta eb by 51 0 and 8 2 respectively during mid season daily etc sims performed very well with an underestimation of 3 5 and an overestimation of 6 9 compared to eta lys and eta eb respectively similar patterns were observed in late season where etc sims overestimated both eta lys and eta eb by 0 6 fig 6 representing very strong agreement overall daily kc lys and kc eb values were calculated from eta lys and eta eb by dividing the daily et values by the daily eto from cimis station 2 daily kcb sims values were calculated through linear interpolation between the satellite based kcb values from sims calculated on satellite overpass dates the daily kc and kcb timeseries from each of these data sources are plotted in fig 8 over the entire study period daily kc lys and kc eb measurements were noisy while kcb values from sims kcb sims stayed relatively smooth due to the dependence on satellite ndvi measurements which track crop canopy development kcb sims presented a relatively dynamic curve with a max kcb sims of 1 02 highlighting the value of using satellite data to measure variations in crop canopy density and extent relative to idealized conditions sims accompanied by both the lysimeter and flux station entered the mid season 15 days earlier than crop growth stages suggested in fao56 this result illustrates the ability of satellite data to capture localized variability in rates of crop canopy development driven by variations in agronomic practices and interannual variability in weather conditions during the mid and late season when soil evaporation was low kcb sims aligned closely with kc lys and kc eb fig 8 the cumulative values of et throughout the sugar beet crop cycle for the various sources are presented in fig 9 on the primary y axis the seasonal total of eta lys was 793 9 mm eta eb was 709 6 mm and etc sims was 737 1 mm on the secondary y axis the total irrigation and precipitation was 696 6 mm seasonally etc sims was 7 7 lower than eta lys and 3 7 higher than eta eb we also separated cumulative et into corresponding crop stages during initial and crop establishment cumulative etc sims eta lys eta eb were 51 3 mm 81 8 mm and 59 9 mm respectively during mid season cumulative etc sims eta lys eta eb was 491 2 mm 518 4 mm and 456 6 mm respectively during late season cumulative etc sims eta lys eta eb was 194 6 mm 193 7 mm and 193 1 mm respectively 4 discussion 4 1 comparison between ground measurements during the growing season the weighing lysimeter was carefully maintained to ensure data quality additionally it was calibrated twice with high r2 values of 0 9999 in december 2014 and 0 9998 in february 2015 this supported the accuracy and reliability of the measurements from the weighing lysimeter over the course of the study daily average eta eb was 8 lower than eta lys fig 5 moorhead et al 2019 reported similar findings for sorghum and corn with a daily underestimation of 14 using eq 8 with h calculated from a scintillometer although weighing lysimeters are generally considered to provide the most accurate characterization of et howell et al 1985 evett et al 2012 the wsrec weighing lysimeter similar to most weighing lysimeters has a calibrated irrigation system 1 mm of water 4 kg weight loss and is maintained differently than the rest of the field compared to weighing lysimeters reb is a portable and cost effective alternative that captures a more complete spatial representation of the field however without the direct measurement of the latent energy flux it is not possible to evaluate the energy balance closure and thus difficult to evaluate the accuracy without a second independent measurement by forcing closure some of the storage terms are also neglected in the reb approach in future studies it would be preferable to employ an infrared gas analyzer to benchmark the reb approach across different crop types overall when compared to the eta lys data at this site eta eb agrees well with underestimation of 11 at a seasonal timestep fig 9 and a mae of 8 at a daily timestep fig 5 this level of agreement shows strong potential for use of the reb approach in water management applications when use of lysimetry or full opec instrumentation is not feasible 4 2 intercomparison and implications for kcb from ndvi the overall pattern in daily et for the crop is summarized in fig 7 daily et peaked at approximately 8 23 mm day and 8 55 mm day for the weighing lysimeter and reb station respectively the timing of this peak corresponded with a maximum etc sims value of 7 96 mm day the maximum kcb sims was 1 02 as shown in fig 8 hauer et al 2015 used field measured canopy height and fc coupled with a p approach and found a maximum kcb of 1 12 for a sugar beet field gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 derived a maximum kcb using a soil adjusted vegetation index savi ranging from 1 0 1 2 from four sugar beet fields fao56 table 12 lists kc mid value of 1 2 and fao56 table 17 lists kcb mid value of 1 15 for sugar beet under well watered conditions in sub humid climates allen et al 1998 the maximum kcb sims compared well with these studies although at the lower end following the period of maximum daily et around june 18th there is a sharp decline in etc sims and both sets of ground measurements which correspond to the end of irrigation for the field and the onset of senescence of the crop figs 7 and 8 this suggests that kcb sims has the ability to accurately capture localized information especially at the peak crop stage fig 8 in addition kcb sims values throughout the crop cycle are within the range of values obtained by gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 where the vi based approach to estimate kcb was also applied 4 3 strengths and limitations of sims due to the reliance primarily on measurement in the visible and near infrared wavelengths sims can be implemented using remote sensing data from a variety of satellite and airborne platforms including landsat and sentinel 2 using data from multiple satellites sims can currently update satellite derived ndvi fc and kcb values every 4 5 days through the combined use of data from landsat 8 sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b johnson et al 2016 showed in field trials for lettuce and broccoli that use of sims data with other irrigation and nutrient management applications such as cropmanage developed by the university of california agriculture and natural resources ucanr institute resulted in reductions in applied water of 20 40 relative to static irrigation schedules daily etc sims considerably underestimated daily eta lys by 51 0 on average during the crop development stage fig 6 which is likely due to the model s parametrizations of the diffusive evaporative component this suggests that incorporation of a gridded soil water balance model to account for evaporation from bare soil via calculation of ke values is necessary to help sims provide a better estimation of etc during the period of initial and crop establishment stages during the mid to late season good agreement was observed between each independent measurement of et from the sugar beet field fig 6 as reported in glenn et al 2011 the uncertainty between satellite estimated et and in situ measurements can generally range from 5 10 for lysimetry and 10 30 for flux data similar results were found in padilla et al 2011 where they used a kcb vi approach complemented with a soil water balance for ke and stress coefficient to estimate et in wheat and corn their modeled results compared well with both daily eta measured from ec and the lysimeter with an average overestimation of 8 mateos et al 2013 used a kcb vi approach in conditions of no water stress in cotton and found their modeled results overestimated daily eta measured from ec by less than 10 we found that the seasonal difference of etc sims was 7 7 lower than eta lys and 3 7 higher than eta eb fig 9 the rmse values for the comparison between etc sims and eta lys 0 73 mm table 2 and between etc sims and eta eb 0 65 mm table 2 are in agreement with rmse reported 0 75 mm in mateos et al 2013 the high modeling efficiency for the comparison 1 between eta lys and etc sims 0 91 2 between eta eb and etc sims 0 93 further indicates the good performance of sims table 2 these results suggest that sims is able to provide et estimates within the expected range of uncertainty of the in situ measurements the close alignment of etc sims with eta lys and eta eb from mid and late season figs 6 and 7 further showcases that kcb sims calculated using the a p approach coupled with satellite derived vi and fc data has the potential for operational et estimation for irrigation management of sugar beets although daily etc sims underestimated eta lys by only 2 97 throughout the whole growing period as shown in fig 5 the approach used to calculate etc sims from satellite derived vi data misses soil evaporation during the crop establishment period fig 7 compared to daily average eta lys etc sims greatly underestimated et by 51 0 during the crop establishment period versus a 3 5 underestimation during mid season and a 0 6 overestimation for end season fig 6 the underestimations during the initial and establishment periods suggest that the limitation of missing soil evaporation is evident while the later close alignments confirm that etc sims agrees well with eta lys once the crop canopy is established validating the use of kcb from ndvi with a p approach when compared to daily eta eb daily etc sims overestimated et by 4 6 during the entire crop cycle fig 5 throughout crop stages daily etc sims consistently overestimated eta eb except the 8 2 underestimation during the initial and crop establishment fig 6 the underestimation further proves the need to account for soil evaporation in the early stages the later overestimations could be caused by flux measurements as any overestimations in h or underestimations in rn and g would result an underestimation of λe based on eq 8 however this is unknown due to the lack of determination of the energy balance closure further highlighting the importance of having an independent measurement of λe along with other energy balance sensors considering phenology directly influences evaporative rates it could be beneficial to incorporate other climatic variables within sims since accurate estimations of kcb are contingent on the crop growth stages richardson et al 2013 hunsaker et al 2002 although this study demonstrated strong alignment between sims and two independent field measurements of et variables including cumulative growing degree days cgdd derived by maximum minimum and base temperature could be used to determine crop growth stages and better construct the kcb curve for mid and late season in the future stegman 1988 slack et al 1996 raes et al 2012 this has previously been done in studies such as hunsaker et al 2003a 2003b where they used cgdd in addition to ndvi to construct the kcb curve r2 0 82 after full canopy cover ndvi 0 8 however as advection can affect surface energy dynamics it is important to distinguish a reasonable temperature threshold should cgdd be incorporated with ndvi 5 conclusion the performance of sims for et mapping was evaluated in a drip irrigated sugar beet field in the california central valley over a 181 day crop cycle the accuracy of etc sims was assessed against et data from a weighing lysimeter and a reb flux station daily etc sims data was derived from landsat 8 surface reflectance data coupled with the a p approach comparisons performed in this study for etc sims yielded an rmse of 0 73 mm day and 0 65 mm day compared to eta lys and eta eb respectively seasonally etc sims totaled 737 1 mm which was within 7 7 of total eta lys and 3 7 of eta eb daily etc sims was 0 55 mm day lower than daily eta lys on average resulting in an underestimation relative to eta lys of 38 7 mm during the initial crop establishment period highlighting the limited sensitivity of vi based approaches to soil evaporation once the crop canopy began to develop however there was strong alignment between etc sims and eta lys with differences of only 0 25 mm day as transpiration become the predominant component of et etc sims also agreed well during this period with eta eb with differences of 0 31 mm day etc sims also had better agreement with eta eb during the initial crop establishment period with differences of only 0 01 mm day results from use of the reb approach in this study are promising and show reasonable overall agreement with the lysimeter measurement in the future deployment of an irga alongside the reb instrumentation would be important in benchmarking the performance of the reb approach before extensive use as the sole ground data source for assessment of remotely sensed et estimates acknowledging the underestimation of soil evaporation during the initial period of crop establishment we conclude that etc sims is able to provide reasonable daily and seasonal estimates of etc for sugar beets especially during the mid and late season this assessment of sims further supports the utility of applying satellite vi based methods coupled with the a p approach to estimate etc for drip irrigated crops to address the underestimation of soil evaporation during the initial period of crop establishment future studies should incorporate a gridded soil water balance model to support calculation of ke to estimate soil evaporation within sims currently sims is being implemented and validated for a wide range of crop types in the salinas valley and central valley in california and ongoing work is supporting expansion across the western u s the ability of sims to rapidly estimate field scale etc via fully automated methods could be useful and significant to agricultural producers and water resource managers for future water use efficiency and conservation efforts declaration

10329,in california and other agricultural regions that are facing challenges with water scarcity accurate estimates of crop evapotranspiration etc can support agricultural entities in ongoing efforts to improve on farm water use efficiency remote sensing approaches for calculating etc can be used to support wide area mapping of crop coefficients and etc with the goal of increasing access to spatially and temporally distributed information for these variables and advancing the use of evapotranspiration et data in irrigation scheduling and management we briefly review past work on the derivation of crop coefficients and etc data from satellite derived vegetation indices vi and evaluate the accuracy of a vi based approach for calculation of etc using a well instrumented drip irrigated sugar beet beta vulgaris field in the california central valley as a demonstration case sugar beets are grown around the world for sugar production and are also being evaluated in california as a potential biofuel crop as well as for their ability to scavenge nitrogen from the soil with important potential benefits for reduction of nitrate leaching from agricultural fields during the winter months in this study we evaluated the accuracy of etc data from the satellite irrigation management support sims framework for sugar beets using et data from a weighing lysimeter and a flux station instrumented with micrometeorological instrumentation we used the allen and pereira a p approach which was developed to estimate single and basal crop coefficients from crop fractional cover fc and height and combined with satellite derived fc data and grass reference et eto data as implemented within sims to estimate daily etc from sims etc sims for the sugar beet crop the accuracy of the daily etc sims data was evaluated against daily actual et data from the weighing lysimeter eta lys and actual et calculated using an energy balance approach from micrometeorological instrumentation eta eb over the course of the 181 day production cycle etc sims totaled 737 1 mm which was within 7 7 of total eta lys and 3 7 of eta eb on a daily timestep sims mean bias error was 0 31 mm day relative to eta lys and 0 15 mm day relative to eta eb the results from this study highlight the potential utility of applying satellite based fc data coupled with the a p approach to estimate etc for drip irrigated crops keywords crop coefficient crop evapotranspiration etc actual crop evapotranspiration eta eddy covariance energy balance residual remote sensing 1 introduction the california agricultural community is facing challenges related to the increasing interannual variability of precipitation and constraints on water resources in response to sustained declines in groundwater levels and the extreme drought that began in 2011 and extended through 2016 the sustainable groundwater management act sgma was passed by the california legislature in 2014 to regulate overdraft of aquifers and increase the sustainability of groundwater supplies additionally in 2012 groundwater regulations were added to the irrigated lands regulatory program in california to prevent agricultural runoff and leaching of fertilizers from irrigated fields from impacting surface and groundwater resources these policies have led to increased interest among the agricultural community in adopting new information technologies to support data driven approaches in irrigation management and scheduling with the goal of evaluating and potentially increasing on farm water use efficiency the food and agriculture organization irrigation and drainage paper 56 fao56 synthesized decades of research to provide a framework and methodology for computing crop water requirements though the integration of reference evapotranspiration calculated from meteorological data and crop coefficients allen et al 1998 fao56 provides look up tables and equations to support calculation of crop coefficients kc for a wide range of crops at different growth stages fao56 includes both single kc and dual kc approaches in the dual kc approach the kc value is determined through separate calculation of a basal crop coefficient kcb and a soil evaporation coefficient ke kcb is defined as evapotranspiration from a well watered crop with a dry soil surface kcb is used primarily to represent the transpiration component of et but also includes diffusive soil evaporation while ke is used to capture evaporation from exposed soil kcb and ke are summed to calculate the dual kc value which is then multiplied by the reference et calculated using the penman monteith equation from meteorological measurements obtained over a reference crop typically a well watered 0 12 m grass surface eto crop water stress can also be accounted for in this approach via incorporation of a stress coefficient ks calculated using a soil water balance model during the initial crop development period evaporation from exposed soil typically accounts for the majority of etc as the crop canopy develops evaporation from exposed soil decreases while the transpiration increases and eventually becomes the dominant process allen et al 1998 satellite observations enable estimation of crop water requirements on a regional scale with good spatial 30 m and temporal 5 8 days resolution kjaersgaard et al 2011 by providing near real time measurements of crop conditions through remote sensing at the scale of individual fields information can benefit growers by allowing them to accurately and easily monitor the crop canopy development and the crop water requirements trout et al 2008 previous studies have used remote sensing on various crops to estimate kc and kcb values from vegetation indices vis such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi calculated from satellite top of atmosphere toa reflectance or surface reflectance data and these results have demonstrated the potential value for the agricultural community of operational systems glenn etal 2007 pôças et al 2020 previous work related specifically to sugar beets using vis approach is limited however and includes a study by gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 that used satellite observed vis to obtain kcb values for sugar beets in spain their study concluded that there was value in using satellite vi data to estimate kcb values but did not evaluate the accuracy of the kcb or etc data instead the study focused on evaluation of crop yields and water productivity tasumi and allen 2007 also applied remote sensing and an energy balance model the mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric model to estimate kc values for sugar beets and other major crops grown in idaho in the u s sugar beet beta vulgaris is a valuable crop grown commercially with the purpose of producing sugar and biofuel panella et al 2015 kaffka et al 2014 described key factors in california that enable the suitability and potential of sugar beets for biofuel production under the energy independence and security act eisa of 2007 sugar beet was qualified as a potential feedstock for advanced biofuel production with the potential for greenhouse gas reductions of up to 50 110th congress 2007 due to the high sugar content beets could potentially double ethanol production compared to other feedstocks panella and kaffka 2010 furthermore sugar beet processing by products can serve as a soil amendment for nitrate reduction kumar et al 2002 as the use of satellite based models for estimating et becomes more common it is important to have robust ground based measurements across a range of crop types and growth forms that can be used to evaluate remotely sensed et surface reflectance based models typically use information in the visible and near infrared vnir wavelengths to estimate kc or kcb and then combine these values with daily eto values derived from meteorological data to calculate etc following the fao56 approach many previous studies have investigated the relationship between kc or kcb and vis bausch and neale 1987 bausch 1993 benedetti and rossini 1993 hunsaker et al 2003a 2003b 2005 glenn et al 2011 and pôças et al 2020 provide a recent review of the literature on this topic thermal based remote sensing approaches use thermal infrared tir measurements to solve energy balance equations to estimate et e g allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 kustas et al 2004 while there has been important recent progress on automation of energy balance models for field scale applications allen et al 2007 semmens et al 2016 sustained operational production of daily et estimates from energy balance approaches remains challenging vi based approaches for field scale etc mapping have a few key advantages for irrigation management applications first moderate resolution 10 300 m vnir measurements are available from a large constellation of satellite and airborne sources murray et al 2009 calera et al 2017 increasing the temporal resolution of the satellite measurements second the algorithms used in the models are computationally simpler and avoid the need for internal or scene by scene calibration rafn et al 2008 facilitating automated data processing over large areas and reducing data latency which is critical for irrigation management applications third vnir observations are available at higher spatial resolution compared to thermal based remote sensing for individual fields johnson and trout 2012 increasing the utility and accuracy for smaller fields without the need for pan sharpening or data fusion one important limitation of vi based approaches is that they typically estimate etc assuming well watered conditions and they are less sensitive to intermittent deficit irrigation and short term crop stress which can lead to overestimation of actual et for deficit irrigated crops glenn et al 2011 for irrigation management applications however estimation of etc assuming well watered conditions provides a consistent reference for the irrigator making it easier to adjust irrigation management to meet their production goals in contrast measurement of actual et eta requires the irrigator to use additional information to determine whether the eta represents stressed or unstressed conditions and then make corrections to calculate etc as the baseline for an intentional deficit irrigation regime a second limitation of vi based approaches is that they are less sensitive to evaporation from bare soil and require integration with a soil water balance model to estimate soil evaporation gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 melton et al 2012 while this can be an important limitation for estimation of evaporation from bare soil or sparsely covered fields during the winter the period during which soil evaporation is a significant percentage of total etc during active crop production is typically limited to a few weeks a key objective in this study was to determine how well etc from a vi based approach compared to ground based measurements and to characterize the overall impact of these two limitations on the accuracy of the etc estimates glenn et al 2011 evaluated different vi based methods used in et studies and provided evidence that this method can be applied to acquire accurate estimates of et of the various vis the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a widely used measure of vegetation density and condition goward et al 1991 one of the earliest applications of a vi based approach was described by bausch and neale 1987 and this study found that ndvi was highly correlated with leaf area index lai and fc these authors proposed a linear transformation between ndvi and kcb to represent a reflectance based crop coefficient kcb vi which tracked closely with kc measured by the weighing lysimeter this study concluded that the kcb vi approach could be used to schedule irrigation at field scales the kcb vi method has also been applied to numerous other crops yielding the conclusions that 1 the use of ndvi as a supplement to static kcb values can improve on farm water management hunsaker et al 2007a 2007b samani et al 2009 and 2 kcb vi also gave consistently accurate results and highlighted the potential to improve irrigation when plants are under aberrant conditions compared to those represented by conventional fao56 approaches hunsaker et al 2003a 2003b 2005 close correlation is commonly established between vegetation amount and transpiration where as vegetated cover increases transpiration increases glenn et al 2007 based on the strong relationship between ndvi and kcb trout et al 2008 and johnson and trout 2012 investigated the relationship between satellite derived ndvi and ground measured fractional cover fc the proportion of ground that is covered with green vegetation johnson and trout 2012 used a multispectral camera to measure the fc of 49 commercial fields that contained 18 different crop types over 11 landsat overpass dates they found that the landsat ndvi formed a strong linear relationship with measured fc supporting the use of satellite derived ndvi to calculate fc for agricultural crops due to the cost effectiveness and flexibility of satellite data remote sensing has been implemented to map kc and kcb values and estimate et on field and regional scales building on the studies described above melton et al 2012 developed the satellite irrigation management support sims framework which integrates satellite data and meteorological data from the california irrigation management information system cimis hart et al 2009 to provide data for ndvi fc kcb and et under well watered conditions with a dry soil surface which we notate as etc sims etc sims largely represents the transpiration component of et however sims does set kcb at a minimum of 0 15 to account for baseline evaporation from bare soil and includes diffusive soil evaporation melton et al 2012 in addition sims kcb values can be combined with a soil water balance model to calculate soil evaporation coefficients ke and crop stress coefficients ks following the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 sims was developed to support irrigation management and regional water accounting to help irrigators and water managers account for interannual variability and heterogeneity in field conditions various studies have discussed the importance of adjusting tabulated kc and kcb values provided by fao56 based on local conditions and climate variability pereira et al 2015 drerup et al 2017 a brief overview of sims is provided in section 2 2 and detailed information about the sims algorithms and workflow can be found in melton et al 2012 2020 and a full description of the allen and pereira a p equations encoded within sims is provided in pereira et al 2020 in a recent study melton et al 2018 described the improvements of sims summarized work to date quantifying the accuracy of etc sims and demonstrated the operational use of sims to improve irrigation management melton et al 2018 also conducted an accuracy assessment with in situ measurements over a dozen crop types in california results showed that seasonal etc sims estimates are within 9 mean absolute error mae of measured crop evapotranspiration for well watered crops and 15 mae across all crops studied including deficit irrigated crops such as wine grapes and cotton glenn et al 2011 found that discrepancies between et calculated from satellites and ground based instrumentation can range from 5 to 10 for lysimetry and 10 30 for open path eddy covariance here we refer to data from the satellite based approach as the modeled data and the et calculated from the ground based observations as the measurements recognizing that the et data from the ground based instrumentation also has errors and uncertainty and involves application of biophysical and micrometeorological models to calculate et values from the measurements collected on the ground glenn et al 2011 it is important to distinguish that actual et from weighing lysimeter eta lys and flux station eta eb stands for et calculated directly from measurements collected by instruments and includes soil evaporation and canopy transpiration as well as the impact of any crop water stress differently etc sims is determined from the combination of satellite vi derived kcb and eto etc sims does not account for soil evaporation and crop water stress unless it results in a reduction in biomass or crop geometry change hence a key question addressed by this study is the ability of etc sims to accurately estimate et despite these limitations as discussed by various studies when using vi based approaches for estimating and mapping etc a soil water balance model for the surface layer and the root zone may be utilized to further increase the accuracy of etc estimates if soil evaporation or crop water stress are major considerations campos et al 2013 mateos et al 2013 pôças et al 2015 odi lara et al 2016 the objective of this paper is to assess the accuracy and applicability of a vi based remote sensing model that incorporates the a p approach to estimate etc in sugar beets we also evaluated the accuracy of the eta eb measurements against eta lys measurements to evaluate the utility of using an energy balance residual approach for measurement of latent energy fluxes from a flux station our strategy in this assessment was to quantify each independently calibrated measurement that occurred simultaneously at the same location to evaluate the potential utility of the vi based remote sensing approach used by sims for estimation of etc for drip irrigated sugar beets 2 methods 2 1 study site the sugar beet field is located in five points ca lat 36 3379 long 120 1131 elev 82 0 m at the west side research and extension center wsrec with average annual precipitation of 175 mm the site has a flat terrain with a mediterranean climate of cool wet winters and warm dry summers the prevailing wind comes from the northwest fig 1 and the soil type at the site is panoche clay loam typic torriorthents the beets were planted on oct 22 2014 with a 0 15 m spacing between plants and a 0 02 m seeding depth the field was 106 m 348 ft long and 61 m 200 ft wide with 140 rows oriented 1 degree northwest the field was irrigated with sprinklers prior to planting through germination and the early stages of crop development and then the irrigation switched to surface drip irrigation on jan 2nd 2015 irrigation was measured in the field using flow meters badger meter milwaukee wi usa installed on two drip laterals in the field as well as from measurements recorded by the weighing lysimeter for the study period from jan 1st to june 30th 2015 the field was irrigated 2 3 times per week using the surface drip irrigation system and a total of 659 mm of water was applied fig 1 the wsrec staff managed the irrigation scheduling based on data from the weighing lysimeter located in the field california irrigation management information system cimis weather station 2 was used to obtain eto data this weather station lat 36 336222 long 120 112910 elev 86 9 m is located inside the wsrec field station and installed over a well watered grass field the field was harvested august 4th 2015 2 2 remotely sensed data the satellite irrigation management support sims system was developed to support mapping of crop development and crop water demand throughout california melton et al 2012 sims uses satellite derived surface reflectances to map ndvi fc and kcb basal crop coefficients to calculate the daily etc sims kcb is combined with daily eto data from the california department of water resources california irrigation management information system cimis sims can be driven with satellite data from multispectral instruments onboard satellites including landsat 5 landsat 7 landsat 8 sentinel 2a sentinel 2b and others that collect measurements in the vnir wavelengths for the comparisons with ground measurements of et described below atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data were obtained from the usgs landsat collection 1 for the operational land imager oli on landsat 8 landsat 7 and landsat 8 each have a 16 day revisit interval but since they are staggered one observation is available approximately every 8 days due to overlap in the scene boundaries landsat observations are available more frequently for some locations as was the case for our field site sims uses the highest quality cloud free observations for each pixel and composites them into a mosaic every eight days in cases where data is available from both landsat 7 and landsat 8 landsat 8 is given priority due to the fact that our study site is located within the overlap between path 42 and path 43 we were able to obtain one landsat 8 scene almost every 8 days excepting cloud cover landsat scenes used in this study can be found in table 1 2 3 calculation of etc sims from satellite data and cimis eto sims first calculates ndvi values from surface reflectance values as 1 ndvi nir r nir r where nir is the reflectance in the near infrared wavelengths and r is the reflectance in the red wavelengths ndvi is then linearly interpolated between cloud free satellite overpass dates to calculate a daily timeseries fig 2 next sims applies the equation described in trout et al 2008 and johnson and trout 2012 to map fc from ndvi at a spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m per pixel following eq 2 2 f c 1 26 ndvi 0 18 sims calculates kcb values via the fc values fig 2 calculated from the satellite observation using eq 2 and a density coefficient kd derived from a biophysical description of the canopy this approach follows allen and pereira 2009 eq 10 3 k d min 1 m l f c eff f c eff 1 1 h where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation h is the crop height fig 2 and ml is a canopy radiation transparency factor ranging from 1 5 to 2 0 allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020 kd links increase in kcb to increasing vegetation amount details of calculations of crop height are provided in pereira et al 2020 this issue and in the sims user manual melton et al 2020 for this study we used a ml of 2 0 for sugarbeet as a simplifying assumption to facilitate full automation the current release of sims assumes standard climate conditions kcb full which represents conditions at peak plant growth for conditions having nearly full ground cover is calculated as a simplified version of eq 7a of allen and pereira 2009 4 k cb full f r min 1 0 0 1h max 1 2 where fr range 0 1 is an adjustment factor related to stomatal regulation for annuals fr is assigned a standard value of 1 for perennials which tend to exhibit more stomatal control on transpiration fr is 1 and varies by crop type and seasonal growth stage allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020 for this study we used a fr of 1 0 for sugarbeet kcb is then derived following eq 5a from allen and pereira 2009 5 k cb sims k cb min k d k cb full k cb min where kcb min is set to 0 15 which is the minimum kcb value for bare soil under typical agricultural conditions allen and pereira 2009 values of hmax are drawn from table 12 of fao56 allen et al 1998 values for h are estimated for annual crops as a linear function of fc and hmax for tree and vine crops values from table 11 of fao56 are used for the late stage start and stop dates as a final step sims calculates etc sims following the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 as 6 et c sims k cb sims k e et o where kcb is the sims basal crop coefficient calculated from eq 5 ke is the soil evaporation coefficient and eto is the grass reference et due to the fact that reflectance based approaches are less sensitive to evaporation from exposed soil in eq 6 sims was originally developed to estimate kcb and currently must set the evaporation coefficient ke as equal to zero for wide area mapping et applications in a drip irrigated system with lines shaded by vegetation as in the present study this simplification is acceptable ongoing work will enhance sims to include a gridded soil water balance model to support calculation of ke for this study eto was obtained from spatial cimis hart et al 2009 operated by the california department of water resources while the spatial cimis data was used in this study outside of california sims utilizes eto data from gridmet abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 additional details on the a p approach and sims algorithms and documentation can be found in pereira et al 2020 and melton et al 2020 respectively 2 4 weighing lysimeter this site has a weighing lysimeter located in the center of the field consisting of a 2 m by 2 m by 2 25 m deep soil tank positioned on a mechanical tank scale model fs 4 cardinal scale manufacturing co webb city mo that is housed underground due to limitations on the lysimeter s accessibility by tractors the lysimeter plot was hand planted following the same scheme as the rest of the field the soil and plants in the lysimeter were irrigated from a supply tank located underneath the lysimeter each time the lysimeter weight decreased by 4 kg i e 1 mm of water on a daily basis et was monitored and computed through the weight change in the soil tank via the 91 kg capacity stainless steel s beam load cell omega engineering inc norwalk ct the data were logged onto a cr3000 datalogger campbell scientific inc logan ut once every 60 s the accuracy of the weighing lysimeter measurements is controlled through calibration in this study the calibration was done by using a known weight 40 200 kg on the surfaces of the lysimeter additionally two 0 3 kg weights were used to ensure detections of small changes the load cell then recorded and averaged three readings mv for each known weight last a linear regression between load cell readings x axis and weights y axis was determined and incorporated into the lysimeter s program besides the factory calibration in jan 2014 two additional calibrations were conducted on dec 23rd 2014 and feb 18th 2015 to validate and ensure the accuracy of the weighing lysimeter both calibrations produced very high coefficient of determination values r2 with 0 9999 for 2014 and 0 9998 for 2015 indicating a high level of accuracy of the weighing lysimeter the theory and details of the weighing lysimeter are well documented in the literature and details can be found in bryla et al 2010 specific details for the lysimeter used in this study are described in thao 2017 2 5 flux measurements open path eddy covariance opec is an approach that uses measurements collected by micrometeorological instrumentation to calculate et the opec approach has been extensively used to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration eta and validate remote sensing models moorhead et al 2019 full opec instrumentation includes both a 3d sonic anemometer and an infrared gas analyzer as a result it is quite expensive and many studies have also explored use of the residual of the energy balance reb approach which also uses a 3d sonic anemometer but does not require use of an infrared gas analyzer the reb approach applies the energy balance equation eq 8 to estimate latent heat flux density as the residual with a forced energy balance closure twine et al 2000 and this micrometeorological measurement is mainly implemented over vegetated regions pan et al 2017 anapalli et al 2018 used the reb approach in a cotton and a corn field in the cotton field which also had a large scale field lysimeter they found that et measured from the flux data compared well with et measured in the lysimeter yielding a rmse for daily et of 1 2 mm and a seasonal et error within 1 in the corn field they found a strong correlation between et measured from the flux data and reference et data for alfalfa and grass with pearson s correlation coefficients of 0 81 and 0 70 respectively their results demonstrated that the reb procedure is a possible alternative method for calculation of actual et from micrometeorological instrumentation and a cost effective alternative to eta measurements from lysimetry and opec systems flux measurements require enough fetch the horizontal distance from sensor to predominant wind direction to achieve representative measurements from an area of interest a general rule of thumb requires a fetch to measurement height ratio of 100 1 over a homogenous and flat surface with no sudden changes in landcover businger 1986 gash 1986 horst and weil 1994 tanner 1988 however burba 2001 conducted ec measurements over a tallgrass prairie and found that over 80 of the latent heat flux came from 80 m within the predominant wind for a measurement height of 1 5 m additionally they examined the effect of roughness on fetch and found that the largest contribution of latent heat flux came from 12 to 18 m and 30 35 m of predominant wind distance for high canopy height of 0 6 m and low canopy height 0 05 m roughness respectively in this study the reb station following the approach described by linquist et al 2015 was deployed to estimate latent heat flux density and calculate the eta eb from the residual of the energy balance one limitation of the reb approach is that it does not provide a direct measurement of latent heat fluxes via an infrared gas analyzer and a sonic anemometer and instead derives the latent heat flux through the residual as a result the energy balance closure as described in twine et al 2000 is not determinable our study site has a flat terrain with a predominant wind from the northwest with a secondary contribution from north northwest fig 1 due to the small size of the area of study a ratio of 100 1 is restricted to best ensure a sufficient fetch while avoiding edges of the field we placed the station about 90 m from the predominant wind as shown in fig 1 the assembly of the station was based on procedures described by mcelrone et al 2013 all data were logged and stored in a datalogger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut a data logger program was used for data acquisition and post processing following the steps described in shapland et al 2013 the station was maintained and adjusted weekly so that all sensors were clean and functioning properly 2 5 1 net radiation and ground heat flux density a two way net radiometer nr lite 2 net radiometer kipp zonen delft netherlands was maintained at 2 m above the canopy to measure net radiation rn the total incoming radiation minus the total outgoing radiation six soil heat flux plates rebs hft3 heat flux plate rebs inc seattle wa usa were buried at a depth of 5 cm each plate was paired with soil thermocouple probes tcav soil thermocouple probe campbell scientific inc logan ut usa installed on either side of the plate with one probe installed diagonally from a depth of 5 2 cm and the second probe installed diagonally from 2 cm to 5 cm six capacitance probes decagon 10hs meter group pullman wa usa were also installed near each soil heat flux sensor package at a depth of 5 cm to measure volumetric water content these sensors provided measurements of ground heat flux g that included the soil heat flux across the heat flow transducer gt and change in heat storage in the soil layer above the transducers s such that g gt s shapland et al 2013 2 5 2 sensible heat flux density from eddy covariance a three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer 81000 3d sonic anemometer rm young traverse city mi usa was maintained at 1 5 m above the canopy to collect wind velocity and sonic temperature with a sampling frequency of 10 hz to measure sensible heat flux density h from the sonic anemometer via the covariance of the vertical wind and the sonic temperature eq 7 swinbank 1951 7 h ρ a c p w t s where ρ a is the air density g m 3 cp is the specific heat of air at constant pressure j g 1 k 1 w is the speed of vertical wind component m s 1 and ts is the sonic temperature k w t s is the covariance between the vertical wind component and the sonic temperature with a two dimensional coordinate rotation tanner and thurtell 1969 a two dimensional rotation is also implemented within the logger program meyers and baldocchi 2005 2 5 3 latent heat flux density and evapotranspiration the latent heat flux density an indirect measurement is determined from the residual of the energy balance twine et al 2000 8 λ e r n g h where λe is the latent heat flux density mj m 2 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 g is the ground heat flux density mj m 2 and h is the sensible heat flux density mj m 2 all flux densities were converted from w m 2 to mj m 2 for the calculation above with gap filling via linear interpolation applied prior to being used in the calculation of λe these instantaneous half hourly λe were then computed into daily profiles the mass flux density of water vapor et mm is then determined as 9 et λ e λ where λ is the latent heat of evaporation which equals 2 45 mj per 0 0001 m3 3 results 3 1 energy balance components the hourly values 24 h profile for each of the individual energy balance components throughout the season were averaged to construct the seasonal mean hourly energy balance the flux densities rn and g usually increased around 6am and transitioned into stable conditions after 6pm during summer in the central valley as the daily average temperature increases throughout the season we would expect a positive trend in h similar to rn and g however we observed a decrease in h as the season moved towards summer suggesting that incoming radiant energy was not the only source of incoming energy on a finer resolution in fig 3 we observed low or negative daytime h cyan to light green hue from late may to the beginning of july which indicates an advection effect as additional energy other than radiation was added into the system to investigate this we evaluated ndvi data around the field throughout the season to examine the local environmental conditions and assess the potential for advection effects an example from a landsat 8 image acquired on june 2nd is shown in fig 4 the field is surrounded by pixels with low ndvi indicating bare dry soil in the fields adjacent to our study site one possible reason for the advection effect observed might be that in 2015 as a result of the exceptional drought in california most of the surrounding fields were left bare and the study field was one of the only irrigated fields at wsrec with a predominant wind from the nw the cooler environmental system in the field serves as a sink of energy as heat transfer will occur spontaneously from higher temperature bodies to lower temperature bodies during canopy development more areas were shaded resulting in cooler soil temperatures which further increased the field s ability to absorb heat consequentially the additional energy stimulated the growth of λe based on the energy balance presented in eq 8 for periods with negative daily h in order to avoid uncertainties associated with nighttime fluxes we used the daytime 6am 6pm inclusive h along with corresponding daytime rn and g to calculate the residual of the energy balance instead of using linear interpolation by using daytime fluxes when daytime h is below zero the possibility of the field serving as a daytime sink of energy is not neglected while avoiding the uncertainties with nighttime fluxes due to the fact that the closure was forced inherently by the reb approach it is important that we were able to compare the data from reb station against the weighing lysimeter this allowed us to assess the accuracy of λe via the comparison with the weighing lysimeter data which agreed well figs 5 and 6 3 2 daily evapotranspiration and intercomparison 3 2 1 comparisons between methods all daily et values collected during the growing season from the flux station weighing lysimeter and sims were plotted against each other to test the strength of the relationship between measurements fig 5 in addition statistical metrics for the comparison of daily etc sims against eta lys and eta eb were computed table 2 overall the results of the comparison between measurements showed good agreement with r2 values above 0 9 in all cases in the comparison between ground measurements the trendline suggests that a slight underestimation of eta eb relative to eta lys was observed for the lower values of eta while an overestimation occurred for the higher eta values the comparison of daily etc sims against eta lys also showed good agreement with model efficiency ef of 0 91 regression coefficient close to 1 mae of 0 56 mm day root mean squared error rmse of 0 73 mm day and mean bias error mbe of 0 31 mm day in the comparison between daily etc sims against eta eb etc sims had a small positive bias relative to eta eb mbe of 0 15 mm day the model ef was high 0 93 mae was only 0 47 mm day and rmse was 0 65 mm day table 2 3 2 2 intercomparison of evapotranspiration from the fc data shown in fig 2 we estimated the lengths of crop stages and plotted linear regressions representing each growth stage in the comparison between etc sims and eta lys a close relationship was obtained for both mid and late seasons while an underestimation of etc sims was observed in the initial and crop establishment stage the comparison between etc sims and eta eb showed that there was slight overestimation of etc sims for the mid season however closer relationships between the two sets of data were observed in the initial and crop establishment stage and late seasons fig 6 in figs 7 and 8 vertical lines were drawn to distinguish growth stages where the first section is the initial and crop development stage 01 01 2015 02 26 2015 the second section is the mid season 02 27 2015 06 02 2015 and the last section is the late season 06 03 2015 06 30 2015 on a daily timestep eta lys and eta eb tracked closely with each other fig 7 over the development stage the weighing lysimeter in general had the highest et and eta lys was consistently higher than eta eb and etc sims though agreement between these measurements increased as the crop reached maturity etc sims was generally the lowest likely due to the soil evaporation from exposed soil which is only considered to a limited extent in etc sims as the canopy develops transpiration becomes dominant and increased alignment among all measurements was observed e g during the mid season and towards the end of the crop cycle a max etc sims of 7 88 mm was observed on may 31st compared to 7 98 mm for eta lys and 7 28 mm for eta eb fig 7 during crop establishment daily etc sims underestimated eta lys and eta eb by 51 0 and 8 2 respectively during mid season daily etc sims performed very well with an underestimation of 3 5 and an overestimation of 6 9 compared to eta lys and eta eb respectively similar patterns were observed in late season where etc sims overestimated both eta lys and eta eb by 0 6 fig 6 representing very strong agreement overall daily kc lys and kc eb values were calculated from eta lys and eta eb by dividing the daily et values by the daily eto from cimis station 2 daily kcb sims values were calculated through linear interpolation between the satellite based kcb values from sims calculated on satellite overpass dates the daily kc and kcb timeseries from each of these data sources are plotted in fig 8 over the entire study period daily kc lys and kc eb measurements were noisy while kcb values from sims kcb sims stayed relatively smooth due to the dependence on satellite ndvi measurements which track crop canopy development kcb sims presented a relatively dynamic curve with a max kcb sims of 1 02 highlighting the value of using satellite data to measure variations in crop canopy density and extent relative to idealized conditions sims accompanied by both the lysimeter and flux station entered the mid season 15 days earlier than crop growth stages suggested in fao56 this result illustrates the ability of satellite data to capture localized variability in rates of crop canopy development driven by variations in agronomic practices and interannual variability in weather conditions during the mid and late season when soil evaporation was low kcb sims aligned closely with kc lys and kc eb fig 8 the cumulative values of et throughout the sugar beet crop cycle for the various sources are presented in fig 9 on the primary y axis the seasonal total of eta lys was 793 9 mm eta eb was 709 6 mm and etc sims was 737 1 mm on the secondary y axis the total irrigation and precipitation was 696 6 mm seasonally etc sims was 7 7 lower than eta lys and 3 7 higher than eta eb we also separated cumulative et into corresponding crop stages during initial and crop establishment cumulative etc sims eta lys eta eb were 51 3 mm 81 8 mm and 59 9 mm respectively during mid season cumulative etc sims eta lys eta eb was 491 2 mm 518 4 mm and 456 6 mm respectively during late season cumulative etc sims eta lys eta eb was 194 6 mm 193 7 mm and 193 1 mm respectively 4 discussion 4 1 comparison between ground measurements during the growing season the weighing lysimeter was carefully maintained to ensure data quality additionally it was calibrated twice with high r2 values of 0 9999 in december 2014 and 0 9998 in february 2015 this supported the accuracy and reliability of the measurements from the weighing lysimeter over the course of the study daily average eta eb was 8 lower than eta lys fig 5 moorhead et al 2019 reported similar findings for sorghum and corn with a daily underestimation of 14 using eq 8 with h calculated from a scintillometer although weighing lysimeters are generally considered to provide the most accurate characterization of et howell et al 1985 evett et al 2012 the wsrec weighing lysimeter similar to most weighing lysimeters has a calibrated irrigation system 1 mm of water 4 kg weight loss and is maintained differently than the rest of the field compared to weighing lysimeters reb is a portable and cost effective alternative that captures a more complete spatial representation of the field however without the direct measurement of the latent energy flux it is not possible to evaluate the energy balance closure and thus difficult to evaluate the accuracy without a second independent measurement by forcing closure some of the storage terms are also neglected in the reb approach in future studies it would be preferable to employ an infrared gas analyzer to benchmark the reb approach across different crop types overall when compared to the eta lys data at this site eta eb agrees well with underestimation of 11 at a seasonal timestep fig 9 and a mae of 8 at a daily timestep fig 5 this level of agreement shows strong potential for use of the reb approach in water management applications when use of lysimetry or full opec instrumentation is not feasible 4 2 intercomparison and implications for kcb from ndvi the overall pattern in daily et for the crop is summarized in fig 7 daily et peaked at approximately 8 23 mm day and 8 55 mm day for the weighing lysimeter and reb station respectively the timing of this peak corresponded with a maximum etc sims value of 7 96 mm day the maximum kcb sims was 1 02 as shown in fig 8 hauer et al 2015 used field measured canopy height and fc coupled with a p approach and found a maximum kcb of 1 12 for a sugar beet field gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 derived a maximum kcb using a soil adjusted vegetation index savi ranging from 1 0 1 2 from four sugar beet fields fao56 table 12 lists kc mid value of 1 2 and fao56 table 17 lists kcb mid value of 1 15 for sugar beet under well watered conditions in sub humid climates allen et al 1998 the maximum kcb sims compared well with these studies although at the lower end following the period of maximum daily et around june 18th there is a sharp decline in etc sims and both sets of ground measurements which correspond to the end of irrigation for the field and the onset of senescence of the crop figs 7 and 8 this suggests that kcb sims has the ability to accurately capture localized information especially at the peak crop stage fig 8 in addition kcb sims values throughout the crop cycle are within the range of values obtained by gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 where the vi based approach to estimate kcb was also applied 4 3 strengths and limitations of sims due to the reliance primarily on measurement in the visible and near infrared wavelengths sims can be implemented using remote sensing data from a variety of satellite and airborne platforms including landsat and sentinel 2 using data from multiple satellites sims can currently update satellite derived ndvi fc and kcb values every 4 5 days through the combined use of data from landsat 8 sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b johnson et al 2016 showed in field trials for lettuce and broccoli that use of sims data with other irrigation and nutrient management applications such as cropmanage developed by the university of california agriculture and natural resources ucanr institute resulted in reductions in applied water of 20 40 relative to static irrigation schedules daily etc sims considerably underestimated daily eta lys by 51 0 on average during the crop development stage fig 6 which is likely due to the model s parametrizations of the diffusive evaporative component this suggests that incorporation of a gridded soil water balance model to account for evaporation from bare soil via calculation of ke values is necessary to help sims provide a better estimation of etc during the period of initial and crop establishment stages during the mid to late season good agreement was observed between each independent measurement of et from the sugar beet field fig 6 as reported in glenn et al 2011 the uncertainty between satellite estimated et and in situ measurements can generally range from 5 10 for lysimetry and 10 30 for flux data similar results were found in padilla et al 2011 where they used a kcb vi approach complemented with a soil water balance for ke and stress coefficient to estimate et in wheat and corn their modeled results compared well with both daily eta measured from ec and the lysimeter with an average overestimation of 8 mateos et al 2013 used a kcb vi approach in conditions of no water stress in cotton and found their modeled results overestimated daily eta measured from ec by less than 10 we found that the seasonal difference of etc sims was 7 7 lower than eta lys and 3 7 higher than eta eb fig 9 the rmse values for the comparison between etc sims and eta lys 0 73 mm table 2 and between etc sims and eta eb 0 65 mm table 2 are in agreement with rmse reported 0 75 mm in mateos et al 2013 the high modeling efficiency for the comparison 1 between eta lys and etc sims 0 91 2 between eta eb and etc sims 0 93 further indicates the good performance of sims table 2 these results suggest that sims is able to provide et estimates within the expected range of uncertainty of the in situ measurements the close alignment of etc sims with eta lys and eta eb from mid and late season figs 6 and 7 further showcases that kcb sims calculated using the a p approach coupled with satellite derived vi and fc data has the potential for operational et estimation for irrigation management of sugar beets although daily etc sims underestimated eta lys by only 2 97 throughout the whole growing period as shown in fig 5 the approach used to calculate etc sims from satellite derived vi data misses soil evaporation during the crop establishment period fig 7 compared to daily average eta lys etc sims greatly underestimated et by 51 0 during the crop establishment period versus a 3 5 underestimation during mid season and a 0 6 overestimation for end season fig 6 the underestimations during the initial and establishment periods suggest that the limitation of missing soil evaporation is evident while the later close alignments confirm that etc sims agrees well with eta lys once the crop canopy is established validating the use of kcb from ndvi with a p approach when compared to daily eta eb daily etc sims overestimated et by 4 6 during the entire crop cycle fig 5 throughout crop stages daily etc sims consistently overestimated eta eb except the 8 2 underestimation during the initial and crop establishment fig 6 the underestimation further proves the need to account for soil evaporation in the early stages the later overestimations could be caused by flux measurements as any overestimations in h or underestimations in rn and g would result an underestimation of λe based on eq 8 however this is unknown due to the lack of determination of the energy balance closure further highlighting the importance of having an independent measurement of λe along with other energy balance sensors considering phenology directly influences evaporative rates it could be beneficial to incorporate other climatic variables within sims since accurate estimations of kcb are contingent on the crop growth stages richardson et al 2013 hunsaker et al 2002 although this study demonstrated strong alignment between sims and two independent field measurements of et variables including cumulative growing degree days cgdd derived by maximum minimum and base temperature could be used to determine crop growth stages and better construct the kcb curve for mid and late season in the future stegman 1988 slack et al 1996 raes et al 2012 this has previously been done in studies such as hunsaker et al 2003a 2003b where they used cgdd in addition to ndvi to construct the kcb curve r2 0 82 after full canopy cover ndvi 0 8 however as advection can affect surface energy dynamics it is important to distinguish a reasonable temperature threshold should cgdd be incorporated with ndvi 5 conclusion the performance of sims for et mapping was evaluated in a drip irrigated sugar beet field in the california central valley over a 181 day crop cycle the accuracy of etc sims was assessed against et data from a weighing lysimeter and a reb flux station daily etc sims data was derived from landsat 8 surface reflectance data coupled with the a p approach comparisons performed in this study for etc sims yielded an rmse of 0 73 mm day and 0 65 mm day compared to eta lys and eta eb respectively seasonally etc sims totaled 737 1 mm which was within 7 7 of total eta lys and 3 7 of eta eb daily etc sims was 0 55 mm day lower than daily eta lys on average resulting in an underestimation relative to eta lys of 38 7 mm during the initial crop establishment period highlighting the limited sensitivity of vi based approaches to soil evaporation once the crop canopy began to develop however there was strong alignment between etc sims and eta lys with differences of only 0 25 mm day as transpiration become the predominant component of et etc sims also agreed well during this period with eta eb with differences of 0 31 mm day etc sims also had better agreement with eta eb during the initial crop establishment period with differences of only 0 01 mm day results from use of the reb approach in this study are promising and show reasonable overall agreement with the lysimeter measurement in the future deployment of an irga alongside the reb instrumentation would be important in benchmarking the performance of the reb approach before extensive use as the sole ground data source for assessment of remotely sensed et estimates acknowledging the underestimation of soil evaporation during the initial period of crop establishment we conclude that etc sims is able to provide reasonable daily and seasonal estimates of etc for sugar beets especially during the mid and late season this assessment of sims further supports the utility of applying satellite vi based methods coupled with the a p approach to estimate etc for drip irrigated crops to address the underestimation of soil evaporation during the initial period of crop establishment future studies should incorporate a gridded soil water balance model to support calculation of ke to estimate soil evaporation within sims currently sims is being implemented and validated for a wide range of crop types in the salinas valley and central valley in california and ongoing work is supporting expansion across the western u s the ability of sims to rapidly estimate field scale etc via fully automated methods could be useful and significant to agricultural producers and water resource managers for future water use efficiency and conservation efforts declaration
