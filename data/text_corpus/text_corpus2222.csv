11110,to determine the specific application rate for each management zone of a variable rate irrigation system the yield and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat were evaluated during two growing seasons at different deficit levels in the alluvial flood plain of the north china plain one 1 64 ha quadrant irrigated by a variable rate center pivot system was delineated into four management zones with available soil water holding capacity and varied soil profiles were detected in these zones each zone was divided into several subzones to be irrigated at different deficit levels in the 2016 season each subzone was managed individually with irrigation trigger points of 55 65 75 and 80 of field capacity along with a rain fed treatment in the 2017 season all subzones were irrigated simultaneously with 0 33 67 100 and 120 of the base application depth for the two season study the rain fed treatment produced significantly lower yield and wue than the irrigated treatments and both the maximum yield and the maximum wue were obtained in zone 2 where a more uniform soil profile was detected a linear crop water production function was determined for zones 1 and 3 in the 2017 season while a quadratic equation fit the crop water production function well for other zones in the two seasons the relationship between wue and crop water use in the three zones can be represented by a curvilinear equation for both seasons taking the optimal application rate of maximizing wue in zone 1 as a basis 89 and 94 of the rate in zone 1 was recommended for zones 2 and 3 respectively to achieve the maximum wue in the entire field our results also suggested that the existing layered textural soil profile can greatly influence crop productivity and should therefore be considered in mapping irrigation prescriptions keywords center pivot deficit irrigation yield water use efficiency layered soil irrigation prescription 1 introduction irrigation is vital for agricultural production and a substantially higher crop yield was obtained on irrigated land than on rain fed land in china cao et al 2015 however available water resources for irrigation are increasingly limited for example the north china plain which has a semi arid climate and produces nearly 75 of the wheat in china has long been suffering from severe water shortages the exploitation of groundwater accounts for 70 of the total water utilization and 79 of the groundwater is pumped for irrigated agriculture zhang et al 2013 proper irrigation management to improve water use efficiency wue is critical for sustainable crop production in this region cao et al 2017 having the ability to allocate varied water amounts in different management zones variable rate irrigation vri systems provide the possibility and flexibility to enhance wue by arraying spatially variable thresholds o shaughnessy et al 2015 or by varying water application depths across a field o shaughnessy and evett 2010 sui and yan 2017 however it is not straightforward how to best manage irrigation with these systems and often the management does not save water or much water it meant that vri is of limited utility without precise irrigation scheduling howell et al 2012 in recent years extensive attention has been given to available soil water holding capacity awc hedley et al 2010 and electrical conductivity larue 2011 sui and yan 2017 for developing management zones and prescription maps although the final conclusions about the irrigation date and amount in different management zones have not yet been determined a common finding is that the management zone with a high awc received a minor irrigation amount evans et al 2013 when the parameter of awc was used to delineate the management zones the awc value in a specific location was the average value in the top 0 0 6 m depths where the majority root zone concentrated hedley et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 and there was no consideration about the soil layers in fact layered soils inevitably exist in many fields as a result of geological processes numerous studies have shown that an interface exists in layered soils whether fine over coarse or coarse over fine limited downward water movement and increased soil water storage in the top layer soil jury and horton 2004 li and liu 2011 these results suggest that the varied soil layers in a field might affect the prescription maps for vri management based on the measurement of soil water content to generate the prescription map knowledge about crop response crop water production functions wpfs to variable water inputs is helpful evans et al 2013 although extensive research for several decades has indicated that wpfs have linear or quadratic functions musick et al 1994 shen et al 1995 schneider and howell 2001 wang et al 2006 wpfs are site specific because of the variability of soil and climatic conditions rajput and singh 1986 sadler et al 2002 tolk and howell 2003 even in an individual field the variation in awc has a substantial influence on the growth parameters yield and water productivity of crop for example through a two season measurement of winter wheat response for a variable rate irrigation system with three management zones zhao et al 2017 reported that the maximum yield was obtained in the zone with the medium awc rather than in the zones with the greatest awc where layered textural soil existed the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the effect of awc and layered textural soil on irrigation scheduling based on soil water content sensors 2 verify the assumption that different water production potentials exist in management zones and 3 generate an irrigation prescription map by means of wpfs in different management zones with the goal of obtaining the maximum wue under a semi arid climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study was conducted from october 2015 to june 2016 referred to as the 2016 season and from october 2016 to june 2017 referred to as the 2017 season during the growing season of winter wheat in zhuozhou 39 45 n and 115 85 e hebei province china this site is located in the taihang mountain alluvial flood plain and experiences a warm and semi arid climate with an annual mean temperature of 11 6 c and an annual mean precipitation of 563 3 mm the experimental area was one 1 64 ha quadrant controlled by a variable rate center pivot irrigation system and the vri control unit of the system was developed by the china institute of water resources and hydropower research zhao et al 2014 weak topographic variations with an average slope of 0 18 and a 0 14 m elevation difference were found across the field prior to the experiments the hydraulic performance of the vri system was tested by field evaluation to guarantee control precision zhao et al 2014 four management zones were delineated using awc by soil sampling at 110 locations of a 12 m 12 m grid the awc range was determined to be 152 161 161 171 171 185 and 185 205 mm within the top 1 0 m soil profile and the average field capacity calculated by the wilcox method wilcox 1962 was 0 21 0 22 0 23 and 0 25 cm3 cm 3 within the 0 6 m soil profile for zones 1 z1 2 z2 3 z3 and 4 z4 respectively accordingly the areas were 0 33 0 76 0 18 and 0 28 ha for z1 z2 z3 and z4 respectively varied soil profiles were detected in different management zones fig 1 in z1 the sand fraction largely increased with depth 57 8 89 5 small ranges of the sand fraction 59 8 65 8 and clay fraction 4 6 5 7 were observed at different depths in z2 showing a relatively uniform profile a fine middle layer 47 9 sand and 8 6 clay at the 0 2 to 0 4 m soil profile was found in z3 suggesting a clearly layered textural profile in the zone in z4 the mean sand and clay fractions in the 0 0 4 m soil layers were 55 4 and 7 4 respectively lots of gravels were found below the 0 4 m depth after the burying of water pipelines therefore z4 was not included in this study since it loses its representativeness to the alluvial flood plain more details about the soil parameters and management zones were described in zhao et al 2017 2 2 experimental design according to the area of each management zone z1 z2 and z3 were equally divided into four five and four subzones respectively for each management zone the subzones were randomly arranged in the zone without reconsidering the variation of awc within management zones the first span of the center pivot was not used in this study due to its small area of coverage to represent different deficit levels the rain fed treatment z1t0 z2t0 and z3t0 referred to as t0 and the treatments triggered at different irrigation trigger points of 55 z1t1 z2t1 and z3t1 referred to as t1 65 z1t2 z2t2 and z3t2 referred to as t2 75 z1t3 z2t3 and z3t3 referred to as t3 and 80 z2t4 of field capacity were scheduled in the 2016 season resulting in a total of thirteen experimental treatment subzones in the field fig 2 a once the irrigation trigger point for a treatment was reached the machine would pass through and apply an irrigation depth of 20 mm that was determined by considering the travel speed of the center pivot and the peak daily water use o shaughnessy and evett 2010 such a vri management approach means that the duty cycle was set 100 i e always on in the treatment the other treatments did not receive any irrigation until the threshold for that subzone was reached in the 2017 season the deficit irrigation levels in each management zone were applied by changing the irrigation rates to 0 z1t0 z2t0 and z3t0 referred to as t0 33 z1t1 z2t1 and z3t1 referred to as t1 67 z1t2 z2t2 and z3t2 referred to as t2 100 z1t3 z2t3 and z3t3 referred to as t3 and 120 z2t4 of the base application depth the base application depth was 20 mm before the flowering stage and 30 mm thereafter the irrigation was triggered when the mean soil water content depletion in the z1t3 subzone exceeded the threshold of 0 45 of the awc approximately 66 of the field capacity the z1 with minimum awc was selected as the trigger zone of irrigation aimed at maximizing yield potential in the entire field zhao et al 2017 once irrigation was triggered irrigation amounts delivered to all thirteen treatments were achieved by regulating the appropriate solenoid valves at duty cycles of 0 33 67 100 and 120 of the base application depth a tdr trime tube system trime t3 imko ltd ettlingen germany was used to monitor the soil water content six ten and three access tubes were installed approximately in the center of a 12 m 12 m grid in each treatment of z1 z2 and z3 respectively fig 2b these soil water content sensors were used in both 2016 and 2017 seasons to determine the irrigation date mean soil water contents in each irrigation treatment were measured daily at 0 2 0 4 m layer to approximately represent the average soil water content li et al 2009 gao et al 2011 during the 2016 season while daily measurement of soil water content in z1t3 treatment to determine the irrigation date was extended to 0 0 4 m depths during the 2017 season this change was aimed at avoiding triggering irrigation too frequently caused by layered textural properties of soil in management zones especially in z3 during both irrigation seasons in addition to determining the irrigation date all access tubes in each subzone were measured in 0 2 m increments to a depth of 1 2 m every seven to ten days to evaluate the influence of deficit irrigation on water flux in different soil layers the rain forecast information of the following three days was considered in the two seasons to make full use of the rainfall the water applied would be decreased by 0 20 and 40 for light less than 10 mm moderate between 10 mm and 25 mm and heavy rain more than 25 mm wang et al 2005 according to the forecast report from the national meteorological center of china meteorological administration there was no additional application except for seedling emergence and aiding fertilization in the rain fed treatments an application of 20 mm irrigation was delivered for seedling emergence for all the treatments in both seasons winter wheat triticum aestivum l jimai no 22 was seeded on october 14 2015 and on october 11 2016 with rows 0 15 m apart and the seeding rate was 375 kg ha 1 all subzones were fertilized uniformly based on typical cultural practices for yield potential specifically the total amounts of nitrogen phosphorus p2o5 and potassium k2o applied were 175 138 and 90 kg ha 1 respectively all phosphorus and potassium fertilizers and 54 kg ha 1 of nitrogen were applied as basal fertilizers the remaining nitrogen was applied on march 15 2016 and on april 2 2017 and 20 mm of water was immediately applied after broadcast fertilization to enhance the fertilizer use efficiency 2 3 data collection and analysis at harvest seven rows of winter wheat of 1 m length 1 05 m2 were harvested near the center of each grid there were six ten and three replications in each treatment in z1 z2 and z3 resulting in 86 sampling locations in total in the 2016 season winter wheat was harvested on june 3 in the rain fed treatments and on june 12 in the irrigated treatments in the 2017 season it was harvested from june 1 to june 5 in the rain fed treatments and on june 9 in the irrigated treatments to deal with the different maturation times grain yields were oven dried at 75 c and corrected to 13 moisture in addition yield components number of productive ears ear length number of grains per ear and the 1000 grain weight were measured to explain the differences in yield among the treatments the reference evapotranspiration et0 mm was calculated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the climatic parameters used in this equation and the total precipitation were collected from a weather station watchdog 2000 spectrum technologies inc usa installed approximately 100 m away from the study field the actual evapotranspiration eta mm was calculated using the following water balance equation allen et al 1998 1 e t a i p e d p r o f f δ s where i is the irrigation applied mm pe is the effective rainfall mm which was calculated by multiplying the total rainfall by the reduction coefficient the coefficient is 0 0 8 and 0 7 when the total rainfall is less than 5 mm between 5 mm and 50 mm and more than 50 mm respectively dp is the deep percolation mm which was neglected because there was no obvious influence of irrigation and precipitation on soil water movement below the 0 6 m layer this will be discussed in the following section roff is runoff caused by irrigation mm which was also ignored due to the weak topographic variations in this field and the low irrigation rate for each event 20 30 mm and δs is the variation in soil water storage mm in the 0 1 2 m soil layers between the initial and terminal stages water use efficiency wue was calculated in each treatment by dividing the average crop yield by eta in each grid the wue values were reported in units of kg of grain per cubic meter of water received all data were analyzed using the statistical product and service solutions spss 16 0 software package spss 2007 one way analysis of variance anova was used to test whether the awc or deficit irrigation had a significant effect on yield and wue at the 0 05 probability level duncan s test was also performed on all management zones and irrigation levels at the 0 05 probability level 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic factors the monthly climatic factors such as the maximum air temperature tmp mean relative humidity rh cumulative solar radiation srd and cumulative reference evapotranspiration c et0 during the two growing seasons of winter wheat are shown in table 1 in both seasons the lowest tmp and srd were from december to february of the next year meaning cold weather after that the tmp and srd increased sharply until harvest the maximum daily solar radiation was 39 mj m2 d in the 2016 season and 24 mj m2 d in the 2017 season and the maximums were observed in late april and may respectively the variation of c et0 was consistent with that of the srd the maximum daily et0 was approximately 7 3 mm but it occurred in late april the rh was less than 50 in most of the growing seasons it ranged from 35 to 80 in the 2016 season and from 36 to 72 in the 2017 season the monthly mean values of tmp rh srd and c et0 were 23 c 52 323 mj m2 and 74 mm in the 2016 season and 23 c 52 322 mj m2 and 75 mm in the 2017 season respectively no obvious differences in these climatic factors were found between the two seasons 3 2 rainfall and irrigation the seasonal application amount and rainfall for different irrigation treatments in the 2016 and 2017 seasons are shown in fig 3 there were thirty two precipitation events in total in the 2016 season and all of them were light rain in the 2017 season twenty five precipitation events occurred of which twenty one were light rains and the remaining were medium the seasonal rainfall was similar in the 2016 80 1 mm and 2017 80 3 mm seasons being less than the long term average of 126 mm zhang et al 2002 a more uniform temporal distribution was found in the 2016 season than in the 2017 season to aid germination and fertilization the rain fed treatments received an additional irrigation amount of 46 mm in the 2016 season and 40 mm in the 2017 season in the irrigation treatments the responses of the seasonal irrigation amount to deficit irrigation levels were different among the three management zones in the 2016 season in z1 the seasonal irrigation amount ranged from 300 to 380 mm among the irrigation treatments and the maximum value was obtained in the z1t2 treatment with the medium irrigation trigger point the widest variation in irrigation amount among the irrigation treatments was observed in z2 226 to 416 mm where the minimum irrigation amount was obtained in the z2t2 treatment and the maximum in the z2t4 treatment in z3 similar irrigation amount was received for all irrigation treatments 380 to 396 mm the phenomenon that the irrigation amount did not fully increase with the increment of irrigation trigger points might be caused by different initial soil water content in the 0 2 0 4 m layer in various subzones fig 4 differing from the common view that a minor irrigation amount was received in the management zone with higher awc the mean irrigation amount in z2 234 mm was 12 and 22 less than that in z1 267 mm and z3 301 mm respectively this result could be explained by the seasonal change in soil water content in the 0 1 2 m layers in each treatment fig 4 the hindrance of the existing interface between adjacent layers on the downward water flux in z1 and z3 resulted in a less depletion of soil water storage within the root zone in these zones especially in z3 fig 4 for example the average depletion of soil water storage for z2 34 mm approximately doubled the value for z1 18 mm and z3 14 mm in the 2016 season then a more frequent irrigation was triggered for z1 and z3 than for z2 this suggests that vri management based on soil water content measurement should carefully select the measurement depth when layered textural soils exist the soil water content sensors should not be positioned beneath the interface to capture the average status of soil water content within the root zone in the 2017 season the irrigation amounts of 153 263 and 370 mm were applied at the 33 67 and 100 treatment in each management zone respectively the seasonal change in soil water content in the 0 1 2 m layers decreased in most subzones fig 5 compared with that in the 2016 season fig 4 this was attributed to the higher terminal soil water content that resulted from the large rainfall at the end of the 2017 growing season fig 3b similar to the 2016 season a similar higher average depletion of soil water storage was obtained for z2 20 mm than for z1 13 mm and z3 12 mm in the 2017 season 3 3 yield yield components and crop water production functions the yield and yield components of winter wheat for all treatments during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are presented in table 2 in the 2016 season the lowest yield was obtained in the rain fed treatments in each management zone the variation in yield among the deficit irrigation treatments differed in the management zones in z1 the yield change was minor and ranged from 6370 to 6714 kg ha 1 while slightly greater variations in yield were observed in z2 5508 to 7092 kg ha 1 and z3 6083 to 7004 kg ha 1 a statistically significant difference in yield among irrigation treatments was only observed in z2 furthermore the maximum yield in z2 was 6 and 1 higher than that in z1 and z3 respectively the minimum yield was again obtained in the rain fed treatments in the 2017 season although the total water received irrigation rainfall in the rain fed treatments was similar in these two seasons the mean yield in the 2017 season was obviously lower than that in the 2016 season due to the uneven temporal distribution of rainfall fig 3 in the 2017 season for the irrigation treatments in the 2017 season the water delivered was equivalent at the same irrigation treatment in different management zones while the yield at different deficit treatments ranged from 1644 to 7989 kg ha 1 from 2482 to 8831 kg ha 1 and from 1603 to 7078 kg ha 1 in z1 z2 and z3 respectively the maximum yield was again obtained in z2 and was 11 and 25 higher than that in z1 and z3 respectively this phenomenon that the maximum yield was obtained in z2 was consistent with the results reported by zhao et al 2017 in the same field for a given irrigation rate no significant difference was observed among management zones however the percentage that the yield deviated from the mean value in different management zones varied from 16 to 30 from 6 to 10 and from 11 to 11 in the 2017 season in t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively the difference in yield among management zones increased as crop suffered from more severe water deficit to obtain the wpfs in each management zone the eta was calculated in each treatment based on the irrigation regimes mentioned above the maximum infiltration depth of water was obtained in z2 and no obvious variation in soil water content was observed at the 0 6 1 2 m layers during the winter wheat growing seasons fig 4 therefore deep percolation was neglected during the calculation of eta based on eq 1 similar to the variation pattern of irrigation applied the lowest seasonal eta was obtained in the rain fed treatment in both seasons the greatest variation in seasonal eta was observed in z2 among the three management zones in the 2016 season for a given irrigation trigger point eta ranged from 449 to 558 mm from 356 to 539 mm and from 479 to 526 mm in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively although similar irrigation was applied in each management zone in the 2017 season the seasonal eta observed in z2 270 to 465 mm was slightly higher than that in z1 258 to 464 mm and z3 237 to 458 mm for a given irrigation rate the eta ranged from 237 to 270 mm from 359 to 373 mm and from 458 to 465 mm in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively in the field the responses of grain yield to eta in each management zone are shown in fig 6 compared to the 2017 season the greater eta and yields for the t1 and t2 treatments were obtained in the 2016 season table 2 this was mainly caused by the greater irrigation amount delivered to these treatments in the 2016 season due to the nonuniform soil profile resultantly the different yield to eta relationships were obtained in these two seasons in the 2016 season quadratic relationships were fitted to wpfs in z1 z2 and z3 in the 2017 season the grain yield was linearly related to seasonal eta for z1 and z3 while a quadratic relationship was fitted for z2 mainly due to an extra application rate of 120 base irrigation depth 3 4 water use efficiency the wue for all treatments in the 2016 and 2017 seasons are shown in table 3 similar to the yield the wue varied within and among management zones in the 2016 season the rain fed treatments produced the least yield and resulted in the lowest wue the wue in the rain fed treatment was significantly lower than that in any irrigation treatment being 69 52 and 72 lower than the average wue value of the irrigation treatments in z1 z2 and z3 respectively in the irrigation treatments no significant difference was observed among treatments in each of the three management zones the values of wue ranged from 1 25 to 1 36 kg m 3 from 1 35 to 1 55 kg m 3 and from 1 09 to 1 32 kg m 3 in z1 z2 and z3 respectively for a given irrigation trigger point the percentage that the wue deviated from the mean value relative wue in different management zones ranged from 14 to 7 from 9 to 13 and from 4 to 8 in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively similar to the 2016 season the rain fed treatments had the lowest wue in the 2017 season table 3 in the irrigated treatments a larger range of wue at different deficit levels was observed and a significantly lower wue was obtained in the t1 treatment than in the t2 and t3 treatments in each management zone the values of wue ranged from 0 64 to 1 75 kg m 3 from 0 92 to 2 04 kg m 3 and from 0 68 to 1 68 kg m 3 in z1 z2 and z3 respectively even with similar water application for a given irrigation rate the relative wue in different management zones ranged from 14 to 23 from 8 to 12 and from 10 to 10 in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively a reduction in wue but a broader wue variation range among management zones was observed with decreasing irrigation water in both seasons indicating that the influence of awc on wue increased as the water applied decreased tolk and evett 2015 the maximum wue values in each management zone in both seasons were within the wue range of 1 07 kg m 3 to 2 4 kg m 3 reported by wang et al 2006 in the north china plain the maximum wue in z2 was higher than that in z1 and z3 being 14 and 17 higher in the 2016 season and 17 and 21 higher in the 2017 season respectively similar to the yield the maximum wue was obtained in z2 with the medium awc again in this study and the same result was reported by zhao et al 2017 in this same field it was confirmed that water productivity potentials were affected by not only awc but also the soil profile characteristics the quadratic responses of wue to eta in each management zone are illustrated in fig 7 this two season study showed that wue would decrease if the irrigation amount continued to increase under this experimental condition the derivative of the fitting curve was calculated to determine the maximum wue and the corresponding optimal eta in each management zone in the 2016 season the maximum wue was 1 36 1 51 and 1 67 kg m 3 and the corresponding eta was 459 409 and 427 mm for z1 z2 and z3 respectively in the 2017 season the maximum wue and the respective eta values were 1 84 1 87 and 1 69 kg m 3 and 514 431 and 522 mm for z1 z2 and z3 respectively in both seasons the minimum optimal eta among the three management zones was found in z2 but the difference in the optimal eta between z1 and z3 was minor a comparison of the variation in awc and the optimal eta among the three management zones revealed that the awc varied in a substantially larger range 152 205 mm with a mean of 164 mm than did the optimal eta 409 459 mm with a mean of 432 mm in the 2016 season this suggests that there are additional factors to awc that affect crop water use the layered textural profile in the studied field might be a contributing factor the generation of prescription maps based on soil water content sensors needs to consider the dual effects of awc and soil profile characteristics to generate a vri prescription the relationships between eta and seasonal irrigation amount i were derived for the zones selected in the 2016 and 2017 seasons fig 8 these linear equations were signiﬁcant at a probability level of p 0 01 with high r2 values as shown in fig 8 the irrigation amount generated by the fitted linear equation corresponding to the optimal eta was 296 276 mm and 263 mm in z1 z2 and z3 respectively in the 2016 season accordingly taking the optimal application rate in zone 1 as a basis 93 and 89 of the rate in zone 1 was recommended for zones 2 and 3 respectively similarly the optimal irrigation amount determined in the 2017 season was 423 354 and 415 mm and the application rates were 100 84 and 98 for z1 z2 and z3 respectively the rates derived from the mean value of the two seasons were 100 89 and 94 for z1 z2 and z3 respectively then these rates were used to determine the water savings of the vri system compared to the uniform rate irrigation management based on the mean irrigation amount obtained from z1 in the two seasons it was found that 7 of irrigation water could be reduced by implementing the vri strategies by multiplying the irrigation amount by the acreage in each management zone the benefit of water savings could be increased when the field is totally irrigated by a vri system because the estimation of water savings was based on one quadrant of the center pivot it should be noted that the effects of awc and layered textural soil on yield and wue were site specific the application rates proposed in the study might not be necessarily applied to other fields while the application rates are a proof of concept on the method generating an irrigation prescription map by means of wpfs further works on various complex soils and climate conditions will be helpful for establishing a more general method of mapping irrigation prescription to serve the vri technology 4 conclusions field experiments were conducted in the semi arid region of the north china plain where an awc range of 152 205 mm within the top 1 0 m soil profile was detected the field was divided into four management zones based on the awc and different water deficit levels were applied in each subzone with the vri system the yield wue wpfs and the relationship between wue and crop water use in each zone were compared the following conclusions are supported by this study 1 the management zone with a higher awc does not always receive less seasonal irrigation for the two seasons zone 2 with a medium awc and relatively uniform profile received 6 and 12 less irrigation water than zones 1 and 3 respectively with clearly layered textural soil profiles when the irrigation scheduling for vri was based on the measurement of soil water content the depth of the interface in the layered soils relative to the buried location of soil water content sensor should be considered our results recommended that the sensors should be placed above the interface 2 the different management zones had different wpfs and water productivity potentials compared with zones 1 and 3 the mean yield in zone 2 was 6 and 8 greater and the mean wue was 18 and 25 higher for the two seasons respectively 3 a method for generating the irrigation prescription was provided with the goal to maximize the wue of winter wheat in the entire field when the optimal application rate of maximizing wue in zone 1 was taken as a basis 89 and 94 of the rate in zone 1 was recommended for zones 2 and 3 respectively for vri management in this semi arid region acknowledgements this study was

11110,to determine the specific application rate for each management zone of a variable rate irrigation system the yield and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat were evaluated during two growing seasons at different deficit levels in the alluvial flood plain of the north china plain one 1 64 ha quadrant irrigated by a variable rate center pivot system was delineated into four management zones with available soil water holding capacity and varied soil profiles were detected in these zones each zone was divided into several subzones to be irrigated at different deficit levels in the 2016 season each subzone was managed individually with irrigation trigger points of 55 65 75 and 80 of field capacity along with a rain fed treatment in the 2017 season all subzones were irrigated simultaneously with 0 33 67 100 and 120 of the base application depth for the two season study the rain fed treatment produced significantly lower yield and wue than the irrigated treatments and both the maximum yield and the maximum wue were obtained in zone 2 where a more uniform soil profile was detected a linear crop water production function was determined for zones 1 and 3 in the 2017 season while a quadratic equation fit the crop water production function well for other zones in the two seasons the relationship between wue and crop water use in the three zones can be represented by a curvilinear equation for both seasons taking the optimal application rate of maximizing wue in zone 1 as a basis 89 and 94 of the rate in zone 1 was recommended for zones 2 and 3 respectively to achieve the maximum wue in the entire field our results also suggested that the existing layered textural soil profile can greatly influence crop productivity and should therefore be considered in

and a substantially higher crop yield was obtained on irrigated land than on rain fed land in china cao et al 2015 however available water resources for irrigation are increasingly limited for example the north china plain which has a semi arid climate and produces nearly 75 of the wheat in china has long been suffering from severe water shortages the exploitation of groundwater accounts for 70 of the total water utilization and 79 of the groundwater is pumped for irrigated agriculture zhang et al 2013 proper irrigation management to improve water use efficiency wue is critical for sustainable crop production in this region cao et al 2017 having the ability to allocate varied water amounts in different management zones variable rate irrigation vri systems provide the possibility and flexibility to enhance wue by arraying spatially variable thresholds o shaughnessy et al 2015 or by varying water application depths across a field o shaughnessy and evett 2010 sui and yan 2017 however it is not straightforward how to best manage irrigation with these systems and often the management does not save water or much water it meant that vri is of limited utility without precise irrigation scheduling howell et al 2012 in recent years extensive attention has been given to available soil water holding capacity awc hedley et al 2010 and electrical conductivity larue 2011 sui and yan 2017 for developing management zones and prescription maps although the final conclusions about the irrigation date and amount in different management zones have not yet been determined a common finding is that the management zone with a high awc received a minor irrigation amount evans et al 2013 when the parameter of awc was used to delineate the management zones the awc value in a specific location was the average value in the top 0 0 6 m depths where the majority root zone concentrated hedley et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 and there was no consideration about the soil layers in fact layered soils inevitably exist in many fields as a result of geological processes numerous studies have shown that an interface exists in layered soils whether fine over coarse or coarse over fine limited downward water movement and increased soil water storage in the top layer soil jury and horton 2004 li and liu 2011 these results suggest that the varied soil layers in a field might affect the prescription maps for vri management based on the measurement of soil water content to generate the prescription map knowledge about crop response crop water production functions wpfs to variable water inputs is helpful evans et al 2013 although extensive research for several decades has indicated that wpfs have linear or quadratic functions musick et al 1994 shen et al 1995 schneider and howell 2001 wang et al 2006 wpfs are site specific because of the variability of soil and climatic conditions rajput and singh 1986 sadler et al 2002 tolk and howell 2003 even in an individual field the variation in awc has a substantial influence on the growth parameters yield and water productivity of crop for example through a two season measurement of winter wheat response for a variable rate irrigation system with three management zones zhao et al 2017 reported that the maximum yield was obtained in the zone with the medium awc rather than in the zones with the greatest awc where layered textural soil existed the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the effect of awc and layered textural soil on irrigation scheduling based on soil water content sensors 2 verify the assumption that different water production potentials exist in management zones and 3 generate an irrigation prescription map by means of wpfs in different management zones with the goal of obtaining the maximum wue under a semi arid climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study was conducted from october 2015 to june 2016 referred to as the 2016 season and from october 2016 to june 2017 referred to as the 2017 season during the growing season of winter wheat in zhuozhou 39 45 n and 115 85 e hebei province china this site is located in the taihang mountain alluvial flood plain and experiences a warm and semi arid climate with an annual mean temperature of 11 6 c and an annual mean precipitation of 563 3 mm the experimental area was one 1 64 ha quadrant controlled by a variable rate center pivot irrigation system and the vri control unit of the system was developed by the china institute of water resources and hydropower research zhao et al 2014 weak topographic variations with an average slope of 0 18 and a 0 14 m elevation difference were found across the field prior to the experiments the hydraulic performance of the vri system was tested by field evaluation to guarantee control precision zhao et al 2014 four management zones were delineated using awc by soil sampling at 110 locations of a 12 m 12 m grid the awc range was determined to be 152 161 161 171 171 185 and 185 205 mm within the top 1 0 m soil profile and the average field capacity calculated by the wilcox method wilcox 1962 was 0 21 0 22 0 23 and 0 25 cm3 cm 3 within the 0 6 m soil profile for zones 1 z1 2 z2 3 z3 and 4 z4 respectively accordingly the areas were 0 33 0 76 0 18 and 0 28 ha for z1 z2 z3 and z4 respectively varied soil profiles were detected in different management zones fig 1 in z1 the sand fraction largely increased with depth 57 8 89 5 small ranges of the sand fraction 59 8 65 8 and clay fraction 4 6 5 7 were observed at different depths in z2 showing a relatively uniform profile a fine middle layer 47 9 sand and 8 6 clay at the 0 2 to 0 4 m soil profile was found in z3 suggesting a clearly layered textural profile in the zone in z4 the mean sand and clay fractions in the 0 0 4 m soil layers were 55 4 and 7 4 respectively lots of gravels were found below the 0 4 m depth after the burying of water pipelines therefore z4 was not included in this study since it loses its representativeness to the alluvial flood plain more details about the soil parameters and management zones were described in zhao et al 2017 2 2 experimental design according to the area of each management zone z1 z2 and z3 were equally divided into four five and four subzones respectively for each management zone the subzones were randomly arranged in the zone without reconsidering the variation of awc within management zones the first span of the center pivot was not used in this study due to its small area of coverage to represent different deficit levels the rain fed treatment z1t0 z2t0 and z3t0 referred to as t0 and the treatments triggered at different irrigation trigger points of 55 z1t1 z2t1 and z3t1 referred to as t1 65 z1t2 z2t2 and z3t2 referred to as t2 75 z1t3 z2t3 and z3t3 referred to as t3 and 80 z2t4 of field capacity were scheduled in the 2016 season resulting in a total of thirteen experimental treatment subzones in the field fig 2 a once the irrigation trigger point for a treatment was reached the machine would pass through and apply an irrigation depth of 20 mm that was determined by considering the travel speed of the center pivot and the peak daily water use o shaughnessy and evett 2010 such a vri management approach means that the duty cycle was set 100 i e always on in the treatment the other treatments did not receive any irrigation until the threshold for that subzone was reached in the 2017 season the deficit irrigation levels in each management zone were applied by changing the irrigation rates to 0 z1t0 z2t0 and z3t0 referred to as t0 33 z1t1 z2t1 and z3t1 referred to as t1 67 z1t2 z2t2 and z3t2 referred to as t2 100 z1t3 z2t3 and z3t3 referred to as t3 and 120 z2t4 of the base application depth the base application depth was 20 mm before the flowering stage and 30 mm thereafter the irrigation was triggered when the mean soil water content depletion in the z1t3 subzone exceeded the threshold of 0 45 of the awc approximately 66 of the field capacity the z1 with minimum awc was selected as the trigger zone of irrigation aimed at maximizing yield potential in the entire field zhao et al 2017 once irrigation was triggered irrigation amounts delivered to all thirteen treatments were achieved by regulating the appropriate solenoid valves at duty cycles of 0 33 67 100 and 120 of the base application depth a tdr trime tube system trime t3 imko ltd ettlingen germany was used to monitor the soil water content six ten and three access tubes were installed approximately in the center of a 12 m 12 m grid in each treatment of z1 z2 and z3 respectively fig 2b these soil water content sensors were used in both 2016 and 2017 seasons to determine the irrigation date mean soil water contents in each irrigation treatment were measured daily at 0 2 0 4 m layer to approximately represent the average soil water content li et al 2009 gao et al 2011 during the 2016 season while daily measurement of soil water content in z1t3 treatment to determine the irrigation date was extended to 0 0 4 m depths during the 2017 season this change was aimed at avoiding triggering irrigation too frequently caused by layered textural properties of soil in management zones especially in z3 during both irrigation seasons in addition to determining the irrigation date all access tubes in each subzone were measured in 0 2 m increments to a depth of 1 2 m every seven to ten days to evaluate the influence of deficit irrigation on water flux in different soil layers the rain forecast information of the following three days was considered in the two seasons to make full use of the rainfall the water applied would be decreased by 0 20 and 40 for light less than 10 mm moderate between 10 mm and 25 mm and heavy rain more than 25 mm wang et al 2005 according to the forecast report from the national meteorological center of china meteorological administration there was no additional application except for seedling emergence and aiding fertilization in the rain fed treatments an application of 20 mm irrigation was delivered for seedling emergence for all the treatments in both seasons winter wheat triticum aestivum l jimai no 22 was seeded on october 14 2015 and on october 11 2016 with rows 0 15 m apart and the seeding rate was 375 kg ha 1 all subzones were fertilized uniformly based on typical cultural practices for yield potential specifically the total amounts of nitrogen phosphorus p2o5 and potassium k2o applied were 175 138 and 90 kg ha 1 respectively all phosphorus and potassium fertilizers and 54 kg ha 1 of nitrogen were applied as basal fertilizers the remaining nitrogen was applied on march 15 2016 and on april 2 2017 and 20 mm of water was immediately applied after broadcast fertilization to enhance the fertilizer use efficiency 2 3 data collection and analysis at harvest seven rows of winter wheat of 1 m length 1 05 m2 were harvested near the center of each grid there were six ten and three replications in each treatment in z1 z2 and z3 resulting in 86 sampling locations in total in the 2016 season winter wheat was harvested on june 3 in the rain fed treatments and on june 12 in the irrigated treatments in the 2017 season it was harvested from june 1 to june 5 in the rain fed treatments and on june 9 in the irrigated treatments to deal with the different maturation times grain yields were oven dried at 75 c and corrected to 13 moisture in addition yield components number of productive ears ear length number of grains per ear and the 1000 grain weight were measured to explain the differences in yield among the treatments the reference evapotranspiration et0 mm was calculated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the climatic parameters used in this equation and the total precipitation were collected from a weather station watchdog 2000 spectrum technologies inc usa installed approximately 100 m away from the study field the actual evapotranspiration eta mm was calculated using the following water balance equation allen et al 1998 1 e t a i p e d p r o f f δ s where i is the irrigation applied mm pe is the effective rainfall mm which was calculated by multiplying the total rainfall by the reduction coefficient the coefficient is 0 0 8 and 0 7 when the total rainfall is less than 5 mm between 5 mm and 50 mm and more than 50 mm respectively dp is the deep percolation mm which was neglected because there was no obvious influence of irrigation and precipitation on soil water movement below the 0 6 m layer this will be discussed in the following section roff is runoff caused by irrigation mm which was also ignored due to the weak topographic variations in this field and the low irrigation rate for each event 20 30 mm and δs is the variation in soil water storage mm in the 0 1 2 m soil layers between the initial and terminal stages water use efficiency wue was calculated in each treatment by dividing the average crop yield by eta in each grid the wue values were reported in units of kg of grain per cubic meter of water received all data were analyzed using the statistical product and service solutions spss 16 0 software package spss 2007 one way analysis of variance anova was used to test whether the awc or deficit irrigation had a significant effect on yield and wue at the 0 05 probability level duncan s test was also performed on all management zones and irrigation levels at the 0 05 probability level 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic factors the monthly climatic factors such as the maximum air temperature tmp mean relative humidity rh cumulative solar radiation srd and cumulative reference evapotranspiration c et0 during the two growing seasons of winter wheat are shown in table 1 in both seasons the lowest tmp and srd were from december to february of the next year meaning cold weather after that the tmp and srd increased sharply until harvest the maximum daily solar radiation was 39 mj m2 d in the 2016 season and 24 mj m2 d in the 2017 season and the maximums were observed in late april and may respectively the variation of c et0 was consistent with that of the srd the maximum daily et0 was approximately 7 3 mm but it occurred in late april the rh was less than 50 in most of the growing seasons it ranged from 35 to 80 in the 2016 season and from 36 to 72 in the 2017 season the monthly mean values of tmp rh srd and c et0 were 23 c 52 323 mj m2 and 74 mm in the 2016 season and 23 c 52 322 mj m2 and 75 mm in the 2017 season respectively no obvious differences in these climatic factors were found between the two seasons 3 2 rainfall and irrigation the seasonal application amount and rainfall for different irrigation treatments in the 2016 and 2017 seasons are shown in fig 3 there were thirty two precipitation events in total in the 2016 season and all of them were light rain in the 2017 season twenty five precipitation events occurred of which twenty one were light rains and the remaining were medium the seasonal rainfall was similar in the 2016 80 1 mm and 2017 80 3 mm seasons being less than the long term average of 126 mm zhang et al 2002 a more uniform temporal distribution was found in the 2016 season than in the 2017 season to aid germination and fertilization the rain fed treatments received an additional irrigation amount of 46 mm in the 2016 season and 40 mm in the 2017 season in the irrigation treatments the responses of the seasonal irrigation amount to deficit irrigation levels were different among the three management zones in the 2016 season in z1 the seasonal irrigation amount ranged from 300 to 380 mm among the irrigation treatments and the maximum value was obtained in the z1t2 treatment with the medium irrigation trigger point the widest variation in irrigation amount among the irrigation treatments was observed in z2 226 to 416 mm where the minimum irrigation amount was obtained in the z2t2 treatment and the maximum in the z2t4 treatment in z3 similar irrigation amount was received for all irrigation treatments 380 to 396 mm the phenomenon that the irrigation amount did not fully increase with the increment of irrigation trigger points might be caused by different initial soil water content in the 0 2 0 4 m layer in various subzones fig 4 differing from the common view that a minor irrigation amount was received in the management zone with higher awc the mean irrigation amount in z2 234 mm was 12 and 22 less than that in z1 267 mm and z3 301 mm respectively this result could be explained by the seasonal change in soil water content in the 0 1 2 m layers in each treatment fig 4 the hindrance of the existing interface between adjacent layers on the downward water flux in z1 and z3 resulted in a less depletion of soil water storage within the root zone in these zones especially in z3 fig 4 for example the average depletion of soil water storage for z2 34 mm approximately doubled the value for z1 18 mm and z3 14 mm in the 2016 season then a more frequent irrigation was triggered for z1 and z3 than for z2 this suggests that vri management based on soil water content measurement should carefully select the measurement depth when layered textural soils exist the soil water content sensors should not be positioned beneath the interface to capture the average status of soil water content within the root zone in the 2017 season the irrigation amounts of 153 263 and 370 mm were applied at the 33 67 and 100 treatment in each management zone respectively the seasonal change in soil water content in the 0 1 2 m layers decreased in most subzones fig 5 compared with that in the 2016 season fig 4 this was attributed to the higher terminal soil water content that resulted from the large rainfall at the end of the 2017 growing season fig 3b similar to the 2016 season a similar higher average depletion of soil water storage was obtained for z2 20 mm than for z1 13 mm and z3 12 mm in the 2017 season 3 3 yield yield components and crop water production functions the yield and yield components of winter wheat for all treatments during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are presented in table 2 in the 2016 season the lowest yield was obtained in the rain fed treatments in each management zone the variation in yield among the deficit irrigation treatments differed in the management zones in z1 the yield change was minor and ranged from 6370 to 6714 kg ha 1 while slightly greater variations in yield were observed in z2 5508 to 7092 kg ha 1 and z3 6083 to 7004 kg ha 1 a statistically significant difference in yield among irrigation treatments was only observed in z2 furthermore the maximum yield in z2 was 6 and 1 higher than that in z1 and z3 respectively the minimum yield was again obtained in the rain fed treatments in the 2017 season although the total water received irrigation rainfall in the rain fed treatments was similar in these two seasons the mean yield in the 2017 season was obviously lower than that in the 2016 season due to the uneven temporal distribution of rainfall fig 3 in the 2017 season for the irrigation treatments in the 2017 season the water delivered was equivalent at the same irrigation treatment in different management zones while the yield at different deficit treatments ranged from 1644 to 7989 kg ha 1 from 2482 to 8831 kg ha 1 and from 1603 to 7078 kg ha 1 in z1 z2 and z3 respectively the maximum yield was again obtained in z2 and was 11 and 25 higher than that in z1 and z3 respectively this phenomenon that the maximum yield was obtained in z2 was consistent with the results reported by zhao et al 2017 in the same field for a given irrigation rate no significant difference was observed among management zones however the percentage that the yield deviated from the mean value in different management zones varied from 16 to 30 from 6 to 10 and from 11 to 11 in the 2017 season in t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively the difference in yield among management zones increased as crop suffered from more severe water deficit to obtain the wpfs in each management zone the eta was calculated in each treatment based on the irrigation regimes mentioned above the maximum infiltration depth of water was obtained in z2 and no obvious variation in soil water content was observed at the 0 6 1 2 m layers during the winter wheat growing seasons fig 4 therefore deep percolation was neglected during the calculation of eta based on eq 1 similar to the variation pattern of irrigation applied the lowest seasonal eta was obtained in the rain fed treatment in both seasons the greatest variation in seasonal eta was observed in z2 among the three management zones in the 2016 season for a given irrigation trigger point eta ranged from 449 to 558 mm from 356 to 539 mm and from 479 to 526 mm in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively although similar irrigation was applied in each management zone in the 2017 season the seasonal eta observed in z2 270 to 465 mm was slightly higher than that in z1 258 to 464 mm and z3 237 to 458 mm for a given irrigation rate the eta ranged from 237 to 270 mm from 359 to 373 mm and from 458 to 465 mm in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively in the field the responses of grain yield to eta in each management zone are shown in fig 6 compared to the 2017 season the greater eta and yields for the t1 and t2 treatments were obtained in the 2016 season table 2 this was mainly caused by the greater irrigation amount delivered to these treatments in the 2016 season due to the nonuniform soil profile resultantly the different yield to eta relationships were obtained in these two seasons in the 2016 season quadratic relationships were fitted to wpfs in z1 z2 and z3 in the 2017 season the grain yield was linearly related to seasonal eta for z1 and z3 while a quadratic relationship was fitted for z2 mainly due to an extra application rate of 120 base irrigation depth 3 4 water use efficiency the wue for all treatments in the 2016 and 2017 seasons are shown in table 3 similar to the yield the wue varied within and among management zones in the 2016 season the rain fed treatments produced the least yield and resulted in the lowest wue the wue in the rain fed treatment was significantly lower than that in any irrigation treatment being 69 52 and 72 lower than the average wue value of the irrigation treatments in z1 z2 and z3 respectively in the irrigation treatments no significant difference was observed among treatments in each of the three management zones the values of wue ranged from 1 25 to 1 36 kg m 3 from 1 35 to 1 55 kg m 3 and from 1 09 to 1 32 kg m 3 in z1 z2 and z3 respectively for a given irrigation trigger point the percentage that the wue deviated from the mean value relative wue in different management zones ranged from 14 to 7 from 9 to 13 and from 4 to 8 in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively similar to the 2016 season the rain fed treatments had the lowest wue in the 2017 season table 3 in the irrigated treatments a larger range of wue at different deficit levels was observed and a significantly lower wue was obtained in the t1 treatment than in the t2 and t3 treatments in each management zone the values of wue ranged from 0 64 to 1 75 kg m 3 from 0 92 to 2 04 kg m 3 and from 0 68 to 1 68 kg m 3 in z1 z2 and z3 respectively even with similar water application for a given irrigation rate the relative wue in different management zones ranged from 14 to 23 from 8 to 12 and from 10 to 10 in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively a reduction in wue but a broader wue variation range among management zones was observed with decreasing irrigation water in both seasons indicating that the influence of awc on wue increased as the water applied decreased tolk and evett 2015 the maximum wue values in each management zone in both seasons were within the wue range of 1 07 kg m 3 to 2 4 kg m 3 reported by wang et al 2006 in the north china plain the maximum wue in z2 was higher than that in z1 and z3 being 14 and 17 higher in the 2016 season and 17 and 21 higher in the 2017 season respectively similar to the yield the maximum wue was obtained in z2 with the medium awc again in this study and the same result was reported by zhao et al 2017 in this same field it was confirmed that water productivity potentials were affected by not only awc but also the soil profile characteristics the quadratic responses of wue to eta in each management zone are illustrated in fig 7 this two season study showed that wue would decrease if the irrigation amount continued to increase under this experimental condition the derivative of the fitting curve was calculated to determine the maximum wue and the corresponding optimal eta in each management zone in the 2016 season the maximum wue was 1 36 1 51 and 1 67 kg m 3 and the corresponding eta was 459 409 and 427 mm for z1 z2 and z3 respectively in the 2017 season the maximum wue and the respective eta values were 1 84 1 87 and 1 69 kg m 3 and 514 431 and 522 mm for z1 z2 and z3 respectively in both seasons the minimum optimal eta among the three management zones was found in z2 but the difference in the optimal eta between z1 and z3 was minor a comparison of the variation in awc and the optimal eta among the three management zones revealed that the awc varied in a substantially larger range 152 205 mm with a mean of 164 mm than did the optimal eta 409 459 mm with a mean of 432 mm in the 2016 season this suggests that there are additional factors to awc that affect crop water use the layered textural profile in the studied field might be a contributing factor the generation of prescription maps based on soil water content sensors needs to consider the dual effects of awc and soil profile characteristics to generate a vri prescription the relationships between eta and seasonal irrigation amount i were derived for the zones selected in the 2016 and 2017 seasons fig 8 these linear equations were signiﬁcant at a probability level of p 0 01 with high r2 values as shown in fig 8 the irrigation amount generated by the fitted linear equation corresponding to the optimal eta was 296 276 mm and 263 mm in z1 z2 and z3 respectively in the 2016 season accordingly taking the optimal application rate in zone 1 as a basis 93 and 89 of the rate in zone 1 was recommended for zones 2 and 3 respectively similarly the optimal irrigation amount determined in the 2017 season was 423 354 and 415 mm and the application rates were 100 84 and 98 for z1 z2 and z3 respectively the rates derived from the mean value of the two seasons were 100 89 and 94 for z1 z2 and z3 respectively then these rates were used to determine the water savings of the vri system compared to the uniform rate irrigation management based on the mean irrigation amount obtained from z1 in the two seasons it was found that 7 of irrigation water could be reduced by implementing the vri strategies by multiplying the irrigation amount by the acreage in each management zone the benefit of water savings could be increased when the field is totally irrigated by a vri system because the estimation of water savings was based on one quadrant of the center pivot it should be noted that the effects of awc and layered textural soil on yield and wue were site specific the application rates proposed in the study might not be necessarily applied to other fields while the application rates are a proof of concept on the method generating an irrigation prescription map by means of wpfs further works on various complex soils and climate conditions will be helpful for establishing a more general method of mapping irrigation prescription to serve the vri technology 4 conclusions field experiments were conducted in the semi arid region of the north china plain where an awc range of 152 205 mm within the top 1 0 m soil profile was detected the field was divided into four management zones based on the awc and different water deficit levels were applied in each subzone with the vri system the yield wue wpfs and the relationship between wue and crop water use in each zone were compared the following conclusions are supported by this study 1 the management zone with a higher awc does not always receive less seasonal irrigation for the two seasons zone 2 with a medium awc and relatively uniform profile received 6 and 12 less irrigation water than zones 1 and 3 respectively with clearly layered textural soil profiles when the irrigation scheduling for vri was based on the measurement of soil water content the depth of the interface in the layered soils relative to the buried location of soil water content sensor should be considered our results recommended that the sensors should be placed above the interface 2 the different management zones had different wpfs and water productivity potentials compared with zones 1 and 3 the mean yield in zone 2 was 6 and 8 greater and the mean wue was 18 and 25 higher for the two seasons respectively 3 a method for generating the irrigation prescription was provided with the goal to maximize the wue of winter wheat in the entire field when the optimal application rate of maximizing wue in zone 1 was taken as a basis 89 and 94 of the rate in zone 1 was recommended for zones 2 and 3 respectively for vri management in this semi arid region acknowledgements this study was

11111,this paper presents the calibration and validation processes of the mopeco model for the simulation of 4 commercial potato cultivars zorba mirari monalisa and leire using the data from a three year field experiment years 2010 2011 and 2012 two per cultivar under deficit irrigation conditions in the basque country region of spain the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi strategy was

fao 56 were 0 45 vegetative period 0 70 to 0 90 yield formation and 0 25 to 0 40 ripening depending on the considered cultivar the validation results showed that mopeco is suitable for simulating the yield versus total water gross irrigation effective rainfall use under the climatic and soil conditions in this study normalized root mean square error from 7 2 to 8 5 between observed and simulated levels ordi maximized the yield of the crop for different volumes of available irrigation water the irrigation water productivity differed according to the cultivar increasing for lower volumes of

optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi mopeco typical meteorological year tmy 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer of water 70 compared to other productive sectors such as industry and services evett and tolk 2009 generating 40 of world food production the reduction of water available for agricultural purposes together with the increase in energy costs directly associated with modernized irrigation make irrigation water productivity and the measures to cope with droughts a priority objective in this sector potato solarum tuberosum l with 368 mt and an area

other growing parameters such as aquacrop steduto et al 2009 foster et al 2017 simdualkc rosa et al 2012 dssat hoogenboom et al 2004 cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 apsim keating et al 2003 and substor potato griffin et al 1995 some authors linker et al 2016 have carried out modeling studies on optimization of irrigation water to potato crop based on aquacrop nevertheless it is less common to find models such as mopeco that optimize irrigation water allocation to maximize yield domínguez et al 2012a leite et al 2015a and the gross margin of crops and farms lópez mata et al 2016 domínguez et al 2017 in the basque country potato crop occupies around 1600 ha in farms located in the south of the territory which represents 20 of the total irrigated land eustat 2017 mapama 2017a the province of álava is the main national reference in the cultivation of virus free potatoes for planting however the potato cropping area has been forecast to increase around 10 in other regions in coming years fepex 2017 for this reason the basque country institute of agricultural research and development neiker tecnalia is developing a line of research to obtain new potato cultivars adapted to heat waves and drought periods resulting from climate change neiker 2017a several studies have shown that gradual soil drying imposed by deficit irrigation techniques induces physiological responses in potato plant resulting in partial stomatal closure and an increase in photosynthetic water use efficiency jensen et al 2010 kiziloglu et al 2006 many experimental results have evidenced that water stress at the early two stages i e stolonization and tuberization showed sharp negative response to the yield of potato compared with bulking and tuber enlargement stages hassan et al 2002 mahima et al 2018 thus the advance in the management of controlled deficit irrigation techniques rdi english 1990 such as the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology developed by crea castilla la mancha university spain domínguez et al 2012a may help improve the competitiveness of this sector this methodology has been successfully applied in crops such as maize domínguez et al 2012a onion domínguez et al 2012b garlic domínguez et al 2013 and carrot léllis et al 2017 in which the yield or marketable yield increased by 10 20 3 7 3 9 and 15 27 and the gross margin rose by 20 30 59 and 30 respectively compared with an irrigation strategy where the stress level remained constant during the whole growth cycle constant regulated deficit irrigation cdi these techniques focus on increasing irrigation water productivity as a way of enhancing agricultural income by decreasing the pressure on natural resources the main aim of this work was to establish a methodology to determine irrigation strategies that maximize the yield of four potato cultivars in the basque country with limited availability of irrigation water under water scarcity conditions the partial objectives were a to determine the typical water requirements of the crop under the climatic conditions of the basque country b to calibrate the yield response factor ky doorenbos and kassam 1979 for four potato cultivars and c to determine the irrigation strategies that maximize the yield under limited availability of irrigation water for four potato cultivars 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the basque country region 7234 km2 is located in the north of spain fig 1 agricultural lands occupy an area of 82 518 ha of which 10 is irrigated with either sprinkler 58 or drip irrigation 21 systems agricultural activity in the basque country is mainly concentrated in álava the southern province the most common irrigated species are annual extensive crops such as sugar beet and potato 67 and tree crops such as grape vines 30 eustat 2017 the accumulated annual precipitation in álava ranges between 500 mm and 800 mm the average annual temperature is approximately 11 c and maximum and minimum

average annual rainfall mostly concentrated in the spring and fall 2 2 field experiments the experimental area was composed of four 36 m 24 m blocks with 18 m each side of the sprinkler line fig 2 the irrigation system was formed by a single line of sprinklers placed at a height of 1 50 m and spaced at 12 00 m fig 2 a sprinkler line source technique hanks et al 1976 was used to define five irrigation treatments t1 t5 this experimental design provides a continuous variable water gradient perpendicular to the sprinkler line the water applied decreased linearly from the sprinkler line t1 to the edge of each experimental block t5 on each side of the sprinkler line the operating pressure was around 300 kpa and water was provided through a double nozzle system diameters 4 0 mm and 2 4 mm supplying 1450 l h 1 the line source 108 m long with 10 sprinklers was placed in the middle of the experimental area fig 2 four potato varieties were randomly distributed inside each block on both sides of the sprinkler line occupying equal areas of 18 m 16 ridges 12 m in each block rain gauges were installed on both sides of the sprinkler line with a separation of 3 m starting from the ridges adjacent to the sprinkler line in order to quantify the amount of water applied following the continuous gradient perpendicular to the sprinkler line fig 2 plots of 1 5 m two ridges 15 m adjacent to each rain gauge were harvested t1 t5 in each of the ridges tubers with a 40 60 cm caliber were planted at a rate of 3 units per linear meter irrigation was scheduled so that treatment t1 received the

requirements which represents approximately between 40 and 100 of maximum crop evapotranspiration etm irrigation was applied every 7 days and the water applied was measured after each irrigation event based on the rain gauge records a total of 80 catch cans with a diameter of 0 16 m and a height of 0 31 m with a spacing of 3 0 m 12 0 m were used for collecting the irrigation water fig 2 to minimize distortion of the sprinkler pattern irrigation was applied under light wind conditions wind speed 2 m s 1 in each t1 plot a pair of watermark sensors irrometer corp riverside ca usa were installed at a depth of 0 3 and 0 6 m to monitor the soil moisture content and to verify that the irrigation in these treatments was suitable for avoiding soil water depletion and percolation out of the root zone as basal dressing 150 kg ha 1 of nitrogen 75 kg ha 1 of phosphorus and 225 kg ha 1 of potassium was added to the soil table 1 one month after planting 100 kg ha 1 of nitrogen was provided as top dressing each year 3 fungicide treatments and 1 insecticide treatment were conducted during the cultivation cycle at the end of the cycle a quantity of herbicide was applied to cause the plants to dry before harvesting table 1 the climatic conditions during the period of development of the crop were similar in terms of evapotranspiration demand with variations up to 10 and very different for precipitation with variations higher than 50 table 1 during the field trials daily irrigation scheduling was performed by using the simplified water balance in the root zone methodology allen et al 1998 pereira and allen 1999 which is that used by the mopeco model domínguez et al 2011 the climatic data employed in this study were collected from the weather station salvatierra located 8 km away from the field trials which is the property of the basque meteorology agency http www euskalmet euskadi eus and a neiker weather station pessl instruments austria installed in the gauna property 2 3 potato cultivars the experiment was conducted using 4 major commercial potato cultivars solarum tuberosum l registered in the official register of plant cultivars mapama 2017b zorba registration number 19920286 an early cultivar suitable for fresh consumption and especially suitable for the production of chips it is relatively unsusceptible to internal damage since it adapts well to storage and is highly resistant to y virus mildew and other diseases mirari registration number 20060305 is a cultivar of excellent characteristics for fresh consumption maturity is semi late and it provides a very high yield it has a certain tolerance to water stress and resistance to golden nematode globodera rostochiensis monalisa registration number 19780253 a semi early cultivar especially indicated for frying and suitable for fresh consumption it adapts well to storage and presents high resistance to a x y viruses leire registration number 20040542 a semi late cultivar is extraordinarily good for boiling and frying it is well adapted to ecological production due to its high resistance to mildew golden nematode globodera rostochiensis potato y virus pvy and especially the potato leaf roll virus plrv the duration of the phenological development was between 110 120 days for the semi early varieties and about 150 days for the semi late maturity varieties in this experiment the crop was harvested around 150 days after plantation this coincides with the usual crop management in the area which is conditioned by the climate requiring potatoes to be harvested before the end of september for the cropping period in the study area the fertilization and the pesticide treatments were implemented as in a non deficit treatment t1 thus the yield obtained by each cultivar was only conditioned by the availability of irrigation water and the climatic conditions during the experimental year 2 4 phenological data in the simulations mopeco uses the crop coefficient kc dimensionless allen et al 1998 to calculate etm and the crop yield response factor ky dimensionless doorenbos and kassam 1979 to estimate actual yield ya section 2 7 both kc and ky depend on the phenological stage of the crop potato has four kc with three reference values and three ky stages with three reference values during its growing period fig 3 the length of the kc and ky stages are required by the model and were determined through the crop monitoring carried out during the three experimental years by using the bbch phenological scale bleiholder et al 2001 2 5 effect of inter annual variability on crop growth to calculate the length of the potato growth stages in terms of accumulated growing degree days gdd mopeco uses the double triangulation method sevacherian et al 1977 domínguez et al 2012c two parameters must be determined for the gdd calculation tl base temperature for development in ºc and tu upper threshold temperature at which the rate of development begins to decrease in ºc tl may vary

lowest coefficient of variation cv for the total number of monitoring plots used in the determination of the average gdd was selected section 3 2 2 6 determination of the typical meteorological year tmy a typical meteorological year tmy hall et al 1978 represents the conditions considered typical over a long period and was adapted by domínguez et al 2013 for forecasting irrigation schedules a tmy consists of 12 months selected from individual years and concatenated to form a complete year with daily values in this study using the climatic series from 1955 to 2016 the regular tmy was determined by means of the methodology proposed by leite et al 2015b to determine which years were regular the precipitation deficit index pd p eto mm was used de pauw 2002 harmsen et al 2009 this index was standardized pdz following sokal and rohlf 1995 only the months from may to september were used to determine the tmys as the growth of the potato crop in the study area occurs during this period 2 7 simulation of the yield versus irrigation relationship mopeco domínguez et al 2013 uses the model proposed by stewart et al 1977 eq 1 which estimates crop yield as a function of the actual versus maximum evapotranspiration ratio eta etm in the different growth stages when eta etm the plant suffers from stress that may cause a drop in yield actual yield ya maximum yield ym hence for each cultivar and treatment eq 1 was used for ky per stages and eq 2 for global ky for the whole growing cycle 1 y a y m k 1 3 1 k y k 1 e t a k e t m k 2 1 y a y m k y 1 e t a e t m where ya and ym are the actual and maximum crop yields kg ha 1 k is the actual growing stage allen et al 1998 kyk is the crop yield response factor by growing stage vegetative period yield formation and ripening doorenbos and kassam 1979 and ky for the whole growing cycle etak and etmk are the accumulated crop evapotranspiration in each ky growing stage mm and eta and etm are the accumulated crop evapotranspiration for the whole growing cycle daily etm is calculated by multiplying daily kc by daily eto values allen et al 1998 while daily eta under water stress conditions is calculated using the equation proposed by the same authors which requires a daily balance of water and soluble salt content the latter not being required in this study in the soil domínguez et al 2011 for the whole growing cycle if ky 1 yield reduction is directly proportional to reduced water use while if ky 1 crop response is very sensitive to water deficit with proportionally larger yield reductions when water use is reduced because of stress 2 8 model calibration and validation the calibration and validation processes followed the methodology proposed by domínguez et al 2012c for maize and followed by other authors for horticultural crops such as onion garlic and carrot domínguez et al 2012b 2013 carvalho et al 2014 respectively the kc values applied in this study were 0 40 1 10 and 0 75 which are those recommended by the irrigation service of the basque country spain neiker 2017b these are based on fao 56 allen et al 1998 and adjusted to the conditions in the area they are similar to those used by other authors in sub humid and other climatic conditions kashyap and panda 2001 shahnazari et al 2007 the process was a the ym value was set according to the results of the field tests the maximum yield ym of each cultivar is different and is conditioned among other factors by the climatic conditions of each cropping year this value is more variable in the case of potato than in other species especially because of its sensitiveness to sun radiation changes and the effects of temperature during the flowering stage landeras 2009 caldiz et al 2002 licker et al 2010 haverkort et al 2014 2015 deguchi et al 2016 mopeco simulates the actual yield ya as a proportion of ym according to the availability of water in the root area during the growing period but is unable to fit ym to the climatic conditions of each year stewart et al 1977 domínguez et al 2011 since the value of ym is essential for adequate calibration of the model domínguez et al 2012c these values in the present study were established according to those obtained for each cultivar and year in the non deficit treatments fig 4 b by inserting the kc values fitted for the study area neiker 2017b in the mopeco model the simulations of the soil moisture progression were conducted for the full irrigation treatments and the eta etm rates were found to be close to 1 and there was no percolation associated with irrigation events c the eta etm rates for every ky and kc stage were calculated for each treatment and cultivar a total of 160 irrigation treatments 4 cultivars x 2 years 5 irrigation treatments 4 repetitions were simulated d treatments in which the eta etm for the whole growing cycle was lower than 0 5 were rejected doorenbos and kassam 1979 in the same way the treatments reaching eta etm rates 0 4 for any of the specific ky stages were also rejected according to domínguez et al 2012b and carvalho et al 2014 this level of stress above 0 4 may be acceptable for single ky periods when the eta etm difference between consecutive ky stages is low e calibration of the ky values for each one of the four studied cultivars to reach the best fit between observed yo and simulated ya yields

ky values for the whole growing cycle and per stage by using the data of the validation year 2012 for all cultivars the model was considered calibrated and validated when the difference between observed and simulated yields was equal to or lower than 10 and when the percentage of simulated yields satisfying the preceding requirement was equal to or higher than 70 of total simulations for each cultivar farahani et al 2009 heng et al 2009 statistical parameters were used to determine the goodness of fit of the simulations willmott 1982 root mean square error rmse normalized root mean

9 optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi ordi determines the irrigation strategy for each growing stage that produces the highest yield for a certain overall deficit target accumulated daily eta divided by the accumulated daily etm for the whole crop cycle using non linear optimization software solver microsoft 2013 this methodology has been validated for several horticultural crops under semi arid domínguez et al 2012b 2013 leite et al 2015a and tropical carvalho et al 2014 léllis et al 2017 conditions following the recommendations of these authors the optimizations must meet the following restrictions accumulated eta etm per ky stage 0 5 during kc i accumulated eta etm 0 8 to guarantee the crop initiates and establishes adequately and the maximum eta etm difference between two consecutive ky stages 0 4 the regular tmy generated in section 2 6 with ordi was used to calculate the theoretical eta etm rate per ky stage that maximizes potato yield under the typical climatic conditions of the study area for the optimization we also considered the amount of soil moisture that may be used by the crop and the management of the irrigation system interval between irrigation events equal to 3 days as a minimum and 7 days as maximum with the net irrigation dose water available for cultivation through the irrigation system being between 3 and 24 mm in this way the net irrigation requirements inr for the full irrigation strategy under the regular tmy conditions were estimated moreover ordi was used to determine the optimal irrigation scheduling for 6 deficit amounts of irrigation water 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of inr that maximizes yield under regular tmy for a limited amount of water for each potato cultivar we analyzed the impact on yield and on the irrigation water productivity defined as the yield produced by the crop per unit of net irrigation water supplied by the irrigation system when the amount of irrigation water supplied to the crop was reduced 3 results and discussion 3 1 typical meteorological year the years of the climatic series 1955 2016 were arranged from highest to lowest pdz and divided into two groups regular and wet with similar range table 2 shows the years included in each climatic group and the years selected for each month of the regular tmy the wet tmy was not calculated because it was outside the scope of this research statistically the number of wet years is lower 14 wet vs 48 regular years the variability of the regular years is low showing a standard deviation of 52 4 mm for pd and 41 5 mm for p table 2 in the 14 wet years the average rainfall was 60 higher than in the regular years nonetheless eto was just 6 4 lower table 2 for the growth period pd was considerably different for regular and wet years table 3 which is likely to affect the irrigation requirements of the crop 3 2 duration of kc and ky stages as a function of gdd to obtain the thermal time of the potato crop table 3 the base tb 2 c and upper tu 26 c temperatures with the lowest cv for gdd were determined these values are similar to those proposed by steduto et al 2012 although the climatic conditions mainly rainfall of the different experimental years varied table 4 during the phenological development period the progression of accumulated gdd in kc and ky stages were similar table 3 thus the differences in the accumulated gdd in each of the stages are below 10 for the three study years translating this variability into days implies a difference of 4 kc i 5 kc ii and ky i 9 kc iii and ky ii and 9 kc iv and ky iii days in the duration of kc and ky stages from the first day after sowing table 3 once the regular tmy was determined table 4 and using the average gdd accumulated by stages table 3 it was possible to calculate the duration of the kc and ky stages of crop development for that theoretical year table 3 as expected the duration of all the stages was within the range obtained in the field experiments while the temperatures of the regular tmy were similar to those in the three year field experiment eto was 10 lower and p was 14 higher than the average 3 3 yield versus irrigation relationship the yield of the four potato cultivars increased with the amount of water supplied by the irrigation system in the three experimental years fig 4 in most of the deficit treatments the effect of water on yield was heterogeneous highlighting the importance of achieving suitable allocation of irrigation water during the growing season the yields of the non deficit treatments were used to determine the ym values of each cultivar table 5 eta etm rates for each ky stage of each treatment were estimated using the kc values considered in the study area neiker 2017b which are similar to those proposed by fao allen et al 1998 table 5 treatments were arranged according to the total net water twn received by the crop fig 5 where treatment 1 t1 received the lowest amount of water and t5 received the highest treatments with eta etm ratios lower than 0 5 in any of the growing stages should not be considered section 2 8 thus justifying a different number of analyzed treatments per cultivar fig 5 however in this study the threshold was set at 0 4 since a large number of treatments showed a good fit between those simulated and observed in the deficit treatments the lowest eta etm ratios occurred during the ky iii stage while the eta etm ratios for the whole growing cycle ranged from 0 57 leire t1 2011 to 1 0 in the full irrigation treatments fig 5 the calibration and validation of the ym ky per growing stage and ky for the whole growing cycle parameters were satisfactory since for each cultivar and experimental year the percentage of matching values the difference between observed and simulated yields 10 was higher than 70 table 6 the statistical analysis of the calibrated and validated ym ky per stage table 7 and ky for the whole growing cycle table 8 revealed high correlations the similarity rate sr and aggregation indices ai were very high values close to 1 in the majority of the cases except for the calibration of the mirari and zorba cultivars which were acceptable the rmse ranged between 3000 and 7000 kg ha 1 which was higher for the most productive cultivars considering the nrmse values these results could be classified as excellent in all the cases except the mirari and zorba cultivars in the calibration years which were good jamieson et al 2004 bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 raes et al 2012 ky for the whole growing cycle can thus be a suitable solution for simpler irrigation schedules under constant deficit irrigation cdi with slight stress analyzing the ky values table 5 it can be seen that the most sensitive stage to water deficit stress is yield formation ky ii similar results were reported by several authors miller and martin 1987a b kumar and minhas 1994 concluding that water shortage during tuber initiation or the bulking stage decreases yield to a greater extent than in other growth stages as a result of smaller tubers the value determined for zobra and monalisa at this stage coincides with the fao recommendation 0 70 doorenbos and kassam 1979 and was higher in the other two cultivars although the duration of this stage represents approximately 20 of the total cycle under the climate conditions of the trials it requires around 40 of the total amount of irrigation water with it thus being unadvisable to provoke a deficit during this stage according to the ky values mirari and leire are more sensitive to water stress than the other two cultivars reaching the same ky values this finding is endorsed by a higher ky for the whole growing cycle values with zorba being the least sensitive therefore these cultivars respond to water stress with differing losses in yield which must be taken into account when making irrigation decisions 3 4 determination of the ordi strategy for cropping potato average optimal deficit targets per developing stage as expected the net irrigation requirements under the climatic conditions of the regular tmy were lower than those in the experimental years for the full irrigation treatments since the test years were drier than the regular ones tables 4 and 9 fig 4 the ordi methodology proposes decreasing the deficit in the most sensitive stage ky ii balancing the use of water by increasing the deficit in the least sensitive stages k iii ky i and ky i respectively this strategy is more evident with increasing levels of the total deficit until eta etm 0 5 table 9 the differences between cultivars as regards the level of deficit to be reached at each phenological stage are related to the ky values used in the simulations in general the simulated yields were higher when using the ky values per development than the ky for the whole growing cycle ones the differences were below 5 for the cultivar that was least sensitive to water stress zorba nevertheless in the other cultivars differences increased with the deficit being up to 5 for the eta etm for the whole growing cycle 0 8 between 10 and 15 for the eta etm for the whole growing cycle 0 7 and up to 25 for the eta etm for the whole growing cycle 0 5 in the most sensitive cultivars leire and mirari table 9 the optimal eta etm ratios per stage should not be directly extrapolated to a real farm since rainfall and or soil moisture content among others may affect the actual eta etm relationships thus the parameters required by this methodology must be fitted to the climatic conditions and the cultivars of the area to be used moreover under water scarcity conditions farmers are not usually interested in applying a determined level of deficit their aim is to supply a certain amount of irrigation water conditioned by the total amount of irrigation water available for the farm that year and reach the maximum yield domínguez et al 2017 in order to address this limitation the methodology proposed by leite et al 2015b was used for seven fixed volumes of irrigation water 100 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of inr 1961 m3 ha 1 table 10 the simulations with the mopeco model produced a result in terms that optimized irrigation schedules decreasing by up to 60 the amount of water irrigation supplied to the crop for the eta etm for the whole growing cycle 0 74 while yields decreased between 28 zorba and 38 mirari and leire consequently the irrigation water productivity in terms of yield increased to 79 7 zorba with deficit with the average being 65 4 therefore under water scarcity conditions this methodology allows irrigation water productivity to be improved this finding contrasts with previous studies in potato and other crops in which efficiency decreases from a certain level of deficit bacon 2004 badr et al 2012 in this case the high values of precipitation in the area during the establishment and vegetative development of the crop ky i allow a high percentage of irrigation water to be reserved for the next two stages reducing the effect of water deficit and thus improving irrigation water productivity table 10 in absolute terms efficiencies were higher for more productive cultivars table10 the improvement in irrigation water productivity makes it possible to determine management strategies for irrigated areas cultivating potatoes hence in the event that decreasing the use of irrigation water in the area is necessary as a consequence of a drought period reducing the amount of water supplied to the crop by 20 would generate a slight drop in yield of around 5 depending on the cultivar fig 6 4 conclusions mopeco is a valid tool to simulate a potato crop under the humid climatic conditions of the basque country the calibrated values of ky differ depending on the cultivar nevertheless they are within the range of those found in the literature the different values of ky determined for the four cultivars under study allow them to be classified according to their sensitivity to stress caused by water deficit the zorba cultivar is the least sensitive followed by monalisa while mirari and leire are the most sensitive in order to increase water productivity and depending on the available amount of water the methodology proposes avoiding deficit at the yield formation stage ky ii if possible causing deficit at the ripening stage ky iii or even in the vegetative period ky i if necessary the yields simulated by using the ky value for the whole growing cycle value or the ky per stage values are similar in terms of goodness of fit however it is not possible to optimize the yield through ordi methodology by using the ky for the whole growing cycle the ordi methodology increased the irrigation water productivity in all the studied cultivars being higher in the case of the cultivars able to achieve higher yields the mopeco simulations using the typical meteorological year combined with the ordi methodology allow the most suitable strategies to be determined to decrease the effects of reduced availability of irrigation water in the basque country consequently these methodologies may be a useful decision support tool

year field experiment years 2010 2011 and 2012 two per cultivar under deficit irrigation conditions in the basque country region of spain the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi strategy was used in combination with the typical meteorological year tmy methodology to determine irrigation strategies aimed at increasing the irrigation water productivity of potato crop under real farming

fao 56 were 0 45 vegetative period 0 70 to 0 90 yield formation and 0 25 to 0 40 ripening depending on the considered cultivar the validation results showed that mopeco is suitable for simulating the yield versus total water gross irrigation effective rainfall use under the climatic and soil conditions in this study normalized root mean square error from 7 2 to 8 5 between observed and simulated levels ordi maximized the yield of the crop for different volumes of available irrigation water the irrigation water productivity differed according to the cultivar increasing for lower volumes of

industry and services evett and tolk 2009 generating 40 of world food production the reduction of water available for agricultural purposes together with the increase in energy costs directly associated with modernized irrigation make irrigation water productivity and the measures to cope with droughts a priority objective in this sector potato solarum tuberosum l with 368 mt and an area of 20 mha is the fourth most widely grown crop in the world over the last three decades yearly production has increased by an average of 1 4 mainly in cultivars destined for industrial processing

other growing parameters such as aquacrop steduto et al 2009 foster et al 2017 simdualkc rosa et al 2012 dssat hoogenboom et al 2004 cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 apsim keating et al 2003 and substor potato griffin et al 1995 some authors linker et al 2016 have carried out modeling studies on optimization of irrigation water to potato crop based on aquacrop nevertheless it is less common to find models such as mopeco that optimize irrigation water allocation to maximize yield domínguez et al 2012a leite et al 2015a and the gross margin of crops and farms lópez mata et al 2016 domínguez et al 2017 in the basque country potato crop occupies around 1600 ha in farms located in the south of the territory which represents 20 of the total irrigated land eustat 2017 mapama 2017a the province of álava is the main national reference in the cultivation of virus free potatoes for planting however the potato cropping area has been forecast to increase around 10 in other regions in coming years fepex 2017 for this reason the basque country institute of agricultural research and development neiker tecnalia is developing a line of research to obtain new potato cultivars adapted to heat waves and drought periods resulting from climate change neiker 2017a several studies have shown that gradual soil drying imposed by deficit irrigation techniques induces physiological responses in potato plant resulting in partial stomatal closure and an increase in photosynthetic water use efficiency jensen et al 2010 kiziloglu et al 2006 many experimental results have evidenced that water stress at the early two stages i e stolonization and tuberization showed sharp negative response to the yield of potato compared with bulking and tuber enlargement stages hassan et al 2002 mahima et al 2018 thus the advance in the management of controlled deficit irrigation techniques rdi english 1990 such as the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology developed by crea castilla la mancha university spain domínguez et al 2012a may help improve the competitiveness of this sector this methodology has been successfully applied in crops such as maize domínguez et al 2012a onion domínguez et al 2012b garlic domínguez et al 2013 and carrot léllis et al 2017 in which the yield or marketable yield increased by 10 20 3 7 3 9 and 15 27 and the gross margin rose by 20 30 59 and 30 respectively compared with an irrigation strategy where the stress level remained constant during the whole growth cycle constant regulated deficit irrigation cdi these techniques focus on increasing irrigation water productivity as a way of enhancing agricultural income by decreasing the pressure on natural resources the main aim of this work was to establish a methodology to determine irrigation strategies that maximize the yield of four potato cultivars in the basque country with limited availability of irrigation water under water scarcity conditions the partial objectives were a to determine the typical water requirements of the crop under the climatic conditions of the basque country b to calibrate the yield response factor ky doorenbos and kassam 1979 for four potato cultivars and c to determine the irrigation strategies that maximize the yield under limited availability of irrigation water for four potato cultivars 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the basque country region 7234 km2 is located in the north of spain fig 1 agricultural lands occupy an area of 82 518 ha of which 10 is irrigated with either sprinkler 58 or drip irrigation 21 systems agricultural activity in the basque country is mainly concentrated in álava the southern province the most common irrigated species are annual extensive crops such as sugar beet and potato 67 and tree crops such as grape vines 30 eustat 2017 the accumulated annual precipitation in álava ranges between 500 mm and 800 mm the average annual temperature is approximately 11 c and maximum and minimum

average annual rainfall mostly concentrated in the spring and fall 2 2 field experiments the experimental area was composed of four 36 m 24 m blocks with 18 m each side of the sprinkler line fig 2 the irrigation system was formed by a single line of sprinklers placed at a height of 1 50 m and spaced at 12 00 m fig 2 a sprinkler line source technique hanks et al 1976 was used to define five irrigation treatments t1 t5 this experimental design provides a continuous variable water gradient perpendicular to the sprinkler line the water applied decreased linearly from the sprinkler line t1 to the edge of each experimental block t5 on each side of the sprinkler line the operating pressure was around 300 kpa and water was provided through a double nozzle system diameters 4 0 mm and 2 4 mm supplying 1450 l h 1 the line source 108 m long with 10 sprinklers was placed in the middle of the experimental area fig 2 four potato varieties were randomly distributed inside each block on both sides of the sprinkler line occupying equal areas of 18 m 16 ridges 12 m in each block rain gauges were installed on both sides of the sprinkler line with a separation of 3 m starting from the ridges adjacent to the sprinkler line in order to quantify the amount of water applied following the continuous gradient perpendicular to the sprinkler line fig 2 plots of 1 5 m two ridges 15 m adjacent to each rain gauge were harvested t1 t5 in each of the ridges tubers with a 40 60 cm caliber were planted at a rate of 3 units per linear meter irrigation was scheduled so that treatment t1 received the

requirements which represents approximately between 40 and 100 of maximum crop evapotranspiration etm irrigation was applied every 7 days and the water applied was measured after each irrigation event based on the rain gauge records a total of 80 catch cans with a diameter of 0 16 m and a height of 0 31 m with a spacing of 3 0 m 12 0 m were used for collecting the irrigation water fig 2 to minimize distortion of the sprinkler pattern irrigation was applied under light wind conditions wind speed 2 m s 1 in each t1 plot a pair of watermark sensors irrometer corp riverside ca usa were installed at a depth of 0 3 and 0 6 m to monitor the soil moisture content and to verify that the irrigation in these treatments was suitable for avoiding soil water depletion and percolation out of the root zone as basal dressing 150 kg ha 1 of nitrogen 75 kg ha 1 of phosphorus and 225 kg ha 1 of potassium was added to the soil table 1 one month after planting 100 kg ha 1 of nitrogen was provided as top dressing each year 3 fungicide treatments and 1 insecticide treatment were conducted during the cultivation cycle at the end of the cycle a quantity of herbicide was applied to cause the plants to dry before harvesting table 1 the climatic conditions during the period of development of the crop were similar in terms of evapotranspiration demand with variations up to 10 and very different for precipitation with variations higher than 50 table 1 during the field trials daily irrigation scheduling was performed by using the simplified water balance in the root zone methodology allen et al 1998 pereira and allen 1999 which is that used by the mopeco model domínguez et al 2011 the climatic data employed in this study were collected from the weather station salvatierra located 8 km away from the field trials which is the property of the basque meteorology agency http www euskalmet euskadi eus and a neiker weather station pessl instruments austria installed in the gauna property 2 3 potato cultivars the experiment was conducted using 4 major commercial potato cultivars solarum tuberosum l registered in the official register of plant cultivars mapama 2017b zorba registration number 19920286 an early cultivar suitable for fresh consumption and especially suitable for the production of chips it is relatively unsusceptible to internal damage since it adapts well to storage and is highly resistant to y virus mildew and other diseases mirari registration number 20060305 is a cultivar of excellent characteristics for fresh consumption maturity is semi late and it provides a very high yield it has a certain tolerance to water stress and resistance to golden nematode globodera rostochiensis monalisa registration number 19780253 a semi early cultivar especially indicated for frying and suitable for fresh consumption it adapts well to storage and presents high resistance to a x y viruses leire registration number 20040542 a semi late cultivar is extraordinarily good for boiling and frying it is well adapted to ecological production due to its high resistance to mildew golden nematode globodera rostochiensis potato y virus pvy and especially the potato leaf roll virus plrv the duration of the phenological development was between 110 120 days for the semi early varieties and about 150 days for the semi late maturity varieties in this experiment the crop was harvested around 150 days after plantation this coincides with the usual crop management in the area which is conditioned by the climate requiring potatoes to be harvested before the end of september for the cropping period in the study area the fertilization and the pesticide treatments were implemented as in a non deficit treatment t1 thus the yield obtained by each cultivar was only conditioned by the availability of irrigation water and the climatic conditions during the experimental year 2 4 phenological data in the simulations mopeco uses the crop coefficient kc dimensionless allen et al 1998 to calculate etm and the crop yield response factor ky dimensionless doorenbos and kassam 1979 to estimate actual yield ya section 2 7 both kc and ky depend on the phenological stage of the crop potato has four kc with three reference values and three ky stages with three reference values during its growing period fig 3 the length of the kc and ky stages are required by the model and were determined through the crop monitoring carried out during the three experimental years by using the bbch phenological scale bleiholder et al 2001 2 5 effect of inter annual variability on crop growth to calculate the length of the potato growth stages in terms of accumulated growing degree days gdd mopeco uses the double triangulation method sevacherian et al 1977 domínguez et al 2012c two parameters must be determined for the gdd calculation tl base temperature for development in ºc and tu upper threshold temperature at which the rate of development begins to decrease in ºc tl may vary from 2 to 7 c while tu ranges between 25 and 36 c ojeda bustamante et al 2004 worthington and hutchinson 2005 ahmadvand et al 2009 steduto et al 2012 the combination of tl and tu values with the lowest coefficient of variation cv for the total number of monitoring plots used in the determination of the average gdd was selected section 3 2 2 6 determination of the typical meteorological year tmy a typical meteorological year tmy hall et al 1978 represents the conditions considered typical over a long period and was adapted by domínguez et al 2013 for forecasting irrigation schedules a tmy consists of 12 months selected from individual years and concatenated to form a complete year with daily values in this study using the climatic series from 1955 to 2016 the regular tmy was determined by means of the methodology proposed by leite et al 2015b to determine which years were regular the precipitation deficit index pd p eto mm was used de pauw 2002 harmsen et al 2009 this index was standardized pdz following sokal and rohlf 1995 only the months from may to september were used to determine the tmys as the growth of the potato crop in the study area occurs during this period 2 7 simulation of the yield versus irrigation relationship mopeco domínguez et al 2013 uses the model proposed by stewart et al 1977 eq 1 which estimates crop yield as a function of the actual versus maximum evapotranspiration ratio eta etm in the different growth stages when eta etm the plant suffers from stress that may cause a drop in yield actual yield ya maximum yield ym hence for each cultivar and treatment eq 1 was used for ky per stages and eq 2 for global ky for the whole growing cycle 1 y a y m k 1 3 1 k y k 1 e t a k e t m k 2 1 y a y m k y 1 e t a e t m where ya and ym are the actual and maximum crop yields kg ha 1 k is the actual growing stage allen et al 1998 kyk is the crop yield response factor by growing stage vegetative period yield formation and ripening doorenbos and kassam 1979 and ky for the whole growing cycle etak and etmk are the accumulated crop evapotranspiration in each ky growing stage mm and eta and etm are the accumulated crop evapotranspiration for the whole growing cycle daily etm is calculated by multiplying daily kc by daily eto values allen et al 1998 while daily eta under water stress conditions is calculated using the equation proposed by the same authors which requires a daily balance of water and soluble salt content the latter not being required in this study in the soil domínguez et al 2011 for the whole growing cycle if ky 1 yield reduction is directly proportional to reduced water use while if ky 1 crop response is very sensitive to water deficit with proportionally larger yield reductions when water use is reduced because of stress 2 8 model calibration and validation the calibration and validation processes followed the methodology proposed by domínguez et al 2012c for maize and followed by other authors for horticultural crops such as onion garlic and carrot domínguez et al 2012b 2013 carvalho et al 2014 respectively the kc values applied in this study were 0 40 1 10 and 0 75 which are those recommended by the irrigation service of the basque country spain neiker 2017b these are based on fao 56 allen et al 1998 and adjusted to the conditions in the area they are similar to those used by other authors in sub humid and other climatic conditions kashyap and panda 2001 shahnazari et al 2007 the process was a the ym value was set according to the results of the field tests the maximum yield ym of each cultivar is different and is conditioned among other factors by the climatic conditions of each cropping year this value is more variable in the case of potato than in other species especially because of its sensitiveness to sun radiation changes and the effects of temperature during the flowering stage landeras 2009 caldiz et al 2002 licker et al 2010 haverkort et al 2014 2015 deguchi et al 2016 mopeco simulates the actual yield ya as a proportion of ym according to the availability of water in the root area during the growing period but is unable to fit ym to the climatic conditions of each year stewart et al 1977 domínguez et al 2011 since the value of ym is essential for adequate calibration of the model domínguez et al 2012c these values in the present study were established according to those obtained for each cultivar and year in the non deficit treatments fig 4 b by inserting the kc values fitted for the study area neiker 2017b in the mopeco model the simulations of the soil moisture progression were conducted for the full irrigation treatments and the eta etm rates were found to be close to 1 and there was no percolation associated with irrigation events c the eta etm rates for every ky and kc stage were calculated for each treatment and cultivar a total of 160 irrigation treatments 4 cultivars x 2 years 5 irrigation treatments 4 repetitions were simulated d treatments in which the eta etm for the whole growing cycle was lower than 0 5 were rejected doorenbos and kassam 1979 in the same way the treatments reaching eta etm rates 0 4 for any of the specific ky stages were also rejected according to domínguez et al 2012b and carvalho et al 2014 this level of stress above 0 4 may be acceptable for single ky periods when the eta etm difference between consecutive ky stages is low e calibration of the ky values for each one of the four studied cultivars to reach the best fit between observed yo and simulated ya yields

ky values for the whole growing cycle and per stage by using the data of the validation year 2012 for all cultivars the model was considered calibrated and validated when the difference between observed and simulated yields was equal to or lower than 10 and when the percentage of simulated yields satisfying the preceding requirement was equal to or higher than 70 of total simulations for each cultivar farahani et al 2009 heng et al 2009 statistical parameters were used to determine the goodness of fit of the simulations willmott 1982 root mean square error rmse normalized root mean

9 optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi ordi determines the irrigation strategy for each growing stage that produces the highest yield for a certain overall deficit target accumulated daily eta divided by the accumulated daily etm for the whole crop cycle using non linear optimization software solver microsoft 2013 this methodology has been validated for several horticultural crops under semi arid domínguez et al 2012b 2013 leite et al 2015a and tropical carvalho et al 2014 léllis et al 2017 conditions following the recommendations of these authors the optimizations must meet the following restrictions accumulated eta etm per ky stage 0 5 during kc i accumulated eta etm 0 8 to guarantee the crop initiates and establishes adequately and the maximum eta etm difference between two consecutive ky stages 0 4 the regular tmy generated in section 2 6 with ordi was used to calculate the theoretical eta etm rate per ky stage that maximizes potato yield under the typical climatic conditions of the study area for the optimization we also considered the amount of soil moisture that may be used by the crop and the management of the irrigation system interval between irrigation events equal to 3 days as a minimum and 7 days as maximum with the net irrigation dose water available for cultivation through the irrigation system being between 3 and 24 mm in this way the net irrigation requirements inr for the full irrigation strategy under the regular tmy conditions were estimated moreover ordi was used to determine the optimal irrigation scheduling for 6 deficit amounts of irrigation water 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of inr that maximizes yield under regular tmy for a limited amount of water for each potato cultivar we analyzed the impact on yield and on the irrigation water productivity defined as the yield produced by the crop per unit of net irrigation water supplied by the irrigation system when the amount of irrigation water supplied to the crop was reduced 3 results and discussion 3 1 typical meteorological year the years of the climatic series 1955 2016 were arranged from highest to lowest pdz and divided into two groups regular and wet with similar range table 2 shows the years included in each climatic group and the years selected for each month of the regular tmy the wet tmy was not calculated because it was outside the scope of this research statistically the number of wet years is lower 14 wet vs 48 regular years the variability of the regular years is low showing a standard deviation of 52 4 mm for pd and 41 5 mm for p table 2 in the 14 wet years the average rainfall was 60 higher than in the regular years nonetheless eto was just 6 4 lower table 2 for the growth period pd was considerably different for regular and wet years table 3 which is likely to affect the irrigation requirements of the crop 3 2 duration of kc and ky stages as a function of gdd to obtain the thermal time of the potato crop table 3 the base tb 2 c and upper tu 26 c temperatures with the lowest cv for gdd were determined these values are similar to those proposed by steduto et al 2012 although the climatic conditions mainly rainfall of the different experimental years varied table 4 during the phenological development period the progression of accumulated gdd in kc and ky stages were similar table 3 thus the differences in the accumulated gdd in each of the stages are below 10 for the three study years translating this variability into days implies a difference of 4 kc i 5 kc ii and ky i 9 kc iii and ky ii and 9 kc iv and ky iii days in the duration of kc and ky stages from the first day after sowing table 3 once the regular tmy was determined table 4 and using the average gdd accumulated by stages table 3 it was possible to calculate the duration of the kc and ky stages of crop development for that theoretical year table 3 as expected the duration of all the stages was within the range obtained in the field experiments while the temperatures of the regular tmy were similar to those in the three year field experiment eto was 10 lower and p was 14 higher than the average 3 3 yield versus irrigation relationship the yield of the four potato cultivars increased with the amount of water supplied by the irrigation system in the three experimental years fig 4 in most of the deficit treatments the effect of water on yield was heterogeneous highlighting the importance of achieving suitable allocation of irrigation water during the growing season the yields of the non deficit treatments were used to determine the ym values of each cultivar table 5 eta etm rates for each ky stage of each treatment were estimated using the kc values considered in the study area neiker 2017b which are similar to those proposed by fao allen et al 1998 table 5 treatments were arranged according to the total net water twn received by the crop fig 5 where treatment 1 t1 received the lowest amount of water and t5 received the highest treatments with eta etm ratios lower than 0 5 in any of the growing stages should not be considered section 2 8 thus justifying a different number of analyzed treatments per cultivar fig 5 however in this study the threshold was set at 0 4 since a large number of treatments showed a good fit between those simulated and observed in the deficit treatments the lowest eta etm ratios occurred during the ky iii stage while the eta etm ratios for the whole growing cycle ranged from 0 57 leire t1 2011 to 1 0 in the full irrigation treatments fig 5 the calibration and validation of the ym ky per growing stage and ky for the whole growing cycle parameters were satisfactory since for each cultivar and experimental year the percentage of matching values the difference between observed and simulated yields 10 was higher than 70 table 6 the statistical analysis of the calibrated and validated ym ky per stage table 7 and ky for the whole growing cycle table 8 revealed high correlations the similarity rate sr and aggregation indices ai were very high values close to 1 in the majority of the cases except for the calibration of the mirari and zorba cultivars which were acceptable the rmse ranged between 3000 and 7000 kg ha 1 which was higher for the most productive cultivars considering the nrmse values these results could be classified as excellent in all the cases except the mirari and zorba cultivars in the calibration years which were good jamieson et al 2004 bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 raes et al 2012 ky for the whole growing cycle can thus be a suitable solution for simpler irrigation schedules under constant deficit irrigation cdi with slight stress analyzing the ky values table 5 it can be seen that the most sensitive stage to water deficit stress is yield formation ky ii similar results were reported by several authors miller and martin 1987a b kumar and minhas 1994 concluding that water shortage during tuber initiation or the bulking stage decreases yield to a greater extent than in other growth stages as a result of smaller tubers the value determined for zobra and monalisa at this stage coincides with the fao recommendation 0 70 doorenbos and kassam 1979 and was higher in the other two cultivars although the duration of this stage represents approximately 20 of the total cycle under the climate conditions of the trials it requires around 40 of the total amount of irrigation water with it thus being unadvisable to provoke a deficit during this stage according to the ky values mirari and leire are more sensitive to water stress than the other two cultivars reaching the same ky values this finding is endorsed by a higher ky for the whole growing cycle values with zorba being the least sensitive therefore these cultivars respond to water stress with differing losses in yield which must be taken into account when making irrigation decisions 3 4 determination of the ordi strategy for cropping potato average optimal deficit targets per developing stage as expected the net irrigation requirements under the climatic conditions of the regular tmy were lower than those in the experimental years for the full irrigation treatments since the test years were drier than the regular ones tables 4 and 9 fig 4 the ordi methodology proposes decreasing the deficit in the most sensitive stage ky ii balancing the use of water by increasing the deficit in the least sensitive stages k iii ky i and ky i respectively this strategy is more evident with increasing levels of the total deficit until eta etm 0 5 table 9 the differences between cultivars as regards the level of deficit to be reached at each phenological stage are related to the ky values used in the simulations in general the simulated yields were higher when using the ky values per development than the ky for the whole growing cycle ones the differences were below 5 for the cultivar that was least sensitive to water stress zorba nevertheless in the other cultivars differences increased with the deficit being up to 5 for the eta etm for the whole growing cycle 0 8 between 10 and 15 for the eta etm for the whole growing cycle 0 7 and up to 25 for the eta etm for the whole growing cycle 0 5 in the most sensitive cultivars leire and mirari table 9 the optimal eta etm ratios per stage should not be directly extrapolated to a real farm since rainfall and or soil moisture content among others may affect the actual eta etm relationships thus the parameters required by this methodology must be fitted to the climatic conditions and the cultivars of the area to be used moreover under water scarcity conditions farmers are not usually interested in applying a determined level of deficit their aim is to supply a certain amount of irrigation water conditioned by the total amount of irrigation water available for the farm that year and reach the maximum yield domínguez et al 2017 in order to address this limitation the methodology proposed by leite et al 2015b was used for seven fixed volumes of irrigation water 100 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of inr 1961 m3 ha 1 table 10 the simulations with the mopeco model produced a result in terms that optimized irrigation schedules decreasing by up to 60 the amount of water irrigation supplied to the crop for the eta etm for the whole growing cycle 0 74 while yields decreased between 28 zorba and 38 mirari and leire consequently the irrigation water productivity in terms of yield increased to 79 7 zorba with deficit with the average being 65 4 therefore under water scarcity conditions this methodology allows irrigation water productivity to be improved this finding contrasts with previous studies in potato and other crops in which efficiency decreases from a certain level of deficit bacon 2004 badr et al 2012 in this case the high values of precipitation in the area during the establishment and vegetative development of the crop ky i allow a high percentage of irrigation water to be reserved for the next two stages reducing the effect of water deficit and thus improving irrigation water productivity table 10 in absolute terms efficiencies were higher for more productive cultivars table10 the improvement in irrigation water productivity makes it possible to determine management strategies for irrigated areas cultivating potatoes hence in the event that decreasing the use of irrigation water in the area is necessary as a consequence of a drought period reducing the amount of water supplied to the crop by 20 would generate a slight drop in yield of around 5 depending on the cultivar fig 6 4 conclusions mopeco is a valid tool to simulate a potato crop under the humid climatic conditions of the basque country the calibrated values of ky differ depending on the cultivar nevertheless they are within the range of those found in the literature the different values of ky determined for the four cultivars under study allow them to be classified according to their sensitivity to stress caused by water deficit the zorba cultivar is the least sensitive followed by monalisa while mirari and leire are the most sensitive in order to increase water productivity and depending on the available amount of water the methodology proposes avoiding deficit at the yield formation stage ky ii if possible causing deficit at the ripening stage ky iii or even in the vegetative period ky i if necessary the yields simulated by using the ky value for the whole growing cycle value or the ky per stage values are similar in terms of goodness of fit however it is not possible to optimize the yield through ordi methodology by using the ky for the whole growing cycle the ordi methodology increased the irrigation water productivity in all the studied cultivars being higher in the case of the cultivars able to achieve higher yields the mopeco simulations using the typical meteorological year combined with the ordi methodology allow the most suitable strategies to be determined to decrease the effects of reduced availability of irrigation water in the basque country consequently these methodologies may be a useful decision support tool

is often recommended and propagated as one of the sustainable crop production strategies with the intention of aiding preservation of soil and water resources hobbs 2007 hobbs et al 2008 in general ca includes three major principles to fulfil its purpose i maintenance of a permanent vegetative cover on the soil surface ii minimal soil disturbance which can be accomplished by reduced or no tillage and iii diversified crop rotation fao 2008 technically ca can be considered as any tillage system that leaves 30 of harvested crop residue on the soil surface after planting uri et al 1998 this can be achieved by adopting several tillage systems or technologies that include reduced tillage rt no tillage nt residue mulching and subsoil mulching conservation tillage practices range from zero tillage

cannot be generalized because of the varied interactions that can occur under different soils climate and cropping systems moreover ca has shown to improve agricultural productivity by reducing soil

in adoption of ca on 125 million ha which is about 9 of the total arable lands globally kassam et al 2012 with the adoption of ca in different regions of the world it becomes necessary that these tillage systems be characterized for their effects on soil water dynamics crop water use crop yields and water productivity as well as the interactions of these variables it is generally perceived that tillage practices can potentially affect soil water dynamics by affecting infiltration evaporation water transmission properties and soil water storage this is possible owing to demonstrated evidence of various tillage systems either conventional or conservation to alter bulk density aggregate stability total porosity and organic carbon content resulting in alteration of soil structure and various other parameters which govern the soil water and soil water related properties bronick and lal 2005 pagliai et al 2004 hernanz et al 2002 beare et al 1994 these impacts of tillage management on soil water dynamics and consequently crop water use grain yield and water productivity however are rare and also considerably variable among studies locations management practices and cropping seasons because of differences in soil types precipitation distribution crop water requirements and aridity boone 1988 lampurlanes et al 2002 hemmat and eskandari 2004 for example one section of literature provides evidence to support the idea that adoption of conservation tillage resulted in improved soil water storage soil quality and crop yield and contributes to sustainable agricultural production when compared to traditional tillage systems it has been shown that no tillage enhanced soil water holding capacity and reduced soil evaporation lampurlanés et al 2016 the increased soil water storage can be attributed to reduced evaporation as the undisturbed crop residue layer under no till conditions serves as a barrier to reduce both soil evaporation and respiration benjamin et al 2015 found that differences in tillage no till vs chisel plow did not affect soil water storage and biomass production in maize while grain yield was unaffected in one of the years increased in four years by 12 18 and decreased in one year by 10 by adopting no till over chisel plow moreover they reported greater water productivity in four out of five years 8 16 when using nt cantero martínez et al 2007 conducted a long term study with several tillage treatments in three contrasting in terms of aridity mediterranean rainfed conditions and reported that the conservation tillage systems no till and minimum till did not present any advantages in terms of water use but benefits were found for yield 5 10 increase and water productivity in drier conditions they attributed the increased wp to higher root density under no till and minimum till in the post anthesis period as demonstrated by lampurlanés et al 2001 lampurlanés et al 2016 extended the same experiments and concluded that the minimum and no tillage treatments showed the highest soil water storage 25 higher than moulboard plow tillage post tillering evapotranspiration 78 of the times nt et was higher than mb et and yield nt yield was higher 26 of the times at the driest site they suggested that in semiarid rainfed conditions these benefits get supplemented with the degree of aridity yang et al 2018 reported that no tillage resulted in 5 7 greater yields than conventional tillage which were statistically significant for two out of three years which was a result of higher number of grains per panicle in the no till wheat stone and schlegel 2006 reported a 43 increase in grain sorghum yield response to water supply plant available soil water at planting plus growing season precipitation under no tillage 18 4 kg ha mm compared to conventional tillage 12 9 kg ha mm a wider range of other studies have reported findings that support this stance while encountering some extent of variability which is justified owing to the diversity of the conditions the experiments were conducted in o leary and connor 1997 pikul and aase 1999 tolk et al 1999 li and gong 2002 li et al 2004 gicheru et al 2004 fabrizzi et al 2005 bottinelli et al 2017 bhatt and khera 2006 shao et al 2016 some researchers reported that the impact of tillage practices on some of the aforementioned variables can show variation with the crop growth stage for example guan et al 2015 evaluated the effect of plow tillage pt rotary tillage rt and no tillage nt on root growth water consumption characteristics grain yield water use and water productivity wp of winter wheat under rain fed condition conducted in a field with 20 year of rotary tillage history they found that the pt and rt decreased the soil bulk density in the 0 20 cm soil depth and the penetration resistance in the 0 30 cm soil depth during two growth seasons pt had greater root weight density rwd root length density rld and root surface density rsd than those under nt in the 0 110 cm soil profile at the tillering stage and in the 0 40 cm soil profile at the flowering stage respectively however rwd rld and rsd of pt were lower than nt at 0 10 cm soil depth and greater at 10 20 cm soil depth at the ripening stage similar trends were observed under rt as compared with nt soil water content under pt and rt were lower as compared with nt from tillering to flowering stage across 0 110 cm but higher than under nt in 0 20 cm soil profile at ripening stage evapotranspiration et under pt was higher than under nt from sowing to flowering stages but significantly lower at the ripening stage they observed that tillage practices had no notable influences on pre planting soil water storage and total et under rainfed conditions during two growing season but pt significantly enhanced grain yield through higher spike number and grain weight compared with nt which led to higher wp under pt the findings of their study show that pt practice can reduce soil bulk density and penetration resistance at the tillage zone which can lead to greater rwd rld and rsd and greater et from tillering to flowering stage this can increase plant population and cause greater wp and yield under rainfed conditions guan et al 2015 in contrast several researchers have also shown that the tillage systems present no differences regarding the soil water dynamics or conservation tillage is not advantageous over other conventional tillage methods for example licht and al kaisi 2005 found that no tillage did not show any difference in soil moisture when compared to strip tillage and chisel plow although the changes in soil moisture were the lowest in no tillage moreover they found that due to the increased soil temperature in strip tillage by 1 2 1 4 c there was an improvement in plant emergence rate when compared to no tillage lampurlanes et al 2002 investigated water storage efficiency under subsoil tillage minimum tillage and no tillage for two soils they found no differences in water productivity among tillage systems overall during the total fallow period because the advantage of nt during the first sub period was lost during the second period guzha 2004 reported that the tilled soils tied ridge had the highest infiltration rates and soil moisture storage across other tillage methods and no till which also resulted in 18 higher yield in the tilled soils when compared to no till yield these diverse and contrasting observations from the past research imply that prior to the wide adoption of any conservation tillage practices its suitability and effectiveness should be researched and assessed on local scales which our research is effective in accomplishing according to the 2008 national crop residue management survey 21 7 060 909 ha of the total land area under maize 33 623 380 ha was cultivated with no till conservation tillage practice 1 4 470 727 ha with ridge till practice and 17 8 5 984 962 ha with mulch till practice amounting to 40 2 13 516 599 ha of the maize growing acreage under conservation tillage specifically in nebraska the adoption of no till systems has been widespread especially in dryland or rainfed cropping systems conservation technology information center ctic national survey 2004 as of 2004 in nebraska area planted with no till soil management was more than double at 26 9 of the total land area 1 74 million ha than that in 1992 when it was 10 3 of the total land area 639 404 ha nebraska leads the nation in terms of no till maize cultivation with 971 247 ha this widespread adoption of no till systems in nebraska justifies the need for scientific investigation of the impacts of these practices on water resources including evapotranspiration yield and crop water productivity although the potential positive impacts of no till practices on energy savings due to reduced field traffic reduced dust emission from agricultural fields reduced wind and water erosion enhanced soil quality structure macro porosity infiltration and organic matter accumulation and soil temperature moderation have been documented in the past fundamental gaps in knowledge of its impacts on crop water use and productivity exist in the region moreover the quantifications and comparisons of microclimate and crop water use etc among conventional and conservation tillage systems using advanced reliable and high resolution methodologies are extremely limited it is hypothesized that among the two tillage systems several aspects such as in season water management water allocations long term estimates of water supply demand and use design and management of water management infrastructures would considerably vary which makes precise measurement of etc even more crucial for this research the specific objectives of this research were to i measure and study the differences in maize growth and development under disk till dt and no till nt management ii measure and quantify daily monthly and growing season maize etc under dt and nt management iii evaluate if dt and nt maize present differences in field scale microclimate and quantify these differences and iv quantify and assess differences in dt and nt maize yield water productivity and irrigation yield and etc yield production functions iypf and etypf respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil and crop management the field experiments were conducted on producers production fields near holdrege nebraska in a semi arid region in 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons the general view of the nt and dt research fields that contrast the residue cover between the two fields are presented in picture 1 a and b two similar fields were selected and were in close proximity to each other fig 1 the selection of the two fields was an extensive process but was also a critical component of this research two fields that had similar topography slope etc same soil characteristics same irrigation system and system capacity same drop nozzles on the pivot same field size 56 ha each field with only 0 8 km apart same planting direction when necessary the same nitrogen herbicide insecticide pesticide fungicide management and the same or very similar other field management practices were selected the farmer cooperators agreed to plant on similar days with the same planting depth same maize hybrids same planting population density and also agreed to use the same planter to plant both dt and nt research fields in some cases the dt field had been disk tilled twice a year once in fall and once in spring with maize soybean rotation for 17 years and the nt field had been under nt management with maize soybean rotation for the last 17 years the soil at both sites was silt loam holdrege fine silty mixed superactive mesic typic argiustolls the measured soil properties at these two sites are presented in table 1 and are very similar to each other which was a crucial requirement for the objectives to be investigated at both the sites the farmer collaborator in close consultation with the senior author determined when and how much to irrigate by utilizing the soil moisture monitored at each site using model cs616 volumetric soil water content reflectometers campbell sci inc logan utah installed in the inter plant spacing at 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m below the soil surface as part of this research the aim of the irrigation management practice was to maintain the available soil water in the root zone between approximately 90 of the field capacity and the maximum allowable depletion of 55 of total available soil water taw irrigations were initiated each time the soil water in the crop root zone was depleted by about 40 45 below field capacity with all the conditions and management practices being similar for this research it was assumed that any observed differences in the field specific variables were attributed to differences in field specific tillage practices during the 2011 growing season both fields were planted with a maize hybrid pioneer 33m54 on 2 may which emerged on 6 may dt and 10 may nt and were harvested on 25 october dt and 27 october nt in 2012 the maize hybrid pioneer 33b51 was planted on 26 april emerged on 6 may dt and 10 may nt and harvested on 30 october dt and 27 october nt finally in 2013 the maize hybrid gh 9071 3000 gt was planted on 5 may dt and 3 may nt emerged on 13 may dt and 15 may nt and harvested on 30 october dt and 27 october nt in general maize plants emerged 2 5 days later in the nt field than dt field the plant population was 71 660 plants ha in 2011 and 74 132 plants ha in 2012 and 2013 in both fields some of the critical field and crop management practices are presented in table 2 2 2 measurement of crop evapotranspiration and surface energy balance variables microclimate and crop growth etc during the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons was measured about 1 m above the canopy using two identical bowen ratio bowen 1926 energy balance systems brebs radiation and energy balance systems rebs inc bellevue washington which were part of the larger nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux irmak 2010 that were installed in each of the two research fields prior to installation of the two brebss in research fields the two identical brebss were run for a period of time in the same location to collect data to ensure that both systems provide exact data under the same conditions so that the measurements in two different fields are not biased effective and robust performance of brebs in successfully quantifying the evaporative fluxes above various vegetation surfaces have been documented lafleur and rouse 1990 ham and heilman 1991 bausch and bernard 1992 fritschen 1965 irmak and mutiibwa 2008 2010 irmak 2010 various meteorological measurements including sensible heat flux h soil heat flux g latent heat flux le net radiation rn and air temperature ta and vapor pressure e gradients ta e were recorded using the brebss the brebs measured flux data and other datasets used in this research were gathered in conjunction with the nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux irmak 2010 that operates eleven brebs and eddy covariance systems over various vegetation surfaces the nebflux measures all surface energy flux variables meteorological variables plant physiological parameters soil water content every 0 30 m up to 1 80 m on an hourly basis soil characteristics and agronomical components including biomass production and or yield for various vegetation surfaces in this research in each brebs a net radiometer model rebs q 7 1 rebs inc bellevue wash was used to measure rn total incoming radiation shortwave longwave total outgoing radiation shortwave longwave and net radiation values were measured using the rebs model thrds7 1 double sided total hemispherical radiometer incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation were measured using the rebs model pds7 1 double sided pyranometer the incoming and outgoing longwave radiation values were determined from the difference between the thrds7 1 measured total radiation and the pds7 1 measured shortwave radiation the albedo values were calculated using the ratio of incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation the thrds7 1 is sensitive to wavelengths from 0 25 to 60 μm and the pds7 1 is sensitive to wavelengths from 0 35 to 2 8 μm the radiometers were mounted about 5 m above the ground surface to obtain a clear view of the underlying surface being measured while minimizing the influence of the mounting tower other objects or surrounding canopy surfaces that might affect albedo or longwave radiation from the measured surface proper leveling of the radiometer domes was routinely maintained to ensure accuracy soil heat flux was measured using rebs hft 3 1 heat flux plates and rebs stp 1 soil thermocouples three soil heat flux plates were placed at depths between 0 05 and 0 06 m below the soil surface three soil thermocouples were installed near soil heat flux plates at depths of 0 04 to 0 05 m below the soil surface soil heat flux measurements were adjusted for soil temperature and moisture as measured by three rebs smp1r soil moisture probes installed in the same location as the soil temperature sensors and soil heat flux plates irmak 2010 air temperature and relative humidity gradients were measured using two platinum resistance thermometers and monolithic capacitive humidity sensors rebs models thp04015 and thp04016 respectively with resolutions of 0 0055 c for temperature and 0 033 for relative humidity measured temperature and relative humidity gradients were used to calculate sensible heat flux density bowen ratio and vapor pressure deficit vpd the brebs included a barometric pressure sensor model 276 setra systems inc boxborough

exchanged the temperature and humidity sensors every 15 min at two heights above the canopy to minimize the impact of any bias in the top and bottom temperature and humidity sensors on the bowen ratio

weather data used in eq 1 were measured from the bowen ratio energy balance system brebs installed in the middle of each of the experimental fields which are a part of the nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux irmak 2010 it has been shown earlier that using weather data measured above an agronomic crop to calculate etref closely resembles the values calculated using weather station data estimated etref skaggs and irmak 2012 the growing degree days gdd concept i e thermal unit tu is based on an accumulation of daily air temperatures between some high and some low temperatures judged to be growth limiting and is commonly expressed as 2 g d d i 1 n t m a x t m i n 2 t b a s e where tmax is the maximum air temperature tmin is the minimum air temperature tbase is the base temperature threshold 10 c and n is the number of days the base temperature for calculating gdd is the minimum threshold temperature below which plant growth ceases in this research maximum and minimum temperature thresholds of 30 c and 10 c respectively were chosen for maize all temperature values exceeding the upper threshold value were reduced to 30 c and values below 10 c were taken as 10 c if the average daily temperature tmax tmin 2 was below the base temperature then the gdd value was assumed to be equal to zero djaman and irmak 2012 the crop water productivity wp also known as water use efficiency was calculated to evaluate the efficiency and productivity response of maize under dt and nt management production settings which was computed as the ratio of maize grain yield to brebs measured maize etc 3 w p y e t c 1000 where wp is expressed in kg m3 on a unit water volume basis and y grain yield kg m2 and etc mm is crop evapotranspiration 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions during the research period monthly means of the weather variables during the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons are presented in table 3 tmax during may june and july were considerably higher during 2012 than 2011 and 2013 while they were comparable for august and september the tmin were similar during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons and were higher in 2013 in august september and october rh was the highest in 2011 followed by 2013 and 2012 also during 2012 higher rs was observed when compared to other growing seasons higher u2 was recorded in 2013 during july and august the vapor pressure deficit vpd was the highest during the 2012 growing season followed by 2013 and 2011 growing seasons vpd is an effective measure of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere implying that the atmospheric evaporative demand was highest during 2012 however this difference was minimal during june and october studies in the past have indicated that a unit change in vpd can result in as much as 10 30 change in the estimated potential reference et saxton 1975 irmak et al 2006 it should be noted that the year 2012 has been characterized as the most severe drought over the central us plains since data record began in 1895 hoerling et al 2014 which was supported by the weather summary presented above this research presents an opportunity to investigate differences between nt and dt in terms of crop water use dynamics during three growing seasons that had substantially different conditions including during an extreme growing season in terms of weather daily thermal units tu or gdd were calculated and analyzed to observe differences in heat accumulation among the three growing seasons weather data from a weather station holdrege 5 n latitude 40 30 longitude 99 22 automated weather data network high plains regional climate center awdn hprcc in proximity to our field sites were used fig 2 depicts the daily and cumulative tus during the common period from each of the growing seasons in the figure the cumulative tus were 1677 c 1814 c and 1833 c for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively cumulative tu for the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons were comparable to each other and both were greater than those in 2011 the 2011 growing season was cooler than 2012 and 2013 growing seasons by more than 1 c average air temperature which explains lower cumulative tu for 2011 it should be noted that for the dt field the cumulative tu at harvest in 2012 was greater than that in 2013 because the dt maize was harvested at 187 dap in 2012 in comparison to 178 dap in 2013 unlike nt maize which were harvested only 2 days apart the precipitation data were analyzed during the window encompassing the growing seasons of both dt and nt maize for each year during these periods the cumulative precipitation amounts were 469 202 and 288 mm for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively fig 3 presents the individual precipitation events and the cumulative precipitation during each of the growing season precipitation was highly variable between the individual growing seasons with 2012 experiencing an extreme drought interestingly the wettest year 2011 received 132 greater total growing season precipitation than the driest year 2012 precipitation was uniformly distributed during the 2011 and 2013 although the precipitation amounts were considerably lower 62 in 2013 while during 2012 dry spells were considerably longer especially in the initial and the later stages of the growing season seasonal total irrigation amounts applied to dt and nt fields were similar in all years the seasonal amounts of irrigation applied to the dt maize field were 165 371 and 180 mm for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively for the nt maize field they were 157 361 and 175 mm for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively for the 2012 growing season the irrigated amounts for both the tillage practices were higher more than two folds as compared to 2011 and 2013 growing seasons in order to compensate for the higher soil water deficit resulting from extremely low precipitation also irrigation application for the dt field was higher than the nt field by a negligible amount 5 the asce standardized daily and cumulative grass reference et eto and alfalfa reference et etr in relation to the tu gdd for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons are presented in fig 4 daily eto varied from 0 24 to 10 9 mm d 1 for the 2011 growing season from 0 54 to 12 1 mm d 1 in 2012 and from 0 12 to 11 9 mm d 1 in 2013 dt etr ranged from 0 27 to 16 4 mm d 1 for the 2011 growing season from 0 82 to 17 7 mm d 1 in 2012 and from 0 13 to 17 7 mm d 1 in 2013 the seasonal total eto was 809 1051 and 952 mm for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively whereas seasonal total etr was 1081 1462 and 1324 mm respectively the eto in 2012 was 30 greater than in 2011 and 10 greater than in 2013 and the etr in 2012 was 35 greater than in 2011 and 10 greater than in 2013 due to higher evaporative demand of the atmosphere in 2012 the seasonal total eto values derived from the meteorological parameters monitored in the individual field sites using brebss brebs 9 in nt field and brebs 10 in dt field were also calculated at the dt site the total seasonal eto was 782 922 and 838 mm whereas for the nt site the values were 760 888 and 834 mm for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively similarly the seasonal total etr values at the dt site were 1003 1207 and 1100 mm whereas for the nt site they were 961 1149 and 1094 mm for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively it should be noted that the differences in eto and etr among the two sites is because of small differences in time of planting and harvesting especially in 2012 which resulted in minor differences observed in seasonal reference et at the two sites these differences in seasonal reference et should not be understood as differences in atmospheric demand at the two sites as they are in close proximity of each other which has further been observed in the similarity of gdd eto and etr magnitudes 3 2 crop growth characteristics figs 5 and 6 present the seasonal patterns of maize plant height and lai respectively for both fields and three growing seasons as a function of days after planting dap maize height in general gradually increased as the growing season progressed reached a maximum at anthesis and then remained relatively constant or decreased slightly as leaf aging leaf folding and senescence started towards the end of the season the maximum plant height showed variation between the nt and dt fields and also inter annual variation between the years for the same tillage practice the peak dt maize height was 263 cm on 93 dap in 2011 343 cm on 98 dap in 2012 and 259 cm on 87 dap in 2013 the peak height for the nt was 303 cm on 93 dap in 2011 298 cm on 98 dap in 2012 and 303 cm on 109 dap in 2013 the nt maize height remained greater than dt maize height throughout the 2011 growing season although the differences were small during crop development and became considerable in the later stages on the contrary in 2012 the dt maize height was greater for the crop development period and then became similar to that of nt maize height in 2013 the dt maize height was greater for the crop development period similar to 2012 but nt maize height was greater during post anthesis period the maximum lai also exhibited variation between the nt and dt fields and also had inter annual variation between the years for the same tillage practice the lai for dt maize peaked at 2 7 m2 m 2 on 122 dap in 2011 4 6 m2 m 2 on 89 dap in 2012 and 5 2 m2 m 2 on 109 dap in 2013 for the nt maize the peak lai was 3 5 m2 m 2 on 109 dap in 2011 5 8 m2 m 2 on 98 dap in 2012 and 5 6 m2 m 2 on 109 dap in 2013 overall nt maize lai was higher than that of dt maize lai in the mid and late crop stages during crop development dt maize lai was slightly higher unlike the post anthesis stages 3 3 evapotranspiration differences in dt and nt maize fields and relationship between etc and lai brebs measured maize et etc was analyzed for differences across years and tillage practices fig 7 presents daily and cumulative maize etc for both dt and nt fields in relation to cumulative tu for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons the dt and nt maize etc summaries are provided in table 4 in 2011 the minimum and maximum respectively measured dt daily maize etc amounts were 0 5 mm d 1 on 173 dap and 11 3 mm d 1 on 78 dap whereas they were 0 2 mm d 1 on 160 dap and 11 3 mm d 1 on 76 dap for the nt maize in 2012 the minimum and maximum respectively observed dt daily maize etc was 0 2 mm d 1 on 169 dap and 11 7 mm d 1 on 61 dap whereas in 2013 they were 0 18 mm d 1 on 30 dap and 10 7 mm d 1 on 62 dap respectively for the nt maize daily etc amounts ranged from 0 25 mm d 1 on 179 dap to 10 8 mm d 1 on 86 dap in 2012 and from 0 1 mm d 1 on 32 dap to 10 mm d 1 on 120 dap in 2013 the seasonal average daily etc for the dt maize was 3 8 mm d 1 4 2 mm d 1 and 3 8 mm d 1 for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively whereas for the nt maize these magnitudes were 3 8 mm d 1 4 1 mm d 1 and 3 4 mm d 1 for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively since the total crop water use is represented as the crop evapotranspiration that occurs during the growing season we quantified the seasonal total etc as the sum of daily etc from crop emergence to harvest cumulative dt maize etc was 649 767 and 675 mm for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively for the nt maize cumulative etc was 668 730 and 601 mm for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively on a three year total basis the dt maize etc 2091 mm was 92 mm higher than the nt maize etc 1999 mm for both tillage practices maize etc was highest during 2012 due to higher vapor pressure deficit year 2012 also had lowest precipitation but irrigation applications in both fields maintained adequate moisture in the soil profile and hence adequate moisture was available to meet the high crop water demand during the 2012 growing season and also in 2011 and 2013 seasons total etc was substantially greater in dt maize than nt maize for 2012 5 greater and 2013 12 3 greater growing seasons however in 2011 the nt maize etc was slightly greater 2 9 than dt maize etc one probable reason for this could be that the residue in the nt field in 2011 was from the preceding soybean crop in 2010 which might not be as efficient as maize residue in 2012 and 2013 to provide appropriate soil cover and shading although there were differences in seasonal maize etc under the two tillage practices it is beneficial and necessary to investigate how these etc differences are distributed during the growing season this will be useful to understand the within season variability of comparative dynamics of dt and nt maize water use fig 8 shows the difference in daily etc measured in dt and nt maize where a positive value indicates that dt maize etc was higher than the nt maize etc and a negative value indicates that the nt maize etc was higher than dt maize etc the figure also shows the difference in daily total soil water tsw in the 0 90 m deep soil profile measured in dt and nt maize during the three years for all three growing seasons the dt etc was higher than the nt etc in the initial crop stages because of the higher evaporation losses in the dt maize than the nt maize due to surface cover and no soil disturbance in nt maize field these differences were as high as 2 7 mm d 1 in 2011 6 8 mm d 1 in 2012 and 5 2 mm d 1 in 2013 soil water evaporation is generally not useful for crop production although it does slightly cool the crop canopy microenvironment klocke et al 2009 hence dt systems involve higher non beneficial loss of water via evaporation which can be reduced by adopting nt systems moreover this conserved moisture in nt systems can possibly be used to produce additional grain yield by maintaining plant transpiration rates at optimum levels full surface residue coverage with maize stover and wheat stubble has been shown to reduce evaporation by 50 65 as compared with bare soil with no shading according to klocke et al 2009 as the maize developed towards full canopy closure the differences in etc converged fig 8 except for the 2011 growing season when the difference in dt etc and nt etc was observed to be large 5 6 mm d 1 later in the growing season around late august to mid september the nt maize etc was observed to be higher than the dt maize etc in other words nt maize had less pre anthesis water use than dt maize and greater post anthesis water use than dt maize in all the growing seasons these differences were as high as 3 1 2 8 and 2 4 mm d 1 in 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively these differences in patterns of water use under the two tillage systems may be related to an observed earlier senescence of the dt maize than nt maize the lai curves fig 6 showed that the dt maize lai was lower in all the three years especially in the late growing season which implies early senescence in dt maize in contrast to nt maize lamm et al 2009 studied maize water use as affected by tillage plant density and irrigation at colby kansas and also found that the conventional tillage used more water before anthesis and the reduced tillage treatments used more water after anthesis due to earlier senescence in conventional till although their study suggested that the reduced tillage systems tended to have slightly greater seasonal crop water use which is contrary to our results soil water availability which is represented here by total soil water in the 0 0 90 m profile can also possibly influence etc but this does not seem likely in our research as sufficient moisture was maintained in the soil profile at all times via irrigation management as observed from fig 8 the tsw in both dt and nt fields are very similar in magnitude and trends and were usually within 10 mm although the tsw in nt maize was generally higher than the dt maize during most of the growing season which confirms that nt can aid in soil moisture conservation especially during drought years such as 2012 greater soil water status in nt field was also due to lower etc rates than the dt maize field liu et al 2013 also found that both no till and reduced till systems lead to higher soil moisture storage when compared to conventional till systems in northeast china as a result a number of studies from both irrigated and rain fed regions around the united states where no tillage is used have reported annual reduced irrigation as much as 10 to 13 cm klocke et al 2009 primarily etc differences between the two tillage practices were most likely a result of differences in surface characteristics leading to differences in evaporation rates microclimatic factors and crop senescence rate which are related to soil moisture differences another reason that might affect maize etc between nt and dt is differences in root distribution by affecting the patterns of soil water uptake or depletion clothier and green 1994 karunatilake et al 2000 found that the higher water loss under conventional tillage is due to water uptake resulting from an extensive root system the relationships between daily etc and lai were developed under both tillage practices for each growing season as well as a pooled dataset for all the seasons fig 9 overall except for 2011 and 2013 dt maize fig 9 a c the relationship was positive for all other growing seasons and both tillage practices with increase in etc with increasing lai the r2 values ranged from 0 12 in 2011 and 2013 for dt to 0 42 in 2011 for nt the relationship was stronger for nt maize relative to dt maize and the reason for this phenomenon is not clear the relationship between etc and lai are considered weak in all cases which is due to nonlinear effect of etc and lai dynamics because etc in many cases is impacted by variables other than lai this is because there can be days when etc is low because of low atmospheric evaporative demand overcast conditions while lai is at its peak around maize tasseling silking or grain fill stages which can cause weakening of the etc vs lai relationship one example of this is the observance of point clouds on the extreme right side of each curve where etc varies on y axes but peak lai 5 0 to 6 0 is reached on the x axes these points represent the days around maize silking maximum lai with daily etc varying with daily variability in atmospheric demand hence while etc vs lai relationship is theoretically deemed to be a linear function it might not be the case in field measured daily etc and lai when the pooled data are considered the peak etc usually occurred within the lai range of 4 6 for both dt and nt maize 3 4 microclimatic differences among dt and nt maize fields it was established that the tillage practices can have a substantial influence on the magnitude of etc which can also translate into differences in microclimate between the two fields as etc is influenced by surface microclimatic conditions in other words the components of the energy balance can get modified owing to tillage or no tillage since the etc term which is a component in both water and energy balance can be altered with management to test this hypothesis the relationship between difference in dt and nt maize daily etc and differences in dt and nt maize daily microclimatic variables such as air temperature ta vpd wind speed measured at 3 m height u3 in addition to some other crucial variables like rn total soil water tsw in the 0 90 m crop root zone and h were analyzed fig 10 since differences in these parameters would not stem from actual weather variation or management differences between the two fields given their very close proximity and very similar management any observed differences are attributed to differences in tillage management a positive magnitude on either axis shows that the dt maize variable was higher than the nt maize variable and vice versa difference in ta showed negative relationship with difference in etc which suggests that higher etc observed in either of the two fields results in lower air temperatures and vice versa because of the evaporative cooling effect arising from the latent heat of vaporization le initially in the growing season when the dt maize etc is higher than the nt maize etc difference is positive the observed ta in the dt field is lower than the nt field and the opposite is true later in the growing season when nt maize etc is higher than the dt maize etc similarly difference in vpd also shows a negative relationship with difference in etc in two fields this is explained by the fact that higher etc in one field positive difference increases the moisture humidity in the field microclimate which results in a lower vpd in the field negative difference higher humidity lower vpd can cause lower wind speeds which explains the negative relationship among the difference in etc and difference in wind speed across the two fields fig 10 d shows that a negative relationship exists between the difference in etc and difference in h across the two fields which is explained by the fact that both terms in addition to soil heat flux g combine to form net radiation rn if latent heat le or etc increases then h has to decrease to maintain the energy balance and vice versa which is clear from the negative relation shown in the figure difference in etc across the two fields was positively correlated with difference in rn in both fields and is justified because of the higher energy available to be used as latent heat le or etc differences in rn between the two fields occur because of the surface characteristics especially in the initial growth stages when one of the surfaces dt is bare soil and the other nt is covered with substantial amount of residue 95 100 picture 1 b from the previous crop this can result in alteration in the radiation interaction dynamics across the two fields including albedo hence affecting rn lastly soil water availability is one of the primary factors for etc to occur as sufficient soil moisture is necessary to sustain and meet the atmospheric evaporative demand hence the difference in tsw across the fields is positively related to the corresponding difference in etc however in some situations the soil water availability may be sufficient but the atmospheric demand may be low resulting in lower etc on some days and the relationship might not necessarily hold true which could be the reason for the low correlation between differences in tsw and etc it should be noted that the data points in fig 10e corresponding to high tsw represent days when high rainfall events or irrigation events occurred in the dt field that resulted in higher etc amounts from the dt maize largely due to increased evaporation this discussion indicates that the tillage practices due to their influence on crop water use also impact field level energy balance and hence microclimate which further contributes towards modification of the local field level atmospheric evaporative demand which in turn results in differences in etc between the dt and nt evaporating surfaces 3 5 disk till vs no till maize yield water productivity and production functions the dt and nt fields were assessed for grain yield for each of the three years to determine if the differential tillage practices impacted crop yields and hence possibly have an economic benefit associated with them also since it has been shown in the previous sections that water consumption for the dt and nt maize differ the maize water productivity may also vary under the two tillage systems table 5 presents the field average maize grain yields y and maize water productivity wp observed under the two tillage systems for all the studied growing seasons in addition to the growing season etc for all three growing seasons dt maize grain yield was higher than its nt counterpart dt yield was greater than nt yield by 6 7 6 and 10 for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively dt wp in 2011 was higher by about 10 from nt wp dt wps in 2012 and 2013 on the other hand was observed to be 0 6 higher and 1 6 lower respectively than nt wp which are negligible differences these results indicate that while dt can be a better alternative than nt when compared in terms of crop yields at least comparable and can correspondingly result in higher economic benefits when other variables are kept similar tillage did not impact water productivity substantially the reason behind this is the offsetting of higher grain yields under dt by its higher water consumption etc which causes the wp magnitudes to remain comparable for the two tillage systems west et al 1996 in a twenty year study in indiana usa also found that no tillage in dark silty clay loam soil reduced maize yields by 14 and 2 8 in continuous maize and maize after soybean respectively when compared against conventional tillage yields probable reasons for these yield results can be sought by focusing on long term changes on soil properties at the two fields which was not one of the primary goals in our research as we aimed to focus extensively on differences in maize water use among the two tillage systems afzalinia and zabihi 2014 found that no tillage in a short term investigation decreased maize grain yield when compared to conventional tillage by 18 2 11 1 they reported that the reason for that decrease in maize yield is the higher soil compaction under no tillage chen et al 2011 also reported significantly lower maize yields under no tillage as compared with conventional tillage a review of one hundred years of international field trials focusing on crop response to no tillage defelice et al 2006 found that the average difference in soybean and maize yields between nt and ct was negligible nt tended to have greater yields than ct in hot and wet areas similar yields occurred in the warm and humid areas and lower nt yields were observed in the cool and semi arid regions in accordance with our findings at nebraska a semi arid region in these studies nt crop yield was influenced by multiple factors including climate soil characteristics landscape crop variety crop rotation fertilizer application and other field management triplett and dick 2008 the irrigation yield production functions iypf and evapotranspiration yield production functions etypf irmak 2015a and b varied between the tillage practices and also exhibited inter annual variation for the same tillage practice fig 11 a both dt and nt maize grain yield had strong and linear response to seasonal etc and irrigation with high coefficients of determination r2 0 95 for iypf and 0 87 for etypf with dt maize having greater r2 values than nt maize in all cases while nt maize had greater slopes than dt maize in both etypf and iypfs the intercept was greater for dt maize in all cases based on the regression parameters a unit of grain productivity per unit of evapotranspiration varied between the tillage practices as 25 4 mm of etc resulted in 0 19 and 0 22 t ha of increase in grain yield beyond the intercept for the dt and nt maize respectively similarly a unit of grain productivity per unit of irrigation water applied also varied between the two tillage systems as 25 4 mm of irrigation water application resulted in 0 10 and 0 13 t ha grain yield for dt and nt systems respectively while the grain productivity per unit of etc and irrigation water applied is slightly greater for the nt system the intercept of the etypf and iypfs were substantially greater fig 11a for the dt system than the nt dt maize yield responded to etc and irrigation water with a greater slope in the initial stage of the crop productivity there was a strong and linear relationship between irrigation water application and etc for both dt and nt fields fig 11b because etc for the dt field was greater than nt field the impact of irrigation on etc i e increase in etc due to irrigation was also greater for the dt field a unit increase in etc per unit of irrigation application also varied between the tillage systems and also exhibited inter annual variation for the same tillage system fig 11b dt maize had greater slope and intercept than the nt maize on a three year average basis a 25 4 mm of irrigation application resulted in 13 1 and 12 4 mm of increase beyond the intercept in etc for dt and nt maize respectively 4 summary and conclusions the extensive adoption of conservation agriculture practices in nebraska and the usa corn belt necessitates intensive research efforts concentrated towards quantification and analyses of maize water use dynamics under local conventional disk till dt and conservation no till nt tillage systems and further finding useful information to enhance our knowledge base this manuscript presents the case of a research effort directed towards this objective in irrigated settings at two producer s farms at holdrege nebraska specifically this research focused on quantifying maize water use evapotranspiration and water productivity and studying microclimatic differences among dt and nt maize evapotranspiration and other weather variables at field scale were measured on an hourly basis using identical bowen ratio energy balance systems brebs installed in each experimental field utmost care was taken to ascertain that the two fields were very similar in terms of crop and soil management practices so that tillage practice was the only difference etc in dt maize field was higher than that in nt maize field for 2012 and 2013 while it was similar for 2011 an interesting observation was that dt maize had higher etc prior to anthesis due to higher evaporation prior to canopy closure in dt maize while nt evapotranspired more post anthesis which was attributed to earlier senescence observed in dt maize due to lower soil moisture storage than nt maize the differences in etc among the two tillage systems altered the energy balance and caused changes in field scale microclimate specifically difference in etc among the two fields was negatively related to differences in ta vpd u3 and h whereas it was positively related to rn and tsw maize grain yield was higher for dt maize than nt maize for all years by 7 6 and 10 for 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively dt maize wp in 2011 was 10 higher than the nt maize wp however dt wp in 2012 and 2013 was observed to be 0 6 higher and 1 6 lower respectively than nt wp which implies that no considerable difference was found among dt and nt maize wp the irrigation yield production functions iypf and evapotranspiration yield production functions etypf varied between the tillage practices and also exhibited inter annual variation for the same tillage practice there was a strong and linear relationship between irrigation water application and etc for both dt and nt fields it has been established in the research studies that the impact of tillage practices on crop production and water resources are highly variable and site specific and hence should be locally assessed for nebraska it was concluded that while no till practice may results in reduction non beneficial loss of water evaporation this does not necessarily translate into yield benefits and hence has no effect on maize wp thus no till crop management seems adoptable in scenarios when and where freshwater resource conservation is a priority but it should not be expected that any economic benefits will result from yield increases nevertheless the producer can avail economic benefits arising from savings from fuel and machinery costs due to absence of tillage operations the information and data presented in this research can be beneficial resource for quantifying and understanding the differences in tilled and untilled crop management with respect to their impacts on agricultural water management acknowledgments this research was partially supported by the grants from the nebraska environmental trust

11112,recognition and understanding of impacts of any crop and or soil management practice on crop water use is equally crucial as its intended impacts one such practice that has gained adoption among producers in the u s maize growing regions is conservation tillage aiming at maintaining about 30 40 or more of residual vegetative cover on the soil surface after planting the presence of numerous interacting factors suggests that the success of this practice is subject to its effectiveness on local scales requiring scientific research based data the crop evapotranspiration etc microclimate yield water productivity wp and other variables for irrigated maize zea mays l were measured and compared under disk till dt conventional and no till nt conservation tillage systems in 2011 2012 and 2013 in two carefully managed and monitored producers fields which have been under these tillage management practices for over 17 years on a three year total basis the dt maize etc 2091 mm was 92 mm higher than the nt maize etc 1999 mm also a seasonal and a monthly pattern existed in the difference between dt and nt etc nt maize had less pre anthesis water use than dt maize and greater post anthesis water use than dt maize in all three growing seasons the irrigation yield iypf and evapotranspiration yield production functions etypf were developed and change in etc increase per unit irrigation application was quantified for both dt and nt maize differences in etc between the two tillage systems was also responsible for modification of field scale microclimate where the difference in etc between the two fields was negatively related to differences in air temperature vapor pressure deficit wind speed and sensible heat flux whereas it was positively related to net radiation and total soil water maize yield was higher for dt maize than nt maize for all three years by 7 0 8 t ha 6 0 8 t ha and 10 1 2 t ha for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively tillage practice did not impact wp as wp for both tillage practices were similar ranging from 1 74 to 1 94 kg m3 the presented research data and information are a benchmark evidence for tillage specific agricultural water management for stakeholders in regions with similar crop management and climatic conditions keywords evapotranspiration production functions tillage water productivity 1 introduction conservation agriculture ca is often recommended and propagated as one of the sustainable crop production strategies with the intention of aiding preservation of soil and water resources hobbs 2007 hobbs et al 2008 in general ca includes three major principles to fulfil its purpose i maintenance of a permanent vegetative cover on the soil surface ii minimal soil disturbance which can be accomplished by reduced or no tillage and iii diversified crop rotation fao 2008 technically ca can be considered as any tillage system that leaves 30 of harvested crop residue on the soil surface after planting uri et al 1998 this can be achieved by adopting several tillage systems or technologies that include reduced tillage rt no tillage nt residue mulching and subsoil mulching conservation tillage practices range from zero tillage no till reduced minimum tillage mulch tillage ridge tillage to contour tillage busari et al 2015 these practices may affect soil chemical biological and physical properties in several ways which cannot be generalized because of the varied interactions that can occur under different soils climate and cropping systems moreover ca has shown to improve agricultural productivity by reducing soil moisture deficits pest and disease pressure and weeds while improving nutrient cycling soil fertility and carbon sequestration kassam et al 2009 palm et al 2014 these potential benefits have resulted in adoption of ca on 125 million ha which is about 9 of the total arable lands globally kassam et al 2012 with the adoption of ca in different regions of the world it becomes necessary that these tillage systems be characterized for their effects on soil water dynamics crop water use crop yields and water productivity as well as the interactions of these variables it is generally perceived that tillage practices can potentially affect soil water dynamics by affecting infiltration evaporation water transmission properties and soil water storage this is possible owing to demonstrated evidence of various tillage systems either conventional or conservation to alter bulk density aggregate stability total porosity and organic carbon content resulting in alteration of soil structure and various other parameters which govern the soil water and soil water related properties bronick and lal 2005 pagliai et al 2004 hernanz et al 2002 beare et al 1994 these impacts of tillage management on soil water dynamics and consequently crop water use grain yield and water productivity however are rare and also considerably variable among studies locations management practices and cropping seasons because of differences in soil types precipitation distribution crop water requirements and aridity boone 1988 lampurlanes et al 2002 hemmat and eskandari 2004 for example one section of literature provides evidence to support the idea that adoption of conservation tillage resulted in improved soil water storage soil quality and crop yield and contributes to sustainable agricultural production when compared to traditional tillage systems it has been shown that no tillage enhanced soil water holding capacity and reduced soil evaporation lampurlanés et al 2016 the increased soil water storage can be attributed to reduced evaporation as the undisturbed crop residue layer under no till conditions serves as a barrier to reduce both soil evaporation and respiration benjamin et al 2015 found that differences in tillage no till vs chisel plow did not affect soil water storage and biomass production in maize while grain yield was unaffected in one of the years increased in four years by 12 18 and decreased in one year by 10 by adopting no till over chisel plow moreover they reported greater water productivity in four out of five years 8 16 when using nt cantero martínez et al 2007 conducted a long term study with several tillage treatments in three contrasting in terms of aridity mediterranean rainfed conditions and reported that the conservation tillage systems no till and minimum till did not present any advantages in terms of water use but benefits were found for yield 5 10 increase and water productivity in drier conditions they attributed the increased wp to higher root density under no till and minimum till in the post anthesis period as demonstrated by lampurlanés et al 2001 lampurlanés et al 2016 extended the same experiments and concluded that the minimum and no tillage treatments showed the highest soil water storage 25 higher than moulboard plow tillage post tillering evapotranspiration 78 of the times nt et was higher than mb et and yield nt yield was higher 26 of the times at the driest site they suggested that in semiarid rainfed conditions these benefits get supplemented with the degree of aridity yang et al 2018 reported that no tillage resulted in 5 7 greater yields than conventional tillage which were statistically significant for two out of three years which was a result of higher number of grains per panicle in the no till wheat stone and schlegel 2006 reported a 43 increase in grain sorghum yield response to water supply plant available soil water at planting plus growing season precipitation under no tillage 18 4 kg ha mm compared to conventional tillage 12 9 kg ha mm a wider range of other studies have reported findings that support this stance while encountering some extent of variability which is justified owing to the diversity of the conditions the experiments were conducted in o leary and connor 1997 pikul and aase 1999 tolk et al 1999 li and gong 2002 li et al 2004 gicheru et al 2004 fabrizzi et al 2005 bottinelli et al 2017 bhatt and khera 2006 shao et al 2016 some researchers reported that the impact of tillage practices on some of the aforementioned variables can show variation with the crop growth stage for example guan et al 2015 evaluated the effect of plow tillage pt rotary tillage rt and no tillage nt on root growth water consumption characteristics grain yield water use and water productivity wp of winter wheat under rain fed condition conducted in a field with 20 year of rotary tillage history they found that the pt and rt decreased the soil bulk density in the 0 20 cm soil depth and the penetration resistance in the 0 30 cm soil depth during two growth seasons pt had greater root weight density rwd root length density rld and root surface density rsd than those under nt in the 0 110 cm soil profile at the tillering stage and in the 0 40 cm soil profile at the flowering stage respectively however rwd rld and rsd of pt were lower than nt at 0 10 cm soil depth and greater at 10 20 cm soil depth at the ripening stage similar trends were observed under rt as compared with nt soil water content under pt and rt were lower as compared with nt from tillering to flowering stage across 0 110 cm but higher than under nt in 0 20 cm soil profile at ripening stage evapotranspiration et under pt was higher than under nt from sowing to flowering stages but significantly lower at the ripening stage they observed that tillage practices had no notable influences on pre planting soil water storage and total et under rainfed conditions during two growing season but pt significantly enhanced grain yield through higher spike number and grain weight compared with nt which led to higher wp under pt the findings of their study show that pt practice can reduce soil bulk density and penetration resistance at the tillage zone which can lead to greater rwd rld and rsd and greater et from tillering to flowering stage this can increase plant population and cause greater wp and yield under rainfed conditions guan et al 2015 in contrast several researchers have also shown that the tillage systems present no differences regarding the soil water dynamics or conservation tillage is not advantageous over other conventional tillage methods for example licht and al kaisi 2005 found that no tillage did not show any difference in soil moisture when compared to strip tillage and chisel plow although the changes in soil moisture were the lowest in no tillage moreover they found that due to the increased soil temperature in strip tillage by 1 2 1 4 c there was an improvement in plant emergence rate when compared to no tillage lampurlanes et al 2002 investigated water storage efficiency under subsoil tillage minimum tillage and no tillage for two soils they found no differences in water productivity among tillage systems overall during the total fallow period because the advantage of nt during the first sub period was lost during the second period guzha 2004 reported that the tilled soils tied ridge had the highest infiltration rates and soil moisture storage across other tillage methods and no till which also resulted in 18 higher yield in the tilled soils when compared to no till yield these diverse and contrasting observations from the past research imply that prior to the wide adoption of any conservation tillage practices its suitability and effectiveness should be researched and assessed on local scales which our research is effective in accomplishing according to the 2008 national crop residue management survey 21 7 060 909 ha of the total land area under maize 33 623 380 ha was cultivated with no till conservation tillage practice 1 4 470 727 ha with ridge till practice and 17 8 5 984 962 ha with mulch till practice amounting to 40 2 13 516 599 ha of the maize growing acreage under conservation tillage specifically in nebraska the adoption of no till systems has been widespread especially in dryland or rainfed cropping systems conservation technology information center ctic national survey 2004 as of 2004 in nebraska area planted with no till soil management was more than double at 26 9 of the total land area 1 74 million ha than that in 1992 when it was 10 3 of the total land area 639 404 ha nebraska leads the nation in terms of no till maize cultivation with 971 247 ha this widespread adoption of no till systems in nebraska justifies the need for scientific investigation of the impacts of these practices on water resources including evapotranspiration yield and crop water productivity although the potential positive impacts of no till practices on energy savings due to reduced field traffic reduced dust emission from agricultural fields reduced wind and water erosion enhanced soil quality structure macro porosity infiltration and organic matter accumulation and soil temperature moderation have been documented in the past fundamental gaps in knowledge of its impacts on crop water use and productivity exist in the region moreover the quantifications and comparisons of microclimate and crop water use etc among conventional and conservation tillage systems using advanced reliable and high resolution methodologies are extremely limited it is hypothesized that among the two tillage systems several aspects such as in season water management water allocations long term estimates of water supply demand and use design and management of water management infrastructures would considerably vary which makes precise measurement of etc even more crucial for this research the specific objectives of this research were to i measure and study the differences in maize growth and development under disk till dt and no till nt management ii measure and quantify daily monthly and growing season maize etc under dt and nt management iii evaluate if dt and nt maize present differences in field scale microclimate and quantify these differences and iv quantify and assess differences in dt and nt maize yield water productivity and irrigation yield and etc yield production functions iypf and etypf respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil and crop management the field experiments were conducted on producers production fields near holdrege nebraska in a semi arid region in 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons the general view of the nt and dt research fields that contrast the residue cover between the two fields are presented in picture 1 a and b two similar fields were selected and were in close proximity to each other fig 1 the selection of the two fields was an extensive process but was also a critical component of this research two fields that had similar topography slope etc same soil characteristics same irrigation system and system capacity same drop nozzles on the pivot same field size 56 ha each field with only 0 8 km apart same planting direction when necessary the same nitrogen herbicide insecticide pesticide fungicide management and the same or very similar other field management practices were selected the farmer cooperators agreed to plant on similar days with the same planting depth same maize hybrids same planting population density and also agreed to use the same planter to plant both dt and nt research fields in some cases the dt field had been disk tilled twice a year once in fall and once in spring with maize soybean rotation for 17 years and the nt field had been under nt management with maize soybean rotation for the last 17 years the soil at both sites was silt loam holdrege fine silty mixed superactive mesic typic argiustolls the measured soil properties at these two sites are presented in table 1 and are very similar to each other which was a crucial requirement for the objectives to be investigated at both the sites the farmer collaborator in close consultation with the senior author determined when and how much to irrigate by utilizing the soil moisture monitored at each site using model cs616 volumetric soil water content reflectometers campbell sci inc logan utah installed in the inter plant spacing at 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m below the soil surface as part of this research the aim of the irrigation management practice was to maintain the available soil water in the root zone between approximately 90 of the field capacity and the maximum allowable depletion of 55 of total available soil water taw irrigations were initiated each time the soil water in the crop root zone was depleted by about 40 45 below field capacity with all the conditions and management practices being similar for this research it was assumed that any observed differences in the field specific variables were attributed to differences in field specific tillage practices during the 2011 growing season both fields were planted with a maize hybrid pioneer 33m54 on 2 may which emerged on 6 may dt and 10 may nt and were harvested on 25 october dt and 27 october nt in 2012 the maize hybrid pioneer 33b51 was planted on 26 april emerged on 6 may dt and 10 may nt and harvested on 30 october dt and 27 october nt finally in 2013 the maize hybrid gh 9071 3000 gt was planted on 5 may dt and 3 may nt emerged on 13 may dt and 15 may nt and harvested on 30 october dt and 27 october nt in general maize plants emerged 2 5 days later in the nt field than dt field the plant population was 71 660 plants ha in 2011 and 74 132 plants ha in 2012 and 2013 in both fields some of the critical field and crop management practices are presented in table 2 2 2 measurement of crop evapotranspiration and surface energy balance variables microclimate and crop growth etc during the 2011 2012 and 2013

were part of the larger nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux irmak 2010 that were installed in each of the two research fields prior to installation of the two brebss in research fields the two identical brebss were run for a period of time in the same location to collect data to ensure that both systems provide exact data under the same conditions so that the measurements in two different fields are not biased effective and robust performance of brebs in successfully quantifying the evaporative fluxes above various vegetation surfaces have been

values were determined from the difference between the thrds7 1 measured total radiation and the pds7 1 measured shortwave radiation the albedo values were calculated using the ratio of incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation the thrds7 1 is sensitive to wavelengths from 0 25 to 60 μm and the pds7 1 is sensitive to wavelengths from 0 35 to 2 8 μm the radiometers were mounted about 5 m above the ground surface to obtain a clear view of the underlying surface being measured while minimizing the influence of the mounting tower other objects or surrounding canopy surfaces that might affect albedo or longwave radiation from the measured surface proper leveling of the radiometer domes was routinely maintained to ensure accuracy soil heat flux was measured using rebs hft 3 1 heat flux

weather data used in eq 1 were measured from the bowen ratio energy balance system brebs installed in the middle of each of the experimental fields which are a part of the nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux irmak 2010 it has been shown earlier that using weather data measured above an agronomic crop to calculate etref closely resembles the values calculated using weather station data estimated etref skaggs and irmak 2012 the growing degree days gdd concept i e thermal unit tu is based on an accumulation of daily air temperatures between some high and some low temperatures judged to be growth limiting and is commonly expressed as 2 g d d i 1 n t m a x t m i n 2 t b a s e where tmax is the maximum air temperature tmin is the minimum air temperature tbase is the base temperature threshold 10 c and n is the number of days the base temperature for calculating gdd is the minimum threshold temperature below which plant growth ceases in this research maximum and minimum temperature thresholds of 30 c and 10 c respectively were chosen for maize all temperature values exceeding the upper threshold value were reduced to 30 c and values below 10 c were taken as 10 c if the average daily temperature tmax tmin 2 was below the base temperature then the gdd value was assumed to be equal to zero djaman and irmak 2012 the crop water

results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions during the research period monthly means of the weather variables during the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons are presented in table 3 tmax during may june and july were considerably higher during 2012 than 2011 and 2013 while they were comparable for august and september the tmin were similar during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons and were higher in 2013 in august september and october rh was the highest in 2011 followed by 2013 and 2012 also during 2012 higher rs was observed when compared to other growing seasons higher u2 was recorded in 2013 during july and august the vapor pressure deficit vpd was the highest during the 2012 growing season followed by 2013 and 2011 growing seasons vpd is an effective measure of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere implying that the atmospheric evaporative demand was highest during 2012 however this difference was minimal during june and october studies in the past have indicated that a unit change in vpd can result in as much as 10 30 change in the estimated potential reference et saxton 1975 irmak et al 2006 it should be noted that the year 2012 has been characterized as the most severe drought over the central us plains since data record began in 1895 hoerling et al 2014 which was supported by the weather summary presented above this research presents an opportunity to investigate differences between nt and dt in terms of crop water use dynamics during three growing seasons that had substantially different conditions including during an extreme growing season in terms of weather daily thermal units tu or gdd were calculated and analyzed to observe differences in heat accumulation among the three growing seasons weather data from a weather station holdrege 5 n latitude 40 30 longitude 99 22 automated weather data network high plains regional climate center awdn hprcc in proximity to our field sites were used fig 2 depicts the daily and cumulative tus during the common period from each of the growing seasons in the figure the cumulative tus were 1677 c 1814 c and 1833 c for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively cumulative tu for the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons were comparable to each other and both were greater than those in 2011 the 2011 growing season was cooler than 2012 and 2013 growing seasons by more than 1 c average air temperature which explains lower cumulative tu for 2011 it should be noted that for the dt field the cumulative tu at harvest in 2012 was greater than that in 2013 because the dt maize was harvested at 187 dap in 2012 in comparison to 178 dap in 2013 unlike nt maize which were harvested only 2 days apart the precipitation data were analyzed during the window encompassing the growing seasons of both dt and nt maize for each year during these periods the cumulative precipitation amounts were 469 202 and 288 mm for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively fig 3 presents the individual precipitation events and the cumulative precipitation during each of the growing season precipitation was highly variable between the individual growing seasons with 2012 experiencing an extreme drought interestingly the wettest year 2011 received 132 greater total growing season precipitation than the driest year 2012 precipitation was uniformly distributed during the 2011 and 2013 although the precipitation amounts were considerably lower 62 in 2013 while during 2012 dry spells were considerably longer especially in the initial and the later stages of the growing season seasonal total irrigation amounts applied to dt and nt fields were similar in all years the seasonal amounts of irrigation applied to the dt maize field were 165 371 and 180 mm for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively for the nt maize field they were 157 361 and 175 mm for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively for the 2012 growing season the irrigated amounts for both the tillage practices were higher more than two folds as compared to 2011 and 2013 growing seasons in order to compensate for the higher soil water deficit resulting from extremely low precipitation also irrigation application for the dt field was higher than the nt field by a negligible amount 5 the asce standardized daily and cumulative grass reference et eto and alfalfa reference et etr in relation to the tu gdd for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons are presented in fig 4 daily eto varied from 0 24 to 10 9 mm d 1 for the 2011 growing season from 0 54 to 12 1 mm d 1 in 2012 and from 0 12 to 11 9 mm d 1 in 2013 dt etr ranged from 0 27 to 16 4 mm d 1 for the 2011 growing season from 0 82 to 17 7 mm d 1 in 2012 and from 0 13 to 17 7 mm d 1 in 2013 the seasonal total eto was 809 1051 and 952 mm for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively whereas seasonal total etr was 1081 1462 and 1324 mm respectively the eto in 2012 was 30 greater than in 2011 and 10 greater than in 2013 and the etr in 2012 was 35 greater than in 2011 and 10 greater than in 2013 due to higher evaporative demand of the atmosphere in 2012 the seasonal total eto values derived from the meteorological parameters monitored in the individual field sites using brebss brebs 9 in nt field and brebs 10 in dt field were also calculated at the dt site the total seasonal eto was 782 922 and 838 mm whereas for the nt site the values were 760 888 and 834 mm for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively similarly the seasonal total etr values at the dt site were 1003 1207 and 1100 mm whereas for the nt site they were 961 1149 and 1094 mm for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively it should be noted that the differences in eto and etr among the two sites is because of small differences in time of planting and harvesting especially in 2012 which resulted in minor differences observed in seasonal reference et at the two sites these differences in seasonal reference et should not be understood as differences in atmospheric demand at the two sites as they are in close proximity of each other which has further been observed in the similarity of gdd eto and etr magnitudes 3 2 crop growth characteristics figs 5 and 6 present the seasonal patterns of maize plant height and lai respectively for both fields and three growing seasons as a function of days after planting dap maize height in general gradually increased as the growing season progressed reached a maximum at anthesis and then remained relatively constant or decreased slightly as leaf aging leaf folding and senescence started towards the end of the season the maximum plant height showed variation between the nt and dt fields and also inter annual variation between the years for the same tillage practice the peak dt maize height was 263 cm on 93 dap in 2011 343 cm on 98 dap in 2012 and 259 cm on 87 dap in 2013 the peak height for the nt was 303 cm on 93 dap in 2011 298 cm on 98 dap in 2012 and 303 cm on 109 dap in 2013 the nt maize height remained greater than dt maize height throughout the 2011 growing season although the differences were small during crop development and became considerable in the later stages on the contrary in 2012 the dt maize height was greater for the crop development period and then became similar to that of nt maize height in 2013 the dt maize height was greater for the crop development period similar to 2012 but nt maize height was greater during post anthesis period the maximum lai also exhibited variation between the nt and dt fields and also had inter annual variation between the years for the same tillage practice the lai for dt maize peaked at 2 7 m2 m 2 on 122 dap in 2011 4 6 m2 m 2 on 89 dap in 2012 and 5 2 m2 m 2 on 109 dap in 2013 for the nt maize the peak lai was 3 5 m2 m 2 on 109 dap in 2011 5 8 m2 m 2 on 98 dap in 2012 and 5 6 m2 m 2 on 109 dap in 2013 overall nt maize lai was higher than that of dt maize lai in the mid and late crop stages during crop development dt maize lai was slightly higher unlike the post anthesis stages 3 3 evapotranspiration differences in dt and nt maize fields and relationship between etc and lai brebs measured maize et etc was analyzed for differences across years and tillage practices fig 7 presents daily and cumulative maize etc for both dt and nt fields in relation to cumulative tu for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons the dt and nt maize etc summaries are provided in table 4 in 2011 the minimum and maximum respectively measured dt daily maize etc amounts were 0 5 mm d 1 on 173 dap and 11 3 mm d 1 on 78 dap whereas they were 0 2 mm d 1 on 160 dap and 11 3 mm d 1 on 76 dap for the nt maize in 2012 the minimum and maximum respectively observed dt daily maize etc was 0 2 mm d 1 on 169 dap and 11 7 mm d 1 on 61 dap whereas in 2013 they were 0 18 mm d 1 on 30 dap and 10 7 mm d 1 on 62 dap respectively for the nt maize daily etc amounts ranged from 0 25 mm d 1 on 179 dap to 10 8 mm d 1 on 86 dap in 2012 and from 0 1 mm d 1 on 32 dap to 10 mm d 1 on 120 dap in 2013 the seasonal average daily etc for the dt maize was 3 8 mm d 1 4 2 mm d 1 and 3 8 mm d 1 for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively whereas for the nt maize these magnitudes were 3 8 mm d 1 4 1 mm d 1 and 3 4 mm d 1 for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively since the total crop water use is represented as the crop evapotranspiration that occurs during the growing season we quantified the seasonal total etc as the sum of daily etc from crop emergence to harvest cumulative dt maize etc was 649 767 and 675 mm for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively for the nt maize cumulative etc was 668 730 and 601 mm for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively on a three year total basis the dt maize etc 2091 mm was 92 mm higher than the nt maize etc 1999 mm for both tillage practices maize etc was highest during 2012 due to higher vapor pressure deficit year 2012 also had lowest precipitation but irrigation applications in both fields maintained adequate moisture in the soil profile and hence adequate moisture was available to meet the high crop water demand during the 2012 growing season and also in 2011 and 2013 seasons total etc was substantially greater in dt maize than nt maize for 2012 5 greater and 2013 12 3 greater growing seasons however in 2011 the nt maize etc was slightly greater 2 9 than dt maize etc one probable reason for this could be that the residue in the nt field in 2011 was from the preceding soybean crop in 2010 which might not be as efficient as maize residue in 2012 and 2013 to provide appropriate soil cover and shading although there were differences in seasonal maize etc under the two tillage practices it is beneficial and necessary to investigate how these etc differences are distributed during the growing season this will be useful to understand the within season variability of comparative dynamics of dt and nt maize water use fig 8 shows the difference in daily etc measured in dt and nt maize where a positive value indicates that dt maize etc was higher than the nt maize etc and a negative value indicates that the nt maize etc was higher than dt maize etc the figure also shows the difference in daily total soil water tsw in the 0 90 m deep soil profile measured in dt and nt maize during the three years for all three growing seasons the dt etc was higher than the nt etc in the initial crop stages because of the higher evaporation losses in the dt maize than the nt maize due to surface cover and no soil disturbance in nt maize field these differences were as high as 2 7 mm d 1 in 2011 6 8 mm d 1 in 2012 and 5 2 mm d 1 in 2013 soil water evaporation is generally not useful for crop production although it does slightly cool the crop canopy microenvironment klocke et al 2009 hence dt systems involve higher non beneficial loss of water via evaporation which can be reduced by adopting nt systems moreover this conserved moisture in nt systems can possibly be used to produce additional grain yield by maintaining plant transpiration rates at optimum levels full surface residue coverage with maize stover and wheat stubble has been shown to reduce evaporation by 50 65 as compared with bare soil with no shading according to klocke et al 2009 as the maize developed towards full canopy closure the differences in etc converged fig 8 except for the 2011 growing season when the difference in dt etc and nt etc was observed to be large 5 6 mm d 1 later in the growing season around late august to mid september the nt maize etc was observed to be higher than the dt maize etc in other words nt maize had less pre anthesis water use than dt maize and greater post anthesis water use than dt maize in all the growing seasons these differences were as high as 3 1 2 8 and 2 4 mm d 1 in 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively these differences in patterns of water use under the two tillage systems may be related to an observed earlier senescence of the dt maize than nt maize the lai curves fig 6 showed that the dt maize lai was lower in all the three years especially in the late growing season which implies early senescence in dt maize in contrast to nt maize lamm et al 2009 studied maize water use as affected by tillage plant density and irrigation at colby kansas and also found that the conventional tillage used more water before anthesis and the reduced tillage treatments used more water after anthesis due to earlier senescence in conventional till although their study suggested that the reduced tillage systems tended to have slightly greater seasonal crop water use which is contrary to our results soil water availability which is represented here by total soil water in the 0 0 90 m profile can also possibly influence etc but this does not seem likely in our research as sufficient moisture was maintained in the soil profile at all times via irrigation management as observed from fig 8 the tsw in both dt and nt fields are very similar in magnitude and trends and were usually within 10 mm although the tsw in nt maize was generally higher than the dt maize during most of the growing season which confirms that nt can aid in soil moisture conservation especially during drought years such as 2012 greater soil water status in nt field was also due to lower etc rates than the dt maize field liu et al 2013 also found that both no till and reduced till systems lead to higher soil moisture storage when compared to conventional till systems in northeast china as a result a number of studies from both irrigated and rain fed regions around the united states where no tillage is used have reported annual reduced irrigation as much as 10 to 13 cm klocke et al 2009 primarily etc differences between the two tillage practices were most likely a result of differences in surface characteristics leading to differences in evaporation rates microclimatic factors and crop senescence rate which are related to soil moisture differences another reason that might affect maize etc between nt and dt is differences in root distribution by affecting the patterns of soil water uptake or depletion clothier and green 1994 karunatilake et al 2000 found that the higher water loss under conventional tillage is due to water uptake resulting from an extensive root system the relationships between daily etc and lai were developed under both tillage practices for each growing season as well as a pooled dataset for all the seasons fig 9 overall except for 2011 and 2013 dt maize fig 9 a c the relationship was positive for all other growing seasons and both tillage practices with increase in etc with increasing lai the r2 values ranged from 0 12 in 2011 and 2013 for dt to 0 42 in 2011 for nt the relationship was stronger for nt maize relative to dt maize and the reason for this phenomenon is not clear the relationship between etc and lai are considered weak in all cases which is due to nonlinear effect of etc and lai dynamics because etc in many cases is impacted by variables other than lai this is because there can be days when etc is low because of low atmospheric evaporative demand overcast conditions while lai is at its peak around maize tasseling silking or grain fill stages which can cause weakening of the etc vs lai relationship one example of this is the observance of point clouds on the extreme right side of each curve where etc varies on y axes but peak lai 5 0 to 6 0 is reached on the x axes these points represent the days around maize silking maximum lai with daily etc varying with daily variability in atmospheric demand hence while etc vs lai relationship is theoretically deemed to be a linear function it might not be the case in field measured daily etc and lai when the pooled data are considered the peak etc usually occurred within the lai range of 4 6 for both dt and nt maize 3 4 microclimatic differences among dt and nt maize fields it was established that the tillage practices can have a substantial influence on the magnitude of etc which can also translate into differences in microclimate between the two fields as etc is influenced by surface microclimatic conditions in other words the components of the energy balance can get modified owing to tillage or no tillage since the etc term which is a component in both water and energy balance can be altered with management to test this hypothesis the relationship between difference in dt and nt maize daily etc and differences in dt and nt maize daily microclimatic variables such as air temperature ta vpd wind speed measured at 3 m height u3 in addition to some other crucial variables like rn total soil water tsw in the 0 90 m crop root zone and h were analyzed fig 10 since differences in these parameters would not stem from actual weather variation or management differences between the two fields given their very close proximity and very similar management any observed differences are attributed to differences in tillage management a positive magnitude on either axis shows that the dt maize variable was higher than the nt maize variable and vice versa difference in ta showed negative relationship with difference in etc which suggests that higher etc observed in either of the two fields results in lower air temperatures and vice versa because of the evaporative cooling effect arising from the latent heat of vaporization le initially in the growing season when the dt maize etc is higher than the nt maize etc difference is positive the observed ta in the dt field is lower than the nt field and the opposite is true later in the growing season when nt maize etc is higher than the dt maize etc similarly difference in vpd also shows a negative relationship with difference in etc in two fields this is explained by the fact that higher etc in one field positive difference increases the moisture humidity in the field microclimate which results in a lower vpd in the field negative difference higher humidity lower vpd can cause lower wind speeds which explains the negative relationship among the difference in etc and difference in wind speed across the two fields fig 10 d shows that a negative relationship exists between the difference in etc and difference in h across the two fields which is explained by the fact that both terms in addition to soil heat flux g combine to form net radiation rn if latent heat le or etc increases then h has to decrease to maintain the energy balance and vice versa which is clear from the negative relation shown in the figure difference in etc across the two fields was positively correlated with difference in rn in both fields and is justified because of the higher energy available to be used as latent heat le or etc differences in rn between the two fields occur because of the surface characteristics especially in the initial growth stages when one of the surfaces dt is bare soil and the other nt is covered with substantial amount of residue 95 100 picture 1 b from the previous crop this can result in alteration in the radiation interaction dynamics across the two fields including albedo hence affecting rn lastly soil water availability is one of the primary factors for etc to occur as sufficient soil moisture is necessary to sustain and meet the atmospheric evaporative demand hence the difference in tsw across the fields is positively related to the corresponding difference in etc however in some situations the soil water availability may be sufficient but the atmospheric demand may be low resulting in lower etc on some days and the relationship might not necessarily hold true which could be the reason for the low correlation between differences in tsw and etc it should be noted that the data points in fig 10e corresponding to high tsw represent days when high rainfall events or irrigation events occurred in the dt field that resulted in higher etc amounts from the dt maize largely due to increased evaporation this discussion indicates that the tillage practices due to their influence on crop water use also impact field level energy balance and hence microclimate which further contributes towards modification of the local field level atmospheric evaporative demand which in turn results in differences in etc between the dt and nt evaporating surfaces 3 5 disk till vs no till maize yield water productivity and production functions the dt and nt fields were assessed for grain yield for each of the three years to determine if the differential tillage practices impacted crop yields and hence possibly have an economic benefit associated with them also since it has been shown in the previous sections that water consumption for the dt and nt maize differ the maize water productivity may also vary under the two tillage systems table 5 presents the field average maize grain yields y and maize water productivity wp observed under the two tillage systems for all the studied growing seasons in addition to the growing season etc for all three growing seasons dt maize grain yield was higher than its nt counterpart dt yield was greater than nt yield by 6 7 6 and 10 for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively dt wp in 2011 was higher by about 10 from nt wp dt wps in 2012 and 2013 on the other hand was observed to be 0 6 higher and 1 6 lower respectively than nt wp which are negligible differences these results indicate that while dt can be a better alternative than nt when compared in terms of crop yields at least comparable and can correspondingly result in higher economic benefits when other variables are kept similar tillage did not impact water productivity substantially the reason behind this is the offsetting of higher grain yields under dt by its higher water consumption etc which causes the wp magnitudes to remain comparable for the two tillage systems west et al 1996 in a twenty year study in indiana usa also found that no tillage in dark silty clay loam soil reduced maize yields by 14 and 2 8 in continuous maize and maize after soybean respectively when compared against conventional tillage yields probable reasons for these yield results can be sought by focusing on long term changes on soil properties at the two fields which was not one of the primary goals in our research as we aimed to focus extensively on differences in maize water use among the two tillage systems afzalinia and zabihi 2014 found that no tillage in a short term investigation decreased maize grain yield when compared to conventional tillage by 18 2 11 1 they reported that the reason for that decrease in maize yield is the higher soil compaction under no tillage chen et al 2011 also reported significantly lower maize yields under no tillage as compared with conventional tillage a review of one hundred years of international field trials focusing on crop response to no tillage defelice et al 2006 found that the average difference in soybean and maize yields between nt and ct was negligible nt tended to have greater yields than ct in hot and wet areas similar yields occurred in the warm and humid areas and lower nt yields were observed in the cool and semi arid regions in accordance with our findings at nebraska a semi arid region in these studies nt crop yield was influenced by multiple factors including climate soil characteristics landscape crop variety crop rotation fertilizer application and other field management triplett and dick 2008 the irrigation yield production functions iypf and evapotranspiration yield production functions etypf irmak 2015a and b varied between the tillage practices and also exhibited inter annual variation for the same tillage practice fig 11 a both dt and nt maize grain yield had strong and linear response to seasonal etc and irrigation with high coefficients of determination r2 0 95 for iypf and 0 87 for etypf with dt maize having greater r2 values than nt maize in all cases while nt maize had greater slopes than dt maize in both etypf and iypfs the intercept was greater for dt maize in all cases based on the regression parameters a unit of grain productivity per unit of evapotranspiration varied between the tillage practices as 25 4 mm of etc resulted in 0 19 and 0 22 t ha of increase in grain yield beyond the intercept for the dt and nt maize respectively similarly a unit of grain productivity per unit of irrigation water applied also varied between the two tillage systems as 25 4 mm of irrigation water application resulted in 0 10 and 0 13 t ha grain yield for dt and nt systems respectively while the grain productivity per unit of etc and irrigation water applied is slightly greater for the nt system the intercept of the etypf and iypfs were substantially greater fig 11a for the dt system than the nt dt maize yield responded to etc and irrigation water with a greater slope in the initial stage of the crop productivity there was a strong and linear relationship between irrigation water application and etc for both dt and nt fields fig 11b because etc for the dt field was greater than nt field the impact of irrigation on etc i e increase in etc due to irrigation was also greater for the dt field a unit increase in etc per unit of irrigation application also varied between the tillage systems and also exhibited inter annual variation for the same tillage system fig 11b dt maize had greater slope and intercept than the nt maize on a three year average basis a 25 4 mm of irrigation application resulted in 13 1 and 12 4 mm of increase beyond the intercept in etc for dt and nt maize respectively 4 summary and conclusions the extensive adoption of conservation agriculture practices in nebraska and the usa corn belt necessitates intensive research efforts concentrated towards quantification and analyses of maize water use dynamics under local conventional disk till dt and conservation no till nt tillage systems and further finding useful information to enhance our knowledge base this manuscript presents the case of a research effort directed towards this objective in irrigated settings at two producer s farms at holdrege nebraska specifically this research focused on quantifying maize water use evapotranspiration and water productivity and studying microclimatic differences among dt and nt maize evapotranspiration and other weather variables at field scale were measured on an hourly basis using identical bowen ratio energy balance systems brebs installed in each experimental field utmost care was taken to ascertain that the two fields were very similar in terms of crop and soil management practices so that tillage practice was the only difference etc in dt maize field was higher than that in nt maize field for 2012 and 2013 while it was similar for 2011 an interesting observation was that dt maize had higher etc prior to anthesis due to higher evaporation prior to canopy closure in dt maize while nt evapotranspired more post anthesis which was attributed to earlier senescence observed in dt maize due to lower soil moisture storage than nt maize the differences in etc among the two tillage systems altered the energy balance and caused changes in field scale microclimate specifically difference in etc among the two fields was negatively related to differences in ta vpd u3 and h whereas it was positively related to rn and tsw maize grain yield was higher for dt maize than nt maize for all years by 7 6 and 10 for 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively dt maize wp in 2011 was 10 higher than the nt maize wp however dt wp in 2012 and 2013 was observed to be 0 6 higher and 1 6 lower respectively than nt wp which implies that no considerable difference was found among dt and nt maize wp the irrigation yield production functions iypf and evapotranspiration yield production functions etypf varied between the tillage practices and also exhibited inter annual variation for the same tillage practice there was a strong and linear relationship between irrigation water application and etc for both dt and nt fields it has been established in the research studies that the impact of tillage practices on crop production and water resources are highly variable and site specific and hence should be locally assessed for nebraska it was concluded that while no till practice may results in reduction non beneficial loss of water evaporation this does not necessarily translate into yield benefits and hence has no effect on maize wp thus no till crop management seems adoptable in scenarios when and where freshwater resource conservation is a priority but it should not be expected that any economic benefits will result from yield increases nevertheless the producer can avail economic benefits arising from savings from fuel and machinery costs due to absence of tillage operations the information and data presented in this research can be beneficial resource for quantifying and understanding the differences in tilled and untilled crop management with respect to their impacts on agricultural water management acknowledgments this research was partially supported by the grants from the nebraska environmental trust

11113,canopy cover or vegetation cover maps serve in irrigation management mainly to determine the primary evapotranspiration et coefficient as radiation interception and evaporative surface area are directly related to canopy cover crop size and development with time depends on water supply therefore crop canopy maps are tools for the detection of the spatial uniformity of irrigation systems several aerial scan campaigns were deployed in the upper galilee of israel in the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons to follow up and evaluate the irrigation uniformity and crop coefficients of peanuts and

atmospheric radiance and transmittance hunt et al 2011 tucker 1979 the red wavelengths are strongly absorbed by chlorophyll and therefore are less sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content gitelson et al 1996 2005 hunt et al 2011 yoder and waring 1994 as the leaf area index lai increases apparent canopy chlorophyll content also increases regardless of the single level leaf chlorophyll content therefore these vis are much more affected by lai than by changes in chlorophyll at the canopy scale daughtry et al 2000 eitel et al 2009 hunt et al 2011 since chlorophyll is vital for the photosynthesis process changes in chlorophyll levels can be linked to photosynthetic productivity developmental phenological stages and plant stress chlorophyll levels also correlate to green vegetation nitrogen levels nitrogen shortage reduces leaf chlorophyll content thus decreasing plant spectral absorption especially in the blue and red wavelengths therefore increasing reflectance in these wavelengths gitelson et al 2005 haboudane et al 2004 hatfield et al 2008 hunt et al 2012 yoder and waring 1994 nitrogen is a vital plant nutrient most important for crop growth and yield on the other hand the green wavelengths are more sensitive to high chlorophyll levels since they are less absorbed by chlorophyll a and b unlike the blue red and nir wavelengths gitelson et al 1996 2005 hunt et al 2011 yoder and waring 1994 therefore vis using the green wavelength are capable of detecting changes in chlorophyll contents at the leaf and canopy scale and are suitable to monitor plants developmental stages and stress gitelson et al gitelson et al 2002 found that the nir reflectance band is less sensitive for determining the vegetation cover or vegetation fraction vf for vf 60 and showed that a vi using the green red blue wavelengths have a linear relationship to vf with an accuracy level of up to 90 they showed that in wheat when vf is between 50 and 100 the green wavelength is most sensitive to changes in the vegetation cover while the blue red and nir wavelengths are insensitive to changes in the vegetation cover adamsen et al adamsen et al 1999 measured greenness of wheat plants throughout the cropping season using a digital camera a hand held radiometer and chlorophyll meter they found that the green to red g r spectral wavelengths ratio index is sensitive to the amount of greenness of the plant it is less than 1 in the beginning and at the end of the growing season and above 1 at midseason adamsen et al 1999 kanemasu 1974 the g r index obtained from an uncalibrated digital camera was more sensitive to plant senescence than the chlorophyll meter and on par with the ndvi index obtained from the hand held radiometer thus proving that moderate cost digital cameras can be used to monitor crop senescence adamsen et al 1999 kanemasu kanemasu 1974 concluded that the g r ratio may serve as a benchmark for crop growth phenological stages and for indicating the vf another vi that is based on the g r ratio is the green red vegetation index grvi that is defined according to eq 1 1 grvi ρgreen ρred ρgreen ρred motohka et al motohka et al 2010 evaluated the use of the grvi as a phenological indicator they concluded that the grvi index can differentiate between green vegetation index above 0 water and snow index around 0 and soils index below 0 furthermore they demonstrated that the grvi unlike the ndvi is sensitive to leaf color change leaf greening and autumn coloring they suggested using the threshold of grvi 0 as a site specific threshold for monitoring phenological changes and the grvi index as an indicator for plant disturbances and comparing between different ecosystem types motohka et al 2010 remote sensing for crop management aims at providing spatial and spectral information for crop classification crop condition yield forecast and weed disease detection and management current satellite based remotely sensed products can cover large areas but they are limited by both their temporal revisit time 2 and 5 days for venus and sentinel 2 satellites respectively and spatial pixel size 5 10 m for venus and sentinel 2 respectively resolutions when compared to unmanned aerial vehicle uav one of satellite imaging s challenges is dealing with pixels that have multiple objects with different spectral signatures e g plants and soil such pixels are called mixed pixels uav imaging high spatial resolution produces mixed free pixels therefore making vegetation detection and differentiation an easier task similarly high spatial resolution allows for a precise estimation of the vegetation cover fraction a basic method for irrigation scheduling is factoring the potential evapotranspiration pet computed from measured radiation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity with a crop specific coefficient kc as widely accepted and formulated by the fao 56 publication testa et al 2011 crop coefficients are provided by diverse methods such as empirical conclusions from field experiments degree day based seasonal functions experts recommendations and the fao 56 publication kc library or by field specific measurements according to the penman monteith equation solar radiation comprise about 85 of the evapotranspiration et driving energy received by the crop canopy testa et al 2011 and intercepted solar radiation is directly proportional to the light interception li green et al 2003 johnson et al 2000 meron et al 1989 further since li is directly proportional to crop canopy cover kc can be fitted to the field and plot specific dimension by measuring crop cover therefore vf can be used as kc aerial survey derived vfs are directly proportional to cover meron et al 2006 thus digital aerial photography provides an efficient method for kc determination campillo et al 2008 precision irrigation can be defined as matching water application to crops need in space time and amount variable rate water application to achieve that is feasible with solid set systems using modern controllers and in variable rate center pivot or lateral move irrigation machines all available in the open market however such application needs spatial and temporal crop water status information in sufficient resolution and accuracy attainable mainly by aerial sensing and imagery haghverdi et al 2015 nahry et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 digital aerial photography became affordable and popularized with the appearance in the open market of low cost high performance small sized unmanned aerial vehicles uav carrying high resolution digital cameras in contrast with the former less accessible human flown aerial photography testing of these new enabling technologies for precision irrigation information acquisition is obviously needed such a technology is presented herein the main objectives of this study were to test the ability of an inexpensive rgb camera mounted on an inexpensive uav to determine vegetation cover and vigor of the canopy at a large scale whole field resolution and to investigate whether vegetation cover and vigor patterns can be utilized as indicators for irrigation water uniformity and as such feedback information for precision water application at variable rate irrigation vri systems another objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of an rgb based vi with that of the well known ndvi both in uav based high spatial resolution cameras and via satellite imaging 2 materials and methods 2 1 uav imaging system dji phantom 4 quadcopter uav was used as the

gadot center pivot test site 33 2 22 91 n 35 38 0 43 e the havat gadash field crops experimental farm 33 10 56 24 n 35 35 5 78 e and the hagoshrim lateral move test site 33 11 57 75 n 35 38 19 15 e all three located in the upper galilee region in the northern part of israel the area has a mediterranean climate characterized by wet mild winters with mean minimum and maximum temperatures of 7 and 14 c respectively and hot dry summers with mean minimum and maximum temperatures of 19 and 32 c respectively annual winter rainfall is in the range of 400 600 mm while summer crops utilize 80 120 mm of winter soil water storage for the initial growth periods at the havat gadash peanuts cv hanoch were sown on 1 may 2017 and irrigated uniformly by an experimental lateral move starting on 8 may table 1 pet was calculated according to the penman monteith formula based on meteorological field data kc was calculated as cumulative irrigation divided by cumulative et four differential irrigation treatments were performed starting on 19 july fig 1 the kc 70 treatment yielded the highest crop weight per area 5 86 ton hectare more than 0 7 ton hectare compared to the rest of the treatments implying optimal water application and water use and was selected for ground truth validation comparing field measured kc with aerial imagery calculation of vf experimental plots were four 12 25 m plots side by side in four replicates fig 1 seven flight campaigns were conducted at midday at 10 50 m altitude and pixel spatial resolution of 0 006 0 02 m table 2 crop cover did not reach full cover during the first two campaigns 25 june 17 july full cover is reached when there are less than 20 pixels that are classified as bare soil the field at the gadot center pivot test site was cultivated with cotton crop sown on 4 april 2017 the field was irrigated at eight day intervals beginning from 3 june two flight campaigns were conducted on 5 july and 24 august when the crop had already reached full cover the flights were conducted at midday at 50 m altitude and pixel spatial resolution of 0 02 m table 2 the field at the hagoshrim lateral move test site was cultivated with cotton crop sown on 1 1 march 2018 the field was irrigated at five day intervals beginning from 24 may two flight campaigns were conducted on 17 and 26 june when the crop had already reached full cover the flights were conducted at midday at 100 m altitude and pixel spatial resolution of 0 043 m table 2 flight courses were created with the pix4dcapture software which was also used to automatically pilot the dji phantom 4 uav according to the flight path an overlap percentage of 70 80 was chosen in order to ease the task of mosaicking in order to compare ndvi and grvi a flight campaign using the dji mavic pro uav was conducted in the peanut field at the havat gadash experimental farm on october 10 2017 twelve days before the end of the growing season table 2 the parrot sequoia multispectral sensor was used to create the ndvi while the rgb camera was used to create the grvi 2 3 data processing the images collected in each flight campaign were mosaicked and georeferenced using the pix4dmapper software the arcgis 10 5 geo referencing tools were used for fine adjustments vf was calculated using arcgis 10 5 calculating the histogram of the grvi products pixels with grvi values greater than 0 were classified as vegetation according to motohka et al 2010 sentinel 2 level 2 a atmospherically corrected images of the gadot test site from 29 august 2017 were acquired courtesy of the copernicus open access hub venus satellite level 1 radiometrically corrected and top of atmosphere reflectance images of the hagoshrim test site from 17 june 2018 were acquired courtesy of cnes french government space agency isa israeli space agency and the scientific center at the ben gurion university israel several vis were created and compared to the uav images in order to check whether it is possible to use sentinel 2 and venus satellite imaging with spatial resolution of 10 and 5 m respectively to determine irrigation uniformity issues the following vis were checked ndvi tucker 1979 green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi gitelson et al 1996 and grvi motohka et al 2010 tucker 1979 uav images were compared to similar date satellites images for the sake of proper comparison same day as venus and 4 days apart from sentinel 2 imagery all images taken with the dji phantom 4 uav built in camera equipped with a gimbal assuring vertical nadir direction were acquired close to midday when the sun is close to zenith taking images of flat agricultural surfaces thus limiting bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf complication furthermore at the height of uav image acquisition 10 100 m and for the purpose of analyzing rgb color space no special calibration or atmospheric correction was applied beyond the standard factory calibration 3 results 3 1 havat gadash experimental farm campaign the rgb images fig 2 a c have high spatial resolution 0 0066 m see table 2 allowing the differentiation of crop from soil negative grvi values were classified as non vegetation i e soil and positive grvi values were classified as vegetation the vfs determined according to the grvi images histograms were 46 and 87 fig 3 a b respectively whereas the vf can be determined as 1 minus the intersection value of the cumulative grvi graph with the y axis in fig 3 the field calculated kc for the campaign dates table 1 highlighted kcs of 40 and 86 were in par with the image calculated vfs of 46 and 87 respectively validating the vf calculations the grvi images revealed crop phenological stages whereas 9 of the pixels grvi values in the image taken 55 days from sowing were below zero and outside of the soil curve pixels group fig 3a only 3 of the pixels grvi were below zero and outside of the soil curve pixels group in the later image at 77 days from sowing fig 3b these pixels that don t belong to either the soil or vegetation classified groups were classified as non vegetation pixels due to their negative grvi value but could also be classified as vegetation in early phenological stages with g r ratio values less than 1 negative grvi value yields g r ratio below 1 indicative of the beginning of the growing season furthermore the vegetation curve in the later image is further away from the y axis compared to the chronologically earlier image fig 3a b with higher positive grvi values indicative of healthy and vital vegetation suitable to the midseason phenological stage as can be seen in table 2 crop cover reaches almost 100 full cover by the third flight campaign but in later campaign there is a drop in vf the reason behind this is due to pest damage wild boars see fig 1 bottom left corner images are not shown 3 2 comparison between ndvi and grvi since there were two different sensors measuring the ndvi and the grvi section 2 3 the spatial resolution of the ndvi was lower pixel size of 0 0373 m than that of the grvi 0 0095 m thus enabling sharper grvi imagery the image was taken toward the end of the season depicting plants in different stages of senescence the rgb image was classified into specific classes bare soil dead vegetation light green vegetation dark green vegetation using supervised classification aided by image pro software http www mediacy com imagepro smart segmentation algorithm fig 4 b table 3 presents the total area for each defined class for the classified rgb grvi and ndvi images as seen in table 3 the grvi classification is more similar to the rgb classification especially in detecting light and dark green vegetation differentiating between healthy dark green and stressed i e in senescence plants light green as can be seen in fig 4 the grvi captured plant senescence better than the ndvi changes in plant color from green to yellow are depicted more accurately in the grvi image than in the ndvi image greener vegetation depicted in the rgb image fig 4a b has higher grvi values fig 4c on the other hand the ndvi image fig 4d did not capture the color differences between plants that are visible in the rgb image fig 4a b the ndvi values are very high for most pixels 0 81 0 92 fig 4d indicating saturation of the ndvi values probably due to high lai values daughtry et al 2000 eitel et al 2009 hunt et al 2011 it is probable that the differences in pixel resolution are also responsible for the accuracy differences regardless for the purpose of vegetation classification and vigor analysis the use of rgb vi is preferable to that of the ndvi 3 3 gadot test site campaign the images of the gadot pivot irrigated cotton crop were taken after the crop had reached full canopy cover fig 5 a c a closer look at the grvi images reveals sector lines indicating differences in plant vigor fig 5b d the sector patterns are indicative of ununiformed irrigation due to intermittent pivot movement the greener areas probably received more irrigation due to lower pivot speed this could have resulted from physical obstacles uneven ground malfunctioning pivot control etc whereas these sectors are noticeably visible in the grvi image it is impossible to notice them in the rgb image therefore using the grvi in this case is crucial in order to detect irrigation uniformity irrigation malfunctions and other subtle disturbances 3 4 sentinel 2 satellite vi of the gadot test site the ndvi and gndvi images are pretty similar showing high values homogenously throughout the whole field except for the middle left corner fig 6 a b the grvi image is more heterogeneous showing patches of low values that are correlated to the uav high resolution grvi image s patches figs 5d and 6 c indicative of the field s heterogeneous plant vigor and ununiformed irrigation the grvi is therefore better at presenting the real crop vigor situation whereas the saturation of red reflectance at intermediate to high chlorophyll values is well known gitelson et al 2005 kanemasu 1974 and is typical of ndvi it is surprising to see that the gndvi was also saturated and did not show field s heterogeneity 3 5 hagoshrim test site campgain the images of the irrigated cotton at the hagoshrim lateral move irrigation system were taken after the crop had reached full canopy cover albeit it is possible to see within the field bare soil lines that were created due to the pivot s wheels movement fig 7 c a closer look at the grvi images reveals lines indicating differences in plant vigor fig 7a b these patterns are indicators for ununiformed irrigation there are both horizontal and vertical lines fig 7a b the horizontal lines are indicative of intermittent pivot movement similar to the gadot test site the denser biomass greener areas probably received more irrigation due to lower pivot speed the vertical lines are indicative of differences in the amount of water delivered by the different sprinklers on board the pivot and or differences in the amount of overlap of irrigation between neighboring sprinklers the heterogeneity in field s plant vigor enhances as a function of time indicative of an irrigation machine related persistent operation malfunction that is responsible for the ununiformed irrigation on the practical level such maps can be shown to the operator and in fact has been shown in order to readjust lateral water distribution of the machine and to identify and remove obstacles in machine movement along the travel path 3 6 venus satellite vi of the hagoshrim test site similarly to the findings of the sentinel 2 satellite at the gadot campaign fig 6 the ndvi and gndvi images of venus satellite fig 8 a b are pretty similar showing lower values of field variability when compared to the grvi image fig 8c the vertical lines can be seen in all images albeit most clearly in the grvi image horizontal lines cannot be identified in any of the compared vi the grvi image is more heterogeneous showing patches of low values that are correlated to the uav high resolution grvi image s patches figs 7a and 8 c therefore once more confirming that the grvi is better than ndvi and gndvi at presenting the real crop vigor situation 4 discussion evaluating crop cover during the beginning of the growing season with the aid of uavs as described in this research can support and validate farmer s irrigation decision making process field irrigation depends on crop cover ratio therefore up until the crop reaches full cover it is necessary to re evaluate crop cover at short time intervals in order to optimize irrigation water quantities the technique proposed in this research offers an affordable and accurate solution we propose conducting a uav flight campaign a day before the scheduled irrigation in order to determine the current field s crop cover ratio thus aiding the farmer in determining crop specific coefficient an aerial survey should be conducted for every irrigation zone in case the zone is very big it is possible to sample only some parts of the whole area based on the field s inherent heterogeneity e g soil texture soil type soil water content apparent soil electrical conductivity and previous flight campaigns wherein crop cover heterogeneity was observed such sampling is beyond the scope of this paper however it should be noted that the proposed techniques for crop cover estimation and crop heterogeneity detection can be integrated into other existing techniques that aim to improve the design of irrigation systems fortes et al 2015 vri systems can use crop cover ratio findings and heterogeneity in plant vigor in order to construct irrigation maps according to plants water demands and to better prescribe variable irrigation rates according to plant size and cover ratio even though much better more accurate and more expensive sensors exist in the open market we argue that for the purpose of determining crop cover ratio utilizing affordable cmos sensors such as were used in this research is adequate very high spatial resolution is paramount it cancels the problem of mixed pixels and allows to obtain pure pixels of vegetation and bare soil thus enabling to distinguish between bare soil and vegetation it is possible to differentiate soil from crop cover using raw rgb images fig 2a c however in order to quantify the ratio of crop cover to bare soil it is necessary to classify these classes such a classification from rgb image is very complex since there are 2563 options of color combinations for each pixel converting the rgb image into a vegetation index simplifies the classification task tremendously as motohka et al motohka et al 2010 concluded the grvi is very suitable for such a task wherein grvi index values of above zero can be classified as green vegetation figs 2b d 3 furthermore as shown in the results the grvi was sensitive to differences in crop s plant vigor as expressed in chlorophyll composition and intensity and in the number of pixels with negative close to zero grvi values at various phenological stages figs 2 3 thus it could potentially be used in some crops as an indicator in determining phenological stages and as a benchmark for phenological stages transitioning such as senescence in groundnuts in this study the grvi also proved to be superior to the ndvi in detecting plant vigor senescence and irrigation uniformity figs 4 6 detecting irrigation water uniformity is crucial for the purpose of optimizing water use and crop yields our results demonstrate that specifically in pivot irrigation it is possible to detect heterogeneity in plant vigor that are caused due to abnormal pivot movement the sectors that are perpendicular to the pivot s advancement direction or horizontal lines in lateral moves are indicative for slower pivot speed and over irrigation figs 5 7 denser vegetation lines formed at the direction of the machine s advancement vertical lines are indicative of inherent problems in the sprinkler system calibration overwatering under watering distance between sprinklers sprinklers overlap due to the height of the sprinkler from the ground fig 7 high spatial resolution uav images are superior to the lower resolution satellite imaging in finding the fine lines that demarcate the field s heterogeneity figs 5 8 whereas some of the lines were identified by the satellites grvi it gave a rough idea towards understanding differences of plant vigor within the field s scale in order to further analyze the intricacies of the field s heterogeneity it is necessary to get a closer look via uav or other higher spatial resolution devices still it was proven that satellite imaging can provide valuable information on large spatial scales regarding the field s plant vigor heterogeneity that can be further investigated on finer scales upon demand 5 conclusions in this study the ability of a high resolution rgb imaging to determine vegetation cover and vigor at the canopy scale at whole field resolution was evaluated using an rgb vi namely the grvi it was concluded that the grvi is suitable for determining vegetation cover distinguishing between vegetation and other land covers such as soil and dead vegetation fig 2 the vf can be accurately measured and used by the farmer on the spot in order to directly define the kc it was also shown that the grvi can be used to distinguish a plant s phenological stages in fact detecting early season and senescence is easy with grvi a grvi lower than 0 indicates low plant s vigor whereas a grvi greater than zero indicates strong plant vigor corresponding to the mid season plant phenological stage figs 2 4 it was also concluded that the grvi is better than the ndvi and gndvi in detecting subtle disturbances in mid season fig 6 high resolution rgb imaging can be utilized to monitor the uniformity of irrigation water application and to detect heterogeneity in field irrigation fig 5 since both the camera and the uav used in this research are inexpensive and available and the current auto pilot uav guiding technologies ease the use of uavs the presented tools

therefore these vis are much more affected by lai than by changes in chlorophyll at the canopy scale daughtry et al 2000 eitel et al 2009 hunt et al 2011 since chlorophyll is vital for the photosynthesis process changes in chlorophyll levels can be linked to photosynthetic productivity developmental phenological stages and plant stress chlorophyll levels also correlate to green vegetation nitrogen levels nitrogen shortage reduces leaf chlorophyll content thus decreasing plant spectral absorption especially in the blue and red wavelengths therefore increasing reflectance in these wavelengths gitelson et al 2005 haboudane et al 2004 hatfield et al 2008 hunt et al 2012 yoder and waring 1994 nitrogen is a vital plant nutrient most important for crop growth and yield on the other hand the green wavelengths are more sensitive to high chlorophyll levels since they are less absorbed by chlorophyll a and b unlike the blue red and nir wavelengths gitelson et al 1996 2005 hunt et al 2011 yoder and waring 1994 therefore vis using the green wavelength are capable of detecting changes in chlorophyll contents at the leaf and canopy scale and are suitable to monitor plants developmental stages and stress gitelson et al gitelson et al 2002 found that the nir reflectance band is less sensitive for determining the vegetation cover or vegetation fraction vf for vf 60 and showed that a vi using the green red blue wavelengths have a linear relationship to vf with an accuracy level of up to 90 they showed that in wheat when vf is between 50 and 100 the green wavelength is most sensitive to changes in the vegetation cover while the blue red and nir wavelengths are insensitive to changes in the vegetation cover adamsen et al adamsen et al 1999 measured greenness of wheat plants throughout the cropping season using a digital camera a hand held radiometer and chlorophyll meter they found that the green to red g r spectral wavelengths ratio index is sensitive to the amount of greenness of the plant it is less than 1 in the beginning and at the end of the growing season and above 1 at midseason adamsen et al 1999 kanemasu 1974 the g r index obtained from an uncalibrated digital camera was more sensitive to plant senescence than the chlorophyll meter and on par with the ndvi index obtained from the hand held radiometer thus proving that moderate cost digital cameras can be used to monitor crop senescence adamsen et al 1999 kanemasu kanemasu 1974 concluded that the g r ratio may serve as a benchmark for crop growth phenological stages and for indicating the vf another vi that is based on the g r ratio is the green red vegetation index grvi that is defined according to eq 1 1 grvi ρgreen ρred ρgreen ρred motohka et al motohka et al 2010 evaluated the use of the grvi as a phenological indicator they concluded that the grvi index can differentiate between green vegetation index above 0 water and snow index around 0 and soils index below 0 furthermore they demonstrated that the grvi unlike the ndvi is sensitive to leaf color change leaf greening and autumn coloring they suggested using the threshold of grvi 0 as a site specific threshold for monitoring phenological changes and the grvi index as an indicator for plant disturbances and comparing between different ecosystem types motohka et al 2010 remote sensing for crop management aims at providing spatial and spectral information for crop classification crop condition yield forecast and weed disease detection and management current satellite based remotely sensed products can cover large areas but they are limited by both their temporal revisit time 2 and 5 days for venus and sentinel 2 satellites respectively and spatial pixel size 5 10 m for venus and sentinel 2 respectively resolutions when compared to unmanned aerial vehicle uav one of satellite imaging s challenges is dealing with pixels that have multiple objects with different spectral signatures e g plants and soil such pixels are called mixed pixels uav imaging high spatial resolution produces mixed free pixels therefore making vegetation detection and differentiation an easier task similarly high spatial resolution allows for a precise estimation of the vegetation cover fraction a basic method for irrigation scheduling is factoring the potential evapotranspiration pet computed from measured radiation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity with a crop specific coefficient kc as widely accepted and formulated by the fao 56 publication testa et al 2011 crop coefficients are provided by diverse methods such as empirical conclusions from field experiments degree day based seasonal functions experts recommendations and the fao 56 publication kc library or by field specific measurements according to the penman monteith equation solar radiation comprise about 85 of the evapotranspiration et driving energy received by the crop canopy testa et al 2011 and intercepted solar radiation is directly proportional to the light interception li green et al 2003 johnson et al 2000 meron et al 1989 further since li is directly proportional to crop canopy cover kc can be fitted to the field and plot specific dimension by measuring crop cover therefore vf can be used as kc aerial survey derived vfs are directly proportional to cover meron et al 2006 thus digital aerial photography provides an efficient method for kc determination campillo et al 2008 precision irrigation can be defined as matching water application to crops need in space time and amount variable rate water application to achieve that is feasible with solid set systems using modern controllers and in variable rate center pivot or lateral move irrigation machines all available in the open market however such application needs spatial and temporal crop water status information in sufficient resolution and accuracy attainable mainly by aerial sensing and imagery haghverdi et al 2015 nahry et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 digital aerial photography became affordable and popularized with the appearance in the open market of low cost high performance small sized unmanned aerial vehicles uav carrying high resolution digital cameras in contrast with the former less accessible human flown aerial photography testing of these new enabling technologies for precision irrigation information acquisition is obviously needed such a technology is presented herein the main objectives of this study were to test the ability of an inexpensive rgb camera mounted on an inexpensive uav to determine vegetation cover and vigor of the canopy at a large scale whole field resolution and to investigate whether vegetation cover and vigor patterns can be utilized as indicators for irrigation water uniformity and as such feedback information for precision water application at variable rate irrigation vri systems another objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of an rgb based vi with that of the well known ndvi both in uav based high spatial resolution cameras and via satellite imaging 2 materials and methods 2 1 uav imaging system dji phantom 4 quadcopter uav was used as the flying platform the uav is equipped with a built in rgb camera with a 4000 3000 pixel 4 k resolution cmos sensor a 20 mm 35 mm eq lens with field of view fov of 94 in a 3 axis stabilized gimbal https www dji com phantom 4 info the uav was flown using pix4d capture pre programmed flightpath control the parrot sequoia multispectral sensor was used in order to compare ndvi with grvi the parrot

4 rgb sensor s white balance setting was set to sunny no other color or style enhancements were made to the obtained images 2 2 flight campaigns flight campaigns were conducted in three test sites the gadot center pivot test site 33 2 22 91 n 35 38 0 43 e the havat gadash field crops experimental farm 33 10 56 24 n 35 35 5 78 e and the hagoshrim lateral move test site 33 11 57 75 n 35 38 19 15 e all three located in the upper galilee region in the northern part of israel the area has a mediterranean climate characterized by wet mild winters with mean minimum and maximum temperatures of 7 and 14 c respectively and hot dry summers with mean minimum and maximum temperatures of 19 and 32 c respectively annual winter rainfall is in the range of 400 600 mm while summer crops utilize 80 120 mm of winter soil water storage for the initial growth periods at the havat gadash peanuts cv hanoch were sown on 1 may 2017 and irrigated uniformly by an experimental lateral move starting on 8 may table 1 pet was calculated according to the penman monteith formula based on meteorological field data kc was calculated as cumulative irrigation divided by cumulative et four differential irrigation treatments were performed starting on 19 july fig 1 the kc 70 treatment yielded the highest crop weight per area 5 86 ton hectare more than 0 7 ton hectare compared to the rest of the treatments implying optimal water application and water use and was selected for ground truth validation comparing field measured kc with aerial imagery calculation of vf experimental plots were four 12 25 m plots side by side in four replicates fig 1 seven flight campaigns were conducted at midday at 10 50 m altitude and pixel spatial resolution of 0 006 0 02 m table 2 crop cover did not reach full cover during the first two campaigns 25 june 17 july full cover is reached when there are less than 20 pixels that are classified as bare soil the field at the gadot center pivot test site was cultivated with cotton crop sown on 4 april 2017 the field was irrigated at eight day intervals beginning from 3 june two flight campaigns were conducted on 5 july and 24 august when the crop had already reached full cover the flights were conducted at midday at 50 m altitude and pixel spatial resolution of 0 02 m table 2 the field at the hagoshrim lateral move test site was cultivated with cotton crop sown on 1 1 march 2018 the field was irrigated at five day intervals beginning from 24 may two flight campaigns were conducted on 17 and 26 june when the crop had already reached full cover the flights were conducted at midday at 100 m altitude and pixel spatial resolution of 0 043 m table 2 flight courses were created with the pix4dcapture software which was also used to automatically pilot the dji phantom 4 uav according to the flight path an overlap percentage of 70 80 was chosen in order to ease the task of mosaicking in order to compare ndvi and grvi a flight campaign using the dji mavic pro uav was conducted in the peanut field at the havat gadash experimental farm on october 10 2017 twelve days before the end of the growing season table 2 the parrot sequoia multispectral sensor was used to create the ndvi while the rgb camera was used to create the grvi 2 3 data processing the images collected in each flight campaign were mosaicked and georeferenced using the pix4dmapper software the arcgis 10 5 geo referencing tools were used for fine adjustments vf was calculated using arcgis 10 5 calculating the histogram of the grvi products pixels with grvi values greater than 0 were classified as vegetation according to motohka et al 2010 sentinel 2 level 2 a atmospherically corrected images of the gadot test site from 29 august 2017 were acquired courtesy of the copernicus open access hub venus satellite level 1 radiometrically corrected and top of atmosphere reflectance images of the hagoshrim test site from 17 june 2018 were acquired courtesy of cnes french government space agency isa israeli space agency and the scientific center at the ben gurion university israel several vis were created and compared to the uav images in order to check whether it is possible to use sentinel 2 and venus satellite imaging with spatial resolution of 10 and 5 m respectively to determine irrigation uniformity issues the following vis were checked ndvi tucker 1979 green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi gitelson et al 1996 and grvi motohka et al 2010 tucker 1979 uav images were compared to similar date satellites images for the sake of proper comparison same day as venus and 4 days apart from sentinel 2 imagery all images taken with the dji phantom 4 uav built in camera equipped with a gimbal assuring vertical nadir direction were acquired close to midday when the sun is close to zenith taking images of flat agricultural surfaces thus limiting bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf complication furthermore at the height of uav image acquisition 10 100 m and for the purpose of analyzing rgb color space no special calibration or atmospheric correction was applied beyond the standard factory calibration 3 results 3 1 havat gadash experimental farm campaign the rgb images fig 2 a c have high spatial resolution 0 0066 m see table 2 allowing the differentiation of crop from soil negative grvi values were classified as non vegetation i e soil and positive grvi values were classified as vegetation the vfs determined according to the grvi images histograms were 46 and 87 fig 3 a b respectively whereas the vf can be determined as 1 minus the intersection value of the cumulative grvi graph with the y axis in fig 3 the field calculated kc for the campaign dates table 1 highlighted kcs of 40 and 86 were in par with the image calculated vfs of 46 and 87 respectively validating the vf calculations the grvi images revealed crop phenological stages whereas 9 of the pixels grvi values in the image taken 55 days from sowing were below zero and outside of the soil curve pixels group fig 3a only 3 of the pixels grvi were below zero and outside of the soil curve pixels group in the later image at 77 days from sowing fig 3b these pixels that don t belong to either the soil or vegetation classified groups were classified as non vegetation pixels due to their negative grvi value but could also be classified as vegetation in early phenological stages with g r ratio values less than 1 negative grvi value yields g r ratio below 1 indicative of the beginning of the growing season furthermore the vegetation curve in the later image is further away from the y axis compared to the chronologically earlier image fig 3a b with higher positive grvi values indicative of healthy and vital vegetation suitable to the midseason phenological stage as can be seen in table 2 crop cover reaches almost 100 full cover by the third flight campaign but in later campaign there is a drop in vf the reason behind this is due to pest damage wild boars see fig 1 bottom left corner images are not shown 3 2 comparison between ndvi and grvi since there were two different sensors measuring the ndvi and the grvi section 2 3 the spatial resolution of the ndvi was lower pixel size of 0 0373 m than that of the grvi 0 0095 m thus enabling sharper grvi imagery the image was taken toward the end of the season depicting plants in different stages of senescence the rgb image was classified into specific classes bare soil dead vegetation light green vegetation dark green vegetation using supervised classification aided by image pro software http www mediacy com imagepro smart segmentation algorithm fig 4 b table 3 presents the total area for each defined class for the classified rgb grvi and ndvi images as seen in table 3 the grvi classification is more similar to the rgb classification especially in detecting light and dark green vegetation differentiating between healthy dark green and stressed i e in senescence plants light green as can be seen in fig 4 the grvi captured plant senescence better than the ndvi changes in plant color from green to yellow are depicted more accurately in the grvi image than in the ndvi image greener vegetation depicted in the rgb image fig 4a b has higher grvi values fig 4c on the other hand the ndvi image fig 4d did not capture the color differences between plants that are visible in the rgb image fig 4a b the ndvi values are very high for most pixels 0 81 0 92 fig 4d indicating saturation of the ndvi values probably due to high lai values daughtry et al 2000 eitel et al 2009 hunt et al 2011 it is probable that the differences in pixel resolution are also responsible for the accuracy differences regardless for the purpose of vegetation classification and vigor analysis the use of rgb vi is preferable to that of the ndvi 3 3 gadot test site campaign the images of the gadot pivot irrigated cotton crop were taken after the crop had reached full canopy cover fig 5 a c a closer look at the grvi images reveals sector lines indicating differences in plant vigor fig 5b d the sector patterns are indicative of ununiformed irrigation due to intermittent pivot movement the greener areas probably received more irrigation due to lower pivot speed this could have resulted from physical obstacles uneven ground malfunctioning pivot control etc whereas these sectors are noticeably visible in the grvi image it is impossible to notice them in the rgb image therefore using the grvi in this case is crucial in order to detect irrigation uniformity irrigation malfunctions and other subtle disturbances 3 4 sentinel 2 satellite vi of the gadot test site the ndvi and gndvi images are pretty similar showing high values homogenously throughout the whole field except for the middle left corner fig 6 a b the grvi image is more heterogeneous showing patches of low values that are correlated to the uav high resolution grvi image s patches figs 5d and 6 c indicative of the field s heterogeneous plant vigor and ununiformed irrigation the grvi is therefore better at presenting the real crop vigor situation whereas the saturation of red reflectance at intermediate to high chlorophyll values is well known gitelson et al 2005 kanemasu 1974 and is typical of ndvi it is surprising to see that the gndvi was also saturated and did not show field s heterogeneity 3 5 hagoshrim test site campgain the images of the irrigated cotton at the hagoshrim lateral move irrigation system were taken after the crop had reached full canopy cover albeit it is possible to see within the field bare soil lines that were created due to the pivot s wheels movement fig 7 c a closer look at the grvi images reveals lines indicating differences in plant vigor fig 7a b these patterns are indicators for ununiformed irrigation there are both horizontal and vertical lines fig 7a b the horizontal lines are indicative of intermittent pivot movement similar to the gadot test site the denser biomass greener areas probably received more irrigation due to lower pivot speed the vertical lines are indicative of differences in the amount of water delivered by the different sprinklers on board the pivot and or differences in the amount of overlap of irrigation between neighboring sprinklers the heterogeneity in field s plant vigor enhances as a function of time indicative of an irrigation machine related persistent operation malfunction that is responsible for the ununiformed irrigation on the practical level such maps can be shown to the operator and in fact has been shown in order to readjust lateral water distribution of the machine and to identify and remove obstacles in machine movement along the travel path 3 6 venus satellite vi of the hagoshrim test site similarly to the findings of the sentinel 2 satellite at the gadot campaign fig 6 the ndvi and gndvi images of venus satellite fig 8 a b are pretty similar showing lower values of field variability when compared to the grvi image fig 8c the vertical lines can be seen in all images albeit most clearly in the grvi image horizontal lines cannot be identified in any of the compared vi the grvi image is more heterogeneous showing patches of low values that are correlated to the uav high resolution grvi image s patches figs 7a and 8 c therefore once more confirming that the grvi is better than ndvi and gndvi at presenting the real crop vigor situation 4 discussion evaluating crop cover during the beginning of the growing season with the aid of uavs as described in this research can support and validate farmer s irrigation decision making process field irrigation depends on crop cover ratio therefore up until the crop reaches full cover it is necessary to re evaluate crop cover at short time intervals in order to optimize irrigation water quantities the technique proposed in this research offers an affordable and accurate solution we propose conducting a uav flight campaign a day before the scheduled irrigation in order to determine the current field s crop cover ratio thus aiding the farmer in determining crop specific coefficient an aerial survey should be conducted for every irrigation zone in case the zone is very big it is possible to sample only some parts of the whole area based on the field s inherent heterogeneity e g soil texture soil type soil water content apparent soil electrical conductivity and previous flight campaigns wherein crop cover heterogeneity was observed such sampling is beyond the scope of this paper however it should be noted that the proposed techniques for crop cover estimation and crop heterogeneity detection can be integrated into other existing techniques that aim to improve the design of irrigation systems fortes et al 2015 vri systems can use crop cover ratio findings and heterogeneity in plant vigor in order to construct irrigation maps according to plants water demands and to better prescribe variable irrigation rates according to plant size and cover ratio even though much better more accurate and more expensive sensors exist in the open market we argue that for the purpose of determining crop cover ratio utilizing affordable cmos sensors such as were used in this research is adequate very high spatial resolution is paramount it cancels the problem of mixed pixels and allows to obtain pure pixels of vegetation and bare soil thus enabling to distinguish between bare soil and vegetation it is possible to differentiate soil from crop cover using raw rgb images fig 2a c however in order to quantify the ratio of crop cover to bare soil it is necessary to classify these classes such a classification from rgb image is very complex since there are 2563 options of color combinations for each pixel converting the rgb image into a vegetation index simplifies the classification task tremendously as motohka et al motohka et al 2010 concluded the grvi is very suitable for such a task wherein grvi index values of above zero can be classified as green vegetation figs 2b d 3 furthermore as shown in the results the grvi was sensitive to differences in crop s plant vigor as expressed in chlorophyll composition and intensity and in the number of pixels with negative close to zero grvi values at various phenological stages figs 2 3 thus it could potentially be used in some crops as an indicator in determining phenological stages and as a benchmark for phenological stages transitioning such as senescence in groundnuts in this study the grvi also proved to be superior to the ndvi in detecting plant vigor senescence and irrigation uniformity figs 4 6 detecting irrigation water uniformity is crucial for the purpose of optimizing water use and crop yields our results demonstrate that specifically in pivot irrigation it is possible to detect heterogeneity in plant vigor that are caused due to abnormal pivot movement the sectors that are perpendicular to the pivot s advancement direction or horizontal lines in lateral moves are indicative for slower pivot speed and over irrigation figs 5 7 denser vegetation lines formed at the direction of the machine s advancement vertical lines are indicative of inherent problems in the sprinkler system calibration overwatering under watering distance between sprinklers sprinklers overlap due to the height of the sprinkler from the ground fig 7 high spatial resolution uav images are superior to the lower resolution satellite imaging in finding the fine lines that demarcate the field s heterogeneity figs 5 8 whereas some of the lines were identified by the satellites grvi it gave a rough idea towards understanding differences of plant vigor within the field s scale in order to further analyze the intricacies of the field s heterogeneity it is necessary to get a closer look via uav or other higher spatial resolution devices still it was proven that satellite imaging can provide valuable information on large spatial scales regarding the field s plant vigor heterogeneity that can be further investigated on finer scales upon demand 5 conclusions in this study the ability of a high resolution rgb imaging to determine vegetation cover and vigor at the canopy scale at whole field resolution was evaluated using an rgb vi namely the grvi it was concluded that the grvi is suitable for determining vegetation cover distinguishing between vegetation and other land covers such as soil and dead vegetation fig 2 the vf can be accurately measured and used by the farmer on the spot in order to directly define the kc it was also shown that the grvi can be used to distinguish a plant s phenological stages in fact detecting early season and senescence is easy with grvi a grvi lower than 0 indicates low plant s vigor whereas a grvi greater than zero indicates strong plant vigor corresponding to the mid season plant phenological stage figs 2 4 it was also concluded that the grvi is better than the ndvi and gndvi in detecting subtle disturbances in mid season fig 6 high resolution rgb imaging can be utilized to monitor the uniformity of irrigation water application and to detect heterogeneity in field irrigation fig 5 since both the camera and the uav used in this research are inexpensive and available and the current auto pilot uav guiding technologies ease the use of uavs the presented tools

11114,climate change and recurring mid season dry spells have resulted in perennial droughts and poor yields in most smallholder farming areas located in marginal arid to semi arid lands asal of zimbabwe where they are dependent on rainwater for agricultural crop production one approach that can be used to adapt to changing climatic pattern is in field water harvesting this study evaluated the soil profile water content and maize yields of 3 infield water harvesting technologies namely infiltration pits if fanya juus fj and contour ridges with cross ties crct in comparison to standard contour ridges sc the three systems are currently the focus of extension recommendations for water conservation in semi arid regions of the country soil water content was measured on a regular basis using gravimetric methods at locations upslope and down slope of each structure the average volumetric water content was signifcantly different between treatments and it varied with increasing distance from the water harvesting structures the average profile soil moisture content over the three seasons were 8 3 8 2 8 1 and 7 8 for crct fj if and sc repectively crct fj and if retained more water for a greater distance from the harvesting structures compared to the sc maize yields were significantly higher in the water harvesting technologies compared to sc maize yields were 1196 1164 1250 and 749 kg ha 1 for crct fj if and sc respectively there as a good correlation between water content and maize yields r2 0 80 it was concluded that improved water harvesting structures when compared to sc have the potential to increase maize yields in areas with water shortages hence they can be a useful strategy for climate change adaptation keywords water conservation dry land cropping margional lands droughts 1 introduction in zimbabwe climate variability has affected marginal areas most as these areas generally receive low rainfall arid to semi arid lands asal are more vulnerable to climate variability because in most cases the rainfall is not adequate to sustain dry land crop production in addition asal also have the least reliable rainfall distribution department of meterological services 1981 bratton 1987 and there has been an increase in the average duration of intra seasonal dry spells new et al 2006 freqent droughts and mid season dry spells that are common in most semi arid regions often results in severe droughts and widespread food shortages nyamadzawo et al 2013 and the most severe impacts are felt among the smallholder farmers about 70 of southern africa estimated to be semi arid and the rainfall is erratic climate change predictions suggest southern africa will get drier and food insecurity is projected to increase as models predict 20 35 decreases in maize yields by 2030 lobell et al 2008 new et al 2006 decreasing rainfall will worsen further the food security situation as most of the agricultural systems of southern africa are predominantly rain fed with little to no irrigation backup in place camberlin et al 2009 the faostat estimates puts the area under irrigation in malawi at less than 3 of the country while in zimbabwe it is less than 5 of the country only 11 13000 ha ha of the total irrigated land in zimbabwe is found in the small scale irrigation sector fao 2000 and of this only 6000 ha are currently in use whilst the remainder 7000 ha require major rehabilitation in addition putting up irrigation infrastructure has proven to be costly to make an impact on rural households food security for most resource constrained countries nyamadzawo et al 2013 hence there is need for efforts to develop climate smart rain fed agriculture practices that can reduce the vulnerability of smallholder farmers who are found mostly in semi arid regions the use of in field water harvesting represents such an opportunity of increasing crop production under rain fed agriculture systems in the face of the current climate change phenomenon a hypothetical model by nyagumbo et al 2009 suggest that besides using improved seed varieties and organic and inorganic fertilizers yields in the smallholder farming areas can be increased through the use of low cost water harvesting technologies fig 1 in situ rain water harvesting involves the use of methods that increase the amount of water stored in the soil profile by trapping or holding the rain when it falls and it involves small movements of rainwater as surface runoff in order to concentrate the water where it is required unep 1997 ngigi et al 2005 and jebamalar and ravikumar 2011 suggested that rain water harvesting involves the collection storage and subsequent use of rainwater for domestic agricultural and other livelihood activities where and when it falls though rainwater harvesting is a very old practice dating back to 4500 bce in the middle east and india it has received little attention since the modernisation of agriculture sivanappan 1997 rockström 2002 siwi 2001 with improved in field water harvesting harvested rainfall stored infield can possibly sustain crop production during the mid season dry spells and it can be considered as a supplemental water source jebamalar and ravikumar 2011 in addition rain water harvesting may also be considered as a key adaptation strategy to the impacts of climate change and variability barron et al 2011 potential water harvesting techniques include the use of fanya juus fj infiltration pits ip and contour ridges with cross ties crct these alternative methods of water conservation harvesting are prefered to the standard contour ridges which were designed to safely dispose of run off elwell and stocking 1988 instead of retaining it the alternative water harvesting techniques came after the realisation that most of the rainfall received in asal is lost as runoff and very little water is harvested for plant growth or future use and losses of 50 of received rainfall have been reported nyamadzawo et al 2012 high levels of runoff losses do not only limit water availability but are also an erosion hazard as the runoff can cause nutrient loss elwell and stocking 1988 these alternative in field water harvetsing techniques can benefit farmers through i increased run off retention thereby improving water availability to crops and ii reduced soil erosion through reducing water flow velocities and iii increased groundwater recharge through reduced run off to natural water courses however the benefit usig crct fj and if on soil water content and mazie yields of these structures has not been scientifically evaluated and quantified other than qualitative and positive indications from practising farmers therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate the water conservation merits of usig crct fj and if on profile water content and mazie yields in shurungwi smallholder farming area of zimbabwe this study further explored factors driving or hindering the use of these water harvesting techniques by farmers in asal of shurugwi 2 materials and methods 2 1 soils of water harvesting experimental sites in shurugwi communal lands the study site was located in ward 5 shurugwi district midlands province about 70 km south east of gweru city the study sites were located 19 59 s and between 30 16 e and 30 18 e 2 2 climate and vegetation the experimental sites were located in zimbabwe s agro ecological zone iv where semi extensive farming is practiced besides experiencing low total rainfall 450 650 mm which is received between november and may fig 2 analysis of rainfall data for the study area showed that the three seasons when we carried out the study were within range of normal seasons this region is subjected to seasonal droughts and severe dry spells during the rainy season highest temperatures of 38 c are recorded in october while minimum temperatures below 0 c are recorded in june main crops grown in this area are maize and groundnuts most of the natural vegetation has been cleared for agricultural purposes however parinari curatellifolia piliostigma thonninii ficus sp azanza garckeana and strychnos sp trees were dominant along contour ridges some re growths of dichrostachys cinerea and terminalia sericea were mainly found on abandoned fields or uncultivated land exotic trees such as eucalyptus spp were also found close to homesteads and some uncultivated land 2 3 geology and soils the area consists mainly of coarse textured soils aerosols which are derived from granitic parent material generally the soils in this area are moderately shallow to shallow 40 100 cm sands a common feature of the soils is a stone line consisting mainly of sub rounded and rounded quartz stones which overlies coarse grained soft weathering granitic parent material permeability of the soil is good to rapid throughout the whole profiles these soils are well drained on crest and upper slope positions however the soils become moderately well drained to moderately poorly drained towards lower slope positions these soils have high exchangeable potassium k and sodium na and this is attributed to the granitic parent material a summary of selected soil properties for the study sites are shown in table 1 2 4 experimental layout three farm sites each measuring at least 2 5 ha ha with a uniform average slope of 2 to 4 were selected the sites were mukandabvute takara and kuchicha villages the experiment was carried out for three seasons from 2004 2007 season 1 was called the 2004 2005 season 2 was the 2005 2006 and season 3 was from 2006 2007 a detailed site characterization was conducted in june 2005 to identify and describe the nature of soils existing at each experimental site morphological properties of the soil such as depth texture were assessed from pits dug in the experimental fields some chemical properties such as ph c n cec among others were determined in the laboratory on soil samples taken from identified horizons of representative soil profiles table 1 at each of the three sites the fields were divded according to catena positions upslope mid slope and lowerslope at each catena position three soil and water conservation treatments which were 1 fanya juu 2 infiltration pit 3 cross tied graded contour ridge were evaluated and standard contour ridge which was the 4th treatment was used as the control plots of 15 10 m in size were used a completely randomised block design was employed and all the treatments were replicated three times the plots were planted to

ridge the standard contour ridge is found throughout zimbabwe and was enforced through the native land husbandry act of 1951 stockings 1978 this act enforced the construction of contour ridges throughout the smallholder farming areas and enforced conservation and good farming practices with serious penalties for offenders the standard contour ridges were constructed in a grade of 1 250 for a purpose of disposing off runoff water that caused soil erosion spacing varies depending on slope and soil type the standard dimensions for a standard contour is 1 7 m for the channel and 1 7 m for the ridge dreyer 1997 the standard contour ridge takes away about 15 of the total arable area out of production and this was not popular with smallholder farmers dreyer 1997 it takes about 30 man days to construct contour ridges on 1 ha of land with an average slope as used in this study 2 4 however if the land is steep contour ridges will be closer it may take even more time in zimbabwe because contour ridges were constructed in the 1950s what is currently required is to repair them thus reducing the labour needs by between 50 and 70 crct are a modification of the standard contour that was enforced in the 1950s cross ties are placed in the channel to reduce water flow velocity out of the channel to improve moisture conservation cross ties are placed at 10 m intervals depending on the main slope of the area and the expected runoff dreyer 1997 cross ties create a damming effect thus converting standard contours from being water disposing structure to water holding structures it is relatively less costly to create cross tied on already existing contour structures labour requirements could be lower than that of infiltration pits hence they could a cheaper option provided their water retention ability proves equally effective infiltration pits are large are trenches dug along the contour ridge to trap run off and increase infiltration and to hold water as it flows this technique originated in zimbabwe from a farmer called mr zephenia phiri in zvishavane maseko 1995 they are suitable for semi arid regions and can be applied easily on land already with standard contours the infiltration pits reduce runoff substantially conserve moisture and can also be used for in situ composting since the pits are placed along the contours and crop residues can accumulate in the pits from the fields above and below critchley 1991 hagmann 1994 it is also less costly to make infiltration pits on already existing contour ridges though they also require regular maintenance in terms of scooping out deposited soil there are variation in dimension of infiltration pits as no quantitative research data is available on the performance of the structures therefore no design specifications based on research are available the most common are 1 1 1 m in dimension and are placed after every 10 m along the contour channel fanya juus originated in kenya and their construction involves throwing soil excavation from the drainage channel to the side of the channel fanya juus have been widely used in ethiopia tanzania and rwanda critchley 1991 hagmann 1994 the fanya juu retain water rather than dispose of it thereby improving moisture conditions down slope excess water is discharged slowly and contains very little sediments less land is taken away from production compared to standard contour ridges the channel occupies approximately 1 1 5 m compared to the standard contour ridges which take up to 3 m therefore the fanya juu only takes about 7 land out of production while the standard contour takes about 15 dreyer 1997 the channel depth is usually 50 60 cm with cross ties at 10 m intervals the channel can be graded pegged at a specified gradient graded fanya juu or on a dead level contour zero gradient level fanya juu depending on how dry the region is and the water retention requirement their labour requirement depends on slopes time of the year and rockiness of the area 2 6 routine measurements each site had 4 water harvesting treatments which were replicated 3 times the analysed variables included soil profile water content and crop grain yield data maize was planted 0 5 m from the water harvesting structures on both upslope and downslope positions soil profile water content was measured using a gravimetric method soil samples were collected from 1 m upslope and at 1 2 and 6 m downslope of each structure soil water content was measured from soil samples collected from the 0 15 and 15 30 cm depths at least once every month during the growing season rainfall was measured at each site using standard raingauges crop yields were assessed on both downslope and upslope of each water conservation structure yield mesurements were

content and yields were analysed using analysis of variance anova data analysis was carried out using combined analysis of variance across site using genstat statistical package snv 2011 3 results 3 1 soil and profile moisture content soil profile moisture contents were controlled by rainfall events average rainfall for the 3 sites were 500 mm per annum fig 1 the rainfall varied with season but was not significantly different among sites the soils at the study sites were sandy and derived from granitic parent material the soils had an effective depth that was 70 cm soil moisture content was significantly different among treatments and varied significantly between season years over the three cropping seasons there was no significant treatment differences in soil moisture among sites and depths volumetric water content did not vary with depth and was 5 3 for the 0 15 cm depth compared to 5 4 for the 15 30 cm depth however the average soil profile moisture and profile moisture contents was signficantly different among treatments table 2 the corresponding profile mositure content was also not significantly different between depths and was 8 0 for the 0 15 cm depthand 8 2 for the 15 30 cm depth throughout the cropping season improved water harvesting technologies maintained higher moisture content compared to the sc and this was more apparent during the dry spells that occurred in february and march when crops were silking and grain filling 3 2 slope position there were significant differences in volumetric water content for treatments which were located upslope middle slope and lower slope the average soil moisture content across treatments were 5 1 5 3 and 5 3 for upslope middle slope and lower slope respectively for the different treatments the upslope had lower moisture content table 3 there were also no significant slope depth interactions that were shown however among the improved water harvesting techniques crct had the highest soil moisture content 3 3 effects of distance from the water harvesting structure soil moisture content was highest closer to the water harvesting structure and decreased with increasing distance from the structures average mositure content were significantly higher in 1 m from the water harvesteing structure compared to the 2 m and 6 m however soil moisture at 2 m from the water harvesting structure were not significantly higher than the 6 m the volumetric water varied with depth and also with distance from the water harvesting structures table 4 the volumetric moisture content for the 0 15 and 15 30 cm depths were comparable the volumetric moisture content and profile moisture content did not vary with depth for different treatments table 4 however the volumetric water content varied with increasing distance from the water harvesting structures and soil moisture was significantly higher 1 m from the water harvesting structure compared to 2 and 6 m from the water harvesting structure however as distanc from the structures increased to 6 m there were no significant differences in both profile and volumetric water content table 5 volumetric and profile water content maintained significantly higher levels in the water harvesting structures compared to standard contours 3 4 effects of the different water harvest technologies on maize yields the average maize yield across sites and cropping seasons were 1156 1129 and 985 kg ha 1 for kuchicha mukandabvute and takarasima respectively the yields varied significantly with season and were lowest in the 2004 5 season across all farmers fig 2 during the 2004 05 and 2005 06 cropping season the highest maize yields were at mukandabvute and least at kuchicha however kuchicha had the highest maize yields during the 2006 07 fig 2 the average maize yield varied signifcantly with water harvesting technology and were 1196 1164 1250 and 749 kg ha 1 for crct fj if and sc respectively fig 3 improved water harvesting technologies had significantly higher yields compared to sc fig 3 however there were no significant differences in maize yields among the improved water harvesting technologies crct fj and if across the three cropping seasons the 2004 2005 season had the lowest maize yields maize yields during the 2004 2005 season were not significantly different between treatments sites in 2005 2006 and 2006 2007 the improved water harvesting technologies had higher maize yields compared to sc in 2005 2006 mukandabvute had higher yields compared to the other improved water harvesting technologies in 2006 2007 kuchicha had the highest maize yields compared to the other sites and the crct water harvesting technology had the highest yields though it was not significantly different from if fig 4 maize yields varied significantly between slope positions and were higher in the lower slope compared to the middle and upper slope which were not significantly different however there were significant differences in maize yields between improved water harvesting technologies crct fj and if and sc fig 5 maize yields for the improved water harvesting structures were signifcantly higher than the sc at different distances from the water harvesting structures maize yields did not vary significantly with distance from the improved water harvesting structures except for fj were there was a decrease in yields as the distance increased however among the improved water harvesting structures maize yields were significantly lower for the crct compared to the fj and if at 1 m upslope and at 2 and 6 m downslope there as a good correlation between water content and maize yields r2 0 80 and this suggested that soil moisture played a very significant role in determining maize yields fig 6 4 discussions in zimbabwe there is high variability in rainfall from region to region and from year to year only 37 of the country receives adequate rainfall for rain fed agriculture while rainfall is insufficient erratic and unreliable for the rest of the country in zimbabwe rainfall exhibits high degree of inter annual variability and several droughts have been recorded from 1959 to 2002 during this period zimbabwe has experienced 15 droughts occurring on average every 2 to 3 years world bank 2009 to worsen the situation the recent climate change phenomenon has resulted in increased temperatures and a further decrease in rainfall in the dry areas natural regions iv and v of zimbabwe mugandani et al 2012 such as the south east and southern part of the country where models have predicted decrease in agricultural productivity and maize yields of between 15 and 35 by 2030 cline 2007 ipcc et al 2007 lobell et al 2008 new et al 2006 the risk and vulnerability of most smallholder farmers is increased because most of the agricultural systems in zimbabwe are predominantly rain fed camberlin et al 2009 fao 2000 hence these challenges that are associated with climate change signal an urgent need for modified farming systems to allow smallholder farmers to adapt to changing climate examples of modified farming systems include the use of rain water harvesting to supplement rain fed smallholder farming systems in asal which are characterized by frequent droughts the use of crct fj and if represents innovative and sustainable climate change adaptation strategy than can be used in semi arid regions to improve dry land crop production contours ridges are found in all fields throughout the semi arid regions of zimbabwe and they dispose off the little rainfall which is the principal water resource for agriculture from the fields nyamadzawo et al 2013 most of the rainfall received in semi arid regions is lost as runoff with none to very little being harvested in field so that it can be used for future plant growth the modified tied contours systems retains water in field which can sustains crop production even during dry spells dreyer 1997 nyamadzawo et al 2015 and this can reduce crop failures and may ultimately lead to improved household food security compared to standard contours in semi arid regions such as chivi in masvingo water harvesting technologies such as infiltration pits have been widely adopted hagmann 1994 maseko 1995 mutekwa et al 2005 2006 these studies suggest that in field water harvesting improves water use efficiency and is a potential climatic change adaptation strategy in semi arid regions hence the optimization of the rainfall management through water harvesting is sustainable and when integrated with the use of improved hybrid seeds and inorganic and inorganic manures there is a potential for improved rain fed agricultural production ibraimo and munguambe 2007 nyagumbo et al 2009 improved water harvesting technologies resulted in higher soil moisture contents than sc and similar results were also reported by mugabe 2004 munamati and nyagumbo 2010 and gumbo et al 2012 moisture content will increase as the water harvesting structure can hold water and give it ample time to infiltrate thus improving ground water recharge and ensuring enough water is stored in the soil profile for plant use although the average volumetric water contents between the improved water harvetsing structures and the sc was not so large tose small differences in soil water content are critical especially during importat stages of crop growth such as tillering and silking the volumetric moisture contents during the months of february and march when crops were silking and grain filling was significantly higher under improved water harvesting structures compared to the sc such small differences in moisture contents can result in significant differences in maize yields between improved water harvesting structures and sc soil moisture content however varied as distance from the water harvesting structure or contour ridge increased however there were no significant differences in moisture between in upslope and downslope positions though this study did not quantify soil moisture on the upslope of the structures we studied we expected that soil moisture content would be greater downslope as reported in studies by mugabe 2004 who reported that water harvesting structures replenished soil water on both upslope and downslope sides though the lower side had higher soil moisture content the strength of using water harvesting structure is that they retain water in field and the moisture spread to a greater distance from the water harvesting structures however the optimum distance where the maize would benefit from the moisture retained in the water harvesting structures was not very apparent a maximum of 6 m was evaluated maize yields were significantly different among water harvesting technologies when compared to sc similar studies reporting higher maize yield under improved water harvesting systems compared to sc were reported by gumbo et al 2012 and nyamadzawo et al 2015 this shows that there is a great potential to improved crop yields food security and livelihood among households using infield water harvesting however maize yields varied with study site and were comparable for kuchicha and mukandabvute which were significantly higher than takarasima variations in yields can be attributed to several factors among them differences in soil types inherent soil fertility management and variations in rainfall amounts and distribution between sites maize yields also varied with sloe positions and yield were signiificantly higher in the lower slope compared to the middle and up slope position this could be attributed to several factors among them higher soil moisture content and soil fertility as eroded soil is deposited downslope although in field water harvesting techniques are beneficial in semi to arid lands adoption by farmers has been poor because of several reason such as lack of knowledge high labour intensity for example ibraimo and munguambe 2007 estimated that the cost of making tie ridges was 33 higher than conventional land preparation using hand hoes hence there is need to increase extension activities to improve uptake of these technologies by farmers however the comparative advantage of contour based technologies such as crct and infiltration pits is that they require less labour because they utilize standard contour ridges that are already in place in zimbabwe in zimbabwe every field has a contour ridge as these were enforced as part of conservation measures of the land husbandry act of 1951 the same sentiments were also echoed by hagmann and murwira 1996 who reported that farmers in semi arid showed more interest in large semi permanent to permanent water harvesting structures as they save labour in the long term permanent water harvesting technologies like crct are likely to be well received by farmers and current extension effort should promote such technologies in asal currently few studies have been carried to evaluate the performance of structures such as if and crct as a result current recommendations for water harvesting technologies give blanket recommendations and do not consider inherent differences in soil water holding capacities soil depth and texture hence there is need to carry out research on site specific water harvesting technologies across a range of soils so that we can recommend the best technology for each soil type for this study the soils were mainly sandy and they had an effective depth that was 70 cm this effectively meant the less water can be stored in the soil hence there is need to retain and store as much water as possible 5 conclusions the use of improved infield water harvesting structures has a great potential to improve maize yields in asal improved water harvesting strategies improved water retention compared to sc which were designed to dispose off water the use of crct fj and if can be an important and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate change in asal as the maize yields were better than sc maize yields varied across treatments with season and with sites and this can be attributed to variation in soil types soil fertility farmer management and in rainfall amounts and distribution between sites however we could not asceratin with the best water harvesting technology from this study more work should be done to carry out site specific evaluation of these in field water harvesting technologies as they may not work across all soil types though contour based water harvesting structures are a among potential solutions chllenges of water shortages in the smallholder farming sector the major challenges in using these include labour shortages lack of technical knowhow and poor extension and research initiatives improved water harvesting structure are not a pancea to the challenges of climate change and should be integrated with other adaptation strategies such as early planting and drought tolarent varieties

11114,climate change and recurring mid season dry spells have resulted in perennial droughts and poor yields in most smallholder farming areas located in marginal arid to semi arid lands asal of zimbabwe where they are dependent on rainwater for agricultural crop production one approach that can be used to adapt to changing climatic pattern is in field water harvesting this study evaluated the soil profile water content and maize yields of 3 infield water harvesting technologies namely infiltration pits if fanya juus fj and contour ridges with cross ties crct in comparison to standard contour ridges sc the three systems are currently the focus of extension recommendations for water conservation in semi arid regions of the country soil water content was measured on a regular basis using gravimetric methods at locations upslope and down slope of each structure the average volumetric water content was signifcantly different between treatments and it varied with increasing distance from the water harvesting structures the average profile soil moisture content over the three seasons were 8 3 8 2 8 1 and 7 8 for crct fj if and sc repectively crct fj and if retained more water for a greater distance from the harvesting structures compared to the sc maize yields were significantly higher in the water harvesting technologies compared to sc maize yields were 1196 1164 1250 and 749 kg ha 1 for crct fj if and sc respectively there as a good correlation between water content and maize yields r2 0 80 it was concluded that improved water harvesting structures when compared to sc have the potential to increase maize yields in areas with water shortages hence they can be a useful strategy for climate change adaptation keywords water conservation dry land cropping margional lands droughts 1 introduction in zimbabwe climate variability has affected marginal areas most as these areas generally receive low rainfall arid to semi arid lands asal are more vulnerable to climate variability because in most cases the rainfall is not adequate to sustain dry land crop production in addition asal also have the least reliable rainfall distribution department of meterological services 1981 bratton 1987 and there has been an increase in the average duration of intra seasonal dry spells new et al 2006 freqent droughts and mid season dry spells that are common in most semi arid regions often results in severe droughts and widespread food shortages nyamadzawo et al 2013 and the most severe impacts are felt among the smallholder farmers about 70 of southern africa estimated to be semi arid and the rainfall is erratic climate change predictions suggest southern africa will get drier and food insecurity is projected to increase as models predict 20 35 decreases in maize yields by 2030 lobell et al 2008 new et al 2006 decreasing rainfall will worsen further the food security situation as most of the agricultural systems of southern africa are predominantly rain fed with little to no irrigation backup in place camberlin et al 2009 the faostat estimates puts the area under irrigation in malawi at less than 3 of the country while in zimbabwe it is less than 5 of the country only 11 13000 ha ha of the total irrigated land in zimbabwe is found in the small scale irrigation sector fao 2000 and of this only 6000 ha are currently in use whilst the remainder 7000 ha require major rehabilitation in addition putting up irrigation infrastructure has proven to be costly to make an impact on rural households food security for most resource constrained countries nyamadzawo et al 2013 hence there is need for efforts to develop climate smart rain fed agriculture practices that can reduce the vulnerability of smallholder farmers who are found mostly in semi arid regions the use of in field water harvesting represents such an opportunity of increasing crop production under rain fed agriculture systems in the face of the current climate change phenomenon a hypothetical model by nyagumbo et al 2009 suggest that besides using improved seed varieties and organic and inorganic fertilizers yields in the smallholder farming areas can be increased through the use of low cost water harvesting technologies fig 1 in situ rain water harvesting involves the use of methods that increase the amount of water stored in the soil profile by trapping or holding the rain when it falls and it involves small movements of rainwater as surface runoff in order to concentrate the water where it is required unep 1997 ngigi et al 2005 and jebamalar and ravikumar 2011 suggested that rain water harvesting involves the collection storage and subsequent use of rainwater for domestic agricultural and other livelihood activities where and when it falls though rainwater harvesting is a very old practice dating back to 4500 bce in the middle east and india it has received little attention since the modernisation of agriculture sivanappan 1997 rockström 2002 siwi 2001 with improved in field water harvesting harvested rainfall stored infield can possibly sustain crop production during the mid season dry spells and it can be considered as a supplemental water source jebamalar and ravikumar 2011 in addition rain water harvesting may also be considered as a key adaptation strategy to the impacts of climate change and variability barron et al 2011 potential water harvesting techniques include the use of fanya juus fj infiltration pits ip and contour ridges with cross ties crct these alternative methods of water conservation harvesting are prefered to the standard contour ridges which were designed to safely dispose of run off elwell and stocking 1988 instead of retaining it the alternative water harvesting techniques came after the realisation that most of the rainfall received in asal is lost as runoff and very little water is harvested for plant growth or future use and losses of 50 of received rainfall have been reported nyamadzawo et al 2012 high levels of runoff losses do not only limit water availability but are also an erosion hazard as the runoff can cause nutrient loss elwell and stocking 1988 these alternative in field water harvetsing techniques can benefit farmers through i increased run off retention thereby improving water availability to crops and ii reduced soil erosion through reducing water flow velocities and iii increased groundwater recharge through reduced run off to natural water courses however the benefit usig crct fj and if on soil water content and mazie yields of these structures has not been scientifically evaluated and quantified other than qualitative and positive indications from practising farmers therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate the water conservation merits of usig crct fj and if on profile water content and mazie yields in shurungwi smallholder farming area of zimbabwe this study further explored factors driving or hindering the use of these water harvesting techniques by farmers in asal of shurugwi 2 materials and methods 2 1 soils of water harvesting experimental sites in shurugwi communal lands the study site was located in ward 5 shurugwi district midlands province about 70 km south east of gweru city the study sites were located 19 59 s and between 30 16 e and 30 18 e 2 2 climate and vegetation the experimental sites were located in zimbabwe s agro ecological zone iv where semi extensive farming is practiced besides experiencing low total rainfall 450 650 mm which is received between november and may fig 2 analysis of rainfall data for the study area showed that the three seasons when we carried out the study were within range of normal seasons this region is subjected to seasonal droughts and severe dry spells during the rainy season highest temperatures of 38 c are recorded in october while minimum temperatures below 0 c are recorded in june main crops grown in this area are maize and groundnuts most of the natural vegetation has been cleared for agricultural purposes however parinari curatellifolia piliostigma thonninii ficus sp azanza garckeana and strychnos sp trees were dominant along contour ridges some re growths of dichrostachys cinerea and terminalia sericea were mainly found on abandoned fields or uncultivated land exotic trees such as eucalyptus spp were also found close to homesteads and some uncultivated land 2 3 geology and soils the area consists mainly of coarse textured soils aerosols which are derived from granitic parent material generally the soils in this area are moderately shallow to shallow 40 100 cm sands a common feature of the soils is a stone line consisting mainly of sub rounded and rounded quartz stones which overlies coarse grained soft weathering granitic parent material permeability of the soil is good to rapid throughout the whole profiles these soils are well drained on crest and upper slope positions however the soils become moderately well drained to moderately poorly drained towards lower slope positions these soils have high exchangeable potassium k and sodium na and this is attributed to the granitic parent material a summary of selected soil properties for the study sites are shown in table 1 2 4 experimental layout three farm sites each measuring at least 2 5 ha ha with a uniform average slope of 2 to 4 were selected the sites were mukandabvute takara and kuchicha villages the experiment was carried out for three seasons from 2004 2007 season 1 was called the 2004 2005 season 2 was the 2005 2006 and season 3 was from 2006 2007 a detailed site characterization was conducted in june 2005 to identify and describe the nature of soils existing at each experimental site morphological properties of the soil such as depth texture were assessed from pits dug in the experimental fields some chemical properties such as ph c n cec among others were determined in the laboratory on soil samples taken from identified horizons of representative soil profiles table 1 at each of the three sites the fields were divded according to catena positions upslope mid slope and lowerslope at each catena position three soil and water conservation treatments which were 1 fanya juu 2 infiltration pit 3 cross tied graded contour ridge were evaluated and standard contour ridge which was the 4th

distance from the water harvesting structures and soil moisture was significantly higher 1 m from the water harvesting structure compared to 2 and 6 m from the water harvesting structure however as distanc from the structures increased to 6 m there were no significant differences in both profile and volumetric water content table 5 volumetric and profile water content maintained significantly higher levels in the water harvesting structures compared to standard contours 3 4 effects of the different water harvest technologies on maize yields the average maize yield across sites and cropping seasons were 1156 1129 and 985 kg ha 1 for kuchicha mukandabvute and takarasima respectively the yields varied significantly with season and were lowest in the 2004 5 season across all farmers fig 2 during the 2004 05 and 2005 06 cropping season the highest maize yields were at mukandabvute and least at kuchicha however kuchicha had the highest maize yields during the 2006 07 fig 2 the average maize yield varied signifcantly with water harvesting technology and were 1196 1164 1250 and 749 kg ha 1 for crct fj if and sc respectively fig 3 improved water harvesting technologies had significantly higher yields compared to sc fig 3 however there were no significant differences in maize yields among the improved water harvesting technologies crct fj and if across the three cropping seasons the 2004 2005 season had the lowest maize yields maize yields during the 2004 2005 season were not significantly different between treatments sites in 2005 2006 and 2006 2007 the improved water harvesting technologies had higher maize yields compared to sc in 2005 2006 mukandabvute had higher yields compared to the other improved water harvesting technologies in 2006 2007 kuchicha had the highest maize yields compared to the other sites and the crct water harvesting technology had the highest yields though it was not significantly different from if fig 4 maize yields varied significantly between slope positions and were higher in the lower slope compared to the middle and upper slope which were not significantly different however there were significant differences in maize yields between improved water harvesting technologies crct fj and if and sc fig 5 maize yields for the improved water harvesting structures were signifcantly higher than the sc at different distances from the water harvesting structures maize yields did not vary significantly with distance from the improved water harvesting structures except for fj were there was a decrease in yields as the distance increased however among the improved water harvesting structures maize yields were significantly lower for the crct compared to the fj and if at 1 m upslope and at 2 and 6 m downslope there as a good correlation between water content and maize yields r2 0 80 and this suggested that soil moisture played a very significant role in determining maize yields fig 6 4 discussions in zimbabwe there is high variability in rainfall from region to region and from year to year only 37 of the country receives adequate rainfall for rain fed agriculture while rainfall is insufficient erratic and unreliable for the rest of the country in zimbabwe rainfall exhibits high degree of inter annual variability and several droughts have been recorded from 1959 to 2002 during this period zimbabwe has experienced 15 droughts occurring on average every 2 to 3 years world bank 2009 to worsen the situation the recent climate change phenomenon has resulted in increased temperatures and a further decrease in rainfall in the dry areas natural regions iv and v of zimbabwe mugandani et al 2012 such as the south east and southern part of the country where models have predicted decrease in agricultural productivity and maize yields of between 15 and 35 by 2030 cline 2007 ipcc et al 2007 lobell et al 2008 new et al 2006 the risk and vulnerability of most smallholder farmers is increased because most of the agricultural systems in zimbabwe are predominantly rain fed camberlin et al 2009 fao 2000 hence these challenges that are associated with climate change signal an urgent need for modified farming systems to allow smallholder farmers to adapt to changing climate examples of modified farming systems include the use of rain water harvesting to supplement rain fed smallholder farming systems in asal which are characterized by frequent droughts the use of crct fj and if represents innovative and sustainable climate change adaptation strategy than can be used in semi arid regions to improve dry land crop production contours ridges are found in all fields throughout the semi arid regions of zimbabwe and they dispose off the little rainfall which is the principal water resource for agriculture from the fields nyamadzawo et al 2013 most of the rainfall received in semi arid regions is lost as runoff with none to very little being harvested in field so that it can be used for future plant growth the modified tied contours systems retains water in field which can sustains crop production even during dry spells dreyer 1997 nyamadzawo et al 2015 and this can reduce crop failures and may ultimately lead to improved household food security compared to standard contours in semi arid regions such as chivi in masvingo water harvesting technologies such as infiltration pits have been widely adopted hagmann 1994 maseko 1995 mutekwa et al 2005 2006 these studies suggest that in field water harvesting improves water use efficiency and is a potential climatic change adaptation strategy in semi arid regions hence the optimization of the rainfall management through water harvesting is sustainable and when integrated with the use of improved hybrid seeds and inorganic and inorganic manures there is a potential for improved rain fed agricultural production ibraimo and munguambe 2007 nyagumbo et al 2009 improved water harvesting technologies resulted in higher soil moisture contents than sc and similar results were also reported by mugabe 2004 munamati and nyagumbo 2010 and gumbo et al 2012 moisture content will increase as the water harvesting structure can hold water and give it ample time to infiltrate thus improving ground water recharge and ensuring enough water is stored in the soil profile for plant use although the average volumetric water contents between the improved water harvetsing structures and the sc was not so large tose small differences in soil water content are critical especially during importat stages of crop growth such as tillering and silking the volumetric moisture contents during the months of february and march when crops were silking and grain filling was significantly higher under improved water harvesting structures compared to the sc such small differences in moisture contents can result in significant differences in maize yields between improved water harvesting structures and sc soil moisture content however varied as distance from the water harvesting structure or contour ridge increased however there were no significant differences in moisture between in upslope and downslope positions though this study did not quantify soil moisture on the upslope of the structures we studied we expected that soil moisture content would be greater downslope as reported in studies by mugabe 2004 who reported that water harvesting structures replenished soil water on both upslope and downslope sides though the lower side had higher soil moisture content the strength of using water harvesting structure is that they retain water in field and the moisture spread to a greater distance from the water harvesting structures however the optimum distance where the maize would benefit from the moisture retained in the water harvesting structures was not very apparent a maximum of 6 m was evaluated maize yields were significantly different among water harvesting technologies when compared to sc similar studies reporting higher maize yield under improved water harvesting systems compared to sc were reported by gumbo et al 2012 and nyamadzawo et al 2015 this shows that there is a great potential to improved crop yields food security and livelihood among households using infield water harvesting however maize yields varied with study site and were comparable for kuchicha and mukandabvute which were significantly higher than takarasima variations in yields can be attributed to several factors among them differences in soil types inherent soil fertility management and variations in rainfall amounts and distribution between sites maize yields also varied with sloe positions and yield were signiificantly higher in the lower slope compared to the middle and up slope position this could be attributed to several factors among them higher soil moisture content and soil fertility as eroded soil is deposited downslope although in field water harvesting techniques are beneficial in semi to arid lands adoption by farmers has been poor because of several reason such as lack of knowledge high labour intensity for example ibraimo and munguambe 2007 estimated that the cost of making tie ridges was 33 higher than conventional land preparation using hand hoes hence there is need to increase extension activities to improve uptake of these technologies by farmers however the comparative advantage of contour based technologies such as crct and infiltration pits is that they require less labour because they utilize standard contour ridges that are already in place in zimbabwe in zimbabwe every field has a contour ridge as these were enforced as part of conservation measures of the land husbandry act of 1951 the same sentiments were also echoed by hagmann and murwira 1996 who reported that farmers in semi arid showed more interest in large semi permanent to permanent water harvesting structures as they save labour in the long term permanent water harvesting technologies like crct are likely to be well received by farmers and current extension effort should promote such technologies in asal currently few studies have been carried to evaluate the performance of structures such as if and crct as a result current recommendations for water harvesting technologies give blanket recommendations and do not consider inherent differences in soil water holding capacities soil depth and texture hence there is need to carry out research on site specific water harvesting technologies across a range of soils so that we can recommend the best technology for each soil type for this study the soils were mainly sandy and they had an effective depth that was 70 cm this effectively meant the less water can be stored in the soil hence there is need to retain and store as much water as possible 5 conclusions the use of improved infield water harvesting structures has a great potential to improve maize yields in asal improved water harvesting strategies improved water retention compared to sc which were designed to dispose off water the use of crct fj and if can be an important and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate change in asal as the maize yields were better than sc maize yields varied across treatments with season and with sites and this can be attributed to variation in soil types soil fertility farmer management and in rainfall amounts and distribution between sites however we could not asceratin with the best water harvesting technology from this study more work should be done to carry out site specific evaluation of these in field water harvesting technologies as they may not work across all soil types though contour based water harvesting structures are a among potential solutions chllenges of water shortages in the smallholder farming sector the major challenges in using these include labour shortages lack of technical knowhow and poor extension and research initiatives improved water harvesting structure are not a pancea to the challenges of climate change and should be integrated with other adaptation strategies such as early planting and drought tolarent varieties
