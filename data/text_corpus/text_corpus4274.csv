21370,in this article we shed light on unresolved issues on the physics of the problem and clarify the effects of slope and other related parameters controlling the wave scattering phase shifting by sinusoidal seabed based on mathieu instability theorem as a starting point 3d water wave scattering by arbitrarily varying sea bottom is governed by 2d wave potential and wavenumber coupling equation using fredholm s alternative theorem seabed undulating effects are split into different components including wavenumber and bottom slope and curvature effects sinusoidal ripples are used to demonstrate these different seabed undulating effects the presented model predictions agree very well with lab data furthermore a method with quantitative formulations is constructed and proposed to elucidate the resonance mechanism of wave scattering by sinusoidal seabed using mathieu instability theorem general stability chart is generated in a relevant parametric plane to detect the unstable conditions quantitively formulations of resonance conditions are presented to predict peak shifting features that beyond the bragg s perdition as demonstrated in this work slope effect is contributed to peak shifting and the calculation formula of the shifting distance is given though the shifting in single sinusoidal case is small it is more obvious in double sinusoidal cases keywords wavenumber coupling model fredholm s alternative theorem fat sinusoidal seabed resonance scattering damped mathieu s equation mathieu instability mi 1 introduction the current investigation is motivated by new advance in wave scattering of sinusoidal seabed ripples liu et al 2019a reefs liu et al 2019a b c submerged breakwaters barbosa lópeza et al 2019 and sandy ripples tsai et al 2017 etc when surface waves match into a patches of bottom undulation the waves scattered by the seabed become in phase and are reinforced properly by the phase correlation which results in strong resonant reflection especially when the incident wave number is approximately 1 2 of the seabed wave number which is historically called the bragg resonance however as indicated in their paper there are many open questions about the bragg s law which is originally used in description of x ray reflection in crystallography therefore the aim of this paper is to study the wave resonant scattering by sinusoidal seabed according to mathieu theory by means of mathematical analysis in addition a general phase shifting calculation method is given for future research in this field the scattering of water wave by undulating seabed or floating structures is of wide practical importance in coastal and offshore engineering for instance resonance scattering caused by the patches of bottom undulations has been investigated extensively in the coastal engineering field most noticeably davies and heathershaw 1984 provided solutions to the linear problem and verified their solutions experimentally mei 1985 concentrated his studies on the process close to the primary resonance condition dalrymple and kirby 1986 studied a single sinusoidal bed for both resonant and non resonant cases using a boundary integral equation method and they dalrymple and kirby 1986 developed the equations to predict wave propagation over rapidly varying topography which is based on the concept of expanding the rapidly varying component on a very mild slope bottom the step approximation model guazzelli et al 1992 or the successive application matrix o hare and davies 1993 in which the bed is divided into a series of very small horizontal shelves have also been developed to model the wave scattering by the rippled bed resonance scattering mechanism is of great significance in the calculation of wave distribution on the ripples as demonstrated by mei 1985 davies et al 1989 belzons et al 1991 and others ardhuin and magne 2007 chang and liou 2007 liu et al 2015a b tang et al 2015 the physical phenomenon of resonant scattering is studied under the so called bragg scattering category for example multiple scales perturbation solution was employed to explain that strong reflection can be induced by the sandbars themselves once the bragg resonance condition is met mei 1985 davies and heathershaw 1984 and guazzelli et al 1992 have presented lab experiments indicating that relatively few bottom undulations with wavenumber equal to approximately twice the surface wavenumber moreover for a given number of ripples and a given ripple steepness the reflection coefficient increases due to both increasing ripple amplitude and decreasing depth on the basis of undamped mathieu equation davies et al 1989 have treated this problem of the reflection of shallow water waves by sinusoidal seabed obviously it is very different from this work since we are focusing on wave in intermediate water depth and using damped mathieu equation there are two distinct cases in water wave and varying seabed interaction namely resonant and non resonant scattering as showing in their paper classical theories are only accurate in one of these cases for instance mei s theory 1985 only valid in resonant case liu et al 2019b since both cases have important engineering applications for example former case is usually used in bottom barrier type breakwater design and later case is good at studying harbor wave distribution hsu et al 2003 cho et al 2004 jeon and cho 2006 liang et al 2015 the possible solution overcoming the drawbacks of theories mentioned above is application of mild slope type models as summarized by hsu et al 2006 also ardhuin and herbers 2002 have studied stochastic bragg scattering and presented a bottom slope effect along in the sinusoidal bar case recent applications by barbosa lópeza et al 2019 show that the radius of the generating circle of the cycloidal geometry has a strong influence on the magnitude of the reflection coefficient which is actually due to the seabed boundary curvature effect we will come to this curvature effect later however as far as we are aware under the bragg s law the phenomenon of bragg phase shifting the location of the resonant reflection peaks and the physical mechanism behind the phenomenon are still unclear liu et al 2015a b even using latest models so far furthermore linton 2010 has indicated that there are approximation errors of peak resonant reflection if using bragg s law also as indicated in tsai et al 2017 the shifting of 2 k k at resonance is greater affected by the bed slope than by other factors because a small phase shifting it will cause a huge change of the reflection coefficient if this issue is not solved in the actual engineering application it may lead to an uncertain prediction uneconomic design and great financial loss we will come back to the seabed slope effect later on the other hand mathieu instability mi is a powerful mathematical tool for a rigorous understanding of many engineering issues such as parametric excitation etc as offshore engineers zhang et al 2002 have observed unstable pitch motion of mathieu type instability in spar platform and tlp tendons where the pitch natural period is about twice that of the heave natural period it is found that damping plays an important role in suppressing mathieu instability in offshore structure dynamics many examples of waves may be excited by pr parametric resonance poulin et al 2003 koo et al 2004 other applications can be found in acoustic instabilities in flames sammarco et al 1997 in geophysical fluid dynamics poulin et al 2003 and pedlosky and thomson 2003 derived ordinary differential equations of the hill type to describe the stability of barotropic and baroclinic shear flows respectively recently yang and xu 2015 investigated the parametric instabilities of spar platforms in irregular waves and provided several suggestions to avoid the parametric pitch resonance in many related fields mi is also widely used in practical application in time domain however in this work time is changed to space of coupling equation in mathieu equation so the corresponding amplitude of oscillation is the magnitude of the velocity potential the properties of φ can be analyzed by mi the aims of this work are trying to shed some light on two issues using mi and two possible contributions will be accomplished one is that the inner mechanism of primary peak phase shifting towards low frequency is given using mi in the bragg resonance phenomenon therefore for a certain case the primary peak phase shifting distance can also be calculated another is the inner mechanism of the variation of the magnitude of the primary peak of resonance reflection this paper will discuss and explain these two contributions rippled seabed is used to represent both regular and irregular ocean bottoms in principle any arbitrarily varying seabed barrier can be decomposed into fourier sum of sinusoidal components thus this work is focus on sinusoidal seabed subsequently newly derived model is validated by comparing with published lab data as discussed in the following section in detail coupling equation which contains the nonlinear relation of wave number caused by seabed slope and curvature change and is embodied in the square terms of sea bottom topographic slope and sea bottom topographic curvature terms can be recast into the standard damped mathieu s equation zhang et al 2002 general stability charts are generated from standard damped mathieu equation above in a relevant parametric plane to detect unstable conditions and then by combining the two theories the inner mechanism of resonance scattering can be explained not only in shallow water but also in intermediate water depth 2 formulation and validation 2 1 formulation although the starting point for this work could have been from the governing equation from zhang and edge 1998 there are benefits to deriving the new equations afresh in this paper as mentioned above most classical theories have different accuracy in different frequency ranges for instance mei s theory mei 1985 only valid in the vicinity of resonance kirby s model cannot predict the subharmonic resonance liu et al 2019a etc therefore we start from 3d laplace equation accordingly the 2d model is established next in which wave potential and wave number are coupled explicitly in eq 1 in particular the governing equation of wave field can be obtained by applying fredholm s alternative theorem fat friedman 1956 and detailed description can be found in ge et al 2020 which is briefly summarized in this section assuming plane wave and removing the time dependence we have the wave number and potential coupled equation for the steady waves as follows 1 p φ k 2 p g f φ 0 where 2 f g 1 σ 2 q σ 2 σ k h 2 1 2 q σ 1 σ 2 2 h 1 σ 2 2 q σ 2 5 σ 2 q 2 h h k 1 4 k 3 q 1 σ 2 4 q 2 σ 2 4 3 q 2 2 q σ 1 σ k 2 1 4 k 2 q 1 σ 2 1 2 q σ σ 2 k 3 p g σ 1 σ 2 q 2 k where water depth variable h is the local water depth and is expressed as the function of x and y i e h x y g is the gravitational acceleration and k x y is the wave number for simplification of derivation σ t a n h q is used where q k h is the product of wave number and water depth h 2 represents the square term of the slope of the seabed 2 h represents seabed topography curvature term k 2 represents the square term of the slope of the water wave number 2 k represents water wave number curvature term 2 2 model verification in two dimensions in this part of the article experimental data from davies and heathershaw 1984 are selected to validated the present model assuming that sea bottom has sinusoidal profile we choose a stationary surface for x0y coordinate plane above mean seabed h 0 and the z coordinate is vertically upwards in the cartesian coordinate system thus the single sinusoidal seabed is descripted by the following functions 4 h h 0 x 0 h 0 b s i n k x 0 x 2 π n k h 0 x 2 π n k in the two dimensional coordinate system the coupling eq 1 becomes 5 φ x x p x p φ x k 2 p g f φ 0 6 f g 1 σ 2 q σ 2 σ k h x 2 1 2 q σ 1 σ 2 h x x 1 σ 2 2 q σ 2 5 2 q σ 1 2 q h h x k x 1 4 k 3 q 1 σ 2 4 q 2 σ 2 4 3 q 2 2 q σ 1 σ k x 2 1 4 k 2 q 1 σ 2 1 2 q σ σ k x x the new coupling equation for surface waves propagating over generally varying seabed is derived for the case of the bottom having only one sinusoidal component there are two resonant peaks of reflection coefficients which were shown numerically by dalrymple and kirby 1986 by solving the 2 d laplace equation later it was confirmed by davies et al 1989 and o hare and davies 1993 considering the same cases of their papers the single sinusoidal seabed parameters are listed in table 1 the three cases selected from davies and heathershaw 1984 here are all linear waves according to zou et al 2017 the effect of surface wave nonlinearity is far less than that of varying bottom in the case of linear waves the numerical results of the present model are presented in fig 1 a c which show that the simulated results of the single sinusoidal seabed agree with the experimental values very well also prediction of the primary and sub harmonic resonance peaks is very reasonable as can be seen from fig 1 the primary peak appears at a place where 2 k k is close to 1 table 2 shows the location of the primary peak in the three cases and the corresponding maximum reflection coefficient as well as the correlation coefficient between the numerical solution of present model and the experimental value davies and heathershaw 1984 firstly it can be seen that when number of fluctuations increases the larger the correlation coefficient between the numerical solution of this model and the experimental value is the better the fitting effect is in actual engineering seabed bottom is undulating and any form of seabed can be expressed in the form of fourier series through the above analysis and comparison it also means that the present model is more suitable for the actual situation of undulating seabed moreover the mean water depth of case a is the same as that of case b when the number of ripples increases the phase of the primary peak is the same and the reflection coefficient increases comparing case c and case b the reflection coefficient of the primary peak did not increase with the increase of mean water depth and ripples number but the phase of the primary peak changed therefore the factors that determine the magnitude of the primary peak reflection coefficient and the phase of the primary peak are complicated then we will use the mathieu s equation to predict the phase and the magnitude of the reflection coefficient of the primary peak table 3 shows the phase of the primary peaks between this numerical model using wave number and potential coupling equation and analytical solution using modified mild slope equation liu et al 2019a under different b h 0 conditions when the number of ripples is 4 when the profile of the seabed remains unchanged the phase of the primary peak gradually becomes stable with the increase of water depth seabed undulating effects are split into different components including wavenumber and bottom slope and curvature effects in summary for sinusoidal beds the numerical results of the present model are all in good agreement with the experimental data of davies and heathershaw 1984 the success of the model and agreement with experimental data suggest that this model is an efficient and accurate tool for the prediction of wave transformation over general varying seabed including sinusoidal seabed of course thus the important application of this wavenumber coupling equation in sinusoidal seabed case will be shown in the remaining part of this paper 3 wave resonant scattering vs mathieu instability coupling equation in above section will be recast into the general damped mathieu s equation then the slope and curvature effects will be analyzed separately in this section the properties of damped mathieu s equation can be used to explain why there are primary and secondary peaks in wave scattering by sinusoidal seabed as shown in fig a1 a2 friction term is largely ineffective in the first region compared to other regions according to zhang et al 2002 high order regions first region excepted of instability are more sensitive to the damping than low order one first region indeed the positions of the several peaks can be accurately predicted by the properties of damped mathieu s equation which not only means that the influence of phase shift of the primary peak can be accurately predicted but also other peaks can be skillfully identified for engineering applications 3 1 seabed curvature effect as indicated in zhang and edge 1998 even for very small seabed slopes the curvature effects may not be very small for some wave components so first we mainly consider the seabed curvature terms in the two dimensional coordinate system by neglecting slope square terms in governing equation as can be seen from figs 2 3 the solutions ignoring the slope term and not ignoring the slope term have little difference in the position of the primary peak figs 2 3 show the relationship between the wave reflection coefficient and 2 k k of the present model where the solid blue line represents the numerical solution of the wave number and velocity potential coupling equation including all terms seabed slope square terms and curvature terms the red solid point represents the numerical solution of the wave number and velocity potential coupling equation containing the seabed curvature terms only fig 2 a1 a6 show the trend of wave reflection coefficient with respect to b h 0 0 56 0 48 0 4 0 32 0 24 0 16 when the number of ripples n 4 fig 3 b1 b6 show the trend of the wave reflection coefficient with respect to b h 0 0 56 0 48 0 4 0 32 0 24 0 16 when the number of ripples n 10 as can be seen from figs 2 3 when b h 0 decreases the reflection coefficient of the corresponding case also decreases near the primary peak the coupling equation with all terms only curvature terms basically fit but in fact the phase of the primary peak is slightly off the inner mechanism of movement is given in section 3 2 of course it can also be observed that in the vicinity of the secondary peak the deviation between the two is large and the reason will be given in section 3 2 in addition when comparing a1 a6 in fig 2 and b1 b6 in fig 3 respectively it can be found that when b h 0 remains unchanged the larger the number of ripples n 4 is the larger the reflection coefficient will be the intrinsic mechanism of the variation of the reflection coefficient with the number of ripples is also given in section 3 3 in this paper the change of wave number comes from the change of water depth under the ideal condition of single sinusoidal topography the equation can be recovered from the coupling equation zhang and edge 1998 by using the relation of the wave number slope and curvature with those of bottom which are obtained from 7 k x k τ 1 h x h 8 k x x k τ 1 h x x h τ 2 h x 2 h 2 9 τ 1 q 1 σ 2 γ 10 τ 2 2 q 2 1 σ 2 γ α γ 2 11 α σ q 1 σ 2 2 12 γ σ q 1 σ 2 as described in the previous section the change of wave number comes from the change of water depth under the ideal condition of single sinusoidal sea bottom when eqs 6 12 is substituted into eq 5 we can get the governing equation 13 φ x x p x p φ x k 2 g ρ h x x p φ 0 where ρ is a parameter consisting of q and σ 14 ρ σ σ 3 q σ 4 q 4 σ q σ 2 q and 15 h x x k 2 b c o s k x let t k x then eq 13 can be transformed into following damped mathieu s equation 16 φ t t p t p φ t k 2 k 2 g ρ b p c o s t φ 0 wave reflection coefficients versus 2 k k for water wave propagating over single sinusoidal seabed with two different high order terms of the coupling equation are plotted in figs 2 3 the bed form is same as fig 1 after eq 5 is converted to eq 16 by inspecting eq 16 we get three parameters in mathieu s equation defined in the appendix as follows 17 a k 2 k 2 18 b g ρ b p k 2 19 c p t p zeros can be found by specifying a and searching for the corresponding b which gives a result sufficiently close to zero in fig a1 moreover convergence is rapid enough to produce the data for to decimals in a very short time by transforming the coupling equation into the standard form of dampeded mathieu s equation in the first and second zones in fig a2 the white zone is the stable zone and the blue zone is the unstable zone corresponding to the coupling equation the phase with the largest reflection coefficient can be obtained from fig a3 in appendix and eq 16 if b is close to a axis we can observe 20 a k 2 k 2 0 25 0 1 the two values correspond to the two primary peaks of figs 2 3 respectively in this way we can explain the primary and secondary peaks of resonance reflection based on damped mathieu s theory as can be seen from figs 2 3 the numerical results of the coupling equation considering all terms and only considering the curvature term are almost identical and the most obvious difference is in the phase of the secondary primary peak in fact the phase of the above two is slightly deviated parameters a b and c were selected from the unstable regions of 1st and 2nd of fig a2 respectively and their solutions were shown in fig a4 and a6 it can be observed that when t remains unchanged the oscillation amplitude of the corresponding solution x t in 1st zone is greater than that in 2nd region after the coupling equation is converted into the form of dampeded mathieu equation it can be obtained from eq 16 that 2 k k 1 and 2 correspond to the phases of the primary peak and the secondary peak respectively it also indicates that the amplitude of φ in the first region is larger than that in the second region because of the unstable strength difference so that the reflection coefficient of the primary peak is higher than that of the secondary peak 3 2 mechanism of phase shifting in the previous section in the case of single sinusoidal patch the phase shift is not very obvious since the slope term considered is comparable small as massel 1993 has shown that the typical bed slope in single patch case is 0 314 thus the slope square terms are of the order of 0 09 in the coupling equation in contrast the curvature terms are of the order of 1 97 liu et al 2015a b 2019b have also shown that the peak bragg reflection shifts a little bit toward lower frequency rather than occurs exactly at 2 k k as predicted by bragg s law in their 1st case liu et al 2015a b wave propagation is only affected by topographic slope not by topographic curvature since there are no curvature in their seabed profile h x x 0 in contrast to above mentioned resonance peak at 2 k k the resonance band concept is proposed in this paper based on mathieu instability diagram the diagram has a axis and b axis showing that if the parametric point a b lies in the crosshatched regions also called unstable zones the solutions are unbounded i e instability occurs thus wave scattering becomes resonant due to unbound solutions if a line of b b 0 drawing parallelly with a axis it will crossing with crosshatched regions in each unstable zone for instance in 1st unstable zone there are two points a 1 b 0 and a 2 b 0 between these two points bandwidth is defined and the resonance band is formed because wave scattering resonance will be excited if controlling parameters enter this band between a 1 b 0 and a 2 b 0 therefore the positions of the resonant peaks are not at exact positions predicted by bragg s law next the effects of these controlling parameters will be analyzed the effect of seabed slope will be looked at first as ma et al 2017 and dong et al 2014 indicated that slope influence on the parameterization cannot be ignored when slope β 1 30 when eqs 6 12 is substituted into eq 5 and when only considering the seabed slope terms 21 φ x x p x p φ x k 2 g ρ 1 k p h x 2 φ 0 where ρ 1 is a parameter consisting of q and σ 22 ρ 1 9 σ 2 1 σ 4 6 σ 1 3 σ 2 5 σ 4 3 σ 6 q 3 1 σ 2 1 σ 2 2 1 2 σ 2 3 σ 4 q 2 8 σ 1 σ 2 3 q 3 2 1 σ 2 4 q 4 12 σ q σ 2 q 3 and 23 h x b k s i n k x let t 1 2 k x we can get the following formula 24 φ t 1 t 1 p t 1 p φ t 1 k 2 4 k 2 g ρ 1 k b 2 s i n 2 1 2 t 1 4 p φ 0 with a simple transformation above equation becomes 25 φ t 1 t 1 p t 1 p φ t 1 k 2 4 k 2 g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p c o s t 1 φ 0 after eq 5 is converted to eq 25 we get 26 a k 2 4 k 2 g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p 27 b g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p 28 c p t 1 p from fig a1 in appendix and eq 25 if b is close to a axis we can observe 29 a k 2 4 k 2 g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p 0 25 1 0 2 25 4 0 will be resonance peaks further transformation of eq 29 shows that 2 k k is approximately 2 4 6 8 so the influence of slope is only concentrated at the secondary peak by comparing with bagg s law these peaks will shifted amount of g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p when considering the effect of topographic slope on wave propagation it can be observed that the phase of the bragg peaks will be shifted the amount of g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p from this perspective we can explain why the phase shift occurs when predict the phase of the primary peak as well as other peaks based on mathieu s instability theory during resonance reflection certain frequency shift will be generated due to slope effect the phase offset is determined by g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p which is function of water depth h amplitude of ripples and wave number it is worth noting that the phase shift is independent of the number of ripples because the effect of slope and value g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p are small in the single sinusoidal patch case the phase shifting is not obvious as shown in figs 2 3 however in general cases the phase shift may not be ignored for instance in the case of double sinusoidal patch guazzelli et al 1992 have shown phase shifting in their lab data for example the phase shifting of the primary peak is very obvious because the second sinusoidal component is steeper than the first in single patch one indeed it is clear that slope terms will affect the phase shift although its influence may not be of significant in single sinusoidal patch case therefore next we will focus on the double sinusoidal patch case as can be seen from figs 2 3 the numerical results of the coupling equation considering all terms and only considering the curvature term are almost identical reflection coefficients versus frequency for water wave propagating over double sinusoidal seabed are plotted in fig 4 the phase of the above two is obviously deviated in the case of double sinusoidal bottom the influence of slope terms on the phase of the primary peak is obvious it is worth to mention that long wave case liu et al 2019b is a special case that can be also calculated by the coupling equation eq 1 in their case the dispersion relation w 2 g k t a n h k h is replaced by a shallow water approximate relation w 2 g k 2 h so their wave propagation is not properly descripted in intermediate water depth in fact according to eq 5 3 3 the magnitude of the resonance peak this part will use damped mathieu solution to explain the magnitude of the primary and secondary peaks as shown in fig a4 and a6 the amplitude increases correspondingly with the increase of time after the coupling equation is converted into the form of damped mathieu equation the time t is changed into length x φ will increase as the increase of x therefore the reflection coefficient of the primary peak increases with the increase of the number of ripples under the condition of single sinusoidal topographic shape in the same water depth as shown in fig 5 a f when the number of ripples increases from 4 to 10 the corresponding reflection coefficient also increases this suggests that the larger the ripple number is the larger the reflection coefficient of the primary peak phase will be based on mi theory 4 conclusions in general wavenumber and velocity potential coupling equation has been derived using fat which are valid for both resonant and non resonant wave scattering by arbitral varying bottom in particular sinusoidal seabed case this equation can be recasted into damped mathieu equation consequently the resonant conditions are explained by using damped mathieu instability diagram that is similar to the mechanism of pr parametric resonance in other engineering fields as demonstrated in this paper specifically by considering the bottom slope and curvature effects separately it is found that the phase shifting mentioned by liu et al 2015a b and linton 2010 which cannot be predicted by bragg s law is mainly due to slope effect in sinusoidal seabed case which is main focus of this work furthermore the positions of the several peak reflection coefficients by sinusoidal seabed can be accurately predicted according to the parameters of damped mathieu s equation in different instability zones which means that not only primary peak but also secondary peaks as well as the influence of phase shift of the peak can all be identified

mathematics have originated from investigating parametrical problems such as hill s floquet s and mathieu s classical mathieu equation can be expressed as a1 x a b cos t x 0 in the engineering literature the term b cos t is often called a parametric excitation of strength likewise dynamic system such as spar oil platform etc often has damping mechanism in engineering thus the damped mathieu equation below is studied a2 x c x a b cos t x 0 in eq a2 if c 0 in the absence of damping the mathieu equation is recovered it is known that the a b parametric plane consists of regions of stability and instability bounded by curves on which there is a periodic solution stability chart in the a b parametric plane has been obtained by many researchers using different methods where a and b are the parameters in the mathieu equation as shown fig a1 where the boundaries between the stable and unstable regions are called transition curves these zones of instability form tongues attached to the a axis at a3 a 0 25 1 0 2 25 4 0 one of the techniques available for generating the transition curves involves the use of hill s infinite determinants under this method the bounded solutions x t along the transition curves are represented by the fourier series substituting the fourier series into the mathieu equation and matching terms with the same harmonics i e harmonic balance lead to an infinite set of linear homogeneous equations for the fourier coefficients in order for x t to be nontrivial the infinite determinant of the associated coefficient matrix must vanish it is this condition that implicitly specifies the transition curves in the a b parameter plane for the damped mathieu equation it revolves around the assertion that the infinite determinants resulting from the damped mathieu equation are complex specifically the bounded solutions x t along the transition curves are represented by the complex fourier series as follows a4 x t n d n e int on substitution into the damped mathieu equation eq a2 one finds a5 n e int 1 2 b d n 1 a i n c n 2 d n 1 2 b d n 1 0 for all t this can be satisfied only if the coefficients are all zeroes a6 1 2 b d n 1 a i n c n 2 d n 1 2 b d n 1 0 n 2 1 0 1 2 this infinite set of homogeneous equations for d n has non zero solutions if the infinite determinant formed by the coefficients is zero assuming a i n c n 2 0 and after dividing all the equation above by a i n c n 2 to secure convergence one obtains a7 γ 1 1 γ 1 0 0 0 γ 0 1 γ 0 0 0 0 γ 1 1 γ 2 0 where a8 γ n b 2 a i n c n 2 n 0 1 2 by fixing c and given a and b the determinants above can rapidly be computed from recurrence relations between the determinants of orders differing by 2 at each step starting with the mid determinant zeros of infinite determinants can be found by specifying a or b and searching for the corresponding b or a which gives results sufficiently close to zero then a stability diagram of the damped mathieu equation shown in fig a3 is developed and shown in terms of percentage of critical damping as shown in fig a3 the characteristics of the principal 1 s t and 2 n d unstable zones affected by damping are shown next fig a1 stability diagram without damping a b parameters in eq a1 fig a1 fig a2 stability diagram with damping a b parameters in eq a2 fig a2 fig a3 and 2 n d unstable zones of stability diagram with without damping a b parameters in eq a2 fig a3 as shown in fig a3 there are four unstable regions from the diagram then according to the parameter characteristics of each region different parameter values were selected and substituted into eq a2 then the oscillation amplitude changes from 1st and 2nd unstable regions are plotted with the increase of time as shown in fig a3 a6 fig a4 mathieu solution in the 1st instability zone a b c parameters in eq a2 a 0 25 b 0 075 c 0 05 fig a4 fig a5 mathieu solution in the 1st stability zone a b c parameters in eq a2 a 0 25 b 0 05 c 0 05 fig a5 fig a6 mathieu

observed fig a4 a7 can intuitively express the properties of stable regions and unstable regions when in the unstable regions in 1 s t and 2 n d as shown in fig a4 and a6 the amplitude of oscillation increases with time on the contrary when in the stable regions in 1 s t and 2 n d as shown in fig a5 and a7 the amplitude of oscillation basically remains unchanged with time 
21370,in this article we shed light on unresolved issues on the physics of the problem and clarify the effects of slope and other related parameters controlling the wave scattering phase shifting by sinusoidal seabed based on mathieu instability theorem as a starting point 3d water wave scattering by arbitrarily varying sea bottom is governed by 2d wave potential and wavenumber coupling equation using fredholm s alternative theorem seabed undulating effects are split into different components including wavenumber and bottom slope and curvature effects sinusoidal ripples are used to demonstrate these different seabed undulating effects the presented model predictions agree very well with lab data furthermore a method with quantitative formulations is constructed and proposed to elucidate the resonance mechanism of wave scattering by sinusoidal seabed using mathieu instability theorem general stability chart is generated in a relevant parametric plane to detect the unstable conditions quantitively formulations of resonance conditions are presented to predict peak shifting features that beyond the bragg s perdition as demonstrated in this work slope effect is contributed to peak shifting and the calculation formula of the shifting distance is given though the shifting in single sinusoidal case is small it is more obvious in double sinusoidal cases keywords wavenumber coupling model fredholm s alternative theorem fat sinusoidal seabed resonance scattering damped mathieu s equation mathieu instability mi 1 introduction the current investigation is motivated by new advance in wave scattering of sinusoidal seabed ripples liu et al 2019a reefs liu et al 2019a b c submerged breakwaters barbosa lópeza et al 2019 and sandy ripples tsai et al 2017 etc when surface waves match into a patches of bottom undulation the waves scattered by the seabed become in phase and are reinforced properly by the phase correlation which results in strong resonant reflection especially when the incident wave number is approximately 1 2 of the seabed wave number which is historically called the bragg resonance however as indicated in their paper there are many open questions about the bragg s law which is originally used in description of x ray reflection in crystallography therefore the aim of this paper is to study the wave resonant scattering by sinusoidal seabed according to mathieu theory by means of mathematical analysis in addition a general phase shifting calculation method is given for future research in this field the scattering of water wave by undulating seabed or floating structures is of wide practical importance in coastal and offshore engineering for instance resonance scattering caused by the patches of bottom undulations has been investigated extensively in the coastal engineering field most noticeably davies and heathershaw 1984 provided solutions to the linear problem and verified their solutions experimentally mei 1985 concentrated his studies on the process close to the primary resonance condition dalrymple and kirby 1986 studied a single sinusoidal bed for both resonant and non resonant cases using a boundary integral equation method and they dalrymple and kirby 1986 developed the equations to predict wave propagation over rapidly varying topography which is based on the concept of expanding the rapidly varying component on a very mild slope bottom the step approximation model guazzelli et al 1992 or the successive application matrix o hare and davies 1993 in which the bed is divided into a series of very small horizontal shelves have also been developed to model the wave scattering by the rippled bed resonance scattering mechanism is of great significance in the calculation of wave distribution on the ripples as demonstrated by mei 1985 davies et al 1989 belzons et al 1991 and others ardhuin and magne 2007 chang and liou 2007 liu et al 2015a b tang et al 2015 the physical phenomenon of resonant scattering is studied under the so called bragg scattering category for example multiple scales perturbation solution was employed to explain that strong reflection can be induced by the sandbars themselves once the bragg resonance condition is met mei 1985 davies and heathershaw 1984 and guazzelli et al 1992 have presented lab experiments indicating that relatively few bottom undulations with wavenumber equal to approximately twice the surface wavenumber moreover for a given number of ripples and a given ripple steepness the reflection coefficient increases due to both increasing ripple amplitude and decreasing depth on the basis of undamped mathieu equation davies et al 1989 have treated this problem of the reflection of shallow water waves by sinusoidal seabed obviously it is very different from this work since we are focusing on wave in intermediate water depth and using damped mathieu equation there are two distinct cases in water wave and varying seabed interaction namely resonant and non resonant scattering as showing in their paper classical theories are only accurate in one of these cases for instance mei s theory 1985 only valid in resonant case liu et al 2019b since both cases have important engineering applications for example former case is usually used in bottom barrier type breakwater design and later case is good at studying harbor wave distribution hsu et al 2003 cho et al 2004 jeon and cho 2006 liang et al 2015 the possible solution overcoming the drawbacks of theories mentioned above is application of mild slope type models as summarized by hsu et al 2006 also ardhuin and herbers 2002 have studied stochastic bragg scattering and presented a bottom slope effect along in the sinusoidal bar case recent applications by barbosa lópeza et al 2019 show that the radius of the generating circle of the cycloidal geometry has a strong influence on the magnitude of the reflection coefficient which is actually due to the seabed boundary curvature effect we will come to this curvature effect later however as far as we are aware under the bragg s law the phenomenon of bragg phase shifting the location of the resonant reflection peaks and the physical mechanism behind the phenomenon are still unclear liu et al 2015a b even using latest models so far furthermore linton 2010 has indicated that there are approximation errors of peak resonant reflection if using bragg s law also as indicated in tsai et al 2017 the shifting of 2 k k at resonance is greater affected by the bed slope than by other factors because a small phase shifting it will cause a huge change of the reflection coefficient if this issue is not solved in the actual engineering application it may lead to an uncertain prediction uneconomic design and great financial loss we will come back to the seabed slope effect later on the other hand mathieu instability mi is a powerful mathematical tool for a rigorous understanding of many engineering issues such as parametric excitation etc as offshore engineers zhang et al 2002 have observed unstable pitch motion of mathieu type instability in spar platform and tlp tendons where the pitch natural period is about twice that of the heave natural period it is found that damping plays an important role in suppressing mathieu instability in offshore structure dynamics many examples of waves may be excited by pr parametric resonance poulin et al 2003 koo et al 2004 other applications can be found in acoustic instabilities in flames sammarco et al 1997 in geophysical fluid dynamics poulin et al 2003 and pedlosky and thomson 2003 derived ordinary differential equations of the hill type to describe the stability of barotropic and baroclinic shear flows respectively recently yang and xu 2015 investigated the parametric instabilities of spar platforms in irregular waves and provided several suggestions to avoid the parametric pitch resonance in many related fields mi is also widely used in practical application in time domain however in this work time is changed to space of coupling equation in mathieu equation so the corresponding amplitude of oscillation is the magnitude of the velocity potential the properties of φ can be analyzed by mi the aims of this work are trying to shed some light on two issues using mi and two possible contributions will be accomplished one is that the inner mechanism of primary peak phase shifting towards low frequency is given using mi in the bragg resonance phenomenon therefore for a certain case the primary peak phase shifting distance can also be calculated another is the inner mechanism of the variation of the magnitude of the primary peak of resonance reflection this paper will discuss and explain these two contributions rippled seabed is used to represent both regular and irregular ocean bottoms in principle any arbitrarily varying seabed barrier can be decomposed into fourier sum of sinusoidal components thus this work is focus on sinusoidal seabed subsequently newly derived model is validated by comparing with published lab data as discussed in the following section in detail coupling equation which contains the nonlinear relation of wave number caused by seabed slope and curvature change and is embodied in the square terms of sea bottom topographic slope and sea bottom topographic curvature terms can be recast into the standard damped mathieu s equation zhang et al 2002 general stability charts are generated from standard damped mathieu equation above in a relevant parametric plane to detect unstable conditions and then by combining the two theories the inner mechanism of resonance scattering can be explained not only in shallow water but also in intermediate water depth 2 formulation and validation 2 1 formulation although the starting point for this work could have been from the governing equation from zhang and edge 1998 there are benefits to deriving the new equations afresh in this paper as mentioned above most classical theories have different accuracy in different frequency ranges for instance mei s theory mei 1985 only valid in the vicinity of resonance kirby s model cannot predict the subharmonic resonance liu et al 2019a etc therefore we start from 3d laplace equation accordingly the 2d model is established next in which wave potential and wave number are coupled explicitly in eq 1 in particular the governing equation of wave field can be obtained by applying fredholm s alternative theorem fat friedman 1956 and detailed description can be found in ge et al 2020 which is briefly summarized in this section assuming plane wave and removing the time dependence we have the wave number and potential coupled equation for the steady waves as follows 1 p φ k 2 p g f φ 0 where 2 f g 1 σ 2 q σ 2 σ k h 2 1 2 q σ 1 σ 2 2 h 1 σ 2 2 q σ 2 5 σ 2 q 2 h h k 1 4 k 3 q 1 σ 2 4 q 2 σ 2 4 3 q 2 2 q σ 1 σ k 2 1 4 k 2 q 1 σ 2 1 2 q σ σ 2 k 3 p g σ 1 σ 2 q 2 k where water depth variable h is the local water depth and is expressed as the function of x and y i e h x y g is the gravitational acceleration and k x y is the wave number for simplification of derivation σ t a n h q is used where q k h is the product of wave number and water depth h 2 represents the square term of the slope of the seabed 2 h represents seabed topography curvature term k 2 represents the square term of the slope of the water wave number 2 k represents water wave number curvature term 2 2 model verification in two dimensions in this part of the article experimental data from davies and heathershaw 1984 are selected to validated the present model assuming that sea bottom has sinusoidal profile we choose a stationary surface for x0y coordinate plane above mean seabed h 0 and the z coordinate is vertically upwards in the cartesian coordinate system thus the single sinusoidal seabed is descripted by the following functions 4 h h 0 x 0 h 0 b s i n k x 0 x 2 π n k h 0 x 2 π n k in the two dimensional coordinate system the coupling eq 1 becomes 5 φ x x p x p φ x k 2 p g f φ 0 6 f g 1 σ 2 q σ 2 σ k h x 2 1 2 q σ 1 σ 2 h x x 1 σ 2 2 q σ 2 5 2 q σ 1 2 q h h x k x 1 4 k 3 q 1 σ 2 4 q 2 σ 2 4 3 q 2 2 q σ 1 σ k x 2 1 4 k 2 q 1 σ 2 1 2 q σ σ k x x the new coupling equation for surface waves propagating over generally varying seabed is derived for the case of the bottom having only one sinusoidal component there are two resonant peaks of reflection coefficients which were shown numerically by dalrymple and kirby 1986 by solving the 2 d laplace equation later it was confirmed by davies et al 1989 and o hare and davies 1993 considering the same cases of their papers the single sinusoidal seabed parameters are listed in table 1 the three cases selected from davies and heathershaw 1984 here are all linear waves according to zou et al 2017 the effect of surface wave nonlinearity is far less than that of varying bottom in the case of linear waves the numerical results of the present model are presented in fig 1 a c which show that the simulated results of the single sinusoidal seabed agree with the experimental values very well also prediction of the primary and sub harmonic resonance peaks is very reasonable as can be seen from fig 1 the primary peak appears at a place where 2 k k is close to 1 table 2 shows the location of the primary peak in the three cases and the corresponding maximum reflection coefficient as well as the correlation coefficient between the numerical solution of present model and the experimental value davies and heathershaw 1984 firstly it can be seen that when number of fluctuations increases the larger the correlation coefficient between the numerical solution of this model and the experimental value is the better the fitting effect is in actual engineering seabed bottom is undulating and any form of seabed can be expressed in the form of fourier series through the above analysis and comparison it also means that the present model is more suitable for the actual situation of undulating seabed moreover the mean water depth of case a is the same as that of case b when the number of ripples increases the phase of the primary peak is the same and the reflection coefficient increases comparing case c and case b the reflection coefficient of the primary peak did not increase with the increase of mean water depth and ripples number but the phase of the primary peak changed therefore the factors that determine the magnitude of the primary peak reflection coefficient and the phase of the primary peak are complicated then we will use the mathieu s equation to predict the phase and the magnitude of the reflection coefficient of the primary peak table 3 shows the phase of the primary peaks between this numerical model using wave number and potential coupling equation and analytical solution using modified mild slope equation liu et al 2019a under different b h 0 conditions when the number of ripples is 4 when the profile of the seabed remains unchanged the phase of the primary peak gradually becomes stable with the increase of water depth seabed undulating effects are split into different components including wavenumber and bottom slope and curvature effects in summary for sinusoidal beds the numerical results of the present model are all in good agreement with the experimental data of davies and heathershaw 1984 the success of the model and agreement with experimental data suggest that this model is an efficient and accurate tool for the prediction of wave transformation over general varying seabed including sinusoidal seabed of course thus the important application of this wavenumber coupling equation in sinusoidal seabed case will be shown in the remaining part of this paper 3 wave resonant scattering vs mathieu instability coupling equation in above section will be recast into the general damped mathieu s equation then the slope and curvature effects will be analyzed separately in this section the properties of damped mathieu s equation can be used to explain why there are primary and secondary peaks in wave scattering by sinusoidal seabed as shown in fig a1 a2 friction term is largely ineffective in the first region compared to other regions according to zhang et al 2002 high order regions first region excepted of instability are more sensitive to the damping than low order one first region indeed the positions of the several peaks can be accurately predicted by the properties of damped mathieu s equation which not only means that the influence of phase shift of the primary peak can be accurately predicted but also other peaks can be skillfully identified for engineering applications 3 1 seabed curvature effect as indicated in zhang and edge 1998 even for very small seabed slopes the curvature effects may not be very small for some wave components so first we mainly consider the seabed curvature terms in the two dimensional coordinate system by neglecting slope square terms in governing equation as can be seen from figs 2 3 the solutions ignoring the slope term and not ignoring the slope term have little difference in the position of the primary peak figs 2 3 show the relationship between the wave reflection coefficient and 2 k k of the present model where the solid blue line represents the numerical solution of the wave number and velocity potential coupling equation including all terms seabed slope square terms and curvature terms the red solid point represents the numerical solution of the wave number and velocity potential coupling equation containing the seabed curvature terms only fig 2 a1 a6 show the trend of wave reflection coefficient with respect to b h 0 0 56 0 48 0 4 0 32 0 24 0 16 when the number of ripples n 4 fig 3 b1 b6 show the trend of the wave reflection coefficient with respect to b h 0 0 56 0 48 0 4 0 32 0 24 0 16 when the number of ripples n 10 as can be seen from figs 2 3 when b h 0 decreases the reflection coefficient of the corresponding case also decreases near the primary peak the coupling equation with all terms only curvature terms basically fit but in fact the phase of the primary peak is slightly off the inner mechanism of movement is given in section 3 2 of course it can also be observed that in the vicinity of the secondary peak the deviation between the two is large and the reason will be given in section 3 2 in addition when comparing a1 a6 in fig 2 and b1 b6 in fig 3 respectively it can be found that when b h 0 remains unchanged the larger the number of ripples n 4 is the larger the reflection coefficient will be the intrinsic mechanism of the variation of the reflection coefficient with the number of ripples is also given in section 3 3 in this paper the change of wave number comes from the change of water depth under the ideal condition of single sinusoidal topography the equation can be recovered from the coupling equation zhang and edge 1998 by using the relation of the wave number slope and curvature with those of bottom which are obtained from 7 k x k τ 1 h x h 8 k x x k τ 1 h x x h τ 2 h x 2 h 2 9 τ 1 q 1 σ 2 γ 10 τ 2 2 q 2 1 σ 2 γ α γ 2 11 α σ q 1 σ 2 2 12 γ σ q 1 σ 2 as described in the previous section the change of wave number comes from the change of water depth under the ideal condition of single sinusoidal sea bottom when eqs 6 12 is substituted into eq 5 we can get the governing equation 13 φ x x p x p φ x k 2 g ρ h x x p φ 0 where ρ is a parameter consisting of q and σ 14 ρ σ σ 3 q σ 4 q 4 σ q σ 2 q and 15 h x x k 2 b c o s k x let t k x then eq 13 can be transformed into following damped mathieu s equation 16 φ t t p t p φ t k 2 k 2 g ρ b p c o s t φ 0 wave reflection coefficients versus 2 k k for water wave propagating over single sinusoidal seabed with two different high order terms of the coupling equation are plotted in figs 2 3 the bed form is same as fig 1 after eq 5 is converted to eq 16 by inspecting eq 16 we get three parameters in mathieu s equation defined in the appendix as follows 17 a k 2 k 2 18 b g ρ b p k 2 19 c p t p zeros can be found by specifying a and searching for the corresponding b which gives a result sufficiently close to zero in fig a1 moreover convergence is rapid enough to produce the data for to decimals in a very short time by transforming the coupling equation into the standard form of dampeded mathieu s equation in the first and second zones in fig a2 the white zone is the stable zone and the blue zone is the unstable zone corresponding to the coupling equation the phase with the largest reflection coefficient can be obtained from fig a3 in appendix and eq 16 if b is close to a axis we can observe 20 a k 2 k 2 0 25 0 1 the two values correspond to the two primary peaks of figs 2 3 respectively in this way we can explain the primary and secondary peaks of resonance reflection based on damped mathieu s theory as can be seen from figs 2 3 the numerical results of the coupling equation considering all terms and only considering the curvature term are almost identical and the most obvious difference is in the phase of the secondary primary peak in fact the phase of the above two is slightly deviated parameters a b and c were selected from the unstable regions of 1st and 2nd of fig a2 respectively and their solutions were shown in fig a4 and a6 it can be observed that when t remains unchanged the oscillation amplitude of the corresponding solution x t in 1st zone is greater than that in 2nd region after the coupling equation is converted into the form of dampeded mathieu equation it can be obtained from eq 16 that 2 k k 1 and 2 correspond to the phases of the primary peak and the secondary peak respectively it also indicates that the amplitude of φ in the first region is larger than that in the second region because of the unstable strength difference so that the reflection coefficient of the primary peak is higher than that of the secondary peak 3 2 mechanism of phase shifting in the previous section in the case of single sinusoidal patch the phase shift is not very obvious since the slope term considered is comparable small as massel 1993 has shown that the typical bed slope in single patch case is 0 314 thus the slope square terms are of the order of 0 09 in the coupling equation in contrast the curvature terms are of the order of 1 97 liu et al 2015a b 2019b have also shown that the peak bragg reflection shifts a little bit toward lower frequency rather than occurs exactly at 2 k k as predicted by bragg s law in their 1st case liu et al 2015a b wave propagation is only affected by topographic slope not by topographic curvature since there are no curvature in their seabed profile h x x 0 in contrast to above mentioned resonance peak at 2 k k the resonance band concept is proposed in this paper based on mathieu instability diagram the diagram has a axis and b axis showing that if the parametric point a b lies in the crosshatched regions also called unstable zones the solutions are unbounded i e instability occurs thus wave scattering becomes resonant due to unbound solutions if a line of b b 0 drawing parallelly with a axis it will crossing with crosshatched regions in each unstable zone for instance in 1st unstable zone there are two points a 1 b 0 and a 2 b 0 between these two points bandwidth is defined and the resonance band is formed because wave scattering resonance will be excited if controlling parameters enter this band between a 1 b 0 and a 2 b 0 therefore the positions of the resonant peaks are not at exact positions predicted by bragg s law next the effects of these controlling parameters will be analyzed the effect of seabed slope will be looked at first as ma et al 2017 and dong et al 2014 indicated that slope influence on the parameterization cannot be ignored when slope β 1 30 when eqs 6 12 is substituted into eq 5 and when only considering the seabed slope terms 21 φ x x p x p φ x k 2 g ρ 1 k p h x 2 φ 0 where ρ 1 is a parameter consisting of q and σ 22 ρ 1 9 σ 2 1 σ 4 6 σ 1 3 σ 2 5 σ 4 3 σ 6 q 3 1 σ 2 1 σ 2 2 1 2 σ 2 3 σ 4 q 2 8 σ 1 σ 2 3 q 3 2 1 σ 2 4 q 4 12 σ q σ 2 q 3 and 23 h x b k s i n k x let t 1 2 k x we can get the following formula 24 φ t 1 t 1 p t 1 p φ t 1 k 2 4 k 2 g ρ 1 k b 2 s i n 2 1 2 t 1 4 p φ 0 with a simple transformation above equation becomes 25 φ t 1 t 1 p t 1 p φ t 1 k 2 4 k 2 g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p c o s t 1 φ 0 after eq 5 is converted to eq 25 we get 26 a k 2 4 k 2 g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p 27 b g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p 28 c p t 1 p from fig a1 in appendix and eq 25 if b is close to a axis we can observe 29 a k 2 4 k 2 g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p 0 25 1 0 2 25 4 0 will be resonance peaks further transformation of eq 29 shows that 2 k k is approximately 2 4 6 8 so the influence of slope is only concentrated at the secondary peak by comparing with bagg s law these peaks will shifted amount of g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p when considering the effect of topographic slope on wave propagation it can be observed that the phase of the bragg peaks will be shifted the amount of g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p from this perspective we can explain why the phase shift occurs when predict the phase of the primary peak as well as other peaks based on mathieu s instability theory during resonance reflection certain frequency shift will be generated due to slope effect the phase offset is determined by g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p which is function of water depth h amplitude of ripples and wave number it is worth noting that the phase shift is independent of the number of ripples because the effect of slope and value g ρ 1 k b 2 8 p are small in the single sinusoidal patch case the phase shifting is not obvious as shown in figs 2 3 however in general cases the phase shift may not be ignored for instance in the case of double sinusoidal patch guazzelli et al 1992 have shown phase shifting in their lab data for example the phase shifting of the primary peak is very obvious because the second sinusoidal component is steeper than the first in single patch one indeed it is clear that slope terms will affect the phase shift although its influence may not be of significant in single sinusoidal patch case therefore next we will focus on the double sinusoidal patch case as can be seen from figs 2 3 the numerical results of the coupling equation considering all terms and only considering the curvature term are almost identical reflection coefficients versus frequency for water wave propagating over double sinusoidal seabed are plotted in fig 4 the phase of the above two is obviously deviated in the case of double sinusoidal bottom the influence of slope terms on the phase of the primary peak is obvious it is worth to mention that long wave case liu et al 2019b is a special case that can be also calculated by the coupling equation eq 1 in their case the dispersion relation w 2 g k t a n h k h is replaced by a shallow water approximate relation w 2 g k 2 h so their wave propagation is not properly descripted in intermediate water depth in fact according to eq 5 3 3 the magnitude of the resonance peak this part will use damped mathieu solution to explain the magnitude of the primary and secondary peaks as shown in fig a4 and a6 the amplitude increases correspondingly with the increase of time after the coupling equation is converted into the form of damped mathieu equation the time t is changed into length x φ will increase as the increase of x therefore the reflection coefficient of the primary peak increases with the increase of the number of ripples under the condition of single sinusoidal topographic shape in the same water depth as shown in fig 5 a f when the number of ripples increases from 4 to 10 the corresponding reflection coefficient also increases this suggests that the larger the ripple number is the larger the reflection coefficient of the primary peak phase will be based on mi theory 4 conclusions in general wavenumber and velocity potential coupling equation has been derived using fat which are valid for both resonant and non resonant wave scattering by arbitral varying bottom in particular sinusoidal seabed case this equation can be recasted into damped mathieu equation consequently the resonant conditions are explained by using damped mathieu instability diagram that is similar to the mechanism of pr parametric resonance in other engineering fields as demonstrated in this paper specifically by considering the bottom slope and curvature effects separately it is found that the phase shifting mentioned by liu et al 2015a b and linton 2010 which cannot be predicted by bragg s law is mainly due to slope effect in sinusoidal seabed case which is main focus of this work furthermore the positions of the several peak reflection coefficients by sinusoidal seabed can be accurately predicted according to the parameters of damped mathieu s equation in different instability zones which means that not only primary peak but also secondary peaks as well as the influence of phase shift of the peak can all be identified

mathematics have originated from investigating parametrical problems such as hill s floquet s and mathieu s classical mathieu equation can be expressed as a1 x a b cos t x 0 in the engineering literature the term b cos t is often called a parametric excitation of strength likewise dynamic system such as spar oil platform etc often has damping mechanism in engineering thus the damped mathieu equation below is studied a2 x c x a b cos t x 0 in eq a2 if c 0 in the absence of damping the mathieu equation is recovered it is known that the a b parametric plane consists of regions of stability and instability bounded by curves on which there is a periodic solution stability chart in the a b parametric plane has been obtained by many researchers using different methods where a and b are the parameters in the mathieu equation as shown fig a1 where the boundaries between the stable and unstable regions are called transition curves these zones of instability form tongues attached to the a axis at a3 a 0 25 1 0 2 25 4 0 one of the techniques available for generating the transition curves involves the use of hill s infinite determinants under this method the bounded solutions x t along the transition curves are represented by the fourier series substituting the fourier series into the mathieu equation and matching terms with the same harmonics i e harmonic balance lead to an infinite set of linear homogeneous equations for the fourier coefficients in order for x t to be nontrivial the infinite determinant of the associated coefficient matrix must vanish it is this condition that implicitly specifies the transition curves in the a b parameter plane for the damped mathieu equation it revolves around the assertion that the infinite determinants resulting from the damped mathieu equation are complex specifically the bounded solutions x t along the transition curves are represented by the complex fourier series as follows a4 x t n d n e int on substitution into the damped mathieu equation eq a2 one finds a5 n e int 1 2 b d n 1 a i n c n 2 d n 1 2 b d n 1 0 for all t this can be satisfied only if the coefficients are all zeroes a6 1 2 b d n 1 a i n c n 2 d n 1 2 b d n 1 0 n 2 1 0 1 2 this infinite set of homogeneous equations for d n has non zero solutions if the infinite determinant formed by the coefficients is zero assuming a i n c n 2 0 and after dividing all the equation above by a i n c n 2 to secure convergence one obtains a7 γ 1 1 γ 1 0 0 0 γ 0 1 γ 0 0 0 0 γ 1 1 γ 2 0 where a8 γ n b 2 a i n c n 2 n 0 1 2 by fixing c and given a and b the determinants above can rapidly be computed from recurrence relations between the determinants of orders differing by 2 at each step starting with the mid determinant zeros of infinite determinants can be found by specifying a or b and searching for the corresponding b or a which gives results sufficiently close to zero then a stability diagram of the damped mathieu equation shown in fig a3 is developed and shown in terms of percentage of critical damping as shown in fig a3 the characteristics of the principal 1 s t and 2 n d unstable zones affected by damping are shown next fig a1 stability diagram without damping a b parameters in eq a1 fig a1 fig a2 stability diagram with damping a b parameters in eq a2 fig a2 fig a3 and 2 n d unstable zones of stability diagram with without damping a b parameters in eq a2 fig a3 as shown in fig a3 there are four unstable regions from the diagram then according to the parameter characteristics of each region different parameter values were selected and substituted into eq a2 then the oscillation amplitude changes from 1st and 2nd unstable regions are plotted with the increase of time as shown in fig a3 a6 fig a4 mathieu solution in the 1st instability zone a b c parameters in eq a2 a 0 25 b 0 075 c 0 05 fig a4 fig a5 mathieu solution in the 1st stability zone a b c parameters in eq a2 a 0 25 b 0 05 c 0 05 fig a5 fig a6 mathieu

observed fig a4 a7 can intuitively express the properties of stable regions and unstable regions when in the unstable regions in 1 s t and 2 n d as shown in fig a4 and a6 the amplitude of oscillation increases with time on the contrary when in the stable regions in 1 s t and 2 n d as shown in fig a5 and a7 the amplitude of oscillation basically remains unchanged with time 
21371,before analyzing the distribution of submarine minerals the positions of hydrophones installed in seismic array cables must be known generally the hydrophone positions are computed through inversion calculation based on assumptions that conflict with the facts and some assumed parameters are adjusted repeatedly to reduce the spatial aliasing in seismic reflection profiling furthermore the inversion calculation cannot study the relations between the cable shape and working conditions dynamic analysis is proposed to predict the hydrophone positions and investigate these relations herein the array cable is modeled by the lumped mass method with respect to the relative velocity element frame the results of the dynamic analysis and inversion calculation are verified using the recorded depth data although the cable shape by inversion calculation is the same as that by dynamic analysis the cable depth by inversion calculation demonstrates an obvious shift in comparison with the depth data meanwhile the results obtained via dynamic analysis match well with the depth data additionally three virtual maneuvers diving and rising depth change and lateral current are designed to study the relation between the cable shape and working conditions the obtained results may help guide exploration and promote the development of exploration equipment keywords deep towed seismic

purpose the array cable is non buoyant in seawater and ideally it is placed straight behind the towed vehicle these positions can be calculated linearly based on the preset positions in the cable and the position of the towed vehicle recorded by the installed sensors however the pitch heave motions of the towed vehicle and the lateral current disturb the array cable and the spatial positions cannot be determined via linear calculation based on the travel times of the reflected seismic waves inversion calculation is widely used to calculate the hydrophone positions generally the mean sea level is the datum in profiling strata therefore sea surface inversion is widely used in positioning the source and hydrophones crutchley and kopp 2018 innanen 2014 it assumes that the sea surface is flat and that the array cables have no lateral drift meanwhile the speed of seismic wave is also assumed to be constant in primitive inversion however the real surface waves affect the reflection paths of the seismic waves and large uncertainties can be introduced in picking travel times additionally the speed of seismic waves always changes with the depth and temperature of water these ideal hypotheses result in a depth error of tens of meters thus the inversion method can be used in the exploration of submarine oil and gas fields yilmaz 2001 but is not suitable for the exploration of gas hydrates as such exploration requires high resolution to reduce the uncertainties of inversion calculation depth gauges and gyrocompasses are embedded in the cables to obtain their depths and orientations respectively the genetic algorithm was introduced into the inversion calculation by he he et al 2009 and the seismic velocity distribution was determined to calculate the positions of the seismic source and the streamer by marsset marsset et al 2018 except for the application of gyrocompasses and velocity analysis seafloor reflection was adopted to reduce the uncertainties generated by the sea surface reflection colin et al 2020 hutapea et al 2020 however these methods still have problems 1 as there is no reflection medium in the horizontal direction neither the depth gauge nor the gyrocompass can identify the lateral drift of the cable 2 the computational error of the gyrocompass accumulates with working time sun et al 2013 thus these sensors are not suitable for long time exploration 3 these sensors installed in the cable interfere with hydrophones and the quantity and positions of installation are limited 4 the cable shape is computed using the recorded data however analyzing the relations between cable shape and interference factors is impossible consequently it is impossible to study the control mechanism that keeps the array cables straight as the inherent properties of the cable are known and the motions of the cable are restrained by the motions of the towed vehicle recorded by the installed sensors the positions of the hydrophones can be calculated in time via a numerical simulation additionally the influences of the pitch heave motions of the towed vehicle and the lateral current on the cable shape can be studied using virtual maneuvers till date several numerical modeling methods of underwater cables have been established that help analyze the response of the cable to design variables ablow ablow and schechter 1983 and dowling 1988 modeled the towed cable using the finite difference method they studied the influence of towing speed and drag coefficients on the diving depth and cable tension the towing cable of the multi parameter profiling system was studied by buckham buckham et al 2003 and soylu soylu et al 2008 using the lumped mass method the dynamic characteristics and the stability control were analyzed using virtual maneuvers the path in the water model was proposed to predict the positions of seismic streamer cables by grindheim grindheim et al 2018 2019 the united states naval research laboratory developed a deep towed seismic exploration system to study shallow sediments in the deep sea the quasi static method was used to analyze the influence of the resistance coefficient and weight of the towed vehicle on the cable tension and diving depth fagot 1986 milburn and fagot 1979 the above mentioned studies denote the following inferences 1 position prediction and stability control are two focus areas for research on the array cable and dynamic analysis is one common solution 2 majority of the published studies focus on the theoretical analysis using virtual simulations 3 the finite difference method and the lumped mass method are widely used to construct the dynamic model of the array cable the finite difference method shows divergence when the tension is near zero whereas the large oscillation invalidates the lumped mass method burgess 1992 4 there is a lack of research on dynamic analysis of the array cable for the deep towed seismic exploration system as the cable shape is affected by the motions of the towed vehicle and the current in time and the stability control of the cable is closely related to its dynamic behaviors dynamic analysis is conducted herein to complete the position prediction and stability control of the deep towed seismic array cable to realize the dynamic analysis the dynamic model of the array cable is first established using the lumped mass method zhu and yoo 2015 2016 zhu demonstrated that the lumped mass method is more robust than the finite difference method in analyzing underwater cables and the singularity of the lumped mass method was solved by the relative velocity element frame zhu and yoo 2017 to analyze the disturbance of the towed array generated by the submarine propeller the lumped mass method was used to construct the dynamic model of the towed array cable by du du et al 2019 second we reproduce the marine environment of the assigned maneuver in accordance with the data recorded by the installed sensors on the towed vehicle the motions of the towed vehicle and current affect the cable shape the influence of current on the steering was studied by walus waluś et al 2014 therefore the motion of towed vehicle and current information are required for position prediction fortunately the deep towed multi channel seismic array analyzed herein is equipped with an altimeter a depth gauge an ultra short baseline usbl to record the height to sea floor depth and position of the towed vehicle respectively the motions of the towed vehicle are treated as kinematic constraint that restrains the displacement of the array cable finally we simulate the assigned maneuver and output the positions of the hydrophones the simulation program is compiled using matlab lindfield and penny 2018 and the accelerations of cable nodes having the same locations as those of the hydrophones are integrated to obtain the positions of the hydrophones the governing equation of the array cable is shown in section 2 and the mechanism of the inversion calculation is illustrated in section 3 the accuracy of both the dynamic analysis and inversion calculation are assessed by the depth data recorded by the depth gauge in one deep sea trial design studies are conducted in section 4 and the relations between the cables shape and the interference factors are illustrated through three virtual maneuvers section 5 provides a summary and indicates that dynamic analysis is a feasible and efficient tool for deep towed seismic array 2 dynamic modeling of array cable the array cable comprises a multi stage combination of digital packages connectors and pu tube as shown in fig 2 there are internal ropes and hydrophones inside the pu tube which are used to resist the axial extension and record the seismic waves respectively the pu tube is also filled with incompressible oil such that the buoyancy of the cable can balance out its gravity the array cable is 210 m long and has a uniform diameter of 46 mm owing to its slender geometry and deformability the array cable is simplified as underwater cable regardless of the bending and torsion in modeling the lumped mass method is used to create a dynamic model of the cable which decomposes the cable into n elements as shown in fig 3 e g i defined by two adjacent nodes represents the orientation of the cable element as shown in eq 1 n g i is a 3 1 vector indicates the x y and z displacement of the ith node in the global frame the node connected to the towed vehicle is named n g 1 and the tail node is named n g n 1 1 e g i n g i 1 n g i the body frame of the towed vehicle is defined at a point where the array cable is tied to the towed vehicle as shown in fig 3 this frame is fixed with the towed vehicle and the x axis always directs the driving direction the z axis is directed upward and the y axis is defined by the right hand rule the global frame is right above the frame of the towed vehicle and located at the still water level the axes of the global frame are the same directions with the initial axes of the towed vehicle as the first node of cable is zero in the x axis of the global frame the rest nodes are located in the negative x axis initially to solve singularity of the element fixed frame of the cable model the relative velocity element frame is defined by vectors of the element orientation and the relative velocity of the fluid the z axis of the cable element has the same direction as the element orientation and the x and y axis change with the relative velocity of the cable in seawater as shown in fig 4 unit vector z i directs the orientation of the ith element e g i unit vector x i is the normal vector of plane p 1 composed of the unit vector z i and relative velocity v g i according to the right hand rule the unit vector y i is perpendicular to the plane p 2 that is composed of unit vectors z i and x i the expression of the ith element is shown in eq 2 2 z i e g i e g i x i z i v g i z i v g i y i z i x i as the frame axes are defined with respect to the global frame the transformation matrix a i is expressed by eq 3 3 a i x i y i z i the array cable is mainly subjected to the internal tension and damping force hydrodynamic force and self inertial force in water the tension and damping force are functions of the axial extension and the extension speed respectively they have the same direction as that of the element orientation vector the hydrodynamic force is proportional to the square of the relative velocity of the cable in water referring to zhu and yoo 2017 all the loads are expressed in eq 4 4 t b i π d c 2 4 e ε b i d b i c d a i t n g i 1 n g i z f w i π d c 2 4 l 0 ρ c π d c 2 4 l 0 ρ f g f d i 1 2 c n ρ f d c l i v b i v b i t b i the cable tension is defined by the axial strain ε b i elastic modulus e and cable diameter d c ε b i is defined by the current length of the ith element l i and the initial length l 0 as shown in eq 5 the damping force d b i is expressed by the velocity difference between the terminal nodes in the z direction with respect to the element fixed frame as n g i is the velocity of the node with respect to the global frame the transformation matrix a i t is used to convert the velocity from the global frame to the element fixed frame c d denotes the damping coefficient of the cable f w i is the weight of the cable in water and g indicates that the force has the same direction as that of the gravity acceleration ρ c and ρ f are the densities of the cable and water respectively f d i is the hydrodynamic force acting on the ith element v b i and v g i are the relative velocities of the ith element with respect to the element fixed frame and global frame respectively the average velocity of the terminal nodes is used to express the velocity of the said element as shown in eq 5 v f i is the velocity of water particle at the ith node 5 ε b i l i l 0 l 0 l i e g i t e g i v b i a i t v g i v g i n g i 1 n g i v f i 1 v f i 2 owing to the added mass effects the mass matrix of the ith element in the element fixed frame is given by eq 6 where c a is the coefficient of the added mass as the cable is continuous in the z direction the added mass is ignored along the cable axis 6 m b i π d c 2 4 l 0 ρ c c a π d c 2 4 l 0 i ρ f 0 0 0 π d c 2 4 l 0 ρ c c a π d c 2 4 l 0 ρ f 0 0 0 π d c 2 4 l 0 ρ c as the ith node is the connection of the ith and i 1 th elements the mass matrix of the ith node m g i is expressed using the mass matrix of the element m b i 1 and m b i as shown in eq 7 the transformation matrix a i is used to convert the mass matrices from the element fixed frame to the global frame 7 m g i 1 2 a i 1 m b i 1 a i 1 t 1 2 a i m b i a i t finally the loads acting on an element are shared equally by its terminal nodes meanwhile the governing equation for the ith node is determined by the loads acting on the i 1 th and ith elements as given in eq 8 n g i represents the acceleration of the ith node

process involving data analysis and optimization the genetic algorithm data driven and machine learning are efficient approaches to identify uncertainties of inversion based on the obtained seismic profiling he et al 2009 ovcharenko et al 2019 pilz et al 2020 as the power of the plasma sparker carried by the towed vehicle is not sufficiently high to generate sub bottom profiling in the first sea trail implementing these inversion calculation algorithms is difficult in addition this paper focuses on numerical simulation and the basic sea surface inversion is explained herein the hydrophone receives the direct wave and records the travel time t d meanwhile the travel time of the seismic wave reflected by the sea surface t r is also determined as shown in fig 5 e denotes the symmetry point of c with respect to the sea surface according to the pythagorean theorem maor 2019 eq 9 can be obtained for the right triangles adc and ade 9 a d 2 a c 2 d p d t 2 a d 2 a c 2 d p d t 2 as the speed of the seismic wave changes from 1480 m s to 1540 m s within water depth of 0 1500 m in the south china sea zhang et al 2010 we ignore the velocity difference at different depths and assume the mean speed of the seismic wave v s is 1500 m s as the towed vehicle carries a depth gauge the depth of the towed vehicle d t is known thus the depth of the hydrophone can subsequently be calculated by eq 10 10 d p v s t r 2 v s t d 2 4 d t the horizontal distance from the said hydrophone to the towed vehicle x p is given by the obtained depth d p as shown in eq 11 11 x p t d v s 2 d p d t 2 as the position of the towed vehicle is known the position of the cable can be identified by the horizontal distances and depths for all hydrophones 3 2 deep sea exploration and data preprocess with the national research fund support the first deep sea trial was conducted by the towed vehicle kuiyang designed by the first institute of oceanography of ministry of natural resources wei zheng rong and liu 2020 as shown in fig 6 a and the survey area is near the northern latitude 19 51 and east longitude 115 10 in the south china sea as shown in fig 6 b kuiyang is made by stainless steel and expected to operate at a depth no less than 2000 m it is equipped with a plasma sparker 2000 w rated power shots pulse signal 500 2500 hz with an output level of 214 db and each hydrophone can receive the direct wave huang et al 2015 it also carries an altimeter a depth gauge and an usbl the data recorded by these sensors are transferred to the mothership through a towing cable in time the 210 m array cable has 48 digital hydrophones with a 3 125 m spacing and the 1st and 48th hydrophones are located at 10 m and 160 m respectively to maintain the distance between the towed vehicle and seabed at 100 m the winch of the mothership winds or unwinds the towing cable automatically according to the data provided by the altimeter this operation generates severe motion in the towed vehicle and disturbs the array cable fortunately the depth of the towed vehicle is recorded by the depth gauge and the usbl provides the horizontal distance of the towed vehicle relative to the mothership in time as the positon of the mothership is recorded by the gps the horizontal displacement of the towed vehicle can be calculated the array cable is driven by the horizontal and vertical displacements of the towed vehicle so the positons of the hydrophones can be calculated by dynamic analysis the testing items include diving rising and towing at depths of 1300 m and 2000 m the maneuver with a constant depth of 1300 m is considered for analysis as shown in fig 7 this survey is conducted from 13 20 00 to 15 20 00 on june 16 2019 with a towing speed of approximately 1 m s the hour and minute of the time are converted into second the time range including the simple diving and rising stages is selected to predict the positions of hydrophones as indicated using the red box owing to electromagnetic interference high frequency noise is filtered as shown in fig 8 the towed cable is driven by the filtered data this depth data is imported into the numerical model such that the start time is reset to zero according to the recorded data four points 1 2 3 and 4 are selected to represent the diving stage and 5 6 7 and 8 represent the rising stage the shape of the array cable at these selected points are analyzed later meanwhile the horizontal travel of the towed vehicle with respect to the gps is converted to the displacements with respect to the geodetic coordinate system cai et al 2011 as shown in fig 9 it is almost a straight line which demonstrates the feasibility to define the driving direction of the towed vehicle as the x axis of the towed vehicle according to the selected time of the depth data shown in fig 8 the x displacement of the towed vehicle with respect to time is shown in fig 10 and the y displacement is always zero the properties of the array cable is shown in table 1 3 3 verification subsequently this maneuver is simulated in matlab and the acceleration of nodes calculated in eq 8 are integrated to obtain the velocities and positions using ode15s wouwer 2014 the results of diving and rising are presented in figs 11 and 12 respectively to verify the accuracy of the dynamic analysis positions of cable are calculated by both the dynamic analysis and inversion calculation in the diving and rising stages respectively these points in the diving or rising stage are picked once in every eight continuous shots as the sparker shots once when the towed vehicle travels every 6 25 m the horizontal distance between adjacent points in the diving or rising stage is 50 m t b indicates the positon of the towed vehicle obtained from the depth gauge and is considered as the standard in this verification i c indicates the position of the array cable computed by the inversion calculation while d a denotes the results obtained by the dynamic analysis the numbers 1 2 3 etc are consistent with the selected points shown in fig 8 the shape of the cable provided by d a is the same with that by i c as shown in figs 11 and 12 however the depth provided by i c is approximately 5 m lower than that provided by d a in the diving stage as the towed vehicle dives continuously in this stage the towed vehicle ought to be located at the lowest position however the head of the array cable by the i c is lower than the towed vehicle at points 1 2 and 3 moreover the fold line exists at the head of the array cable these unreasonable phenomenon are generated by the incorrect assumption of the speed of the seismic wave the speed of the seismic wave varies with the depth sometime it s identified from the conductivity temperature depth vertical profiles krahmann et al 2009 yang et al 2010 on the other hand it can also be identified from the obtained seismic profiling for example to adjust the hydrophone positions velocity analysis is conducted twice to assess the generated hyperbolic reflection signals and velocity spectra based on the normal move out equation and common depth point gathers hutapea et al 2020 the speed of seismic wave is more convergent at a water depth of 800 1600 m than at 0 800 m and the deep span between the towed vehicle and the seafloor is much narrower than that between the towed vehicle and the sea surface therefore the seafloor reflection is adopted to locate the positions of hydrophones so that the uncertainty of the speed can be reduced colin et al 2020 hutapea et al 2020 anyway the trouble of the speed of the seismic waves is the inherent part of the inversion calculation and it is one weakness of the inversion calculation in comparison with the dynamic analysis moreover the depth is about 1300 m so the trace of the reflected wave from the surface is more than 2600 m this travel is completed in 1 7 s however this system continuously dives in this time instead of d p d p is obtained from eq 10 as illustrated in fig 13 as d p is larger than the real value x p provided by eq 11 is smaller than the real value this prediction is verified as the horizontal distance of the head of the array cable to the towed vehicle is less than 10 m as shown in fig 11 the positions of the array cable in the rising stage is shown in fig 12 indicating that the depth provided by the i c is 2 m higher than that given by dynamic analysis the explanation for the diving stage is also suitable for the rising stage the depth of hydrophone decreases after 1 7 s and the shortened depth increases the distance between the towed vehicle and the said hydrophone fig 13 shows that the head of the cable observed via i c is behand the one observed via d a although the time delay can be considered in the simple diving or rising considering it when the diving speed changes particularly when the towed vehicle moves up and down is difficult this is another weakness of the inversion calculation generally the results given by the dynamic analysis are reasonable slight oscillation is generated at time points 1 2 and 3 and this oscillation is generated by the hydrodynamic force closely related to the element length and relative velocity of the fluid the array cable is divided in 21 elements and 42 elements respectively so that the influence of the element length is analyzed fig 14 shows the cable shapes expressed with the elements 21 and 42 at time points 1 2 and 3 respectively the positions of the cable by elements 21 matches well with that by elements 42 and the oscillation amplitude of the elements 42 is indeed reduced compared to that of the elements 21 however the computational time of the elements 42 is more than two times longer than that of elements 21 moreover the elements 42 generates a matrix with a large size that consumes much memory of computer as the oscillation is slight and the cable shape given by elements 42 has no obvious superiority in predicting the positions of the hydrophone the elements 21 is used to model the array cable herein except the element length the osculation is also affected by the component of the relative velocity normal to the cable the slope in rising is smaller than that in diving as shown in fig 8 this indicates that the relative velocity normal to the cable in rising is smaller than that in diving the hydrodynamic force is insufficient to generate oscillation in rising stage with current element length as shown in fig 12 4 virtual maneuver and design study the straight shape of the array cable is appropriate for the reception of the seismic waves which improves the exploration resolution in another manner although the position of the array cable can be predicted by inversion calculation or interpolation referring to data recorded by a gyrocompass installed in the cable it is difficult to study the relations between the cable shape and the motions of the towed vehicle by inversion calculation the motivation of the towed vehicle originates from the towing cable that is driven by the winch installed on the mothership as shown in fig 1 the influence of the motions of the towed vehicle on the cable shape is analyzed herein which promotes the control of the winch and the installation of the hydrophones williams 2006 zand et al 2009 in addition the lateral current is an important item that deflects the positon of the array cable therefore three virtual maneuvers diving and rising depth change and lateral current are set to study the relations between the cable shape and the interference factors in this section the cable used in virtual maneuvers is the same as the one used in the first deep sea trial and the cable properties are presented in table 1 consistent with the real exploration the speed of the towed vehicle is always 1 m s in the x direction 4 1 diving and rising as the towed vehicle is 2000 kg and the towing speed is approximately 1 m s the surface wave has non ignorable effects on the heave motion of the towed vehicle besides the surface wave the towing cable is shortened or lengthened to keep the towed vehicle at a safe distance from the seabed this operation promotes the towed vehicle diving and rising to study the behavior of the array cable under diving and rising the towed vehicle moves with the sine function as shown by the red line in fig 15 the amplitude is 3 m and the period is 60 s six points on the array cable are selected and s0 s10 s60 s110 s160 and s210 indicate that the distances of these points to the towed vehicle are 0 m 10 m 60 m 110 m 160 m and 210 m respectively s0 and s160 represent the first and last hydrophones installed in the cable the vertical displacement of the cable with respect to the horizontal displacement is shown in fig 15 initially the first and the last nodes are located at the 0 0 2000 and 210 0 2000 respectively the time points for s10 s60 s110 and s160 start to vertical oscillate around 0 5 s 9 5 s 19 0 s and 32 5 s respectively they move to the first wave crest at 17 0 s 32 0 s 45 5 s and 59 0 s respectively this study indicates that a sine wave propagates along the x direction when the head of the cable oscillates in the y direction and travels along the x direction this helps predict the position of the cable when the heave and surge motions of the towed vehicle are known it takes approximately 600 s for the oscillation to become stable although the head of the cable oscillates with an amplitude of 3 m the oscillation amplitude is damped with respect to its length as shown in fig 16 it has exponential decay and about 65 of the amplitude is damped out at 50 m indicating that the seawater severely dampens the oscillation however the minimum oscillation amplitude is not at the end of the cable but at 200 m in this model according to the real heave motion of the towed vehicle and the requirements of the hydrophones on the orientation of the cable in acquiring seismic waves the ideal position to install hydrophones could be found herein 4 2 depth change sometimes the towed vehicle needs to change the diving depth as shown at the end of fig 7 to study the behavior of the array cable with the change in depth the depth of the towed vehicle is changed from 2000 m to 1990 m this operation starts after a travel of 50 m and finishes within 5 s as shown by the red line in fig 17 it takes about 750 s for the entire cable changes to a new depth owing to the momentum conservation the cable dives slightly before rising as show in the red box the upward motion of the front node of one element generates a rotation motion that forces the rear node to move downwards and the shift value is closely related to the element length although the towed vehicle starts the depth change at 50 m s160 and s210 start this motion at 70 9 m and 82 9 m respectively as shown in fig 18 this motion is propagated in the x direction which helps predict the cable shape if the towed vehicle changes depth during exploration 4 3 lateral current because no reflection medium in present in the horizontal direction the inversion calculation cannot consider the lateral drift generated commonly by the lateral current as the diameter of the array cable is 0 046 m the influence of the lateral current cannot be ignored the current meter can be installed on the towed vehicle to record the current information as the array cable is non buoyant in seawater it moves after the towed vehicle it assumes that the current changes with x axis defined herein and the current recorded by the towed vehicle also passes through the array cable the shift of the cable can be easily predicted using dynamic analysis if the current is known to study the influence of the lateral current y directional current with a speed of 0 3 m s is set in the x axis which starts from 50 m to 150 m as shown in fig 19 the maximum shifts of s110 s160 and s210 are 20 5 m 30 1 m and 42 3 m respectively this maximum shift is located a little to the front of the mid of the current region and the cable returns quickly after the maximum shift even though the lateral current disappears after 350 m the lateral shifts of s10 s60 s110 and s160 are 0 2 m 1 2 m 1 7 m and 1 8 m respectively at the point where the x axis is 500 m a considerable distance is required for the shifted part of the cable to return back because the current meter is installed on the towed vehicle the shift of the hydrophones can be predicted when the towed vehicle passes a current region after the towed vehicle passes the 150 m boundary it takes 36 7 s 81 7 s 124 6 s and 169 5 s for the s60 s110 s160 and s210 to meet the maximum shifts as shown in fig 20 this maneuver indicates that the lateral current has severe influence on the array cable and stabilizing device ought to be used in the real test one proper stabilizer could be found efficiently using dynamic analysis 5 conclusions dynamic analysis is proposed herein to predict the positions of hydrophones for deep towed seismic arrays the dynamics of the array cable is considered using the lumped mass method and loads acting on the cable elements are expressed with respect to the relative velocity element frame dynamic analysis is conducted without singularity and the positions of hydrophones are obtained according to the data recorded in one deep sea trial in comparison with the depth data recorded by a depth gauge the traditional inversion calculation shows depth shifts of 5 m and 2 m in the diving and rising stages respectively while the dynamic analysis provides more accurate results the cable shape and hydrophone positions calculated by the dynamic analysis can be valuable reference data to identify the uncertainty of the inversion calculation and improve the exploration resolution additionally in accordance with the working conditions of the deep towed system three virtual maneuvers diving and rising depth change and lateral current are designed to study the influence of the motions of the towed vehicle and the current on the behavior of the array cable these studies reveal the attenuation rule of the oscillation amplitude and the propagation rule of the x directional wave generated by the y directional oscillations according to the requirements of the hydrophones on the cable shape in receiving the seismic wave these studies may guide exploration and improve the accuracy of data acquisition moreover analysis results reveal that the lateral current has a considerable influence on the cable shape the equipment that stabilizes the array cable can be efficiently developed using dynamic analysis credit authorship contribution statement xiangqian zhu conceptualization methodology software formal

21371,before analyzing the distribution of submarine minerals the positions of hydrophones installed in seismic array cables must be known generally the hydrophone positions are computed through inversion calculation based on assumptions that conflict with the facts and some assumed parameters are adjusted repeatedly to reduce the spatial aliasing in seismic reflection profiling furthermore the inversion calculation cannot study the relations between the cable shape and working conditions dynamic analysis is proposed to predict the hydrophone positions and investigate these relations herein the array cable is modeled by the lumped mass method with respect to the relative velocity element frame the results of the dynamic analysis and inversion calculation are verified using the recorded depth data although the cable shape by inversion calculation is the same as that by dynamic analysis the cable depth by inversion calculation demonstrates an obvious shift in comparison with the depth data meanwhile the results obtained via dynamic analysis match well with the depth data additionally three virtual maneuvers diving and rising depth change and lateral current are designed to study the relation between the cable shape and working conditions the obtained results may help guide exploration and promote the development of exploration equipment keywords deep towed seismic

hypotheses result in a depth error of tens of meters thus the inversion method can be used in the exploration of submarine oil and gas fields yilmaz 2001 but is not suitable for the exploration of gas hydrates as such exploration requires high resolution to reduce the uncertainties of inversion calculation depth gauges and gyrocompasses are embedded in the cables to obtain their depths and orientations respectively the genetic algorithm was introduced into the inversion calculation by he he et al 2009 and the seismic velocity distribution was determined to calculate the positions of the seismic source and the streamer by marsset marsset et al 2018 except for the application of gyrocompasses and velocity analysis seafloor reflection was adopted to reduce the uncertainties generated by the sea surface reflection colin et al 2020 hutapea et al 2020 however these methods still have problems 1 as there is no reflection medium in the horizontal direction neither the depth gauge nor the gyrocompass can identify the lateral drift of the cable 2 the computational error of the gyrocompass accumulates with working time sun et al 2013 thus these sensors are not suitable for long time exploration 3 these sensors installed in the cable interfere with hydrophones and the quantity and positions of installation are limited 4 the cable shape is computed using the recorded data however analyzing the relations between cable shape and interference factors is impossible consequently it is impossible to study the control mechanism that keeps the array cables straight as the inherent properties of the cable are known and the motions of the cable are restrained by the motions of the towed vehicle recorded by the installed sensors the positions of the hydrophones can be calculated in time via a numerical simulation additionally the influences of the pitch heave motions of the towed vehicle and the lateral current on the cable shape can be studied using virtual maneuvers till date several numerical modeling methods of underwater cables have been established that help analyze the response of the cable to design variables ablow ablow and schechter 1983 and dowling 1988 modeled the towed cable using the finite difference method they studied the influence of towing speed and drag coefficients on the diving depth and cable tension the towing cable of the multi parameter profiling system was studied by buckham buckham et al 2003 and soylu soylu et al 2008 using the lumped mass method the dynamic characteristics and the stability control were analyzed using virtual maneuvers the path in the water model was proposed to predict the positions of seismic streamer cables by grindheim grindheim et al 2018 2019 the united states naval research laboratory developed a deep towed seismic exploration system to study shallow sediments in the deep sea the quasi static method was used to analyze the influence of the resistance coefficient and weight of the towed vehicle on the cable tension and diving depth fagot 1986 milburn and fagot 1979 the above mentioned studies denote the following inferences 1 position prediction and stability control are two focus areas for research on the array cable and dynamic analysis is one common solution 2 majority of the published studies focus on the theoretical analysis using virtual simulations 3 the finite difference method and the lumped mass method are widely used to construct the dynamic model of the array cable the finite difference method shows divergence when the tension is near zero whereas the large oscillation invalidates the lumped mass method burgess 1992 4 there is a lack of research on dynamic analysis of the array cable for the deep towed seismic exploration system as the cable shape is affected by the motions of the towed vehicle and the current in time and the stability control of the cable is closely related to its dynamic behaviors dynamic analysis is conducted herein to complete the position prediction and stability control of the deep towed seismic array cable to realize the dynamic analysis the dynamic model of the array cable is first established using the lumped mass method zhu and yoo 2015 2016 zhu demonstrated that the lumped mass method is more robust than the finite difference method in analyzing underwater cables and the singularity of the lumped mass method was solved by the relative velocity element frame zhu and yoo 2017 to analyze the disturbance of the towed array generated by the submarine propeller the lumped mass method was used to construct the dynamic model of the towed array cable by du du et al 2019 second we reproduce the marine environment of the assigned maneuver in accordance with the data recorded by the installed sensors on the towed vehicle the motions of the towed vehicle and current affect the cable shape the influence of current on the steering was studied by walus waluś et al 2014 therefore the motion of towed vehicle and current information are required for position prediction fortunately the deep towed multi channel seismic array analyzed herein is equipped with an altimeter a depth gauge an ultra short baseline usbl to record the height to sea floor depth and position of the towed vehicle respectively the motions of the towed vehicle are treated as kinematic constraint that restrains the displacement of the array cable finally we simulate the assigned maneuver and output the positions of the hydrophones the simulation program is compiled using matlab lindfield and penny 2018 and the accelerations of cable nodes having the same locations as those of the hydrophones are integrated to obtain the positions of the hydrophones the governing equation of the array cable is shown in section 2 and the mechanism of the inversion calculation is illustrated in section 3 the accuracy of both the dynamic analysis and inversion calculation are assessed by the depth data recorded by the depth gauge in one deep sea trial design studies are conducted in section 4 and the relations between the cables shape and the interference factors are illustrated through three virtual maneuvers section 5 provides a summary and indicates that dynamic analysis is a feasible and efficient tool for deep towed seismic array 2 dynamic modeling of array cable the array cable comprises a multi stage combination of digital packages connectors and pu tube as shown in fig 2 there are internal ropes and hydrophones inside the pu tube which are used to resist the axial extension and record the seismic waves respectively the pu tube is also filled with incompressible oil such that the buoyancy of the cable can balance out its gravity the array cable is 210 m long and has a uniform diameter of 46 mm owing to its slender geometry and deformability the array cable is simplified as underwater cable regardless of the bending and torsion in modeling the lumped mass method is used to create a dynamic model of the cable which decomposes the cable into n elements as shown in fig 3 e g i defined by two adjacent nodes represents the orientation of the cable element as shown in eq 1 n g i is a 3 1 vector indicates the x y and z displacement of the ith node in the global frame the node connected to the towed vehicle is named n g 1 and the tail node is named n g n 1 1 e g i n g i 1 n g i the body frame of the towed vehicle is defined at a point where the array cable is tied to the towed vehicle as shown in fig 3 this frame is fixed with the towed vehicle and the x axis always directs the driving direction the z axis is directed upward and the y axis is defined by the right hand rule the global frame is right above the frame of the towed vehicle and located at the still water level the axes of the global frame are the same directions with the initial axes of the towed vehicle as the first node of cable is zero in the x axis of the global frame the rest nodes are located in the negative x axis initially to solve singularity of the element fixed frame of the cable model the relative velocity element frame is defined by vectors of the element orientation and the relative velocity of the fluid the z axis of the cable element has the same direction as the element orientation and the x and y axis change with the relative velocity of the cable in seawater as shown in fig 4 unit vector z i directs the orientation of the ith element e g i unit vector x i is the normal vector of plane p 1 composed of the unit vector z i and relative velocity v g i according to the right hand rule the unit vector y i is perpendicular to the plane p 2 that is composed of unit vectors z i and x i the expression of the ith element is shown in eq 2 2 z i e g i e g i x i z i v g i z i v g i y i z i x i as the frame axes are defined with respect to the global frame the transformation matrix a i is expressed by eq 3 3 a i x i y i z i the array cable is mainly subjected to the internal tension and damping force hydrodynamic force and self inertial force in water the tension and damping force are functions of the axial extension and the extension speed respectively they have the same direction as that of the element orientation vector the hydrodynamic force is proportional to the square of the relative velocity of the cable in water referring to zhu and yoo 2017 all the loads are expressed in eq 4 4 t b i π d c 2 4 e ε b i d b i c d a i t n g i 1 n g i z f w i π d c 2 4 l 0 ρ c π d c 2 4 l 0 ρ f g f d i 1 2 c n ρ f d c l i v b i v b i t b i the cable tension is defined by the axial strain ε b i elastic modulus e and cable diameter d c ε b i is defined by the current length of the ith element l i and the initial length l 0 as shown in eq 5 the damping force d b i is expressed by the velocity difference between the terminal nodes in the z direction with respect to the element fixed frame as n g i is the velocity of the node with respect to the global frame the transformation matrix a i t is used to convert the velocity from the global frame to the element fixed frame c d denotes the damping coefficient of the cable f w i is the weight of the cable in water and g indicates that the force has the same direction as that of the gravity acceleration ρ c and ρ f are the densities of the cable and water respectively f d i is the hydrodynamic force acting on the ith element v b i and v g i are the relative velocities of the ith element with respect to the element fixed frame and global frame respectively the average velocity of the terminal nodes is used to express the velocity of the said element as shown in eq 5 v f i is the velocity of water particle at the ith node 5 ε b i l i l 0 l 0 l i e g i t e g i v b i a i t v g i v g i n g i 1 n g i v f i 1 v f i 2 owing to the added mass effects the mass matrix of the ith element in the element fixed frame is given by eq 6 where c a is the coefficient of the added mass as the cable is continuous in the z direction the added mass is ignored along the cable axis 6 m b i π d c 2 4 l 0 ρ c c a π d c 2 4 l 0 i ρ f 0 0 0 π d c 2 4 l 0 ρ c c a π d c 2 4 l 0 ρ f 0 0 0 π d c 2 4 l 0 ρ c as the ith node is the connection of the ith and i 1 th elements the mass matrix of the ith node m g i is expressed using the mass matrix of the element m b i 1 and m b i as shown in eq 7 the transformation matrix a i is used to convert the mass matrices from the element fixed frame to the global frame 7 m g i 1 2 a i 1 m b i 1 a i 1 t 1 2 a i m b i a i t finally the loads acting on an element are shared equally by its terminal nodes meanwhile the governing equation for the ith node is determined by the loads acting on the i 1 th and ith elements as given in eq 8 n g i represents the acceleration of the ith node

process involving data analysis and optimization the genetic algorithm data driven and machine learning are efficient approaches to identify uncertainties of inversion based on the obtained seismic profiling he et al 2009 ovcharenko et al 2019 pilz et al 2020 as the power of the plasma sparker carried by the towed vehicle is not sufficiently high to generate sub bottom profiling in the first sea trail implementing these inversion calculation algorithms is difficult in addition this paper focuses on numerical simulation and the basic sea surface inversion is explained herein the hydrophone receives the direct wave and records the travel time t d meanwhile the travel time of the seismic wave reflected by the sea surface t r is also determined as shown in fig 5 e denotes the symmetry point of c with respect to the sea surface according to the pythagorean theorem maor 2019 eq 9 can be obtained for the right triangles adc and ade 9 a d 2 a c 2 d p d t 2 a d 2 a c 2 d p d t 2 as the speed of the seismic wave changes from 1480 m s to 1540 m s within water depth of 0 1500 m in the south china sea zhang et al 2010 we ignore the velocity difference at different depths and assume the mean speed of the seismic wave v s is 1500 m s as the towed vehicle carries a depth gauge the depth of the towed vehicle d t is known thus the depth of the hydrophone can subsequently be calculated by eq 10 10 d p v s t r 2 v s t d 2 4 d t the horizontal distance from the said hydrophone to the towed vehicle x p is given by the obtained depth d p as shown in eq 11 11 x p t d v s 2 d p d t 2 as the position of the towed vehicle is known the position of the cable can be identified by the horizontal distances and depths for all hydrophones 3 2 deep sea exploration and data preprocess with the national research fund support the first deep sea trial was conducted by the towed vehicle kuiyang designed by the first institute of oceanography of ministry of natural resources wei zheng rong and liu 2020 as shown in fig 6 a and the survey area is near the northern latitude 19 51 and east longitude 115 10 in the south china sea as shown in fig 6 b kuiyang is made by stainless steel and expected to operate at a depth no less than 2000 m it is equipped with a plasma sparker 2000 w rated power shots pulse signal 500 2500 hz with an output level of 214 db and each hydrophone can receive the direct wave huang et al 2015 it also carries an altimeter a depth gauge and an usbl the data recorded by these sensors are transferred to the mothership through a towing cable in time the 210 m array cable has 48 digital hydrophones with a 3 125 m spacing and the 1st and 48th hydrophones are located at 10 m and 160 m respectively to maintain the distance between the towed vehicle and seabed at 100 m the winch of the mothership winds or unwinds the towing cable automatically according to the data provided by the altimeter this operation generates severe motion in the towed vehicle and disturbs the array cable fortunately the depth of the towed vehicle is recorded by the depth gauge and the usbl provides the horizontal distance of the towed vehicle relative to the mothership in time as the positon of the mothership is recorded by the gps the horizontal displacement of the towed vehicle can be calculated the array cable is driven by the horizontal and vertical displacements of the towed vehicle so the positons of the hydrophones can be calculated by dynamic analysis the testing items include diving rising and towing at depths of 1300 m and 2000 m the maneuver with a constant depth of 1300 m is considered for analysis as shown in fig 7 this survey is conducted from 13 20 00 to 15 20 00 on june 16 2019 with a towing speed of approximately 1 m s the hour and minute of the time are converted into second the time range including the simple diving and rising stages is selected to predict the positions of hydrophones as indicated using the red box owing to electromagnetic interference high frequency noise is filtered as shown in fig 8 the towed cable is driven by the filtered data this depth data is imported into the numerical model such that the start time is reset to zero according to the recorded data four points 1 2 3 and 4 are selected to represent the diving stage and 5 6 7 and 8 represent the rising stage the shape of the array cable at these selected points are analyzed later meanwhile the horizontal travel of the towed vehicle with respect to the gps is converted to the displacements with respect to the geodetic coordinate system cai et al 2011 as shown in fig 9 it is almost a straight line which demonstrates the feasibility to define the driving direction of the towed vehicle as the x axis of the towed vehicle according to the selected time of the depth data shown in fig 8 the x displacement of the towed vehicle with respect to time is shown in fig 10 and the y displacement is always zero the properties of the array cable is shown in table 1 3 3 verification subsequently this maneuver is simulated in matlab and the acceleration of nodes calculated in eq 8 are integrated to obtain the velocities and positions using ode15s wouwer 2014 the results of diving and rising are presented in figs 11 and 12 respectively to verify the accuracy of the dynamic analysis positions of cable are calculated by both the dynamic analysis and inversion calculation in the diving and rising stages respectively these points in the diving or rising stage are picked once in every eight continuous shots as the sparker shots once when the towed vehicle travels every 6 25 m the horizontal distance between adjacent points in the diving or rising stage is 50 m t b indicates the positon of the towed vehicle obtained from the depth gauge and is considered as the standard in this verification i c indicates the position of the array cable computed by the inversion calculation while d a denotes the results obtained by the dynamic analysis the numbers 1 2 3 etc are consistent with the selected points shown in fig 8 the shape of the cable provided by d a is the same with that by i c as shown in figs 11 and 12 however the depth provided by i c is approximately 5 m lower than that provided by d a in the diving stage as the towed vehicle dives continuously in this stage the towed vehicle ought to be located at the lowest position however the head of the array cable by the i c is lower than the towed vehicle at points 1 2 and 3 moreover the fold line exists at the head of the array cable these unreasonable phenomenon are generated by the incorrect assumption of the speed of the seismic wave the speed of the seismic wave varies with the depth sometime it s identified from the conductivity temperature depth vertical profiles krahmann et al 2009 yang et al 2010 on the other hand it can also be identified from the obtained seismic profiling for example to adjust the hydrophone positions velocity analysis is conducted twice to assess the generated hyperbolic reflection signals and velocity spectra based on the normal move out equation and common depth point gathers hutapea et al 2020 the speed of seismic wave is more convergent at a water depth of 800 1600 m than at 0 800 m and the deep span between the towed vehicle and the seafloor is much narrower than that between the towed vehicle and the sea surface therefore the seafloor reflection is adopted to locate the positions of hydrophones so that the uncertainty of the speed can be reduced colin et al 2020 hutapea et al 2020 anyway the trouble of the speed of the seismic waves is the inherent part of the inversion calculation and it is one weakness of the inversion calculation in comparison with the dynamic analysis moreover the depth is about 1300 m so the trace of the reflected wave from the surface is more than 2600 m this travel is completed in 1 7 s however this system continuously dives in this time instead of d p d p is obtained from eq 10 as illustrated in fig 13 as d p is larger than the real value x p provided by eq 11 is smaller than the real value this prediction is verified as the horizontal distance of the head of the array cable to the towed vehicle is less than 10 m as shown in fig 11 the positions of the array cable in the rising stage is shown in fig 12 indicating that the depth provided by the i c is 2 m higher than that given by dynamic analysis the explanation for the diving stage is also suitable for the rising stage the depth of hydrophone decreases after 1 7 s and the shortened depth increases the distance between the towed vehicle and the said hydrophone fig 13 shows that the head of the cable observed via i c is behand the one observed via d a although the time delay can be considered in the simple diving or rising considering it when the diving speed changes particularly when the towed vehicle moves up and down is difficult this is another weakness of the inversion calculation generally the results given by the dynamic analysis are reasonable slight oscillation is generated at time points 1 2 and 3 and this oscillation is generated by the hydrodynamic force closely related to the element length and relative velocity of the fluid the array cable is divided in 21 elements and 42 elements respectively so that the influence of the element length is analyzed fig 14 shows the cable shapes expressed with the elements 21 and 42 at time points 1 2 and 3 respectively the positions of the cable by elements 21 matches well with that by elements 42 and the oscillation amplitude of the elements 42 is indeed reduced compared to that of the elements 21 however the computational time of the elements 42 is more than two times longer than that of elements 21 moreover the elements 42 generates a matrix with a large size that consumes much memory of computer as the oscillation is slight and the cable shape given by elements 42 has no obvious superiority in predicting the positions of the hydrophone the elements 21 is used to model the array cable herein except the element length the osculation is also affected by the component of the relative velocity normal to the cable the slope in rising is smaller than that in diving as shown in fig 8 this indicates that the relative velocity normal to the cable in rising is smaller than that in diving the hydrodynamic force is insufficient to generate oscillation in rising stage with current element length as shown in fig 12 4 virtual maneuver and design study the straight shape of the array cable is appropriate for the reception of the seismic waves which improves the exploration resolution in another manner although the position of the array cable can be predicted by inversion calculation or interpolation referring to data recorded by a gyrocompass installed in the cable it is difficult to study the relations between the cable shape and the motions of the towed vehicle by inversion calculation the motivation of the towed vehicle originates from the towing cable that is driven by the winch installed on the mothership as shown in fig 1 the influence of the motions of the towed vehicle on the cable shape is analyzed herein which promotes the control of the winch and the installation of the hydrophones williams 2006 zand et al 2009 in addition the lateral current is an important item that deflects the positon of the array cable therefore three virtual maneuvers diving and rising depth change and lateral current are set to study the relations between the cable shape and the interference factors in this section the cable used in virtual maneuvers is the same as the one used in the first deep sea trial and the cable properties are presented in table 1 consistent with the real exploration the speed of the towed vehicle is always 1 m s in the x direction 4 1 diving and rising as the towed vehicle is 2000 kg and the towing speed is approximately 1 m s the surface wave has non ignorable effects on the heave motion of the towed vehicle besides the surface wave the towing cable is shortened or lengthened to keep the towed vehicle at a safe distance from the seabed this operation promotes the towed vehicle diving and rising to study the behavior of the array cable under diving and rising the towed vehicle moves with the sine function as shown by the red line in fig 15 the amplitude is 3 m and the period is 60 s six points on the array cable are selected and s0 s10 s60 s110 s160 and s210 indicate that the distances of these points to the towed vehicle are 0 m 10 m 60 m 110 m 160 m and 210 m respectively s0 and s160 represent the first and last hydrophones installed in the cable the vertical displacement of the cable with respect to the horizontal displacement is shown in fig 15 initially the first and the last nodes are located at the 0 0 2000 and 210 0 2000 respectively the time points for s10 s60 s110 and s160 start to vertical oscillate around 0 5 s 9 5 s 19 0 s and 32 5 s respectively they move to the first wave crest at 17 0 s 32 0 s 45 5 s and 59 0 s respectively this study indicates that a sine wave propagates along the x direction when the head of the cable oscillates in the y direction and travels along the x direction this helps predict the position of the cable when the heave and surge motions of the towed vehicle are known it takes approximately 600 s for the oscillation to become stable although the head of the cable oscillates with an amplitude of 3 m the oscillation amplitude is damped with respect to its length as shown in fig 16 it has exponential decay and about 65 of the amplitude is damped out at 50 m indicating that the seawater severely dampens the oscillation however the minimum oscillation amplitude is not at the end of the cable but at 200 m in this model according to the real heave motion of the towed vehicle and the requirements of the hydrophones on the orientation of the cable in acquiring seismic waves the ideal position to install hydrophones could be found herein 4 2 depth change sometimes the towed vehicle needs to change the diving depth as shown at the end of fig 7 to study the behavior of the array cable with the change in depth the depth of the towed vehicle is changed from 2000 m to 1990 m this operation starts after a travel of 50 m and finishes within 5 s as shown by the red line in fig 17 it takes about 750 s for the entire cable changes to a new depth owing to the momentum conservation the cable dives slightly before rising as show in the red box the upward motion of the front node of one element generates a rotation motion that forces the rear node to move downwards and the shift value is closely related to the element length although the towed vehicle starts the depth change at 50 m s160 and s210 start this motion at 70 9 m and 82 9 m respectively as shown in fig 18 this motion is propagated in the x direction which helps predict the cable shape if the towed vehicle changes depth during exploration 4 3 lateral current because no reflection medium in present in the horizontal direction the inversion calculation cannot consider the lateral drift generated commonly by the lateral current as the diameter of the array cable is 0 046 m the influence of the lateral current cannot be ignored the current meter can be installed on the towed vehicle to record the current information as the array cable is non buoyant in seawater it moves after the towed vehicle it assumes that the current changes with x axis defined herein and the current recorded by the towed vehicle also passes through the array cable the shift of the cable can be easily predicted using dynamic analysis if the current is known to study the influence of the lateral current y directional current with a speed of 0 3 m s is set in the x axis which starts from 50 m to 150 m as shown in fig 19 the maximum shifts of s110 s160 and s210 are 20 5 m 30 1 m and 42 3 m respectively this maximum shift is located a little to the front of the mid of the current region and the cable returns quickly after the maximum shift even though the lateral current disappears after 350 m the lateral shifts of s10 s60 s110 and s160 are 0 2 m 1 2 m 1 7 m and 1 8 m respectively at the point where the x axis is 500 m a considerable distance is required for the shifted part of the cable to return back because the current meter is installed on the towed vehicle the shift of the hydrophones can be predicted when the towed vehicle passes a current region after the towed vehicle passes the 150 m boundary it takes 36 7 s 81 7 s 124 6 s and 169 5 s for the s60 s110 s160 and s210 to meet the maximum shifts as shown in fig 20 this maneuver indicates that the lateral current has severe influence on the array cable and stabilizing device ought to be used in the real test one proper stabilizer could be found efficiently using dynamic analysis 5 conclusions dynamic analysis is proposed herein to predict the positions of hydrophones for deep towed seismic arrays the dynamics of the array cable is considered using the lumped mass method and loads acting on the cable elements are expressed with respect to the relative velocity element frame dynamic analysis is conducted without singularity and the positions of hydrophones are obtained according to the data recorded in one deep sea trial in comparison with the depth data recorded by a depth gauge the traditional inversion calculation shows depth shifts of 5 m and 2 m in the diving and rising stages respectively while the dynamic analysis provides more accurate results the cable shape and hydrophone positions calculated by the dynamic analysis can be valuable reference data to identify the uncertainty of the inversion calculation and improve the exploration resolution additionally in accordance with the working conditions of the deep towed system three virtual maneuvers diving and rising depth change and lateral current are designed to study the influence of the motions of the towed vehicle and the current on the behavior of the array cable these studies reveal the attenuation rule of the oscillation amplitude and the propagation rule of the x directional wave generated by the y directional oscillations according to the requirements of the hydrophones on the cable shape in receiving the seismic wave these studies may guide exploration and improve the accuracy of data acquisition moreover analysis results reveal that the lateral current has a considerable influence on the cable shape the equipment that stabilizes the array cable can be efficiently developed using dynamic analysis credit authorship contribution statement xiangqian zhu conceptualization methodology software formal

21372,the three dimensional flow around the four cylinder and five cylinder arrays are numerically studied at re 3900 by large eddy simulation les by selecting eight spacing ratios l d 2 0 7 0 and three incidence angles α 0 45 the influence of the center cylinder on the flow characteristics and interference effects of the four cylinder array is discussed different spacing ratios can be divided into three categories with respect to flow regions of the multi cylinder small gap flow regime l d 2 0 3 5 critical flow regime l d 3 5 5 0 and large gap flow regime l d 5 0 7 0 for cases with small spacing ratios the influence of the center cylinder is very notable on the flow characteristics of the four cylinder array as the ratio increases the influence of the center cylinder gradually decreases on the surrounding cylinders in the multi cylinder array on the other hand the direction of the incoming flow also affects the flow characteristics of both four cylinder and five cylinder arrays the development of the shear layer is strongly influenced by the center cylinder for the upstream cylinders at α 45 boundary vortex flux components flow characteristics and fluid force coefficients change significantly with adding the center cylinder for the four cylinders keywords four circular cylinders center cylinder spacing ratio incidence angle flow patterns interference effect 1 introduction the multi cylinder composed of a group of bluff structures is common in engineering fields such as the cylinders of offshore drilling platforms towering buildings suspension bridges and cooling towers lam and zou 2010 wang et al 2013 ma et al 2017 etc the four cylinder array and the five cylinder array with equal spacing are widely used as the base of offshore superstructures such as offshore wind turbines offshore launch pads and offshore lighthouses moreover the vertical cylinder group which acts as the fixed support for coastal buildings or water level monitoring system is also composed of four cylinder array or five cylinder system when the fluid flows through the cylinders the free shear layers interfere with each other causing the dramatic change of the forces exerting on cylinder arrays and the flow patterns of the wake the complexity of strong mutual interference effect and free shear layer interference because of cylinder arrays has aroused

cylinder in detail meanwhile investigations found in references zhang and zhou 2001 islam et al 2016a were carried out by a numerical simulation along with an experiment on the flow characteristics of three tandem square cylinders and three side by side cylinders respectively the two papers mentioned above analyzed and explored the evolution mechanism of the flow vortex structures of the multi cylinder array lam and lo 1992 lam et al 2003 2008 experimentally investigated the flow patterns of four cylinders and the corresponding changes of the strauhal number at the subcritical reynolds number of 2100 the main research parameters included the spacing ratio and incidence angle subsequently they used a piezoelectric load cell to obtain the mean and fluctuating forces of the four cylinders in the square arrangement and the associated measurements of vortex shedding frequency at reynolds number ranging from 2 25 104 to 4 5 104 in addition to experimental research numerical simulations were also used to study the flow characteristics around 2d and 3d four cylinder arrays at low reynolds number the results show that the flow patterns depended on reynolds number re spacing ratio l d and aspect ratio h d and three patterns around the four cylinders were defined lam and zou 2007 2010 did the experiment and numerical simulation which mainly studied the flow around four cylinders with four different spacing ratios l d 1 5 5 0 at re 1 128 104 to 1 982 104 it was found that the pattern of vortex shedding behind upstream cylinders was distinctly changed for the case with l d 3 5 the two key parameters of spacing ratio and re would alter the flow characteristics of the four cylinder array at the small reynolds number re 200 they used numerical calculation methods to study the influences of different spacing ratios l d and aspect ratios h d on the 3d flow characteristics of the four cylinder square array the development of the free shear layer of the cylinder was significantly influenced by the spacing ratios aspect ratios and the condition of the non slip wall which has a significant effect on the pressure as well as forces of the four cylinder array zou et al 2008 2011 used large eddy simulation les for investigating 3d turbulence characteristics of four cylinder array in an in line square with l d 1 5 and 3 0 at re 1 5 104 later they used the finite volume method fvm to study the influence of the spacing ratios l d 1 2 at low reynolds number re 200 on the 3d flow characteristics of diamond shaped four cylinder group comparing with the experimental results from the water tank the numerical method was validated their study found that the transition from the narrow gap flow pattern to the eddy current impact pattern occurred at the spacing ratio of 3 0 tong et al 2014 numerically simulated the 3d flow around a square array with a small spacing ratio and different reynolds number ranging from 100 to 500 analyzing the effects of reynolds number on the vortex pattern of the four cylinder group and classifying them into four flow regimes meanwhile the fluid force coefficients changed significantly with the transition from one regime to another and the time averaged drag coefficients of the upstream cylinders were much larger than those of downstream cylinders for the single cylinder case the peak frequencies of lift and drag forces were nearly identical wang et al 2013 conducted a physical test on the flow of four cylinder square array at re 8000 the effects of different spacing ratios l d and incidence angle α on the flow characteristics were investigated the mutual interference effect was also explained the flow interference between cylinders was complex in the four cylinder array according to the combination of α and l d values which may be asynchronous quasi periodic and so on most of the above investigators studied the flow characteristics of multi cylinder groups with large reynolds numbers but the study of cylinder groups under small reynolds numbers was also worthy of attention bao et al 2010 performed a 2d numerical study by using second order characteristic based split finite element algorithm which studied flow around an in line array of six square cylinders with different spacing ratios 1 5 15 at re 100 according to the change of gap spacing the flow pattern of multi cylinder array could be divided into six flow regimes for the gap region around the wake mode transition there were two different lifting force fluctuation jumping mechanisms han et al 2013 used the spectral element method to numerically study the 2d flow around four cylinders in square arrangement at spacing ratios l d 1 5 4 0 re 200 by considering two incidence angles of 0 and 45 under a certain reynolds number the spacing ratio had a great influence on the flow patterns and three flow regimes could be observed in four cylinders at two incidence angles gao et al 2017 numerically studied the 2d flow characteristics of the square arranged four cylinder group with different spacing ratios l d 1 5 5 0 at low reynolds number range re 100 1000 the results indicated that the flow characteristics behind a group of four cylinders are obviously controlled by the two key parameter listed before l d and re with the increasing re the transition of the flow pattern proceeded rapidly and the value of the force coefficient correspondingly appeared to fluctuate strongly in addition to the above researches on the four cylinder array the investigation of the multi cylinder group with more cylinders also attracted researchers attention by making use of the piv technique ma et al 2017 conducted the experiment on the flow around a nine cylinder array in square at four different spacing ratios l d 1 5 to 3 0 and subcritical reynolds numbers re 1500 to 5000 they mainly analyzed the influence of the spacing ratio and the reynolds number on the fluid force coefficients and explained the wake field characteristics of the cylinder compared with the reynolds number l d has more severe effects on the wake field characteristics and fluid forces nicollei and eames 2011 applied a high precision calculation method to calculate the flow around a group of cylinders with fixed diameter ratios at re 2100 the influence of void fraction was studied by exploring the flow characteristics of cylinder groups the vortices variation characteristics in the wake of the cylinder groups were revealed and three typical flow patterns were observed islam et al 2016b studied the effect of spacing ratio on the 2d flow characteristics of five rectangular square cylinders based on the lattice boltzmann method lbm with a reynolds number of 150 the characteristics of the related parameters were analyzed such as the fluid force coefficients vortex shedding frequency and other parameters of the square cylinder they found that the maximum value of the mean drag coefficient appeared at gap spacing of 0 5 the above literature mainly studied the effects of the spacing ratio and the incidence angle on the mutual interference effect and the flow characteristics of four cylinders and multiple cylinders at low re bao et al 2010 han et al 2013 gao et al 2017 respectively in addition at the large reynolds numbers compared with the 2d models the three dimensional numerical models are capable to simulate the flow characteristics around the cylinder and explain the vortex transportation as well as the conversion mechanism furthermore few research work reveal the flow characteristics in the turbulent flow regime after adding the 5th cylinder to the center of a four cylinder array at the subcritical reynolds number together with the combined effect of the spacing ratio and the incidence angle at present the research on the flow and mutual interference mechanism of multiple cylinders can be further investigated in this paper the main research parameters include three kinds of incidence angles and seven different spacing ratios the flow characteristics and boundary vortex flux characteristics of four cylinder and five cylinder arrays will be uncovered respectively the flow characteristics of the surrounding four cylinders are analyzed by considering the influence of the center cylinder as emphasis the entire flow field the mean pressure and fluid force coefficients will be analyzed and the vortex shedding frequency of the cylinders will be discussed as well this paper will provide an in depth analysis of the flow problem and mutual interference mechanism of multi cylinder structure the paper is organized as follows the numerical methodology and the computational domain together with the boundary conditions are presented in section 2 following this the validation cases of flow around the single cylinder and four cylinders are shown in section 3 the mechanism of the flow mutual interference is revealed in section 4 in section 5 the main findings are summarized 2 numerical methods 2 1 governing equations by using the 3d les turbulence model the filtered navier stokes equations for incompressible flows are written as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j ν 2 u i x j x j 1 ρ p x i where u i are the filtered velocity components in the cartesian coordinates x i p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid here u i u j is defined by u i u j u i u j u i u j u i u j and τ i j u i u j u i u j is the sub grid scale stress eq 2 can be written as 3 u i t u i u j x j ν 2 u i x j x j 1 ρ p x i τ i j x j the majority of subgrid scale models are based on the eddy viscosity models as follow 4 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 ν t s i j where the trace of the subgrid scale stress is incorporated into the pressure which results in a modified pressure term ν t is the subgrid scale kinematic viscosity and s i j is the strain rate tensor for the resolved scale defined by 5 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i in the most basic of subgrid scale models the subgrid kinematic viscosity ν t is modelled by 6 ν t l s 2 s i j where l s is the mixing length for the subgrid scales and s i j 2 s i j s i j l s can be computed using 7 l s min k y c s δ 1 3 where k is the von kármán constant k 0 42 and y is the distance to the nearest wall c s is the smagorinsky constant is the volume of the computational cell the value of the model constant c s is flow dependent and found to vary from 0 065 to 0 25 in fact a large c s value c s 0 2 may causes excessive damping of the large scale fluctuations and a small value c s 0 1 can affect convergence of correlation curve lam and lin 2007 the numerical calculation in the present work is based on a constant c s 0 2 reported by zhang et al 2015 in this study finite volume method fvm is chosen in the cfd software ansys fluent for discretization in order to realize the coupling between the pressure and the velocity fields the algorithm simple is adopted patankar and spalding 1972 which could help to accelerate the convergence of equation and reach a good accuracy during the calculation gao et al 2017 there are two kinds of conditions at the boundary for the pressure correction equation the pressure at the boundary is given the velocity is unknown and the velocity component normal to the boundary is specified as for the spatial discretization of the convective term is accomplished through the quadratic upwind interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme and a central difference scheme is used for the diffusive terms of the momentum equations the bounded second order implicit forward discretization is used for the transient formulation to reduce the convergence time compared to other equations the continuity equation is harder to converge thus the criteria for convergence are residual 10 4 for continuity equation and 10 5 for other equations respectively in summary there are two differential equations with four main unknowns which include three velocity vectors and one pressure scalar 2 2 computational models and grid independence test the entire computational domain is defined as 40 2 n cos α π 10 d 20 2 n cos α π 10 d h length width height in the simulations here n is the dimensionless coefficient which can be calculated by n l d and the computational domain in the z direction is set at h 4d where d is the circular cylinder diameter the origin coordinate o 0 0 0 is set at the center of the bottom of the center cylinder as shown in fig 1 on the other hand the boundary conditions are as follows the inlet boundary u u v 0 w 0 the outlet boundary u x v x w x 0 and the no slip wall condition u 0 v 0 w 0 applied to the surface of the circular cylinders where u v and w denote the velocity in x y and z direction the pressure boundary condition p 0 is imposed on the outlet the upstream boundary is set at 10d from the center of the upstream cylinder the downstream boundary is 30d away from the center of the downstream cylinder symmetry conditions are used at the lateral boundaries in this work the reynolds number is fixed at re 3900 where re ud ν and ν 1 39000 m2 s the mesh is divided by a hexahedral structured grid with a total of about 6 2 million grids as shown in fig 2 the number of nodes is 42 along the cylinder spanwise considering the accuracy and reliability of numerical calculations the surrounding area and the wake area of the cylinder are mesh encrypted the encryption area is 5d 5d with 8 encryption layers and the grid size near the wall of the cylinder is 0 003182d to easily control the cell size near the cylinder an o type grid of 0 1d in width is adopted around the cylinder in addition it can be seen from fig 2 that no mesh distortion is generated in the mesh encryption area in order to facilitate the description of the relative positional relationship between the cylinders array the four cylinders are named as cylinder 1 c1 cylinder 2 c2 cylinder 3 c3 and cylinder 4 c4 respectively the four cylinder and five cylinder arrays are abbreviated as 4c and 5c and the center cylinder arranged in 5c is expressed as cc the single circular cylinder is abbreviated as sc the pressure coefficient on the cylinder surface is defined as c p p p 0 0 5ρu 2 where p and p 0 are the static pressure of the cylinder surface and static pressure of the oncoming flow respectively the total drag coefficient and lift coefficient are defined as cd 2f d ρu 2 hd and cl 2f l ρu 2 hd respectively the strouhal number is dimensionless frequency of the vortex shedding defined by st f s d u where f d f l f are the total drag force lift force and the vortex shedding frequency respectively the grid model with an incidence angle of α 0 is compared and verified and the grid independence tests are carried out for the four circular cylinders with l d 4 0 at re 3900 the effects of the number of circumferential nodes and the wall grid scale on the numerical results of the flow around the circular cylinder such as the average drag coefficient and the st are also analyzed it can be seen from table 1 that the calculated results with different number of circumferential nodes are quite different the numerical results of mesh models with different near wall meshes are compared and analyzed mesh1 mesh2 and mesh3 vary in the scale of first layer near wall of cylinder while mesh1 mesh4 and mesh5 change the number of circumferential nodes it should be noted that with the consideration of the time consumption of the present simulations and the accuracy of the results all the investigations presented hereafter are based on the mesh1 the normalized time step is fixed as uδt d 0 05 which meets with the requirement of courant friedrichs lewy cfl calculation formula δt cfl δx u here the number of cfl is less than 1 0 zou et al 2008 zhu et al 2017 courant et al 1967 where δt is the time step and u is the free stream velocity compared with the results of zdravkovich 1987 there are still some gaps between the two results the main reasons may be the three dimensional effect of turbulence ignored by zdravkovich 1987 and the different turbulence models selected the y values are smaller than 1 in all simulation where y u δy 1 ν where u denotes the friction velocity at the nearest wall δy 1 is grid scale of the boundary layer zhang et al 2016 have used the time averaged drag coefficient integral curve to determine whether turbulent flow has reached steady fig 3 shows the average drag coefficient integral curve of five cylinders with l d 3 5 at an incidence angle of 0 it can be seen from fig 3 that the mean time history curve of the drag coefficient gradually becomes stable and the turbulent flow is considered to be stable additionally the statistics are collected after nearly 500 vortex shedding periods when the vortex shedding is fully developed in the simulation the statistics are captured every time step and a total of 30 vortex shedding periods are counted breuer 1998 3 validation of the numerical method in this section to verify the accuracy and reliability of the les model and corresponding parameters the numerical simulation results of the flow past the single circular cylinder and four cylinders arranged in square configuration are compared with existing literature breuer 1998 kravchenko and moin 2000 lehmkuhl et al 2013 the statistical values of the fluid force coefficient of the single cylinder sc such as the mean drag coefficient the st and the average separation angle θ sep are listed in table 2 together with those reported in existing literature the result of present study is close to that of the corresponding literature which shows that the present numerical calculation method has good applicability in this paper in addition the distribution of the mean streamwise velocity along the centerline of the wake region at the middle height of the cylinder z h 0 50 is compared to results from the literature lourenco and shih 1993 yan et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 a the distribution of the mean streamwise velocity z h 0 50 is selected from different locations of the wake the average velocity of the profile is presented at three positions of 1 04 1 58 and 2 02 respectively as shown in fig 4 b although there are subtle differences between present values and literature results the trends are completely consistent with the variation of the position of the wake field the time averaged velocity distribution changes from u shaped to v shaped gradually becomes flat and finally tends to be smooth as straight line furthermore the results of the four cylinder array in square configuration are compared with the results obtained by lam and zou 2010 wang et al 2013 table 3 it can be seen from table 3 that the mean drag coefficient and st in this method are in good agreement with the results in the literature which provides considerable evidence to validate the numerical method however there is a small disparity between the present results and literature results which is attributed to a combination of effects related to re notable differences in aspect ratio free stream conditions etc 4 results and discussions 4 1 flow pattern the pattern of the flow around the multiple cylinders appears several different classes with the change of the incidence angles and the vortex shedding from the cylinder is apparent based on the fact that there is a strong interference for the flow field of the multi cylinder structure in small gap regime the results of two typical spacing ratios l d 2 0 and 3 5 are given the instantaneous non dimensional 3d vortex structures of 4c and 5c cases are presented in figs 5 8 with three different incidence angles the dimensionless streamwise vortex ω x and spanwise vortex ω z structures are defined by ω x d w y v z u and ω z d v x u y u respectively in small gap flow regime l d 2 0 the streamwise vortex distribution is more disordered in the wake of the cylinder group after the center cylinder cc is added at α 0 it is known that there are more vortices diffusing from the surfaces of c1 and c2 before adding the cc as shown in fig 5 a in addition the wake of c3 and c4 shows an oblique flow in the five cylinder array which leads to the increment of the width of the wake region when the incidence angle is 22 5 the wake of the upstream cylinder c1 is hindered by the cc however the vortex shed from cc directly hits the upstream surface of c3 while the pattern of vortex structure for c2 and c4 is not significantly subjected to cc as shown in fig 5 b with the incidence angle changing to 45 as shown in fig 5 c the wake development of c1 is limited which is mainly due to the blocking effect of cc on the other hand the wake pattern of c2 and c4 is less affected by cc due to its special side by side arrangement in addition the upstream surface of the c3 is impacted by the wake of cc which may lead to the change of the original vortex shedding pattern it is also very important to observe the development of the spanwise vortex ω z around cylinders fig 6 shows the spanwise vortex development of the cylinder group with small spacing ratio case at different incidence angles the development of the free shear layer can be observed near the wall of cylinder which is expressed as the corrugated shear layer csl zhang and samtaney 2016 it can be seen that the csl mainly forms and spreads from the surface of the upstream and midstream cylinders and then it may be stretched and deformed markedly for α 0 case the csl of c1 and c2 develops from the surface of the downstream cylinder and it rolls up to form a vortex before adding cc into 4c array with the addition of the cc the csl pattern of c1 and c2 shows the deflected flow which disturbs the formation of the free shear layer near the wall of the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 6 a the mutual interference effect is relatively strong among the cylinders located in five cylinder array not only leading to a significant skewed flow for cylinder but also inducing a complex mechanical behavior in addition it can be found that the csl of the cylinder is torn and deformed greatly in the wake area for 5c case and its integrity is disturbed when the incidence angle changes to 22 5 there is a noteworthy deflected flow in the csl development of c1 after adding cc while it does not influence the csl development of c2 with the incidence angle changing to 45 the center cylinder has a great influence on the wake development of c1 and c3 furthermore the csl of c1 is attached to the surface of cc and further develops to the surface of c3 when the spacing ratio increases to 3 5 critical gap flow regime the gap between the cylinders increases a lot and the wake development of each cylinder can develop in a large room fig 7 shows the streamwise vortices of the cylinder group under the condition of l d 3 5 at different incidence angles compared with the small spacing ratio case the influence of cc on the wake development of c1 and c2 at α 0 is weakened for which a lot of large scale streamwise vortices can be observed in the gap region furthermore the wake pattern of the whole system changes to a disorder state that the number of streamwise vortices increases and its spatial distribution is changed along downstream direction however the cc hinders the development of the wake of c1 to a certain extent with an incidence angle of 22 5 resulting in the smaller number of vortices diffusing from the surface of c1 when α is 45 the wake vortex of c1 is also blocked by cc while the vortex scale is transformed into a multi scale pattern in the wake region of c1 fig 8 shows the development of the spanwise vortex of each cylinder with the condition of l d 3 5 in different inflow directions when α 0 based on the fact that the deflected flow of wake can be observed for c1 and c2 in 5c system the influence of cc on the csl development pattern of the upstream cylinders cannot be ignored besides the distribution of the vortex is very disordered behind the wake region of the whole 5c group when α 22 5 the influence of cc on the csl development of each cylinder is also not negligible that the wake of the cylinder group changes greatly into a chaotic state the csl on c1 surface develops along downstream direction gets stretched and interferes with the development of free shear layer between cc and c3 surface at α 22 5 as depicted in fig 8 b for α 45 case the csl of c1 interferences with cc and forms a vortex along the downstream after adding cc as depicted in fig 8 c on the other hand the vortex pattern of c2 and c4 in 5c system is consistent with the results of 4c case 4 2 vorticity transportation and deformation since the wake dynamics of cylinders are mainly associated with vortices it is important to examine the source of the vorticity in an incompressible flow vorticity can only be generated on the no slip surface and enter the flow by diffusion the rate at which the vorticity is created at the surface per unit area and time is measured by the boundary vorticity flux bvf lightthill 1963 defined as 8 σ ν n ν n ω where is the vorticity gradient tensor at wall and n is the unit normal vector σ is a vector of 3 1 dimension the three components of bvf σ x σ y σ z denote the generation the three vorticity components ω x ω y ω z the bvf components can be normally defined by σ i σ i ρu 2 considering the representativeness and typicality of relevant data the bvf distribution characteristic is selected for the classic case for the analysis in critical flow regime l d 3 5 fig 9 only shows the distribution of the bvf components σ x σ y σ z of the four cylinders and five cylinders with l d 3 5 at α 45 respectively in the four cylinder array σ x and σ y are mainly distributed at the c3 upstream surface while they are very small on other cylinders surfaces however the distribution of σ z is not zero on the surface of the four cylinders it is worth noting that σ z is distributed along the axial direction of c3 and a peak region can be observed as shown in fig 9 c it is suggested that ω x and ω y develop substantially along the surface of the downstream cylinder c3 and diffuse into the flow field this is consistent with the characteristic of the streamwise vorticity distribution in section 4 1 on the other hand ω z normally originates from some specified cylinders c1 c2 and c4 in four cylinder array and enters into the wake it is concluded that the distribution characteristics of bvf components can better explain the vortex transportation mechanisms which are related to the vortex development mechanisms by adding the center cylinder the distribution characteristics of σ x and σ y for the surrounding cylinders are partially affected as shown in figs 9 a and b for c1 the σ x of the c1 surface is almost 0 indicating that the c1 vortex transportation is suppressed by cc however for c2 c4 and cc σ x and σ y increase slightly showing that more downstream vortices diffuse from the cylinder surface into the flow field as compared with 4c case however the bvf components of center cylinder also exhibit alternating positive and negative values in the 5c system ω x is basically transported from the cc and c3 surfaces into the flow field in fact the addition of the cc has a large influence on the distribution characteristic of σ z on c3 surface meanwhile the σ z continuity distribution is disturbed by the center cylinder along spanwise direction of the c3 it can be seen that the development mechanism of ω x and ω y changes a lot after the addition of the cc the reason is that ω x and ω y are simultaneously generated from the center cylinder and downstream cylinder and develop along downstream direction in addition ω z simultaneously develops from special cylinder located in five cylinder array as shown in fig 9 c when ω z develops from the surfaces of cc and c3 it is stretched and deformed resulting in the transformation of ω z to ω x and forming the rib like vortex along downstream direction the vortex stretches and deforms when it goes in the flow field from the cylinder surface resulting in the original σ z converting into σ x it is significant to observe the change of σ z to σ x because the σ x plays a major role in suppressing generation of vortex in order to further analyze the transportation mechanism of vorticity the development of ω x is investigated based on the vorticity stretching term p 1 ω x u x and vorticity turning term p 2 ω y u y ω z u z of ω x equation zhao et al 2017 perkins 1970 hansen et al 2016 the normalization of the p1 and p2 terms are marked as p1 p1 u d 2 and p2 p2 u d 2 respectively fig 10 shows the distributions of p1 and p2 along the surface of the cylinder of four cylinders and five cylinders respectively the mechanisms of the vortex stretching and transformation are impressively different between four cylinder array and five cylinder array 9 d ω x d t ω x u x ω y u y ω z u z ν 2 ω x in fact the terms p1 and p2 show the effect of streamwise vorticity stretching on ω x and the generation of ω x which is by means of vorticity tilting respectively so the overall influence of vorticity convection on ω x can be expressed as p1 p2 in the four cylinder array it can be found that the distribution of the primary vortex is mainly concentrated on the surface of the downstream cylinder c3 which is the same as the distribution of bvf components σ x σ y as shown in fig 10 the scale of p1 on the c1 surface is smaller than that of other cylinders which indicates that ω x diffuses and deforms less into the flow field the sign of p1 p2 changes which further weakens the primary vortices as depicted in fig 10 c the vortex stretching is nearly offset by the vorticity tilting mechanism which leads to the reduction of the p1 p2 iso surface magnitude and induces the generation of secondary vortices after adding the center cylinder the scale of primary vortex from the c1 surface reduces slightly with some secondary vortices attaching to surface of c2 c4 as shown in figs 10 a and b it indicates that the addition of the center cylinder has an effect on the vortex stretching and deformation of c2 c4 for c1 its wake development is suppressed by cc which reveals the formation mechanism of the primary vortex with small scale moreover the center cylinder has a certain weakening effect on the p1 p2 transformation mechanism resulting in a number of primary vortices on the downstream cylinder surface fig 10 c the term p1 evolution mechanism is closely related to the streamwise velocity gradient in shear layer u x can be either positive or negative at the surface because the acceleration or deceleration of streamwise velocity would take place near the primary vortices in addition the free shear layer separation is also related to its surrounding static pressure distribution for multi cylinder array due to the presence of a reverse pressure gradient around the surface of the cylinder the free shear layer gradually separates and forms eddy in the flow field the secondary vortex also affects the development of the shear layer of the cylinder and the p1 p2 combination is connected with the static pressure 4 3 time averaged flow field this section is to further explore the influence of cc on the distribution characteristics and fluid force characteristics of the other four cylinders figs 12 15 show the time averaged vorticity distribution the timed averaged pressure distribution the time averaged streamline distribution with small flow regime l d 2 0 and critical flow regime l d 3 5 at z h 0 5 the purple color filled region is defined by positive pressure and the gray region indicates negative pressure in the follow diagrams respectively as shown in fig 11 with the presence of positive pressure gradient cp mean decreases sharply from stagnation point resulting in accelerating the flow of the boundary layer moreover cp mean reaches the lowest value along the circumference which is located in the range of θ 70 120 as depicted in fig 11 b the position of cp mean 0 on the cylinder where pressure changes sign from positive to negative is related to its forward pressure gradient thus it will affect the separation of the boundary layer near the wall surface of cylinder when the incidence angle is 0 the vortices of the c1 and c2 attach near the upstream surface of the downstream cylinders c3 and c4 before the cc is added at small spacing ratio causing a reduction in the scale of positive pressure zone meanwhile the time averaged vortex formation length reduces significantly for the downstream cylinders and the pressure difference reduces between the front rear of the cylinders it could induce a drag crisis for downstream cylinders after adding the center cylinder c1 and c2 show an obvious oblique flow which can also be found in the time average streamline diagram as shown in fig 14 a the presence of cc has a small effect on the pressure distribution of c1 and c2 however it causes the positive pressure region to further expand for c3 and c4 which eventually relieves the drag crisis of the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 12 a this is mainly due to the blocking effect of cc which weakens the impact strength of upstream cylinders for c3 and c4 compared with the sc result θ sta 0 it can be found that the stagnation points shift to other positions for c1 and c2 the c3 and c4 are affected by the wake vortex of the upstream cylinder in 4c system so that the stagnation point is not sure and cannot be clearly observed with adding the cc due to the development of the skew flow of the c1 and c2 the positions of the stagnation points are not affected by the wake for c3 and c4 after adding cc as shown in fig 14 a when the spacing ratio increases to 3 5 the pressure distribution and wake characteristics of the upstream cylinder c1 and c2 are different from the results of the l d 2 0 in the four cylinder array as depicted in fig 13 a the downstream cylinders c3 and c4 are impacted by the vortex derived from upstream cylinders for which the position of stagnation points is not clear with the addition of the fifth cylinder cc the scale of positive pressure distribution of the downstream cylinders are larger than the results of 4c system indicating that cc has a greater obstruction effect in the 5c system which can protect the downstream cylinders from the direct impact of the vortex in addition the wake deflection angles of c1 and c2 increase intuitively and greatly which can be seen from fig 14 a when the incidence angle is 22 5 with small flow regime l d 2 0 the size of the positive pressure region is small for c1 before cc is added as shown in fig 12 b when the cc is added the positive pressure of the c1 increases significantly which is closely related to the pattern of deflected wake however due to the influence of cc deflected flow its positive pressure region reduces significantly for c3 it can be seen from streamline that the stagnation point of each cylinder is clearly visible in the four cylinders before cc is added on the other hand stagnation point of c3 is not obvious due to the existence of defected flow in the five cylinder system as shown in fig 14 b when the spacing ratio changes to 3 5 the pressure distribution of each cylinder shows a significant positive pressure region in the four cylinder array as shown in fig 13 b due to the staggered arrangement of the cylinders and the increasing gap the vortex shedding can be observed and the positions of the stagnation points are clear for each cylinder it s worth to mention that even though the relative arrangement of each cylinder changes and the gap area is also squeezed when the fifth cylinder is added to the original 4c system the scale of positive pressure distribution of each cylinder are close to the corresponding results of 4c the difference is that the wake pattern of the upstream cylinders c1 and c2 is transformed into a deflected flow as shown in fig 15 b with the incidence angle changing to 45 c3 is affected by the impact of the wake shedding vortex of c1 due to the full development of the wakes of cylinders without cc at l d 2 0 the positive pressure region in 4c array is larger than that of five cylinder result for c3 in the five cylinder system due to the strong wake impact a large negative pressure region appears in the upstream surface of c3 which leads to a drag crisis as shown in fig 12 c it can be seen from fig 14 c that the stagnation point position of c3 changes to disorder after cc is added and the deflected flow pattern weakens suddenly for c2 when the spacing ratio increases to 3 5 due to the impact of the wake of the cc the scale of positive pressure region shrinks markedly for c3 as shown in fig 13 c however compared with the results of 4c case the wake vortex patterns of c2 and c4 do not change significantly for 5c case because a larger spacing gap among them in side by side arrangement for c1 before adding cc its mean recirculation length is significantly smaller than the result of 5c case as depicted in fig 15 c 4 4 fluid force coefficients in this section the effect of both gap spacing and incidence angles on the force characteristics in multi cylinder array is discussed based on drag and lift forces statistics figs 16 18 show the variation of the fluid force coefficients with different gap spacing and incidence angles where void curves and solid curves denote the case of four cylinder array and the case of five cylinder array respectively the results of sc are introduced for comparative analysis in this section fig 16 shows the variations of mean drag coefficient as the key variable to reflect l d at different incidence angles in fact due to the existence of gap flow between the multi cylinder array the force characteristics of five cylinder array show a drastic change at small gap flow regime l d 2 0 3 0 as shown in fig 16 for four cylinder array case the mean drag coefficients of downstream cylinders c3 and c4 gradually increase with the increasing l d and then keep steady l d 3 5 at α 0 adding a circular cylinder into the center of the four cylinder array leads to considerable changes of the mean drag coefficient it is worth noting that c3 and c4 have a drag crisis in the small spacing ratio cases for 4c system which is mainly caused by the strong wake impact of the upstream cylinders for 5c case the drag crisis phenomenon of c3 and c4 cannot be observed in the critical flow regime l d 3 5 5 0 and large flow regime l d 5 7 0 the mean drag coefficient keeps relatively stable for c3 and c4 in both 4c and 5c system however the mean drag coefficient of the downstream cylinder c3 changes markedly in five cylinder array at α 22 5 which can be attributed to the wake impact of cc at small gap flow regime l d 2 0 3 0 as shown in fig 16 b the drag crisis appears on c3 and it is not found for other cylinders in addition for 5c cases the mean drag coefficient of c2 remains at a high level after adding cc in the range of l d 2 0 2 5 and it approaches to the result of sc with the increasing of l d compared with the results of sc the mean drag value of the downstream cylinders c3 and c4 are stable in the range of higher l d values for all cases when the incidence angle is 45 c3 shows negative drag due to the strong wake interference of cc at the small spacing ratios l d 2 0 2 5 as shown in fig 16 c it can be seen from fig 12 c that the surface of c3 is under negative pressure which in turn leads to a negative drag in c3 in fact the addition of the fifth cylinder causes the vortex shedding modes of c1 cc and c3 to be transformed into overshoot pattern papaioannou et al 2006 where the three cylinders are close to each other and serve as a single cylinder zhou et al 2019 with the spacing ratio gradually increasing the gap between the cylinders increases and the vortex shedding pattern changes again for c1 cc and c3 a positive pressure region appears on the surface of c3 and the negative drag phenomenon is gradually interrupted on the other hand for c1 the development of the wake is hindered by cc and the mean drag is smaller than that without cc fig 17 shows the variations of mean lift coefficients to reflect the change of key parameter of l d at three incidence angles 0 22 5 45 for the cases of incidence angles α 0 and 45 the distribution of c l is following a symmetric fashion along the centerline of the cylinder array x axis since the arrangement of multi cylinder is symmetric about the flow of computational domain this phenomenon has not been observed at α 22 5 but the trough for c l of c3 is available at l d 4 0 it should be noted that c l distribution of c3 is different from other cylinders in both four cylinder and five cylinder arrays for the small gap flow regime l d 2 0 3 0 depicted in fig 17 a the value c l of all cylinders located in multi cylinder is far from zero which is owing to the mutual interference effect between cylinders at α 0 otherwise the curve slightly fluctuates as the spacing increases from l d 4 0 7 0 and gradually approaches to c l of a single cylinder from fig 17 c the fashion of c l in the case of α 45 is similar to that of α 0 for c2 and c4 in five cylinder array fig 18 shows the changes of r m s drag coefficient cd for different cases when the incidence angle is α 0 and α 22 5 the cd value of the upstream cylinder is smaller than that of the downstream cylinder and gradually approaches the results of sc as the spacing ratio increases at l d 2 0 although the wake pattern of c1 and c2 undergoes a large change deflected flow the corresponding cd value is not dramatically affected when cc is added at α 0 and α 22 5 furthermore the cd value of c1 is less affected by the cc and incidence angles under the case of α 22 5 for 5c system the drag oscillation of c3 is obviously larger than that of other cylinders as depicted in fig 18 b for α 45 after adding cc in the interval of l d 2 0 5 0 the cd of c3 is greater than that of other cylinders subsequently fig 19 shows the variation of r m s lift coefficients with three incident angles and l d based on the fact that the fluctuation of lift coefficient for downstream cylinders is larger than that of upstream cylinders at α 0 and α 22 5 it can be concluded that the downstream cylinders are subjected to the impact of the wake resulting in the distorting of the original stability of the vortex shedding frequency by adding the cc into the four cylinder array the r m s lift coefficient also changes apparently with the increasing of the spacing ratio from l d 2 0 7 0 for three incidence angles for the case of α 0 the cl of c1 and c2 has basically the same changing trend with spacing ratio for 4c and 5c case as well c3 and c4 with the increasing of l d the cl of the upstream cylinders c1 and c2 gradually coincides with the corresponding results of sc as shown in fig 19 a for the case α 45 the cl value of the c3 is close to result of sc for the five cylinder array at l d 2 0 which is only half of c3 in 4c system the c3 lift oscillation curve has a peak cl 0 73 at l d 3 0 in four cylinder array for 5c the cl of c3 undergoes a dramatic jump with the value of cl 0 75 at l d 4 0 as shown in fig 19 c 4 5 spanwise distribution characteristics the introduction of the 5th cylinder complicates the flow around the typical four cylinder array with l d 2 0 at α 45 in order to further understand the 3d distribution of the fluid forces and flow characteristics of the five cylinders with l d 2 0 at α 45 the spatial temporal distribution of the fluid force coefficients is presented in this section for which zhang et al 2020 stated that the friction can be ignored in drag at high reynolds numbers figs 20 and 21 show the spatial temporal distribution of the drag coefficients and the lift coefficients along the spanwise direction of cylinder with l d 2 0 at α 45 the spatial temporal distribution of lift and drag coefficients is composed of many filament like lines which exhibit periodic changes in addition the color depth of filaments represents the drag value of the cylinder meanwhile the spatial temporal distribution of the lift coefficient is composed of many filament lines and the width of these lines is 0 09 or 0 33 dimensionless second which correspond to the periods of the vortex shedding the spatial temporal distribution characteristics of c1 are obviously different from other cylinders because the addition of the 5th cylinder has an inhibitory effect on the development of the wake of c1 moreover c1 cc and c3 act as a whole structure causing the change of the periodic pattern of the original fluid force it also causes changes in the vortex shedding frequency of c1 and c3 after the introduction of the 5th cylinder since c2 c4 and cc are arranged side by side the vortex shedding modes of c2 and c4 are less affected by cc therefore for c2 the lines width of spatial temporal of the force coefficients is close to the results of c4 as shown in figs 21 b and d notably the magnitude of the drag coefficient reaches its minimum value cd 0 65 near the middle height range of c1 and assumes a larger level 0 7 cd 0 8 at the end of the cylinder besides it can be seen from fig 21 a that the larger value 0 1 cl 0 2 of the lift coefficient is concentrated in the middle height range for c1 as compared to smaller value 0 3 cl 0 15 near the bottom and top moreover the strong three dimensional characteristics of spatial temporal of force coefficient can be observed for each cylinder due to the obstruction of the 5th cylinder c3 may undergo a huge change in its vortex shedding mode which can be seen from fig 14 c the spatial temporal distribution of drag fluctuates in the negative range for c3 this means that the phenomenon of negative drag can be clearly observed which is consistent with the previous analysis in section 4 4 in order to further analyze the three dimensional flow characteristics of the cylinder spanwise correlation of fluid force coefficients is introduced which is an important indicator of three dimensional characteristics gabbai and benaroya 2005 this is also significant for the vortex induced vibration of the structure as shown in zhang et al 2016 the correlation coefficient is computed as follows 10 ρ z 1 z 2 ε z 1 μ z 1 z 2 μ z 2 σ z 1 σ z 2 where μ x and σ x are the mean and standard deviation variables while x z 1 and z 2 can be represented at any two different span positions in this section the bottom of the cylinder is used as a reference point so the correlation coefficient of the lift and drag coefficients can be expressed as ρ 0 z fig 22 shows the correlation coefficients of the drag and lift of the four and five cylinders along the spanwise direction in which ρ 0 0 1 is the maximum value that can be found since the upper and lower bottom surfaces of the flow field are set as symmetric boundary conditions the correlation coefficient reaches the minimum value at z d 4 for four cylinders case and five cylinders case however for c3 in the five cylinder array the minimum value of drag spanwise correlation coefficient appears near the mid height section at about z d 2 with ρ 0 2 0 48 which is significantly different from the results of other cylinders this is probably due to the fact that cc has a greater hindering effect on c3 which further induces the drastic changes for the c3 wake and pressure characteristics as depicted in figs 12 c and 13 c it can be seen that the correlation coefficient of each cylinder is not the same in the cylinder group and decreases with the increase of z d after adding cc the drag correlation coefficient of c1 varies around a fixed value which is a little higher than 0 9 these results are consistent with its spatial temporal distribution characteristics the drag coefficient of c2 decreases sharply along the spanwise direction and reaches the minimum value ρ 0 4 0 15 at z d 4 in 5c system in addition the correlation coefficient of lift is worth more analysis and discussion because it is related to the vortex shedding pattern along the spanwise direction of cylinder the lift correlation coefficients of c2 and c4 increase with the increasing z d after the cc is added as shown in fig 22 b this shows that the three dimensional characteristics of c2 and c4 have been weakened after adding cc on the other hand the lift spanwise correlation coefficient of c1 and c3 decreases along the axial height in five cylinder array compared with the results of four cylinder case at larger axial distances due to the shedding of 3d vortices the correlation coefficient of lift may reach zero norberg 2003 the corresponding research by lee et al 2014 showed that a reasonable prediction of spanwise correlation coefficient can be established only when the cylinder height reaches 16d with applying the periodicity boundary conditions along spanwise direction of cylinder however the spanwise length is far from reaching this requirement but some notable features can still be observed in the current simulation for instance the lift spanwise correlation coefficient of c2 and c4 achieves a smaller value ρ 0 4 0 29 at z d 4 in the four cylinder array 4 6 vortex shedding frequency based on the time series for lift force coefficient fourier transformation is applied to reveal the frequency characteristics of the kármán vortex around multi cylinder array the frequency peaks on the power spectrum density plot of lift force coefficient show the existence of flow interference in the current study the influence of the center cylinder on the flow characteristics and mechanical properties of the surrounding cylinder four cylinder array is significant at the mall gap flow regime l d 2 0 while such influence has been partially weakened in large gap flow regime l d 5 0 furthermore within the large gap flow regime the influence of cc on the surrounding cylinder is negligible for the characteristics of vortex shedding frequency fig 23 shows the variation of the vortex shedding frequencies which is normalized by f s d u with the spacing ratio l d 2 0 5 0 here black curves and red curves denote the case of four cylinder array and the case of five cylinder array respectively the value of the x coordinate corresponding to the primary peak of the psd curve is almost the same for all four cylinders cases under the same incidence angle and spacing ratio in which the same results have also been recorded by liang et al 2009 and sewatkar et al 2012 for the small gap flow regime l d 2 0 it can be seen that the vortex shedding frequencies of the surrounding cylinders increase by 2 5 times after adding cc for the case α 0 in addition by adding the cc the frequency of the wake fluctuation for four cylinder array slightly moves to a lager value for the case α 22 5 it can be seen from figs 23 a and c that the c1 and c3 are strongly influenced by the center cylinder which causes the vortex shedding frequency to reduce to about 1 4 for the case α 45 in five cylinder array the flow interference among the cylinders is very complicated while considering the l d and α thus the psd distribution characteristics are analyzed with α 45 as a typical case fig 24 shows the time history of force coefficients of each cylinder in the four cylinder and five cylinder array at α 45 in the four cylinder array the oscillation of lift coefficient of c3 is significantly stronger than that of other cylinders while the mean drag coefficient is significantly smaller than that of other cylinders in addition due to the deflected flow pattern behind the wake region of c2 and c4 the corresponding psd curve shows a double peak phenomenon after the 5th cylinder is added the intensity of deflected flow gradually decreases for c2 and c4 and the psd curve shows a significant primary peak the original vortex shedding patterns of c1 and c3 show a change otherwise c1 cc and c3 are like a whole structure and only generate a single vortex shedding in which its vortex shedding frequency decreases sharply in addition due to the impact of the cc wake compared with the result of 4c case the oscillation of the lift coefficient falls markedly for c3 and the drag coefficient fluctuates in the negative range for c3 causing the primary peak of the psd curve being quite vague however the results of c2 and c4 are almost unaffected by cc for the same α as shown in figs 23 b and d the main reason for this result is that the wake development of c1 is hindered by the center cylinder and the inflow of the c3 is also shielded by that one seen figs 5 and 6 with the spacing ratio increasing to 3 5 the wake of the cylinder can be further extended as shown in figs 13 and 14 for different incidence angles a significant vortex shedding phenomenon can be observed for each cylinder which agrees with the corresponding psd behavior when the center cylinder is added in four cylinder array the wakes of c1 and c2 have obvious deflected flow pattern and the vortex shedding frequency pattern is changed compared with other cases the center cylinder has a greater effect on the vortex shedding frequency of the four cylinders at α 0 and α 22 5 this is mainly due to the change of the flow pattern in the gap region of the cylinder group for the larger gap flow regime l d 5 0 the vortex is fully developed in the wake region of the cylinder the vortex shedding frequencies of each cylinder are almost the same in all cases 5 conclusion the 3d numerical investigation on flow past multi cylinder array is carried out at eight spacing ratios l d 2 0 7 0 and three incidence angles α 0 22 5 and 45 at re 3900 the influence of cc on the flow characteristics for a four cylinder array is studied the results show that cc has significant effects on the flow behaviors and force coefficients of four cylinders and three distinct flow regimes are identified as a function of l d namely small gap flow regime critical gap flow regime and large gap flow regime the details are presented in the following i in small gap flow regime such as l d 2 0 the addition of the center cylinder induces the formation of deflected flow for upstream cylinders at α 0 and α 22 5 in addition the vortex structure is markedly affected by the coupling effect of center cylinder and the incidence angle in critical gap flow regime such as l d 3 5 the presence of the cc still has an influence on vortex formation and shedding patterns of the surrounding cylinders for the case of α 45 the csl development of c1 are greatly hindered by cc while it is weak for other cylinders arranged in four cylinder array ii boundary vortex flux characteristics reveal the source of its vorticity for four cylinder array ω x and ω y develop substantially along the surface of the downstream cylinder and ω z is originated from upstream cylinders the addition of cc has the greatest impact on the σ z distribution pattern of the downstream cylinder c3 as compared to other cylinders for another the center cylinder has a certain weakening effect on the p1 p2 transformation mechanism leading to the addition in primary vortices of c3 and the changes in surrounding static pressure distribution the secondary vortex also affects the development of the shear layer of the cylinder iii in small gap flow regime such as l d 2 0 due to the existence of cc the wake of the upstream cylinders shows a deflected flow and the stagnation point position is easily changed by its flow pattern at α 0 and α 22 5 in addition due to the combined wake effect of cc and upstream cylinder the downstream cylinders are more likely to experience drag crisis due to the negative pressure region in critical gap flow regime such as l d 3 5 cc still interferes with the vortex development of c1 and c3 at α 45 and the region of the positive pressure of c1 is the largest among the four cylinders iv in small gap flow regime l d 2 0 3 0 the addition of the center cylinder induces the mean drag coefficient of downstream cylinder c3 to reach its minimum value cd 0 with l d 2 0 at α 22 5 and α 45 but the effect of cc is weak on the fluid force of the cylinder in large gap flow regime l d 5 0 7 0 due to the symmetry of the multi cylinder arrangement and the flow field the mean lift coefficient curves of the upper side cylinders are substantially similar to those of the lower side cylinders at both α 0 and α 45 however this phenomenon is not observed at the case with α 22 5 in the four cylinder system the mean lift coefficient of each cylinder is almost 0 which is smaller than the results of 5c at α 45 in addition the oscillation of the force coefficients of the upper cylinder of the 4c system is larger than those of the 5c system v the spatial temporal distribution of the force coefficient of each cylinder has a significant three dimensional effect at a small spacing ratio l d 2 0 of 45 the drag of c1 reaches the minimum cd 0 65 and its lift value reaches the maximum 0 1 cl 0 2 in the middle height region in addition with the implantation of the center cylinder the spanwise correlation coefficient of the fluid force of the cylinder changes significantly the drag spanwise correlation coefficient of c3 reaches its minimum value ρ 0 2 0 48 at the middle height section z d 2 which is different from other cylinders in the 5c system where the lift spanwise correlation coefficients of c2 and c4 reach the minimum at the top surface of the cylinder vi the mutual interference effect between the cylinder groups is very strong in the small gap flow regime and it is further enhanced especially after augmenting the center cylinder when α 0 the vortex shedding frequency of surrounding cylinders increase by 2 5 times after adding cc the vortex shedding frequencies of c1 and c3 are strongly affected by the center cylinder which are reduced about 75 with α 45 in the 5 cylinder array credit authorship contribution statement jiahuang tu software validation writing

21372,the three dimensional flow around the four cylinder and five cylinder arrays are numerically studied at re 3900 by large eddy simulation les by selecting eight spacing ratios l d 2 0 7 0 and three incidence angles α 0 45 the influence of the center cylinder on the flow characteristics and interference effects of the four cylinder array is discussed different spacing ratios can be divided into three categories with respect to flow regions of the multi cylinder small gap flow regime l d 2 0 3 5 critical flow regime l d 3 5 5 0 and large gap flow regime l d 5 0 7 0 for cases with small spacing ratios the influence of the center cylinder is very notable on the flow characteristics of the four cylinder array as the ratio increases the influence of the center cylinder gradually decreases on the surrounding cylinders in the multi cylinder array on the other hand the direction of the incoming flow also affects the flow characteristics of both four cylinder and five cylinder arrays the development of the shear layer is strongly influenced by the center cylinder for the upstream cylinders at α 45 boundary vortex flux components flow characteristics and fluid force coefficients change significantly with adding the center cylinder for the four cylinders keywords four circular cylinders center cylinder spacing ratio incidence angle flow patterns interference effect 1 introduction the multi cylinder composed of a group of bluff structures is common in engineering fields such as the cylinders of offshore drilling platforms towering buildings suspension bridges and cooling towers lam and zou 2010 wang et al 2013 ma et al 2017 etc the four cylinder array and the five cylinder array with equal spacing are widely used as the base of offshore superstructures such as offshore wind turbines offshore launch pads and offshore lighthouses moreover the vertical cylinder group which acts as the fixed support for coastal buildings or water level monitoring system is also composed of four cylinder array or five cylinder system when the fluid flows through the cylinders the free shear layers interfere with each other causing the dramatic change of the forces exerting on cylinder arrays and the flow patterns of the wake the complexity of strong mutual interference effect and free shear layer interference because of cylinder arrays has aroused the attention of many investigators due to its wide application in engineering many researchers studied flow past rigid multi cylinder arrays with different spacing ratios and reynolds numbers georgios et al 2006 zhang and zhou 2001 islam et al 2016a lam and lo 1992 lam et al 2003 lam et al 2008 lam and zou 2007 lam and zou 2010 zou et al 2008 zou et al 2011 tong et al 2014 wang et al 2013 bao et al 2010 han et al 2013 gao et al 2017 ma et al 2017 nicollei and eames 2011 islam et al 2016b some scholars georgios et al 2006 zhang and zhou 2001 islam et al 2016a had investigated the flow characteristics of two tandem cylinders and triple cylinders for instance georgios et al 2006 applied the direct numerical simulation dns method to study the flow characteristics of 2d and 3d double tandem cylinders in the range of re 100 1000 by setting the spacing ratio from 1 1 to 5 0 the focus was to understand the coupling mechanisms of the 3d characteristics and the spacing ratio of the cylinder in detail meanwhile investigations found in references zhang and zhou 2001 islam et al 2016a were carried out by a numerical simulation along with an experiment on the flow characteristics of three tandem square cylinders and three side by side cylinders respectively the two papers mentioned above analyzed and explored the evolution mechanism of the flow vortex structures of the multi cylinder array lam and lo 1992 lam et al 2003 2008 experimentally investigated the flow patterns of four cylinders and the corresponding changes of the strauhal number at the subcritical reynolds number of 2100 the main research parameters included the spacing ratio and incidence angle subsequently they used a piezoelectric load cell to obtain the mean and fluctuating forces of the four cylinders in the square arrangement and the associated measurements of vortex shedding frequency at reynolds number ranging from 2 25 104 to 4 5 104 in addition to experimental research numerical simulations were also used to study the flow characteristics around 2d and 3d four cylinder arrays at low reynolds number the results show that the flow patterns depended on reynolds number re spacing ratio l d and aspect ratio h d and three patterns around the four cylinders were defined lam and zou 2007 2010 did the experiment and numerical simulation which mainly studied the flow around four cylinders with four different spacing ratios l d 1 5 5 0 at re 1 128 104 to 1 982 104 it was found that the pattern of vortex shedding behind upstream cylinders was distinctly changed for the case with l d 3 5 the two key parameters of spacing ratio and re would alter the flow characteristics of the four cylinder array at the small reynolds number re 200 they used numerical calculation methods to study the influences of different spacing ratios l d and aspect ratios h d on the 3d flow characteristics of the four cylinder square array the development of the free shear layer of the cylinder was significantly influenced by the spacing ratios aspect ratios and the condition of the non slip wall which has a significant effect on the pressure as well as forces of the four cylinder array zou et al 2008 2011 used large eddy simulation les for investigating 3d turbulence characteristics of four cylinder array in an in line square with l d 1 5 and 3 0 at re 1 5 104 later they used the finite volume method fvm to study the influence of the spacing ratios l d 1 2 at low reynolds number re 200 on the 3d flow characteristics of diamond shaped four cylinder group comparing with the experimental results from the water tank the numerical method was validated their study found that the transition from the narrow gap flow pattern to the eddy current impact pattern occurred at the spacing ratio of 3 0 tong et al 2014 numerically simulated the 3d flow around a square array with a small spacing ratio and different reynolds number ranging from 100 to 500 analyzing the effects of reynolds number on the vortex pattern of the four cylinder group and classifying them into four flow regimes meanwhile the fluid force coefficients changed significantly with the transition from one regime to another and the time averaged drag coefficients of the upstream cylinders were much larger than those of downstream cylinders for the single cylinder case the peak frequencies of lift and drag forces were nearly identical wang et al 2013 conducted a physical test on the flow of four cylinder square array at re 8000 the effects of different spacing ratios l d and incidence angle α on the flow characteristics were investigated the mutual interference effect was also explained the flow interference between cylinders was complex in the four cylinder array according to the combination of α and l d values which may be asynchronous quasi periodic and so on most of the above investigators studied the flow characteristics of multi cylinder groups with large reynolds numbers but the study of cylinder groups under small reynolds numbers was also worthy of attention bao et al 2010 performed a 2d numerical study by using second order characteristic based split finite element algorithm which studied flow around an in line array of six square cylinders with different spacing ratios 1 5 15 at re 100 according to the change of gap spacing the flow pattern of multi cylinder array could be divided into six flow regimes for the gap region around the wake mode transition there were two different lifting force fluctuation jumping mechanisms han et al 2013 used the spectral element method to numerically study the 2d flow around four cylinders in square arrangement at spacing ratios l d 1 5 4 0 re 200 by considering two incidence angles of 0 and 45 under a certain reynolds number the spacing ratio had a great influence on the flow patterns and three flow regimes could be observed in four cylinders at two incidence angles gao et al 2017 numerically studied the 2d flow characteristics of the square arranged four cylinder group with different spacing ratios l d 1 5 5 0 at low reynolds number range re 100 1000 the results indicated that the flow characteristics behind a group of four cylinders are obviously controlled by the two key parameter listed before l d and re with the increasing re the transition of the flow pattern proceeded rapidly and the value of the force coefficient correspondingly appeared to fluctuate strongly in addition to the above researches on the four cylinder array the investigation of the multi cylinder group with more cylinders also attracted researchers attention by making use of the piv technique ma et al 2017 conducted the experiment on the flow around a nine cylinder array in square at four different spacing ratios l d 1 5 to 3 0 and subcritical reynolds numbers re 1500 to 5000 they mainly analyzed the influence of the spacing ratio and the reynolds number on the fluid force coefficients and explained the wake field characteristics of the cylinder compared with the reynolds number l d has more severe effects on the wake field characteristics and fluid forces nicollei and eames 2011 applied a high precision calculation method to calculate the flow around a group of cylinders with fixed diameter ratios at re 2100 the influence of void fraction was studied by exploring the flow characteristics of cylinder groups the vortices variation characteristics in the wake of the cylinder groups were revealed and three typical flow patterns were observed islam et al 2016b studied the effect of spacing ratio on the 2d flow characteristics of five rectangular square cylinders based on the lattice boltzmann method lbm with a reynolds number of 150 the characteristics of the related parameters were analyzed such as the fluid force coefficients vortex shedding frequency and other parameters of the square cylinder they found that the maximum value of the mean drag coefficient appeared at gap spacing of 0 5 the above literature mainly studied the effects of the spacing ratio and the incidence angle on the mutual interference effect and the flow characteristics of four cylinders and multiple cylinders at low re bao et al 2010 han et al 2013 gao et al 2017 respectively in addition at the large reynolds numbers compared with the 2d models the three dimensional numerical models are capable to simulate the flow characteristics around the cylinder and explain the vortex transportation as well as the conversion mechanism furthermore few research work reveal the flow characteristics in the turbulent flow regime after adding the 5th cylinder to the center of a four cylinder array at the subcritical reynolds number together with the combined effect of the spacing ratio and the incidence angle at present the research on the flow and mutual interference mechanism of multiple cylinders can be further investigated in this paper the main research parameters include three kinds of incidence angles and seven different spacing ratios the flow characteristics and boundary vortex flux characteristics of four cylinder and five cylinder arrays will be uncovered respectively the flow characteristics of the surrounding four cylinders are analyzed by considering the influence of the center cylinder as emphasis the entire flow field the mean pressure and fluid force coefficients will be analyzed and the vortex shedding frequency of the cylinders will be discussed as well this paper will provide an in depth analysis of the flow problem and mutual interference mechanism of multi cylinder structure the paper is organized as follows the numerical methodology and the computational domain together with the boundary conditions are presented in section 2 following this the validation cases of flow around the single cylinder and four cylinders are shown in section 3 the mechanism of the flow mutual interference is revealed in section 4 in section 5 the main findings are summarized 2 numerical methods 2 1 governing equations by using the 3d les turbulence model the filtered navier stokes equations for incompressible flows are written as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j ν 2 u i x j x j 1 ρ p x i where u i are the filtered velocity components in the cartesian coordinates x i p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid here u i u j is defined by u i u j u i u j u i u j u i u j and τ i j u i u j u i u j is the sub grid scale stress eq 2 can be written as 3 u i t u i u j x j ν 2 u i x j x j 1 ρ p x i τ i j x j the majority of subgrid scale models are based on the eddy viscosity models as follow 4 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 ν t s i j where the trace of the subgrid scale stress is incorporated into the pressure which results in a modified pressure term ν t is the subgrid scale kinematic viscosity and s i j is the strain rate tensor for the resolved scale defined by 5 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i in the most basic of subgrid scale models the subgrid kinematic viscosity ν t is modelled by 6 ν t l s 2 s i j where l s is the mixing length for the subgrid scales and s i j 2 s i j s i j l s can be computed using 7 l s min k y c s δ 1 3 where k is the von kármán constant k 0 42 and y is the distance to the nearest wall c s is the smagorinsky constant is the volume of the computational cell the value of the model constant c s is flow dependent and found to vary from 0 065 to 0 25 in fact a large c s value c s 0 2 may causes excessive damping of the large scale fluctuations and a small value c s 0 1 can affect convergence of correlation curve lam and lin 2007 the numerical calculation in the present work is based on a constant c s 0 2 reported by zhang et al 2015 in this study finite volume method fvm is chosen in the cfd software ansys fluent for discretization in order to realize the coupling between the pressure and the velocity fields the algorithm simple is adopted patankar and spalding 1972 which could help to accelerate the convergence of equation and reach a good accuracy during the calculation gao et al 2017 there are two kinds of conditions at the boundary for the pressure correction equation the pressure at the boundary is given the velocity is unknown and the velocity component normal to the boundary is specified as for the spatial discretization of the convective term is accomplished through the quadratic upwind interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme and a central difference scheme is used for the diffusive terms of the momentum equations the bounded second order implicit forward discretization is used for the transient formulation to reduce the convergence time compared to other equations the continuity equation is harder to converge thus the criteria for convergence are residual 10 4 for continuity equation and 10 5 for other equations respectively in summary there are two differential equations with four main unknowns which include three velocity vectors and one pressure scalar 2 2 computational models and grid independence test the entire computational domain is defined as 40 2 n cos α π 10 d 20 2 n cos α π 10 d h length width height in the simulations here n is the dimensionless coefficient which can be calculated by n l d and the computational domain in the z direction is set at h 4d where d is the circular cylinder diameter the origin coordinate o 0 0 0 is set at the center of the bottom of the center cylinder as shown in fig 1 on the other hand the boundary conditions are as follows the inlet boundary u u v 0 w 0 the outlet boundary u x v x w x 0 and the no slip wall condition u 0 v 0 w 0 applied to the surface of the circular cylinders where u v and w denote the velocity in x y and z direction the pressure boundary condition p 0 is imposed on the outlet the upstream boundary is set at 10d from the center of the upstream cylinder the downstream boundary is 30d away from the center of the downstream cylinder symmetry conditions are used at the lateral boundaries in this work the reynolds number is fixed at re 3900 where re ud ν and ν 1 39000 m2 s the mesh is divided by a hexahedral structured grid with a total of about 6 2 million grids as shown in fig 2 the number of nodes is 42 along the cylinder spanwise considering the accuracy and reliability of numerical calculations the surrounding area and the wake area of the cylinder are mesh encrypted the encryption area is 5d 5d with 8 encryption layers and the grid size near the wall of the cylinder is 0 003182d to easily control the cell size near the cylinder an o type grid of 0 1d in width is adopted around the cylinder in addition it can be seen from fig 2 that no mesh distortion is generated in the mesh encryption area in order to facilitate the description of the relative positional relationship between the cylinders array the four cylinders are named as cylinder 1 c1 cylinder 2 c2 cylinder 3 c3 and cylinder 4 c4 respectively the four cylinder and five cylinder arrays are abbreviated as 4c and 5c and the center cylinder arranged in 5c is expressed as cc the single circular cylinder is abbreviated as sc the pressure coefficient on the cylinder surface is defined as c p p p 0 0 5ρu 2 where p and p 0 are the static pressure of the cylinder surface and static pressure of the oncoming flow respectively the total drag coefficient and lift coefficient are defined as cd 2f d ρu 2 hd and cl 2f l ρu 2 hd respectively the strouhal number is dimensionless frequency of the vortex shedding defined by st f s d u where f d f l f are the total drag force lift force and the vortex shedding frequency respectively the grid model with an incidence angle of α 0 is compared and verified and the grid independence tests are carried out for the four circular cylinders with l d 4 0 at re 3900 the effects of the number of circumferential nodes and the wall grid scale on the numerical results of the flow around the circular cylinder such as the average drag coefficient and the st are also analyzed it can be seen from table 1 that the calculated results with different number of circumferential nodes are quite different the numerical results of mesh models with different near wall meshes are compared and analyzed mesh1 mesh2 and mesh3 vary in the scale of first layer near wall of cylinder while mesh1 mesh4 and mesh5 change the number of circumferential nodes it should be noted that with the consideration of the time consumption of the present simulations and the accuracy of the results all the investigations presented hereafter are based on the mesh1 the normalized time step is fixed as uδt d 0 05 which meets with the requirement of courant friedrichs lewy cfl calculation formula δt cfl δx u here the number of cfl is less than 1 0 zou et al 2008 zhu et al 2017 courant et al 1967 where δt is the time step and u is the free stream velocity compared with the results of zdravkovich 1987 there are still some gaps between the two results the main reasons may be the three dimensional effect of turbulence ignored by zdravkovich 1987 and the different turbulence models selected the y values are smaller than 1 in all simulation where y u δy 1 ν where u denotes the friction velocity at the nearest wall δy 1 is grid scale of the boundary layer zhang et al 2016 have used the time averaged drag coefficient integral curve to determine whether turbulent flow has reached steady fig 3 shows the average drag coefficient integral curve of five cylinders with l d 3 5 at an incidence angle of 0 it can be seen from fig 3 that the mean time history curve of the drag coefficient gradually becomes stable and the turbulent flow is considered to be stable additionally the statistics are collected after nearly 500 vortex shedding periods when the vortex shedding is fully developed in the simulation the statistics are captured every time step and a total of 30 vortex shedding periods are counted breuer 1998 3 validation of the numerical method in this section to verify the accuracy and reliability of the les model and corresponding parameters the numerical simulation results of the flow past the single circular cylinder and four cylinders arranged in square configuration are compared with existing literature breuer 1998 kravchenko and moin 2000 lehmkuhl et al 2013 the statistical values of the fluid force coefficient of the single cylinder sc such as the mean drag coefficient the st and the average separation angle θ sep are listed in table 2 together with those reported in existing literature the result of present study is close to that of the corresponding literature which shows that the present numerical calculation method has good applicability in this paper in addition the distribution of the mean streamwise velocity along the centerline of the wake region at the middle height of the cylinder z h 0 50 is compared to results from the literature lourenco and shih 1993 yan et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 a the distribution of the mean streamwise velocity z h 0 50 is selected from different locations of the wake the average velocity of the profile is presented at three positions of 1 04 1 58 and 2 02 respectively as shown in fig 4 b although there are subtle differences between present values and literature results the trends are completely consistent with the variation of the position of the wake field the time averaged velocity distribution changes from u shaped to v shaped gradually becomes flat and finally tends to be smooth as straight line furthermore the results of the four cylinder array in square configuration are compared with the results obtained by lam and zou 2010 wang et al 2013 table 3 it can be seen from table 3 that the mean drag coefficient and st in this method are in good agreement with the results in the literature which provides considerable evidence to validate the numerical method however there is a small disparity between the present results and literature results which is attributed to a combination of effects related to re notable differences in aspect ratio free stream conditions etc 4 results and discussions 4 1 flow pattern the pattern of the flow around the multiple cylinders appears several different classes with the change of the incidence angles and the vortex shedding from the cylinder is apparent based on the fact that there is a strong interference for the flow field of the multi cylinder structure in small gap regime the results of two typical spacing ratios l d 2 0 and 3 5 are given the instantaneous non dimensional 3d vortex structures of 4c and 5c cases are presented in figs 5 8 with three different incidence angles the dimensionless streamwise vortex ω x and spanwise vortex ω z structures are defined by ω x d w y v z u and ω z d v x u y u respectively in small gap flow regime l d 2 0 the streamwise vortex distribution is more disordered in the wake of the cylinder group after the center cylinder cc is added at α 0 it is known that there are more vortices diffusing from the surfaces of c1 and c2 before adding the cc as shown in fig 5 a in addition the wake of c3 and c4 shows an oblique flow in the five cylinder array which leads to the increment of the width of the wake region when the incidence angle is 22 5 the wake of the upstream cylinder c1 is hindered by the cc however the vortex shed from cc directly hits the upstream surface of c3 while the pattern of vortex structure for c2 and c4 is not significantly subjected to cc as shown in fig 5 b with the incidence angle changing to 45 as shown in fig 5 c the wake development of c1 is limited which is mainly due to the blocking effect of cc on the other hand the wake pattern of c2 and c4 is less affected by cc due to its special side by side arrangement in addition the upstream surface of the c3 is impacted by the wake of cc which may lead to the change of the original vortex shedding pattern it is also very important to observe the development of the spanwise vortex ω z around cylinders fig 6 shows the spanwise vortex development of the cylinder group with small spacing ratio case at different incidence angles the development of the free shear layer can be observed near the wall of cylinder which is expressed as the corrugated shear layer csl zhang and samtaney 2016 it can be seen that the csl mainly forms and spreads from the surface of the upstream and midstream cylinders and then it may be stretched and deformed markedly for α 0 case the csl of c1 and c2 develops from the surface of the downstream cylinder and it rolls up to form a vortex before adding cc into 4c array with the addition of the cc the csl pattern of c1 and c2 shows the deflected flow which disturbs the formation of the free shear layer near the wall of the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 6 a the mutual interference effect is relatively strong among the cylinders located in five cylinder array not only leading to a significant skewed flow for cylinder but also inducing a complex mechanical behavior in addition it can be found that the csl of the cylinder is torn and deformed greatly in the wake area for 5c case and its integrity is disturbed when the incidence angle changes to 22 5 there is a noteworthy deflected flow in the csl development of c1 after adding cc while it does not influence the csl development of c2 with the incidence angle changing to 45 the center cylinder has a great influence on the wake development of c1 and c3 furthermore the csl of c1 is attached to the surface of cc and further develops to the surface of c3 when the spacing ratio increases to 3 5 critical gap flow regime the gap between the cylinders increases a lot and the wake development of each cylinder can develop in a large room fig 7 shows the streamwise vortices of the cylinder group under the condition of l d 3 5 at different incidence angles compared with the small spacing ratio case the influence of cc on the wake development of c1 and c2 at α 0 is weakened for which a lot of large scale streamwise vortices can be observed in the gap region furthermore the wake pattern of the whole system changes to a disorder state that the number of streamwise vortices increases and its spatial distribution is changed along downstream direction however the cc hinders the development of the wake of c1 to a certain extent with an incidence angle of 22 5 resulting in the smaller number of vortices diffusing from the surface of c1 when α is 45 the wake vortex of c1 is also blocked by cc while the vortex scale is transformed into a multi scale pattern in the wake region of c1 fig 8 shows the development of the spanwise vortex of each cylinder with the condition of l d 3 5 in different inflow directions when α 0 based on the fact that the deflected flow of wake can be observed for c1 and c2 in 5c system the influence of cc on the csl development pattern of the upstream cylinders cannot be ignored besides the distribution of the vortex is very disordered behind the wake region of the whole 5c group when α 22 5 the influence of cc on the csl development of each cylinder is also not negligible that the wake of the cylinder group changes greatly into a chaotic state the csl on c1 surface develops along downstream direction gets stretched and interferes with the development of free shear layer between cc and c3 surface at α 22 5 as depicted in fig 8 b for α 45 case the csl of c1 interferences with cc and forms a vortex along the downstream after adding cc as depicted in fig 8 c on the other hand the vortex pattern of c2 and c4 in 5c system is consistent with the results of 4c case 4 2 vorticity transportation and deformation since the wake dynamics of cylinders are mainly associated with vortices it is important to examine the source of the vorticity in an incompressible flow vorticity can only be generated on the no slip surface and enter the flow by diffusion the rate at which the vorticity is created at the surface per unit area and time is measured by the boundary vorticity flux bvf lightthill 1963 defined as 8 σ ν n ν n ω where is the vorticity gradient tensor at wall and n is the unit normal vector σ is a vector of 3 1 dimension the three components of bvf σ x σ y σ z denote the generation the three vorticity components ω x ω y ω z the bvf components can be normally defined by σ i σ i ρu 2 considering the representativeness and typicality of relevant data the bvf distribution characteristic is selected for the classic case for the analysis in critical flow regime l d 3 5 fig 9 only shows the distribution of the bvf components σ x σ y σ z of the four cylinders and five cylinders with l d 3 5 at α 45 respectively in the four cylinder array σ x and σ y are mainly distributed at the c3 upstream surface while they are very small on other cylinders surfaces however the distribution of σ z is not zero on the surface of the four cylinders it is worth noting that σ z is distributed along the axial direction of c3 and a peak region can be observed as shown in fig 9 c it is suggested that ω x and ω y develop substantially along the surface of the downstream cylinder c3 and diffuse into the flow field this is consistent with the characteristic of the streamwise vorticity distribution in section 4 1 on the other hand ω z normally originates from some specified cylinders c1 c2 and c4 in four cylinder array and enters into the wake it is concluded that the distribution characteristics of bvf components can better explain the vortex transportation mechanisms which are related to the vortex development mechanisms by adding the center cylinder the distribution characteristics of σ x and σ y for the surrounding cylinders are partially affected as shown in figs 9 a and b for c1 the σ x of the c1 surface is almost 0 indicating that the c1 vortex transportation is suppressed by cc however for c2 c4 and cc σ x and σ y increase slightly showing that more downstream vortices diffuse from the cylinder surface into the flow field as compared with 4c case however the bvf components of center cylinder also exhibit alternating positive and negative values in the 5c system ω x is basically transported from the cc and c3 surfaces into the flow field in fact the addition of the cc has a large influence on the distribution characteristic of σ z on c3 surface meanwhile the σ z continuity distribution is disturbed by the center cylinder along spanwise direction of the c3 it can be seen that the development mechanism of ω x and ω y changes a lot after the addition of the cc the reason is that ω x and ω y are simultaneously generated from the center cylinder and downstream cylinder and develop along downstream direction in addition ω z simultaneously develops from special cylinder located in five cylinder array as shown in fig 9 c when ω z develops from the surfaces of cc and c3 it is stretched and deformed resulting in the transformation of ω z to ω x and forming the rib like vortex along downstream direction the vortex stretches and deforms when it goes in the flow field from the cylinder surface resulting in the original σ z converting into σ x it is significant to observe the change of σ z to σ x because the σ x plays a major role in suppressing generation of vortex in order to further analyze the transportation mechanism of vorticity the development of ω x is investigated based on the vorticity stretching term p 1 ω x u x and vorticity turning term p 2 ω y u y ω z u z of ω x equation zhao et al 2017 perkins 1970 hansen et al 2016 the normalization of the p1 and p2 terms are marked as p1 p1 u d 2 and p2 p2 u d 2 respectively fig 10 shows the distributions of p1 and p2 along the surface of the cylinder of four cylinders and five cylinders respectively the mechanisms of the vortex stretching and transformation are impressively different between four cylinder array and five cylinder array 9 d ω x d t ω x u x ω y u y ω z u z ν 2 ω x in fact the terms p1 and p2 show the effect of streamwise vorticity stretching on ω x and the generation of ω x which is by means of vorticity tilting respectively so the overall influence of vorticity convection on ω x can be expressed as p1 p2 in the four cylinder array it can be found that the distribution of the primary vortex is mainly concentrated on the surface of the downstream cylinder c3 which is the same as the distribution of bvf components σ x σ y as shown in fig 10 the scale of p1 on the c1 surface is smaller than that of other cylinders which indicates that ω x diffuses and deforms less into the flow field the sign of p1 p2 changes which further weakens the primary vortices as depicted in fig 10 c the vortex stretching is nearly offset by the vorticity tilting mechanism which leads to the reduction of the p1 p2 iso surface magnitude and induces the generation of secondary vortices after adding the center cylinder the scale of primary vortex from the c1 surface reduces slightly with some secondary vortices attaching to surface of c2 c4 as shown in figs 10 a and b it indicates that the addition of the center cylinder has an effect on the vortex stretching and deformation of c2 c4 for c1 its wake development is suppressed by cc which reveals the formation mechanism of the primary vortex with small scale moreover the center cylinder has a certain weakening effect on the p1 p2 transformation mechanism resulting in a number of primary vortices on the downstream cylinder surface fig 10 c the term p1 evolution mechanism is closely related to the streamwise velocity gradient in shear layer u x can be either positive or negative at the surface because the acceleration or deceleration of streamwise velocity would take place near the primary vortices in addition the free shear layer separation is also related to its surrounding static pressure distribution for multi cylinder array due to the presence of a reverse pressure gradient around the surface of the cylinder the free shear layer gradually separates and forms eddy in the flow field the secondary vortex also affects the development of the shear layer of the cylinder and the p1 p2 combination is connected with the static pressure 4 3 time averaged flow field this section is to further explore the influence of cc on the distribution characteristics and fluid force characteristics of the other four cylinders figs 12 15 show the time averaged vorticity distribution the timed averaged pressure distribution the time averaged streamline distribution with small flow regime l d 2 0 and critical flow regime l d 3 5 at z h 0 5 the purple color filled region is defined by positive pressure and the gray region indicates negative pressure in the follow diagrams respectively as shown in fig 11 with the presence of positive pressure gradient cp mean decreases sharply from stagnation point resulting in accelerating the flow of the boundary layer moreover cp mean reaches the lowest value along the circumference which is located in the range of θ 70 120 as depicted in fig 11 b the position of cp mean 0 on the cylinder where pressure changes sign from positive to negative is related to its forward pressure gradient thus it will affect the separation of the boundary layer near the wall surface of cylinder when the incidence angle is 0 the vortices of the c1 and c2 attach near the upstream surface of the downstream cylinders c3 and c4 before the cc is added at small spacing ratio causing a reduction in the scale of positive pressure zone meanwhile the time averaged vortex formation length reduces significantly for the downstream cylinders and the pressure difference reduces between the front rear of the cylinders it could induce a drag crisis for downstream cylinders after adding the center cylinder c1 and c2 show an obvious oblique flow which can also be found in the time average streamline diagram as shown in fig 14 a the presence of cc has a small effect on the pressure distribution of c1 and c2 however it causes the positive pressure region to further expand for c3 and c4 which eventually relieves the drag crisis of the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 12 a this is mainly due to the blocking effect of cc which weakens the impact strength of upstream cylinders for c3 and c4 compared with the sc result θ sta 0 it can be found that the stagnation points shift to other positions for c1 and c2 the c3 and c4 are affected by the wake vortex of the upstream cylinder in 4c system so that the stagnation point is not sure and cannot be clearly observed with adding the cc due to the development of the skew flow of the c1 and c2 the positions of the stagnation points are not affected by the wake for c3 and c4 after adding cc as shown in fig 14 a when the spacing ratio increases to 3 5 the pressure distribution and wake characteristics of the upstream cylinder c1 and c2 are different from the results of the l d 2 0 in the four cylinder array as depicted in fig 13 a the downstream cylinders c3 and c4 are impacted by the vortex derived from upstream cylinders for which the position of stagnation points is not clear with the addition of the fifth cylinder cc the scale of positive pressure distribution of the downstream cylinders are larger than the results of 4c system indicating that cc has a greater obstruction effect in the 5c system which can protect the downstream cylinders from the direct impact of the vortex in addition the wake deflection angles of c1 and c2 increase intuitively and greatly which can be seen from fig 14 a when the incidence angle is 22 5 with small flow regime l d 2 0 the size of the positive pressure region is small for c1 before cc is added as shown in fig 12 b when the cc is added the positive pressure of the c1 increases significantly which is closely related to the pattern of deflected wake however due to the influence of cc deflected flow its positive pressure region reduces significantly for c3 it can be seen from streamline that the stagnation point of each cylinder is clearly visible in the four cylinders before cc is added on the other hand stagnation point of c3 is not obvious due to the existence of defected flow in the five cylinder system as shown in fig 14 b when the spacing ratio changes to 3 5 the pressure distribution of each cylinder shows a significant positive pressure region in the four cylinder array as shown in fig 13 b due to the staggered arrangement of the cylinders and the increasing gap the vortex shedding can be observed and the positions of the stagnation points are clear for each cylinder it s worth to mention that even though the relative arrangement of each cylinder changes and the gap area is also squeezed when the fifth cylinder is added to the original 4c system the scale of positive pressure distribution of each cylinder are close to the corresponding results of 4c the difference is that the wake pattern of the upstream cylinders c1 and c2 is transformed into a deflected flow as shown in fig 15 b with the incidence angle changing to 45 c3 is affected by the impact of the wake shedding vortex of c1 due to the full development of the wakes of cylinders without cc at l d 2 0 the positive pressure region in 4c array is larger than that of five cylinder result for c3 in the five cylinder system due to the strong wake impact a large negative pressure region appears in the upstream surface of c3 which leads to a drag crisis as shown in fig 12 c it can be seen from fig 14 c that the stagnation point position of c3 changes to disorder after cc is added and the deflected flow pattern weakens suddenly for c2 when the spacing ratio increases to 3 5 due to the impact of the wake of the cc the scale of positive pressure region shrinks markedly for c3 as shown in fig 13 c however compared with the results of 4c case the wake vortex patterns of c2 and c4 do not change significantly for 5c case because a larger spacing gap among them in side by side arrangement for c1 before adding cc its mean recirculation length is significantly smaller than the result of 5c case as depicted in fig 15 c 4 4 fluid force coefficients in this section the effect of both gap spacing and incidence angles on the force characteristics in multi cylinder array is discussed based on drag and lift forces statistics figs 16 18 show the variation of the fluid force coefficients with different gap spacing and incidence angles where void curves and solid curves denote the case of four cylinder array and the case of five cylinder array respectively the results of sc are introduced for comparative analysis in this section fig 16 shows the variations of mean drag coefficient as the key variable to reflect l d at different incidence angles in fact due to the existence of gap flow between the multi cylinder array the force characteristics of five cylinder array show a drastic change at small gap flow regime l d 2 0 3 0 as shown in fig 16 for four cylinder array case the mean drag coefficients of downstream cylinders c3 and c4 gradually increase with the increasing l d and then keep steady l d 3 5 at α 0 adding a circular cylinder into the center of the four cylinder array leads to considerable changes of the mean drag coefficient it is worth noting that c3 and c4 have a drag crisis in the small spacing ratio cases for 4c system which is mainly caused by the strong wake impact of the upstream cylinders for 5c case the drag crisis phenomenon of c3 and c4 cannot be observed in the critical flow regime l d 3 5 5 0 and large flow regime l d 5 7 0 the mean drag coefficient keeps relatively stable for c3 and c4 in both 4c and 5c system however the mean drag coefficient of the downstream cylinder c3 changes markedly in five cylinder array at α 22 5 which can be attributed to the wake impact of cc at small gap flow regime l d 2 0 3 0 as shown in fig 16 b the drag crisis appears on c3 and it is not found for other cylinders in addition for 5c cases the mean drag coefficient of c2 remains at a high level after adding cc in the range of l d 2 0 2 5 and it approaches to the result of sc with the increasing of l d compared with the results of sc the mean drag value of the downstream cylinders c3 and c4 are stable in the range of higher l d values for all cases when the incidence angle is 45 c3 shows negative drag due to the strong wake interference of cc at the small spacing ratios l d 2 0 2 5 as shown in fig 16 c it can be seen from fig 12 c that the surface of c3 is under negative pressure which in turn leads to a negative drag in c3 in fact the addition of the fifth cylinder causes the vortex shedding modes of c1 cc and c3 to be transformed into overshoot pattern papaioannou et al 2006 where the three cylinders are close to each other and serve as a single cylinder zhou et al 2019 with the spacing ratio gradually increasing the gap between the cylinders increases and the vortex shedding pattern changes again for c1 cc and c3 a positive pressure region appears on the surface of c3 and the negative drag phenomenon is gradually interrupted on the other hand for c1 the development of the wake is hindered by cc and the mean drag is smaller than that without cc fig 17 shows the variations of mean lift coefficients to reflect the change of key parameter of l d at three incidence angles 0 22 5 45 for the cases of incidence angles α 0 and 45 the distribution of c l is following a symmetric fashion along the centerline of the cylinder array x axis since the arrangement of multi cylinder is symmetric about the flow of computational domain this phenomenon has not been observed at α 22 5 but the trough for c l of c3 is available at l d 4 0 it should be noted that c l distribution of c3 is different from other cylinders in both four cylinder and five cylinder arrays for the small gap flow regime l d 2 0 3 0 depicted in fig 17 a the value c l of all cylinders located in multi cylinder is far from zero which is owing to the mutual interference effect between cylinders at α 0 otherwise the curve slightly fluctuates as the spacing increases from l d 4 0 7 0 and gradually approaches to c l of a single cylinder from fig 17 c the fashion of c l in the case of α 45 is similar to that of α 0 for c2 and c4 in five cylinder array fig 18 shows the changes of r m s drag coefficient cd for different cases when the incidence angle is α 0 and α 22 5 the cd value of the upstream cylinder is smaller than that of the downstream cylinder and gradually approaches the results of sc as the spacing ratio increases at l d 2 0 although the wake pattern of c1 and c2 undergoes a large change deflected flow the corresponding cd value is not dramatically affected when cc is added at α 0 and α 22 5 furthermore the cd value of c1 is less affected by the cc and incidence angles under the case of α 22 5 for 5c system the drag oscillation of c3 is obviously larger than that of other cylinders as depicted in fig 18 b for α 45 after adding cc in the interval of l d 2 0 5 0 the cd of c3 is greater than that of other cylinders subsequently fig 19 shows the variation of r m s lift coefficients with three incident angles and l d based on the fact that the fluctuation of lift coefficient for downstream cylinders is larger than that of upstream cylinders at α 0 and α 22 5 it can be concluded that the downstream cylinders are subjected to the impact of the wake resulting in the distorting of the original stability of the vortex shedding frequency by adding the cc into the four cylinder array the r m s lift coefficient also changes apparently with the increasing of the spacing ratio from l d 2 0 7 0 for three incidence angles for the case of α 0 the cl of c1 and c2 has basically the same changing trend with spacing ratio for 4c and 5c case as well c3 and c4 with the increasing of l d the cl of the upstream cylinders c1 and c2 gradually coincides with the corresponding results of sc as shown in fig 19 a for the case α 45 the cl value of the c3 is close to result of sc for the five cylinder array at l d 2 0 which is only half of c3 in 4c system the c3 lift oscillation curve has a peak cl 0 73 at l d 3 0 in four cylinder array for 5c the cl of c3 undergoes a dramatic jump with the value of cl 0 75 at l d 4 0 as shown in fig 19 c 4 5 spanwise distribution characteristics the introduction of the 5th cylinder complicates the flow around the typical four cylinder array with l d 2 0 at α 45 in order to further understand the 3d distribution of the fluid forces and flow characteristics of the five cylinders with l d 2 0 at α 45 the spatial temporal distribution of the fluid force coefficients is presented in this section for which zhang et al 2020 stated that the friction can be ignored in drag at high reynolds numbers figs 20 and 21 show the spatial temporal distribution of the drag coefficients and the lift coefficients along the spanwise direction of cylinder with l d 2 0 at α 45 the spatial temporal distribution of lift and drag coefficients is composed of many filament like lines which exhibit periodic changes in addition the color depth of filaments represents the drag value of the cylinder meanwhile the spatial temporal distribution of the lift coefficient is composed of many filament lines and the width of these lines is 0 09 or 0 33 dimensionless second which correspond to the periods of the vortex shedding the spatial temporal distribution characteristics of c1 are obviously different from other cylinders because the addition of the 5th cylinder has an inhibitory effect on the development of the wake of c1 moreover c1 cc and c3 act as a whole structure causing the change of the periodic pattern of the original fluid force it also causes changes in the vortex shedding frequency of c1 and c3 after the introduction of the 5th cylinder since c2 c4 and cc are arranged side by side the vortex shedding modes of c2 and c4 are less affected by cc therefore for c2 the lines width of spatial temporal of the force coefficients is close to the results of c4 as shown in figs 21 b and d notably the magnitude of the drag coefficient reaches its minimum value cd 0 65 near the middle height range of c1 and assumes a larger level 0 7 cd 0 8 at the end of the cylinder besides it can be seen from fig 21 a that the larger value 0 1 cl 0 2 of the lift coefficient is concentrated in the middle height range for c1 as compared to smaller value 0 3 cl 0 15 near the bottom and top moreover the strong three dimensional characteristics of spatial temporal of force coefficient can be observed for each cylinder due to the obstruction of the 5th cylinder c3 may undergo a huge change in its vortex shedding mode which can be seen from fig 14 c the spatial temporal distribution of drag fluctuates in the negative range for c3 this means that the phenomenon of negative drag can be clearly observed which is consistent with the previous analysis in section 4 4 in order to further analyze the three dimensional flow characteristics of the cylinder spanwise correlation of fluid force coefficients is introduced which is an important indicator of three dimensional characteristics gabbai and benaroya 2005 this is also significant for the vortex induced vibration of the structure as shown in zhang et al 2016 the correlation coefficient is computed as follows 10 ρ z 1 z 2 ε z 1 μ z 1 z 2 μ z 2 σ z 1 σ z 2 where μ x and σ x are the mean and standard deviation variables while x z 1 and z 2 can be represented at any two different span positions in this section the bottom of the cylinder is used as a reference point so the correlation coefficient of the lift and drag coefficients can be expressed as ρ 0 z fig 22 shows the correlation coefficients of the drag and lift of the four and five cylinders along the spanwise direction in which ρ 0 0 1 is the maximum value that can be found since the upper and lower bottom surfaces of the flow field are set as symmetric boundary conditions the correlation coefficient reaches the minimum value at z d 4 for four cylinders case and five cylinders case however for c3 in the five cylinder array the minimum value of drag spanwise correlation coefficient appears near the mid height section at about z d 2 with ρ 0 2 0 48 which is significantly different from the results of other cylinders this is probably due to the fact that cc has a greater hindering effect on c3 which further induces the drastic changes for the c3 wake and pressure characteristics as depicted in figs 12 c and 13 c it can be seen that the correlation coefficient of each cylinder is not the same in the cylinder group and decreases with the increase of z d after adding cc the drag correlation coefficient of c1 varies around a fixed value which is a little higher than 0 9 these results are consistent with its spatial temporal distribution characteristics the drag coefficient of c2 decreases sharply along the spanwise direction and reaches the minimum value ρ 0 4 0 15 at z d 4 in 5c system in addition the correlation coefficient of lift is worth more analysis and discussion because it is related to the vortex shedding pattern along the spanwise direction of cylinder the lift correlation coefficients of c2 and c4 increase with the increasing z d after the cc is added as shown in fig 22 b this shows that the three dimensional characteristics of c2 and c4 have been weakened after adding cc on the other hand the lift spanwise correlation coefficient of c1 and c3 decreases along the axial height in five cylinder array compared with the results of four cylinder case at larger axial distances due to the shedding of 3d vortices the correlation coefficient of lift may reach zero norberg 2003 the corresponding research by lee et al 2014 showed that a reasonable prediction of spanwise correlation coefficient can be established only when the cylinder height reaches 16d with applying the periodicity boundary conditions along spanwise direction of cylinder however the spanwise length is far from reaching this requirement but some notable features can still be observed in the current simulation for instance the lift spanwise correlation coefficient of c2 and c4 achieves a smaller value ρ 0 4 0 29 at z d 4 in the four cylinder array 4 6 vortex shedding frequency based on the time series for lift force coefficient fourier transformation is applied to reveal the frequency characteristics of the kármán vortex around multi cylinder array the frequency peaks on the power spectrum density plot of lift force coefficient show the existence of flow interference in the current study the influence of the center cylinder on the flow characteristics and mechanical properties of the surrounding cylinder four cylinder array is significant at the mall gap flow regime l d 2 0 while such influence has been partially weakened in large gap flow regime l d 5 0 furthermore within the large gap flow regime the influence of cc on the surrounding cylinder is negligible for the characteristics of vortex shedding frequency fig 23 shows the variation of the vortex shedding frequencies which is normalized by f s d u with the spacing ratio l d 2 0 5 0 here black curves and red curves denote the case of four cylinder array and the case of five cylinder array respectively the value of the x coordinate corresponding to the primary peak of the psd curve is almost the same for all four cylinders cases under the same incidence angle and spacing ratio in which the same results have also been recorded by liang et al 2009 and sewatkar et al 2012 for the small gap flow regime l d 2 0 it can be seen that the vortex shedding frequencies of the surrounding cylinders increase by 2 5 times after adding cc for the case α 0 in addition by adding the cc the frequency of the wake fluctuation for four cylinder array slightly moves to a lager value for the case α 22 5 it can be seen from figs 23 a and c that the c1 and c3 are strongly influenced by the center cylinder which causes the vortex shedding frequency to reduce to about 1 4 for the case α 45 in five cylinder array the flow interference among the cylinders is very complicated while considering the l d and α thus the psd distribution characteristics are analyzed with α 45 as a typical case fig 24 shows the time history of force coefficients of each cylinder in the four cylinder and five cylinder array at α 45 in the four cylinder array the oscillation of lift coefficient of c3 is significantly stronger than that of other cylinders while the mean drag coefficient is significantly smaller than that of other cylinders in addition due to the deflected flow pattern behind the wake region of c2 and c4 the corresponding psd curve shows a double peak phenomenon after the 5th cylinder is added the intensity of deflected flow gradually decreases for c2 and c4 and the psd curve shows a significant primary peak the original vortex shedding patterns of c1 and c3 show a change otherwise c1 cc and c3 are like a whole structure and only generate a single vortex shedding in which its vortex shedding frequency decreases sharply in addition due to the impact of the cc wake compared with the result of 4c case the oscillation of the lift coefficient falls markedly for c3 and the drag coefficient fluctuates in the negative range for c3 causing the primary peak of the psd curve being quite vague however the results of c2 and c4 are almost unaffected by cc for the same α as shown in figs 23 b and d the main reason for this result is that the wake development of c1 is hindered by the center cylinder and the inflow of the c3 is also shielded by that one seen figs 5 and 6 with the spacing ratio increasing to 3 5 the wake of the cylinder can be further extended as shown in figs 13 and 14 for different incidence angles a significant vortex shedding phenomenon can be observed for each cylinder which agrees with the corresponding psd behavior when the center cylinder is added in four cylinder array the wakes of c1 and c2 have obvious deflected flow pattern and the vortex shedding frequency pattern is changed compared with other cases the center cylinder has a greater effect on the vortex shedding frequency of the four cylinders at α 0 and α 22 5 this is mainly due to the change of the flow pattern in the gap region of the cylinder group for the larger gap flow regime l d 5 0 the vortex is fully developed in the wake region of the cylinder the vortex shedding frequencies of each cylinder are almost the same in all cases 5 conclusion the 3d numerical investigation on flow past multi cylinder array is carried out at eight spacing ratios l d 2 0 7 0 and three incidence angles α 0 22 5 and 45 at re 3900 the influence of cc on the flow characteristics for a four cylinder array is studied the results show that cc has significant effects on the flow behaviors and force coefficients of four cylinders and three distinct flow regimes are identified as a function of l d namely small gap flow regime critical gap flow regime and large gap flow regime the details are presented in the following i in small gap flow regime such as l d 2 0 the addition of the center cylinder induces the formation of deflected flow for upstream cylinders at α 0 and α 22 5 in addition the vortex structure is markedly affected by the coupling effect of center cylinder and the incidence angle in critical gap flow regime such as l d 3 5 the presence of the cc still has an influence on vortex formation and shedding patterns of the surrounding cylinders for the case of α 45 the csl development of c1 are greatly hindered by cc while it is weak for other cylinders arranged in four cylinder array ii boundary vortex flux characteristics reveal the source of its vorticity for four cylinder array ω x and ω y develop substantially along the surface of the downstream cylinder and ω z is originated from upstream cylinders the addition of cc has the greatest impact on the σ z distribution pattern of the downstream cylinder c3 as compared to other cylinders for another the center cylinder has a certain weakening effect on the p1 p2 transformation mechanism leading to the addition in primary vortices of c3 and the changes in surrounding static pressure distribution the secondary vortex also affects the development of the shear layer of the cylinder iii in small gap flow regime such as l d 2 0 due to the existence of cc the wake of the upstream cylinders shows a deflected flow and the stagnation point position is easily changed by its flow pattern at α 0 and α 22 5 in addition due to the combined wake effect of cc and upstream cylinder the downstream cylinders are more likely to experience drag crisis due to the negative pressure region in critical gap flow regime such as l d 3 5 cc still interferes with the vortex development of c1 and c3 at α 45 and the region of the positive pressure of c1 is the largest among the four cylinders iv in small gap flow regime l d 2 0 3 0 the addition of the center cylinder induces the mean drag coefficient of downstream cylinder c3 to reach its minimum value cd 0 with l d 2 0 at α 22 5 and α 45 but the effect of cc is weak on the fluid force of the cylinder in large gap flow regime l d 5 0 7 0 due to the symmetry of the multi cylinder arrangement and the flow field the mean lift coefficient curves of the upper side cylinders are substantially similar to those of the lower side cylinders at both α 0 and α 45 however this phenomenon is not observed at the case with α 22 5 in the four cylinder system the mean lift coefficient of each cylinder is almost 0 which is smaller than the results of 5c at α 45 in addition the oscillation of the force coefficients of the upper cylinder of the 4c system is larger than those of the 5c system v the spatial temporal distribution of the force coefficient of each cylinder has a significant three dimensional effect at a small spacing ratio l d 2 0 of 45 the drag of c1 reaches the minimum cd 0 65 and its lift value reaches the maximum 0 1 cl 0 2 in the middle height region in addition with the implantation of the center cylinder the spanwise correlation coefficient of the fluid force of the cylinder changes significantly the drag spanwise correlation coefficient of c3 reaches its minimum value ρ 0 2 0 48 at the middle height section z d 2 which is different from other cylinders in the 5c system where the lift spanwise correlation coefficients of c2 and c4 reach the minimum at the top surface of the cylinder vi the mutual interference effect between the cylinder groups is very strong in the small gap flow regime and it is further enhanced especially after augmenting the center cylinder when α 0 the vortex shedding frequency of surrounding cylinders increase by 2 5 times after adding cc the vortex shedding frequencies of c1 and c3 are strongly affected by the center cylinder which are reduced about 75 with α 45 in the 5 cylinder array credit authorship contribution statement jiahuang tu software validation writing

21373,the rotor stabilizer systems based on the magnus principle are among the alternative systems used as an anti rolling system the key objective of this paper is to extensively study the performance of the magnus stabilizer on a ship s roll heave motions in a regular beam sea and at low velocity as well as to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the rotating cylinder in the varied diameters and rotation speeds two dimensional rotating cylinders and three dimensional ship rotor cases are simulated using the rans solver by adopting sst k ω turbulence model flow past a rotating cylinder is computed with cylinder diameter based reynolds numbers of 7 33 105 1 01 106 and 1 26 106 in the spin ratio range of 1 52 α 13 09 the rotational motion of the cylinder is simulated by the rotating wall approach the lift forces obtained from two dimensional analyses are applied externally as damping moments to examine the effect of magnus stabilizer on the dynamic motions of the full scale motor yacht the results indicate that the increased diameter is effective on the lift force than increased rotation speed the ship rotor interaction is successfully modeled by external moment application as a practical engineering approach magnus stabilizer presents a high performance in roll reduction that varies between 9 13 and 85 84 keywords magnus force rotating circular cylinder local rotation rate high reynolds number roll damping full scale ship 1 introduction large amplitudes and dynamic accelerations caused by ship motions especially in the resonance zone can cause passengers on board to show motion sickness symptoms during the cruise and increase the likelihood of crew induced error due to the worsening of working conditions having such a problem is required researchers to extensive studies on various anti rolling systems and the rotor stabilizer system based on the magnus principle is one of the alternative devices that may be used for damping the roll motion in ships and marine structures here the term rotor system represents a cylindrical structure with a circular cross section that rotates around its longitudinal axis to generate magnus force the magnus effect or magnus force is the name given to the aerodynamic or hydrodynamic lifting force of a non symmetrical flow profile generated by the rotational motion of a circular cross section body in a fluid magnus 1853 in the case of a clockwise rotating cylinder with an angular speed ω and the corresponding free stream velocity u as in fig 1 a the fluid velocity accelerates above the cylinder and slows down below while the pressure decreases with increasing velocity on the upper side decreasing the velocity on the lower side increases the pressure and the cylinder is subjected to an upward magnus force due to the pressure difference fig 1 b shows the magnus principle for the counterclockwise rotating cylinder the basis of the investigation of the flow around the rotating cylinder is based on studies on low reynold numbers in the study of prandtl 1925 the formation of the karman vortex street was experimentally observed at various re numbers between 30 and 300 for the fixed cylinder prandtl further stated that adding the end plate to the cylinder and increasing the spin ratio had an effect on increasing the lift coefficient mittal and kumar 2003 conducted a stabilized finite element method to solve the incompressible navier stokes equations for 2d rotating cylinder with different α from 0 to 5 at re 200 vortex shedding was observed in the case of α 1 91 and high spin ratios led to achievement of higher magnus lift coefficients the dimensionless spin ratio α was obtained from the ratio of the circumferential velocity of the cylinder to the free stream velocity u θ u subsequently mittal 2004 performed 3d numerical case of re 200 and α 5 in order to observe the instabilities in wake region the author pointed out that the flow was stable in the 2d analysis of mittal and kumar 2003 while that was subjected to centrifugal instabilities in the 3d analysis with the same spin ratio as expected higher magnus forces were achieved via cylinders with a high aspect ratio these values exceeded the limit of c l max 4π asserted by prandtl 1925 in recent decades key studies on the flow around the rotating cylinder were carried out for further increased re 103 by badr et al 1990 chew et al 1995 and nair et al 1998 the common points of these unsteady flow investigations are concerning the wake formation behind the rotating cylinder within a certain re and α range tokumaru and dimotakis 1993 carried out a series of experiments to investigate the influence of rotation rate and the addition of forced rotary oscillations on the flow past a rotating cylinder the authors report that the three dimensional effects bring the mean lift force measured at a given rotational speed below the level obtained in the two dimensional flow the particle imaging velocimetry and hot wire anemometer measurements around the wake region of a rotating cylinder were conducted by dol et al 2008 at re 9 103 the vortex shedding was strong under conditions where the α is less than 1 and it was suppressed around α 2 aljure et al 2015 examined the strouhal number lift force and the behavior of the separation point using direct numerical simulation dns in the range 0 a 5 and re 5 103 the wake dynamics did not change significantly and the vortex shedding occurred in cases where α 2 the rotational motion of the cylinder caused the vortex to be disrupted in the tangential velocity direction also compression of the boundary layer considering a high re the systematic experiments were carried out to obtain forces acting on cylinders with an infinite aspect ratio exposed to transverse air flow in a wind tunnel reid 1924 the results were presented for rotative speeds in the range of 25 and 3600 also these values correspond to cases in which the spin ratios in the range of 0 01 3 95 in order to avoid the effects based on the aspect ratio reid left only a small gap between the tunnel walls and the cylinder bases in the experiments aoki and ito 2001 studied flow past a rotating circular cylinder in the range of 0 α 1 and for various re as 6 104 and 1 4 105 with experimental tests and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method karabelas 2010 confirmed the 2d cylinder solutions by the large eddy simulation les model at re 1 4 105 with available numerical and experimental results the increase in α caused the average drag force to decrease while the lift force to increase in addition the karman vortex street formed after α 1 3 then suppressed and the flow became stable the most notable attempt due to using on the high reynolds numbers re 5 105 1 106 and 5 106 was the study of karabelas et al 2012 the 2d simulations solved with the k ε turbulence model using α ranging 2 to 8 it was stated that the spin ratio effect in the turbulent flow profile with high re differs from the laminar regime besides the lifting force increased linearly with spin ratio while drag force increased up to α 4 and then decreased in addition there are several studies e g muto et al 2012 and zheng et al 2017 performed to predict the negative magnus force for a range of different re and α pezzotti et al 2020 experimentally examined the magnus force for aerodynamic purposes in the range 1 4 104 re 3 5 104 of cylindrical bodies with a different number of faces dasgupta et al 2020 studied the flow past rotating cylinder using different rans turbulence models and observed the development of negative magnus force the simulations were carried out at re 1 3 105 and up to α 1 chen et al 2020 investigated the flow past a rotating cylinder using a 2d discrete vortex simulation method within 0 α 19 and re 105 the vortex shedding disappeared at α 3 5 and the lift coefficient results exceeded the prandtl s limit magnus effect on ships was first used for wind propulsion flettner rotors placed on the deck developed a system that is environmentally friendly and aimed at reducing fuel consumption bordogna et al 2019 copuroglu and pesman 2018 de marco et al 2015 2016 in the maritime sector magnus stabilizers are developed which are known to reduce roll amplitudes as an alternative to the active fin systems commonly used swanson 1961 borg 1986 and seifert 2012 are among the studies examining the development and various application areas of magnus effect in addition morisseau 1986 specifically focused on marine applications such as roll stabilizers and water propellers sosa 2014 experimentally investigated the characteristics of magnus stabilizer system using a rotating cylinder the effects of roughness and rotation speed were also included in the test conditions which is in the range of 2 3 104 re 1 4 105 and 0 α 3 5 the lift and drag characteristics had a minor dependency on re at certain intervals of the spin ratio sosa and ooms 2016 then implemented a comfort rating analysis of a yacht hull to compare the fin stabilizers and mag nus stabilizers the model tests were performed at calm water and irregular wave conditions in various ship advance speeds and headings it was stated that the magnus stabilizer provided better performance at lower ship speeds liang et al 2016 obtained the hydrodynamic characteristics of magnus stabilizer at medium and low speed with rans simulations using rng k ε turbulence model as well as a theoretical approach as indicated by sosa 2014 liang et al 2016 also stated that the magnus rotor is better roll reduction performance at low speed the increase in drag force in high speed conditions caused the efficiency to decrease following this liang et al 2017 performed the numerical simulations of 3d cylinder in low free stream velocity and worked on a pid controller mechanism to investigate the anti rolling effect rotational speed was changed from 300 rpm to 1500 rpm for computations in the range of 4 7 105 re 2 6 106 most research and application of the magnus effect took place between 1910 and 1930 however there has created a demand for research due to the new interest and advantages of magnus based products in the market with the advancing capability of cfd solver there are gaps and new grounds that are worth re evaluating and need to be filled in research this paper presents an efficient numerical analysis and design procedure based on 3d rans method to estimate the effect of rotating magnus stabilizers on the motions and accelerations of a full scale ship the first stage of the procedure is the prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics of flow past rotating cylinders at three high reynolds numbers re 7 33 105 1 01 106 1 26 106 and fifteen α from 1 52 to 13 09 by 2d rans computations with the shear stress transport sst k ω model the qualitative and quantitative results for one of the cylinder diameter based re cases are successfully validated with the available results a spatial convergence study is conducted with grid convergence study gci for the roll motion of motor yacht to determine the uncertainty of the numerical model the seakeeping simulations are carried out in beam sea condition and the 2dof motion of the ship was excited by fifth order stokes wave the ship rotor interaction is modeled via the external moment application that transfers the hydrodynamic properties of the 2d rotating cylinder simulations to the ship a primary goal of the application is to contact a facilitated and effective relationship between lift force obtained from magnus stabilizer and the dynamic behavior of ship roll motion as a final step time dependent behaviors of roll and heave motions are plotted to determine magnus stabilizer performance the present study extends the rotating cylinder investigation to higher spin ratios and reynolds numbers than those considered to date it is anticipated that the methods and outcomes of the study will provide a developed approach for researches to examining both the ship rotor interaction and the effect of the rotor design on ship motions and hydrodynamic characteristics the theoretical framework of the numerical models is given in section 2 the details of the computational work related to the rotating cylinder case and coupled ship motion simulations are presented in section 3 whilst section 4 includes the verification and comparison studies and comparative results along with the related discussions the conclusions of the paper are presented in section 5 2 theoretical framework numerical modeling techniques which were preferred in both rotating cylinder analyses and seakeeping analyses are briefly described below the governing equations used for the solution of the numerical model are the continuity and the rans momentum equations for incompressible flow the averaged continuity and momentum equations can be expressed as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i x i u j u j x j p x i x j τ i j ρ u i u j where u i and u j are the mean velocity vectors in the ith and jth direction of the cartesian coordinate ρ is the density p is the mean pressure and u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor in standard k ω model reynolds stress tensor τ i j r and mean viscous stress tensor τ i j can be respectively written as follows 3 τ i j r ρ u i u j ρ u i u j u i u j 4 τ i j μ u i x j u j x i where μ is the dynamic viscosity the turbulence models are used to solve the closure problem by calculating the reynolds stress tensor u i u j on the right side of eq 3 in the aim to assess the behavior of magnus rotating roll stabilizers on ship motion the star ccm commercial code was used to predict both the hydrodynamic characteristics of flow past the rotating cylinder and ship rotor interaction while the flow around the circular rotating cylinder was studied in two dimensional and single phase the flow around the full scale ship was modeled as the three dimensional and two phase the whole analyses were performed using the rans method and by adopting sst k ω turbulence model one of the advantages of the k ω model compared to other commonly used turbulence models is that it offers a high performance solution for boundary layers under adverse pressure gradients at low y wilcox 1993 here the finite volume method fvm was used for discretization and velocity pressure coupling was achieved with the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple based pressure correction technique discretization of convection terms in rans and turbulence transport equations was obtained with a second order upwind scheme the all y wall treatment was preferred for a correct estimate of flow and turbulence characteristics along the wall boundary layer the aim is to produce results close to the values given by the low y wall treatment when the y approaches zero and the values given by the high y wall treatment when it exceeds 30 cd adapco 2018 3 numerical methodology 3 1 flow past the rotating cylinder the notable factors affecting the flow around the rotating cylinder were chosen as diameter rotation speed by examining similar studies of karabelas et al 2012 sosa 2014 and liang et al 2017 also it was stated in elmiligui et al 2004 and travin et al 1999 that 2d solutions are highly compatible with 3d solutions in the examination of the flow around the cylinder eventually the magnus lift force as well as flow characteristics were examined by considering variations in the cylinder diameter 3 conditions and the rotation speed 5 conditions in 2d simulations within the scope of the study cylinders with different diameters in constant length l 2 m were studied where the free stream velocity u was 3 m s the aspect ratios l d in the fixed length cylinder were selected as 4 5 and 6 9 to specifying the size of cylinder diameters as a result cylinder diameters d calculated to be 50 cm 40 cm and 29 cm respectively the circumferential velocity of the cylinder is determined by the relation u θ 2 π 60 r n where n is the rotation speed and r is the radius of the cylinder here the five rotation speeds n were selected in a wide range between 300 rpm and 1500 rpm at 300 rpm intervals the flow past a counterclockwise rotating cylinder was examined at high reynolds number of 7 33 105 1 01 106 and 1 26 106 unlike a great number of studies in low reynolds numbers r e u d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity the main particulars of the cylinder analyses that form the basis of magnus stabilizer are given in table 1 the case codes are expressed as dinj where d i and n j are the magnus cylinder parameters in the ith diameter and jth rotation speed the magnus lift coefficient c l is non dimensionalized in 2d by the quantities where ρ is the density of fluid d is the cylinder rotor diameter and u is the free stream velocity f l represents the magnus based lift force produced by a rotating cylinder and c l can be defined as follows 5 c l f l 0 5 ρ d u 2 an important point to be noted here is that magnus forces to be applied on the ship via stabilizers were calculated by taking into account the relevant lateral projection area s instead of the dimensionless coefficients obtained from the 2d cylinder study to define body rotation speed n the local rotation rate method was applied on the wall surface in a 2d cylinder study thus the rotating wall approach which is suitable for axisymmetric geometries facilitated to define a tangential velocity on no slip walls in a simple way cd adapco 2018 the domain should cover a sufficient distance from the region where the solution accuracy is important while its dimensions should lead to the optimum computational costs in this study where d is the cylinder diameter the dimensions of the computational region in the xy plane were determined from the center of the cylinder as 32d to the outlet boundary 20d to the inlet boundary and 13 2d to the lateral surfaces fig 2 a inlet boundary condition was modeled as velocity inlet outlet boundary as pressure outlet and lateral boundaries as symmetry plane the cylinder surface was defined as the no slip wall boundary to be an impermeable surface fig 2 b the computational domain was discretized with the 2d polygonal cells by developed mesh features of the cfd software it is aimed to accelerate the convergence of the solution by aligning the cell surfaces in the flow direction the computational domain was divided into three regions with progressively refined mesh sizes as seen in fig 2 the close region around the cylinder zone 1 was meshed with a finer grid to resolve the boundary layer flow the grid resolution was gradually made coarser towards the boundaries of the domain also the prism layer mesh model was used to create orthogonal prismatic cells near the wall as can be illustrated in fig 2 b the parameters of the boundary layer were set suitably for y to be around 1 aim of prism layer mesh is not only limited to finding the forces on the wall correctly but that is also crucial for determining accurately the flow topology such as separation point in the boundary layer region ünal et al 2010 thus the hybrid mesh configurations with 9 65 104 1 84 105 and 2 75 105 cells were formed for 2d cylinder analyses in the computational domain 3 2 motion analysis for ship rotor system in the following a background to the numerical simulation approaches related to the roll heave motion of full scale ship coupled with 2d cylinder computations is presented the 35 m motor yacht hull was chosen to study ship rotor interaction my 35 m which has with twin screw and bulbous bow is a semi displacement hull a 3d view of the motor yacht with magnus stabilizer is illustrated in fig 3 and its main properties are presented in table 2 3 2 1 physical modeling the free water surface and fifth order stokes waves were modeled with the volume of fluid vof method the vof method developed by hirt and nichols 1981 can robustly form the free surface defined as the interface between immiscible fluids the method works by calculating the share of light fluid air and heavy fluid water in each cell in two phase numerical flow analyses the temperature of seawater was set as 15 5 c where ρ air 1 184 kg m3 ν air 1 567 10 5 m2 s ρ water 1025 91 kg m3 and ν water 1 174 10 6 m2 s ittc 2011 the high resolution interface capturing hric technique was applied with the vof method to well capture the sharp interface profile separating the water and air particles hric is a hybrid method between bounded downwind and upwind differencing schemes and achieves to get low numerical diffusion or dispersion error muzaferija and peric 1998 in the present study only roll and heave motions of the ship were enabled using body driven rotation and translation motion node in dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi module and the rest of the motions were restricted the dfbi method balances the pressure forces shear forces and moments imposing on the body and updates the position of the rigid body the motion updating with the dfbi solver is followed by the assigned local coordinate system represented the ship s gravity center where the magnus moment was applied the presence of magnus stabilizers requires additional requirements e g extra rotational interfaces greater cell number lower time step higher inner iteration number to model the rotational motion therefore the ship rotor interaction which is an inherently complex problem was represented and modeled in a facilitated way via external moment application approach considering the processing capability of cfd solver and computational cost the restoring magnus moments m m a g n u s were applied to the gravity center of the full scale my the magnus moment should be applied in the reverse direction of the wave induced rolling motion therefore the time dependent series of roll angular velocity y 4 was used to simulate the working principle of the stabilizer for the solution period as displayed with a flow chart in fig 4 the positive angular velocity corresponded to the ship s rolling motion from the portside to the starboard side in that condition y 4 0 the magnus moment tries to rotate the ship to the port side by taking a negative value m m a g n u s 0 at the points where the y 4 0 the hull stops and then starts to rotate in the opposite direction around the y axis the opposite is the case where y 4 0 the positive external moment m m a g n u s 0 tries to reduce the rolling angle this mechanism repetitively continues until the maximum physical time of numerical analysis and the ship motions are stored simultaneously the time step can be selected depending on the courant friedrichs lewy number cfl in accordance with the flow characteristics the condition is defined as c f l u δ t δ x where u is free stream velocity δ t is physical time step and δ x is minimum cell dimension it is recommended that the cfl number should be around 0 5 for a stable vof wave model simulation böhm and graf 2014 cd adapco 2018 in this study the time step was selected as 0 004 s for the prediction of ship responses to beam waves thereby was providing the permissible values of cfl in addition the selection of the appropriate release and ramp time sizes can decrease the oscillation of the residual and enables the convergence of the solution cakici et al 2018a the release time is the period of time that passes until the start of the body motion after the release period is completed the body starts to move and gradually freed until the ramp time within this study the release time was taken as 0 8 s as 200 δ t and the ramp time was selected as 10 times release time 3 2 2 numerical wave tank generation the determination of domain sizes mostly depends on the dimensions of the hull and the incident wave field in marine applications in simulations with a progressive wave model the dimensions of the computational field were determined in accordance with ittc 2014b guideline and illustrated in fig 5 the computational domain was divided into two parts as the overset and the background with an indirect region based interface between them here the domain around the ship represents the overset region where the motion takes place to computing ship motion the distance weighted scheme which is more cost effective and robust was preferred for the cell interpolation between the acceptor and donor cells in the overlapping region cd adapco 2018 the overset domain was defined as 2 1 d in height 1 2l bp in length and 2b in width the boundary conditions are depicted in fig 6 there are four velocity inlets two pressure outlets and a no slip wall in total the direction of the stokes wave propagation and the ship s advancing direction were perpendicular to each other the my hull advancing on the y axis was exposed to stokes waves from the starboard side on the x axis direction therefore the positive y direction and positive x direction were modeled via velocity inlet conditions while the opposite ends of those were assigned as the pressure outlet boundary conditions in addition top and bottom boundaries were defined as velocity inlet it is aimed to enable the deep water and infinite air conditions tezdogan et al 2015 the computational domain also had two pressure outlet including the vof damping boundary to prevent wave reflections as recommended in ittc 2014a the hull surface was assigned as the no slip wall boundary considering an impermeable surface it is assumed that the magnus stabilizers do not oscillate in the head and stern direction that is they were placed in a fixed and upright position to the hull also the performance of the magnus roll stabilizer at low speeds is examined within the scope of study although the ship s service speed is 14 knots 7 202 m s therefore the inflow velocity from the positive y direction which is also equal to the flow past the roll stabilizer was defined as 3 m s all of the simulations were carried out in beam sea condition and the 2dof motion of the ship was excited by fifth order stokes wave starting from positive x direction the reason for the selection is that the fifth order wave has more similarity with the real one than the first order wave cd adapco 2018 also the model does not need a long solution time as in the irregular wave to observe all harmonic components in the signal the wavelength was chosen 50 m approximately 1 5l bp and wave steepness was accepted as 1 64 as shown in table 3 ursell number u r h λ 2 d 3 where h is the wave height λ is wave length and d is the water depth less than 30 showed that the parameters are appropriate ursell 1953 the damping length was set at 62 5 m which is about 1 25 λ as similarly in the study of perić and abdel maksoud 2016 from outlet boundaries in order to avoid wave reflection besides the grid extrusion approach was preferred in the region close to the pressure outlet on the long side thus both the reflection errors and the increase in the computational time were prevented the initial wave pattern and grid structure of the free surface are shown in fig 7 3 2 3 mesh generation the overset algorithm is an appropriate method used to accurately predict the rotation and translation motions of multi part or moving structures this technique was preferred to handle the large amplitude motions of the full scale ship can et al 2020 delen and bal 2019 the major advantage of choosing overset mesh technique in the seakeeping simulations is that it minimizes the unsteady motions induced grid deformations around the complex geometry the passive cells inside the overset domain are not included in the solution as shown in fig 8 however they may become active during the motion of the object in the later stages of the simulation the grid structure around the my from different views are clearly displayed in fig 9 extreme distortion in grid structure can lead to unbalanced transitions between active and passive cells and eventually divergence of analysis therefore dimensions of the refinement volume were gradually increased to ensure a smooth grid transition also the height of refinement volume for the free surface i e the distance in the z direction was chosen as 1 12 m to cover the wave height there are several studies that can be a guide for creating a qualified phase separation for the free surface problem while ittc 2014a recommends at least 40 grid points per wavelength cd adapco 2018 recommends using 80 100 grids per wavelength and 20 grids per wave amplitude with the aim of well capture severe free surface deformation a minimum of 80 points per wavelength and a minimum of 20 cells were defined in the vertical direction the vof view on the mesh presented in fig 10 clearly shows that the generated fifth order stokes wave is fully captured inside of the proper grid refinement the all y wall approach was preferred and the dimensionless height of the first cell was studied to be y 5 the boundary layer grid can be seen from fig 11 in detail since the study does not deal with capturing the kelvine wave pattern any specific mesh refinement was not performed in the wake region finally a total of 5 84 million cells were formed including 2 29 million for the background region and 3 55 million for the overset region 4 results and discussions in this section the verification assessment results were presented for the uncertainty of seakeeping simulation considering roll amplitude and the lift coefficient of rotating cylinder at a certain re was validated with previously published results then the two dimensional simulations were carried out in order to get the hydrodynamic characteristics of rotating cylinder with various parameters of diameter d i and rotation speed n j seakeeping performances of the full scale my with and without external magnus based moments representing the stabilizers were numerically predicted and relatively compared to each other 4 1 verification and comparison study the first step in the assessment of the reliability of cfd analyses are generally to quantitatively determine the uncertainty level in order to quantify the effect of uncertainties on the numerical model a verification study should be made in this context the grid refinements n1 n2 and n3 were composed systematically by taking the refinement factor r g as 2 the differences between solution scalars can be calculated with ε 32 φ 3 φ 2 and ε 21 φ 2 φ 1 where φ i indicates the solution of the key parameter in the corresponding grid in the present study the rms roll amplitudes for full scale my and lift coefficient for d2n3 were chosen as the key parameters in cases where the convergence ratio r ε 21 ε 32 is between 0 and 1 the numerical solution is said to converge monotonously stern et al 2006 monotonic convergence leads to follow a procedure reference can be made to celik et al 2008 de luca et al 2016 and delen et al 2020 for more comprehensive knowledge about the procedure of grid convergence index gci based on richardson extrapolation the convergence ratios rg were calculated as 0 184 in the d2n3 cylinder case and 0 143 in the my seakeeping tests the solutions were monotonously convergent the discretization uncertainty components of spatial convergence studies are given in table 4 as a result the numerical uncertainty values g c i f i n e 21 of fine grid were estimated as 0 225 and 1 116 respectively thus verification analysis showed that the uncertainty values were at an acceptable level and the fine grid structures were used in the examination of the cases with rotating cylinder and the ship rotor system as a comparison study numerical analyses were re simulated in 2d similar to cylinder diameter and rotation speed of the reid 1924 s study fig 12 shows comparisons of the present lift coefficients with the available experimental results efd swanson 1961 indicated that the study of reid 1924 is the best approach to two dimensional flow as the experimental setup minimizes the end effects of cylinder the comparison study was conducted at a satisfactory level while the small discrepancies in lift coefficients can be due to the order of the reynolds number then the rest of the simulations were performed considering the parameters diameters and rotation speeds given in table 1 the comparison study was also conducted with the 2d cylinder computations in terms of the lift coefficients c l to compare the numerical model via lift coefficient simulations were carried out in a wide range of spin ratios α 2 09 4 19 6 28 8 38 and 10 47 subsequently the numerical results were found satisfactorily compatible with the case of karabelas et al 2012 at re 1 00 106 l 2 m d 0 4 m the relative differences were below around 1 as can be seen in fig 13 consequently it could be confirmed that the rotating wall approach gives a favorable representation of the lift characteristics the local rotation rate method within the approach can be preferred for the two dimensional rotating cylinder simulations because that presents a cost effective and faster solution compared to conventional methods i e moving reference frame and rigid body motion 4 2 flow characteristics and lift forces generated by rotating cylinders the vortex shedding process behind the 2d circular cylinders performed in three reynolds numbers and five rotation speeds are given in fig 14 streamlines patterns of karabelas et al 2012 obtained from the analyses by the k ε turbulence model at re 1 00 106 for the rotating case were chosen for comparison with present results at re 1 01 106 because it is observed from consistency both in the lift coefficients submitted at the previous sub section and in the streamlines presented below that the sst k ω model suffices to predict the mean flow characteristics the changes in the mean flow brought upon by the rotation of the cylinder are generally quite compatible with each other the minor discrepancies observed in the stagnation and saddle points of the streamlines may be negligible due to the variation in spin ratios the location of the stagnation points aʹ and bʹ and the saddle points cʹ and dʹ are marked in the wake region as depicted in fig 14 b and fig 14 c the two vortices are formed on the suction side in the case of re 1 01 106 and α 2 09 as can be observed in the transition from α 4 19 to α 6 28 vortices respectively disappear moreover a new saddle point dʹ is shaped certain time as points aʹ and bʹ approach each other gradually increasing α leads to thickening the rotational layer due to vorticity the point dʹ defined in a similar manner by aljure et al 2015 tends to move away from the cylinder surface as the α increases the wake region is composed of similar mean flow structures at such low spin ratios in agreement with reported observations by karabelas et al 2012 and aljure et al 2015 as the spin ratio increased that corresponds to the increase in the rotation speed n of the cylinder the vortices are dispersed to exemplify the two asymmetrical vortex pair are observed approximately in the positions θ 180 and θ 150 in the case of d1n1 α 1 52 where θ represents the angular displacement the typical two vortex configurations are also formed at other low spin ratio α 3 conditions as expected then the downstream vortex gradually narrows while the upstream vortex expands in all cases the rotating boundary layer in the downstream region of the cylinder transfers the energy to the free stream in that region preventing separation in the low pressure region and causing the vortex to form away from the wall in contrast differences in the vortex sizes appear when the boundary layer that develops in the upstream region creates a reverse flow and supports the formation of the vortex structure also in cases where two vortices exist the upstream vortex rotates clockwise and the downstream vortex rotates counterclockwise at the moment of loss of the downstream vortex the velocity in the rotating boundary layer is much higher than the average value of the free stream velocity the vortex shedding phenomenon of the wake behind a rotating circular cylinder was observed to be affected by the spin ratio rather than the reynolds number the dimensional change of the vortex structure is successive when the cases of d1n2 α 3 04 d2n1 α 2 09 and d3n1 α 2 62 are sorted according to the increase in the α also the saddle points are very close to each other in the cases of d2n4 α 8 38 and d3n3 α 7 85 although re of d2n5 and d3n4 cases are different due to the varying cylinder diameters the same linear velocities ensure that the wake regions were similar to each other it is also noticeable that the distances of the saddle points dʹ to the surface of the cylinder are almost at the same location present results where the relation of the lift coefficient c l versus the spin ratio α is presented indicate an almost linear relationship between the parameters and both variables of d and n fig 15 note that the circumferential velocity of the cylinder in the spin ratio calculation depends on both rotation speed and diameter in fig 15 a the variable d is kept constant in the spin ratio calculation and the effect of changing the variable n is examined for just one diameter that is repeated for d2 and d3 besides a similar process is carried out for the constant variable of n to obtain fig 15 b the c l tends to increase with growing d and n for the range of examined α since the steep slope of the diameter based lines is higher than the steep slope of the rotation speed based lines it can be justified that the relative effect of the diameter increase on the lift force is higher than the rotation speed increase besides the lift coefficient is smaller than that of prandtl s limit c l m a x 4π the c l is 9 64 at maximum α because of the turbulent flow 4 3 seakeeping analyses with magnus force roll and heave motions which impacted the full scale motor yacht from the port side by regular fifth order stokes waves were allowed to realistically depict the ship s behavior in sea conditions while representing the roll damping mechanism it was assumed that the rotors were positioned perpendicular to the ship s hull outwardly and parallel to the free surface thus it is aimed to achieve maximum magnus force from the flow perpendicular to the lateral surface of the cylinder first the lift forces obtained from the 2d cylinder study were expanded along the length of the rotor to achieve 3d lift forces then because the rotors were operated in opposite directions the total lift force was found by taking twice a single lift force for each case the magnus based moment quantity was achieved by multiply with the moment arm ℓ m 4 82 m which is the perpendicular distance between the cylinder volume center and the ship s center of gravity consequently the roll damping effect of the magnus stabilizer was defined with an external moment application approach the maximum roll amplitudes y 4 m a x and the rms roll amplitudes y 4 r m s of the ships with magnus moment values applied were compared with those of the original motor yacht case my the relative difference calculation can be expressed as follows 6 δ y 4 y 4 my y 4 y 4 my y 4 my 100 firstly the motion problems for my my w d1n3 my w d2n3 and my w d3n3 cases were simulated using t max 100 s fig 16 the maximum difference between the roll rms values obtained from the 100 s signals and the 35 s signals is calculated as 0 116 degree since a slight difference is observed and the fundamental roll signals maintain the periodicity the overall solution time is chosen as 35 s considering the computational cost consequently the external moment application provides a practical engineering approach for the solution of seemingly complex ship rotor interaction and the magnus stabilizer ensures a decrease between 9 13 and 85 84 in roll motion as listed in table 5 in cases where the relative difference value is almost the same the coercive moment values obtained from the cylinder are actually quite close to each other the rms roll amplitudes of the ships exerted magnus moment are presented with respect to spin ratio in fig 17 fig 18 and fig 19 display the change in roll amplitude y 4 at different rotor diameters and rotation speeds it is noteworthy to mention that the time intervals corresponding to negative values in the figures represent the ship s rolling to the port side while the positive values stand for rolling to the starboard side the curves indicate that the magnus damping moment clearly reduces the ship s roll amplitude while the average roll amplitude difference between my case and my w d1n1 case at constant free stream velocity is around 9 13 that difference is 26 48 for my w d1n5 case similar changes are valid for all situations where revolution increases for example the decrease in the average roll amplitude which is 19 18 for the rotation speed of 300 rpm has reaches 49 77 for 1500 rpm if the diameter is taken as a 40 cm the greatest reduction in roll amplitude is 85 84 at 1500 rpm for the 50 cm diameter rotor my w d3n5 there are remarkable behaviors in the roll motion characteristics of the hull under the action of the forced roll device as shown in figs 18 and 19 the my model completes the motion in the direction of the port side at 2 45 in about 20 s of the analysis then the motion is completed at a nearly upright position 0 05 at 23rd seconds and continued to the port direction also the ship rotor system is found to have larger amplitudes than the my in the third cycle of all cases both the presence of the my behavior and the observation of larger amplitudes in ship rotor systems in the same cycle compared to the my despite the effectiveness of the damping moment are unexpected responses at first glance hence that can be considered as an irregular motion characteristic due to the non linearity of the problem both in terms of the dynamic character of the ship and the factors that cause motion still the behavior may be explained mathematically in a simple way the harmonic components hc of the signal may be obtained as complex quantities by applying fast fourier transform fft algorithm to the time series of roll data each component is distinguished from the others by its frequency amplitude and phase angle or its real and imaginary parts given the my case it is noticed that the time varying roll angle can be represented by nine harmonic components if components whose amplitude is less than 0 001 radians are neglected these harmonic components are given in fig 20 a with corresponding waveforms total roll signals starting with the first harmonic component with the smallest frequency and adding an increasing number of components to the previous ones are presented in fig 20 b each added component depending on its amplitude and phase angle may partially or entirely change the form of the time signal within a certain time interval eventually the sudden deviation observed in the range of 20 25 s with the addition of the 7th harmonic component hc7 in the case of my similar behaviors were observed in other combinations such as my w d2n3 as can be seen in fig 21 theoretically the parallelism between the increase in rotation speed and the decrease in roll angle should be continuous liang et al 2017 however an uninterrupted efficiency cannot be obtained from a system with constant rotation speed one way to resolve this contradiction may be to change the physical parameters or working conditions of magnus stabilizer instantly the damping provided by a lower higher rotation speeds may be more effective at some moments as can be seen in the examples and the importance of a control system for the magnus stabilizer increases the results of roll angular velocity y 4 are presented in fig 22 here the left vertical axis refers to the roll angular velocities obtained from the ship rotor system analyses and the right vertical axis represents the roll angular velocities of my scaled by 0 2 the first thing that draws attention in the graphs is that there is a 180 degree phase difference between the my case and all the remaining cases as expected the increases in rotation speed and diameter reduce the angular velocity of the rolling the maximum value reaching around 0 5 rad s for the my decreases remarkably to 0 05 rad s with the magnus stabilizer appendage in addition the my w d3n5 case behaves differently than others and at some time intervals 5 7 s and 15 17 s the roll angular velocity is almost zero it is also notable that the roll amplitude is around 0 06 during these periods the roll acceleration y 4 results which are important parameters especially for passenger comfort are given in fig 23 it should not be forgotten that another purpose of roll reduction systems e g fin stabilizer gyroscope or magnus stabilizer is to decrease the acceleration characteristics of the marine vessels although the ship moves with low roll amplitudes high vertical accelerations may negatively affect the passengers and crew as it is discussed in the study of cakici et al 2018b the roll acceleration is reduced for the first two cycles however there is an increase in the peak of the third and fourth cycles of some cases as seen at the time histories of other parameters above it is unnecessary to take that increase as a negative indicator because the roll acceleration is obtained always at low levels the case my w d3n5 differentiates from the general system behavior fig 23 c and serious oscillations are observed in the roll acceleration curve however that case has an efficient configuration for roll reduction which is clearly visible in fig 18 c as such it can be considered that a system with these conditions is not feasible however the fact that the behavior stables after about 25 s suggests that analysis has to be resolved over a longer time period in order to make a more precise interpretation fig 24 and fig 25 graphically display the effects of the magnus stabilizer on the heave amplitude y 3 and heave acceleration y 3 respectively as can be seen from both figures the scalars defining the magnus stabilizer have no significant effect on either the heave motion or the acceleration the heave amplitude has slight changes around the 28th second in the conditions where the 40 cm diameter cylinder rotates faster than 300 rpm it is possible to see the similar reduction effects in the 50 cm diameter cases also the heave amplitudes are not affected even in the highest rotation speed which is favorable outcomes to the roll motion because of the insignificant effect of the magnus stabilizer on the heave acceleration the values are much higher compared to the roll acceleration that indicates the heave motion may be more determinant as a vertical component in the motion sickness disturbances i e sea sickness associated with the vertical acceleration of the ship 5 concluding remarks the emphasis in the study is on the effects of a circular cross section magnus rotating roll stabilizer on the roll and heave motions and the associated accelerations of a 35 m motor yacht the work was first conducted by simulating the flow around the two dimensional rotating circular cylinders of three different high reynolds numbers 7 33 105 1 01 106 and 1 26 106 and fifteen different spin ratios between 1 52 and 13 09 discussing at wider spin ratios and higher reynolds numbers yielded a specialized aspect to the studies about flow around the rotating cylinder then the magnus based lift force obtained from rotating cylinder analyses was externally enforced from the gravity center of ship in three dimensional seakeeping simulations the effect of magnus moment applied in a facilitated way on ship motion was investigated by systematic analyses the lift force generated by cylinders and roll heave characteristics of the motor yacht were estimated by reynolds averaged navier stokes rans based computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis with the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model the discrepancy for the lift coefficient was found to be less than 1 for the rotating cylinder compared the available data a very good correlation was also found with that of available cfd analyses in terms of instantaneous streamline patterns in the wakefield pointing out the flow phenomenon of vortex shedding regarding the evaluation of the vortex shedding around the rotating cylinder a change in spin ratio affected the streamline pattern noticeably and the magnus lift force increased almost linearly with growing spin ratio as a result of the parametric analysis it was found that the increase in the cylinder diameter would be more effective than the rotational speed in the production of magnus lift force the rotating wall approach which ensures the rotational motion of the cylinder was concluded as quite successful in predicting the lift force and changes in vortex formation the numerical model of the rotating cylinder and motor yacht were verified by the grid convergence index in terms of lift coefficient and roll amplitudes respectively the effect of the magnus stabilizer system on the heave motion was almost negligible while significant decreases in roll related parameters amplitude velocity and acceleration were achieved an encouraging outcome from the present study was that the magnus stabilizer can reduce the rms roll amplitude of the full scale motor yacht up to 85 84 with the combination of appropriate geometric characteristics and operating conditions external moment application as a practical engineering approach yielded successful in modeling ship rotor interaction this approach also provided a fast and facilitated aspect in numerical modeling of various dynamic stabilizers additionally a decrease in accelerations of ship motions may cause magnus stabilizers to have a reducing effect on the motion sickness index credit authorship contribution statement deniz ozturk conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation resources

21373,the rotor stabilizer systems based on the magnus principle are among the alternative systems used as an anti rolling system the key objective of this paper is to extensively study the performance of the magnus stabilizer on a ship s roll heave motions in a regular beam sea and at low velocity as well as to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the rotating cylinder in the varied diameters and rotation speeds two dimensional rotating cylinders and three dimensional ship rotor cases are simulated using the rans solver by adopting sst k ω turbulence model flow past a rotating cylinder is computed with cylinder diameter based reynolds numbers of 7 33 105 1 01 106 and 1 26 106 in the spin ratio range of 1 52 α 13 09 the rotational motion of the cylinder is simulated by the rotating wall approach the lift forces obtained from two dimensional analyses are applied externally as damping moments to examine the effect of magnus stabilizer on the dynamic motions of the full scale motor yacht the results indicate that the increased diameter is effective on the lift force than increased rotation speed the ship rotor interaction is successfully modeled by external moment application as a practical engineering approach magnus stabilizer presents a high performance in roll reduction that varies between 9 13 and 85 84 keywords magnus force rotating circular cylinder local rotation rate high reynolds number roll damping full scale ship 1 introduction large amplitudes and dynamic accelerations caused by ship motions especially in the resonance zone can cause passengers on board to show motion sickness symptoms during the cruise and increase the likelihood of crew induced error due to the worsening of working conditions having such a problem is required researchers to extensive studies on various anti rolling systems and the rotor stabilizer system based on the magnus principle is one of the alternative devices that may be used for damping the roll motion in ships and marine structures here the term rotor system represents a cylindrical structure with a circular cross section that rotates around its longitudinal axis to generate magnus force the magnus effect or magnus force is the name given to the aerodynamic or hydrodynamic lifting force of a non symmetrical flow profile generated by the rotational motion of a circular cross section body in a fluid magnus 1853 in the case of a clockwise rotating cylinder with an angular speed ω and the corresponding free stream velocity u as in fig 1 a the fluid velocity accelerates above the cylinder and slows down below while the pressure decreases with increasing velocity on the upper side decreasing the velocity on the lower side increases the pressure and the cylinder is subjected to an upward magnus force due to the pressure difference fig 1 b shows the magnus principle for the counterclockwise rotating cylinder the basis of the investigation of the flow around the rotating cylinder is based on studies on low reynold numbers in the study of prandtl 1925 the formation of the karman vortex street was experimentally observed at various re numbers between 30 and 300 for the fixed cylinder prandtl further stated that adding the end plate to the cylinder and increasing the spin ratio had an effect on increasing the lift coefficient mittal and kumar 2003 conducted a stabilized finite element method to solve the incompressible navier stokes equations for 2d rotating cylinder with different α from 0 to 5 at re 200 vortex shedding was observed in the case of α 1 91 and high spin ratios led to achievement of higher magnus lift coefficients the dimensionless spin ratio α was obtained from the ratio of the circumferential velocity of the cylinder to the free stream velocity u θ u subsequently mittal 2004 performed 3d numerical case of re 200 and α 5 in order to observe the instabilities in wake region the author pointed out that the flow was stable in the 2d analysis of mittal and kumar 2003 while that was subjected to centrifugal instabilities in the 3d analysis with the same spin ratio as expected higher magnus forces were achieved via cylinders with a high aspect ratio these values exceeded the limit of c l max 4π asserted by prandtl 1925 in recent decades key studies on the flow around the rotating cylinder were carried out for further increased re 103 by badr et al 1990 chew et al 1995 and nair et al 1998 the common points of these unsteady flow investigations are concerning the wake formation behind the rotating cylinder within a certain re and α range tokumaru and dimotakis 1993 carried out a series of experiments to investigate the influence of rotation rate and the addition of forced rotary oscillations on the flow past a rotating cylinder the authors report that the three dimensional effects bring the mean lift force measured at a given rotational speed below the level obtained in the two dimensional flow the particle imaging velocimetry and hot wire anemometer measurements around the wake region of a rotating cylinder were conducted by dol et al 2008 at re 9 103 the vortex shedding was strong under conditions where the α is less than 1 and it was suppressed around α 2 aljure et al 2015 examined the strouhal number lift force and the behavior of the separation point using direct numerical simulation dns in the range 0 a 5 and re 5 103 the wake dynamics did not change significantly and the vortex shedding occurred in cases where α 2 the rotational motion of the cylinder caused the vortex to be disrupted in the tangential velocity direction also compression of the boundary layer considering a high re the systematic experiments were carried out to obtain forces acting on cylinders with an infinite aspect ratio exposed to transverse air flow in a wind tunnel reid 1924 the results were presented for rotative speeds in the range of 25 and 3600 also these values correspond to cases in which the spin ratios in the range of 0 01 3 95 in order to avoid the effects based on the aspect ratio reid left only a small gap between the tunnel walls and the cylinder bases in the experiments aoki and ito 2001 studied flow past a rotating circular cylinder in the range of 0 α 1 and for various re as 6 104 and 1 4 105 with experimental tests and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method karabelas 2010 confirmed the 2d cylinder solutions by the large eddy simulation les model at re 1 4 105 with available numerical and experimental results the increase in α caused the average drag force to decrease while the lift force to increase in addition the karman vortex street formed after α 1 3 then suppressed and the flow became stable the most notable attempt due to using on the high reynolds numbers re 5 105 1 106 and 5 106 was the study of karabelas et al 2012 the 2d simulations solved with the k ε turbulence model using α ranging 2 to 8 it was stated that the spin ratio effect in the turbulent flow profile with high re differs from the laminar regime besides the lifting force increased linearly with spin ratio while drag force increased up to α 4 and then decreased in addition there are several studies e g muto et al 2012 and zheng et al 2017 performed to predict the negative magnus force for a range of different re and α pezzotti et al 2020 experimentally examined the magnus force for aerodynamic purposes in the range 1 4 104 re 3 5 104 of cylindrical bodies with a different number of faces dasgupta et al 2020 studied the flow past rotating cylinder using different rans turbulence models and observed the development of negative magnus force the simulations were carried out at re 1 3 105 and up to α 1 chen et al 2020 investigated the flow past a rotating cylinder using a 2d discrete vortex simulation method within 0 α 19 and re 105 the vortex shedding disappeared at α 3 5 and the lift coefficient results exceeded the prandtl s limit magnus effect on ships was first used for wind propulsion flettner rotors placed on the deck developed a system that is environmentally friendly and aimed at reducing fuel consumption bordogna et al 2019 copuroglu and pesman 2018 de marco et al 2015 2016 in the maritime sector magnus stabilizers are developed which are known to reduce roll amplitudes as an alternative to the active fin systems commonly used swanson 1961 borg 1986 and seifert 2012 are among the studies examining the development and various application areas of magnus effect in addition morisseau 1986 specifically focused on marine applications such as roll stabilizers and water propellers sosa 2014 experimentally investigated the characteristics of magnus stabilizer system using a rotating cylinder the effects of roughness and rotation speed were also included in the test conditions which is in the range of 2 3 104 re 1 4 105 and 0 α 3 5 the lift and drag characteristics had a minor dependency on re at certain intervals of the spin ratio sosa and ooms 2016 then implemented a comfort rating analysis of a yacht hull to compare the fin stabilizers and mag nus stabilizers the model tests were performed at calm water and irregular wave conditions in various ship advance speeds and headings it was stated that the magnus stabilizer provided better performance at lower ship speeds liang et al 2016 obtained the hydrodynamic characteristics of magnus stabilizer at medium and low speed with rans simulations using rng k ε turbulence model as well as a theoretical approach as indicated by sosa 2014 liang et al 2016 also stated that the magnus rotor is better roll reduction performance at low speed the increase in drag force in high speed conditions caused the efficiency to decrease following this liang et al 2017 performed the numerical simulations of 3d cylinder in low free stream velocity and worked on a pid controller mechanism to investigate the anti rolling effect rotational speed was changed from 300 rpm to 1500 rpm for computations in the range of 4 7 105 re 2 6 106 most research and application of the magnus effect took place between 1910 and 1930 however there has created a demand for research due to the new interest and advantages of magnus based products in the market with the advancing capability of cfd solver there are gaps and new grounds that are worth re evaluating and need to be filled in research this paper presents an efficient numerical analysis and design procedure based on 3d rans method to estimate the effect of rotating magnus stabilizers on the motions and accelerations of a full scale ship the first stage of the procedure is the prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics of flow past rotating cylinders at three high reynolds numbers re 7 33 105 1 01 106 1 26 106 and fifteen α from 1 52 to 13 09 by 2d rans computations with the shear stress transport sst k ω model the qualitative and quantitative results for one of the cylinder diameter based re cases are successfully validated with the available results a spatial convergence study is conducted with grid convergence study gci for the roll motion of motor yacht to determine the uncertainty of the numerical model the seakeeping simulations are carried out in beam sea condition and the 2dof motion of the ship was excited by fifth order stokes wave the ship rotor interaction is modeled via the external moment application that transfers the hydrodynamic properties of the 2d rotating cylinder simulations to the ship a primary goal of the application is to contact a facilitated and effective relationship between lift force obtained from magnus stabilizer and the dynamic behavior of ship roll motion as a final step time dependent behaviors of roll and heave motions are plotted to determine magnus stabilizer performance the present study extends the rotating cylinder investigation to higher spin ratios and reynolds numbers than those considered to date it is anticipated that the methods and outcomes of the study will provide a developed approach for researches to examining both the ship rotor interaction and the effect of the rotor design on ship motions and hydrodynamic characteristics the theoretical framework of the numerical models is given in section 2 the details of the computational work related to the rotating cylinder case and coupled ship motion simulations are presented in section 3 whilst section 4 includes the verification and comparison studies and comparative results along with the related discussions the conclusions of the paper are presented in section 5 2 theoretical framework numerical modeling techniques which were preferred in both rotating cylinder analyses and seakeeping analyses are briefly described below the governing equations used for the solution of the numerical model are the continuity and the rans momentum equations for incompressible flow the averaged continuity and momentum equations can be expressed as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i x i u j u j x j p x i x j τ i j ρ u i u j where u i and u j are the mean velocity vectors in the ith and jth direction of the cartesian coordinate ρ is the density p is the mean pressure and u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor in standard k ω model reynolds stress tensor τ i j r and mean viscous stress tensor τ i j can be respectively written as follows 3 τ i j r ρ u i u j ρ u i u j u i u j 4 τ i j μ u i x j u j x i where μ is the dynamic viscosity the turbulence models are used to solve the closure problem by calculating the reynolds stress tensor u i u j on the right side of eq 3 in the aim to assess the behavior of magnus rotating roll stabilizers on ship motion the star ccm commercial code was used to predict both the hydrodynamic characteristics of flow past the rotating cylinder and ship rotor interaction while the flow around the circular rotating cylinder was studied in two dimensional and single phase the flow around the full scale ship was modeled as the three dimensional and two phase the whole analyses were performed using the rans method and by adopting sst k ω turbulence model one of the advantages of the k ω model compared to other commonly used turbulence models is that it offers a high performance solution for boundary layers under adverse pressure gradients at low y wilcox 1993 here the finite volume method fvm was used for discretization and velocity pressure coupling was achieved with the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple based pressure correction technique discretization of convection terms in rans and turbulence transport equations was obtained with a second order upwind scheme the all y wall treatment was preferred for a correct estimate of flow and turbulence characteristics along the wall boundary layer the aim is to produce results close to the values given by the low y wall treatment when the y approaches zero and the values given by the high y wall treatment when it exceeds 30 cd adapco 2018 3 numerical methodology 3 1 flow past the rotating cylinder the notable factors affecting the flow around the rotating cylinder were chosen as diameter rotation speed by examining similar studies of karabelas et al 2012 sosa 2014 and liang et al 2017 also it was stated in elmiligui et al 2004 and travin et al 1999 that 2d solutions are highly compatible with 3d solutions in the examination of the flow around the cylinder eventually the magnus lift force as well as flow characteristics were examined by considering variations in the cylinder diameter 3 conditions and the rotation speed 5 conditions in 2d simulations within the scope of the study cylinders with different diameters in constant length l 2 m were studied where the free stream velocity u was 3 m s the aspect ratios l d in the fixed length cylinder were selected as 4 5 and 6 9 to specifying the size of cylinder diameters as a result cylinder diameters d calculated to be 50 cm 40 cm and 29 cm respectively the circumferential velocity of the cylinder is determined by the relation u θ 2 π 60 r n where n is the rotation speed and r is the radius of the cylinder here the five rotation speeds n were selected in a wide range between 300 rpm and 1500 rpm at 300 rpm intervals the flow past a counterclockwise rotating cylinder was examined at high reynolds number of 7 33 105 1 01 106 and 1 26 106 unlike a great number of studies in low reynolds numbers r e u d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity the main particulars of the cylinder analyses that form the basis of magnus stabilizer are given in table 1 the case codes are expressed as dinj where d i and n j are the magnus cylinder parameters in the ith diameter and jth rotation speed the magnus lift coefficient c l is non dimensionalized in 2d by the quantities where ρ is the density of fluid d is the cylinder rotor diameter and u is the free stream velocity f l represents the magnus based lift force produced by a rotating cylinder and c l can be defined as follows 5 c l f l 0 5 ρ d u 2 an important point to be noted here is that magnus forces to be applied on the ship via stabilizers were calculated by taking into account the relevant lateral projection area s instead of the dimensionless coefficients obtained from the 2d cylinder study to define body rotation speed n the local rotation rate method was applied on the wall surface in a 2d cylinder study thus the rotating wall approach which is suitable for axisymmetric geometries facilitated to define a tangential velocity on no slip walls in a simple way cd adapco 2018 the domain should cover a sufficient distance from the region where the solution accuracy is important while its dimensions should lead to the optimum computational costs in this study where d is the cylinder diameter the dimensions of the computational region in the xy plane were determined from the center of the cylinder as 32d to the outlet boundary 20d to the inlet boundary and 13 2d to the lateral surfaces fig 2 a inlet boundary condition was modeled as velocity inlet outlet boundary as pressure outlet and lateral boundaries as symmetry plane the cylinder surface was defined as the no slip wall boundary to be an impermeable surface fig 2 b the computational domain was discretized with the 2d polygonal cells by developed mesh features of the cfd software it is aimed to accelerate the convergence of the solution by aligning the cell surfaces in the flow direction the computational domain was divided into three regions with progressively refined mesh sizes as seen in fig 2 the close region around the cylinder zone 1 was meshed with a finer grid to resolve the boundary layer flow the grid resolution was gradually made coarser towards the boundaries of the domain also the prism layer mesh model was used to create orthogonal prismatic cells near the wall as can be illustrated in fig 2 b the parameters of the boundary layer were set suitably for y to be around 1 aim of prism layer mesh is not only limited to finding the forces on the wall correctly but that is also crucial for determining accurately the flow topology such as separation point in the boundary layer region ünal et al 2010 thus the hybrid mesh configurations with 9 65 104 1 84 105 and 2 75 105 cells were formed for 2d cylinder analyses in the computational domain 3 2 motion analysis for ship rotor system in the following a background to the numerical simulation approaches related to the roll heave motion of full scale ship coupled with 2d cylinder computations is presented the 35 m motor yacht hull was chosen to study ship rotor interaction my 35 m which has with twin screw and bulbous bow is a semi displacement hull a 3d view of the motor yacht with magnus stabilizer is illustrated in fig 3 and its main properties are presented in table 2 3 2 1 physical modeling the free water surface and fifth order stokes waves were modeled with the volume of fluid vof method the vof method developed by hirt and nichols 1981 can robustly form the free surface defined as the interface between immiscible fluids the method works by calculating the share of light fluid air and heavy fluid water in each cell in two phase numerical flow analyses the temperature of seawater was set as 15 5 c where ρ air 1 184 kg m3 ν air 1 567 10 5 m2 s ρ water 1025 91 kg m3 and ν water 1 174 10 6 m2 s ittc 2011 the high resolution interface capturing hric technique was applied with the vof method to well capture the sharp interface profile separating the water and air particles hric is a hybrid method between bounded downwind and upwind differencing schemes and achieves to get low numerical diffusion or dispersion error muzaferija and peric 1998 in the present study only roll and heave motions of the ship were enabled using body driven rotation and translation motion node in dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi module and the rest of the motions were restricted the dfbi method balances the pressure forces shear forces and moments imposing on the body and updates the position of the rigid body the motion updating with the dfbi solver is followed by the assigned local coordinate system represented the ship s gravity center where the magnus moment was applied the presence of magnus stabilizers requires additional requirements e g extra rotational interfaces greater cell number lower time step higher inner iteration number to model the rotational motion therefore the ship rotor interaction which is an inherently complex problem was represented and modeled in a facilitated way via external moment application approach considering the processing capability of cfd solver and computational cost the restoring magnus moments m m a g n u s were applied to the gravity center of the full scale my the magnus moment should be applied in the reverse direction of the wave induced rolling motion therefore the time dependent series of roll angular velocity y 4 was used to simulate the working principle of the stabilizer for the solution period as displayed with a flow chart in fig 4 the positive angular velocity corresponded to the ship s rolling motion from the portside to the starboard side in that condition y 4 0 the magnus moment tries to rotate the ship to the port side by taking a negative value m m a g n u s 0 at the points where the y 4 0 the hull stops and then starts to rotate in the opposite direction around the y axis the opposite is the case where y 4 0 the positive external moment m m a g n u s 0 tries to reduce the rolling angle this mechanism repetitively continues until the maximum physical time of numerical analysis and the ship motions are stored simultaneously the time step can be selected depending on the courant friedrichs lewy number cfl in accordance with the flow characteristics the condition is defined as c f l u δ t δ x where u is free stream velocity δ t is physical time step and δ x is minimum cell dimension it is recommended that the cfl number should be around 0 5 for a stable vof wave model simulation böhm and graf 2014 cd adapco 2018 in this study the time step was selected as 0 004 s for the prediction of ship responses to beam waves thereby was providing the permissible values of cfl in addition the selection of the appropriate release and ramp time sizes can decrease the oscillation of the residual and enables the convergence of the solution cakici et al 2018a the release time is the period of time that passes until the start of the body motion after the release period is completed the body starts to move and gradually freed until the ramp time within this study the release time was taken as 0 8 s as 200 δ t and the ramp time was selected as 10 times release time 3 2 2 numerical wave tank generation the determination of domain sizes mostly depends on the dimensions of the hull and the incident wave field in marine applications in simulations with a progressive wave model the dimensions of the computational field were determined in accordance with ittc 2014b guideline and illustrated in fig 5 the computational domain was divided into two parts as the overset and the background with an indirect region based interface between them here the domain around the ship represents the overset region where the motion takes place to computing ship motion the distance weighted scheme which is more cost effective and robust was preferred for the cell interpolation between the acceptor and donor cells in the overlapping region cd adapco 2018 the overset domain was defined as 2 1 d in height 1 2l bp in length and 2b in width the boundary conditions are depicted in fig 6 there are four velocity inlets two pressure outlets and a no slip wall in total the direction of the stokes wave propagation and the ship s advancing direction were perpendicular to each other the my hull advancing on the y axis was exposed to stokes waves from the starboard side on the x axis direction therefore the positive y direction and positive x direction were modeled via velocity inlet conditions while the opposite ends of those were assigned as the pressure outlet boundary conditions in addition top and bottom boundaries were defined as velocity inlet it is aimed to enable the deep water and infinite air conditions tezdogan et al 2015 the computational domain also had two pressure outlet including the vof damping boundary to prevent wave reflections as recommended in ittc 2014a the hull surface was assigned as the no slip wall boundary considering an impermeable surface it is assumed that the magnus stabilizers do not oscillate in the head and stern direction that is they were placed in a fixed and upright position to the hull also the performance of the magnus roll stabilizer at low speeds is examined within the scope of study although the ship s service speed is 14 knots 7 202 m s therefore the inflow velocity from the positive y direction which is also equal to the flow past the roll stabilizer was defined as 3 m s all of the simulations were carried out in beam sea condition and the 2dof motion of the ship was excited by fifth order stokes wave starting from positive x direction the reason for the selection is that the fifth order wave has more similarity with the real one than the first order wave cd adapco 2018 also the model does not need a long solution time as in the irregular wave to observe all harmonic components in the signal the wavelength was chosen 50 m approximately 1 5l bp and wave steepness was accepted as 1 64 as shown in table 3 ursell number u r h λ 2 d 3 where h is the wave height λ is wave length and d is the water depth less than 30 showed that the parameters are appropriate ursell 1953 the damping length was set at 62 5 m which is about 1 25 λ as similarly in the study of perić and abdel maksoud 2016 from outlet boundaries in order to avoid wave reflection besides the grid extrusion approach was preferred in the region close to the pressure outlet on the long side thus both the reflection errors and the increase in the computational time were prevented the initial wave pattern and grid structure of the free surface are shown in fig 7 3 2 3 mesh generation the overset algorithm is an appropriate method used to accurately predict the rotation and translation motions of multi part or moving structures this technique was preferred to handle the large amplitude motions of the full scale ship can et al 2020 delen and bal 2019 the major advantage of choosing overset mesh technique in the seakeeping simulations is that it minimizes the unsteady motions induced grid deformations around the complex geometry the passive cells inside the overset domain are not included in the solution as shown in fig 8 however they may become active during the motion of the object in the later stages of the simulation the grid structure around the my from different views are clearly displayed in fig 9 extreme distortion in grid structure can lead to unbalanced transitions between active and passive cells and eventually divergence of analysis therefore dimensions of the refinement volume were gradually increased to ensure a smooth grid transition also the height of refinement volume for the free surface i e the distance in the z direction was chosen as 1 12 m to cover the wave height there are several studies that can be a guide for creating a qualified phase separation for the free surface problem while ittc 2014a recommends at least 40 grid points per wavelength cd adapco 2018 recommends using 80 100 grids per wavelength and 20 grids per wave amplitude with the aim of well capture severe free surface deformation a minimum of 80 points per wavelength and a minimum of 20 cells were defined in the vertical direction the vof view on the mesh presented in fig 10 clearly shows that the generated fifth order stokes wave is fully captured inside of the proper grid refinement the all y wall approach was preferred and the dimensionless height of the first cell was studied to be y 5 the boundary layer grid can be seen from fig 11 in detail since the study does not deal with capturing the kelvine wave pattern any specific mesh refinement was not performed in the wake region finally a total of 5 84 million cells were formed including 2 29 million for the background region and 3 55 million for the overset region 4 results and discussions in this section the verification assessment results were presented for the uncertainty of seakeeping simulation considering roll amplitude and the lift coefficient of rotating cylinder at a certain re was validated with previously published results then the two dimensional simulations were carried out in order to get the hydrodynamic characteristics of rotating cylinder with various parameters of diameter d i and rotation speed n j seakeeping performances of the full scale my with and without external magnus based moments representing the stabilizers were numerically predicted and relatively compared to each other 4 1 verification and comparison study the first step in the assessment of the reliability of cfd analyses are generally to quantitatively determine the uncertainty level in order to quantify the effect of uncertainties on the numerical model a verification study should be made in this context the grid refinements n1 n2 and n3 were composed systematically by taking the refinement factor r g as 2 the differences between solution scalars can be calculated with ε 32 φ 3 φ 2 and ε 21 φ 2 φ 1 where φ i indicates the solution of the key parameter in the corresponding grid in the present study the rms roll amplitudes for full scale my and lift coefficient for d2n3 were chosen as the key parameters in cases where the convergence ratio r ε 21 ε 32 is between 0 and 1 the numerical solution is said to converge monotonously stern et al 2006 monotonic convergence leads to follow a procedure reference can be made to celik et al 2008 de luca et al 2016 and delen et al 2020 for more comprehensive knowledge about the procedure of grid convergence index gci based on richardson extrapolation the convergence ratios rg were calculated as 0 184 in the d2n3 cylinder case and 0 143 in the my seakeeping tests the solutions were monotonously convergent the discretization uncertainty components of spatial convergence studies are given in table 4 as a result the numerical uncertainty values g c i f i n e 21 of fine grid were estimated as 0 225 and 1 116 respectively thus verification analysis showed that the uncertainty values were at an acceptable level and the fine grid structures were used in the examination of the cases with rotating cylinder and the ship rotor system as a comparison study numerical analyses were re simulated in 2d similar to cylinder diameter and rotation speed of the reid 1924 s study fig 12 shows comparisons of the present lift coefficients with the available experimental results efd swanson 1961 indicated that the study of reid 1924 is the best approach to two dimensional flow as the experimental setup minimizes the end effects of cylinder the comparison study was conducted at a satisfactory level while the small discrepancies in lift coefficients can be due to the order of the reynolds number then the rest of the simulations were performed considering the parameters diameters and rotation speeds given in table 1 the comparison study was also conducted with the 2d cylinder computations in terms of the lift coefficients c l to compare the numerical model via lift coefficient simulations were carried out in a wide range of spin ratios α 2 09 4 19 6 28 8 38 and 10 47 subsequently the numerical results were found satisfactorily compatible with the case of karabelas et al 2012 at re 1 00 106 l 2 m d 0 4 m the relative differences were below around 1 as can be seen in fig 13 consequently it could be confirmed that the rotating wall approach gives a favorable representation of the lift characteristics the local rotation rate method within the approach can be preferred for the two dimensional rotating cylinder simulations because that presents a cost effective and faster solution compared to conventional methods i e moving reference frame and rigid body motion 4 2 flow characteristics and lift forces generated by rotating cylinders the vortex shedding process behind the 2d circular cylinders performed in three reynolds numbers and five rotation speeds are given in fig 14 streamlines patterns of karabelas et al 2012 obtained from the analyses by the k ε turbulence model at re 1 00 106 for the rotating case were chosen for comparison with present results at re 1 01 106 because it is observed from consistency both in the lift coefficients submitted at the previous sub section and in the streamlines presented below that the sst k ω model suffices to predict the mean flow characteristics the changes in the mean flow brought upon by the rotation of the cylinder are generally quite compatible with each other the minor discrepancies observed in the stagnation and saddle points of the streamlines may be negligible due to the variation in spin ratios the location of the stagnation points aʹ and bʹ and the saddle points cʹ and dʹ are marked in the wake region as depicted in fig 14 b and fig 14 c the two vortices are formed on the suction side in the case of re 1 01 106 and α 2 09 as can be observed in the transition from α 4 19 to α 6 28 vortices respectively disappear moreover a new saddle point dʹ is shaped certain time as points aʹ and bʹ approach each other gradually increasing α leads to thickening the rotational layer due to vorticity the point dʹ defined in a similar manner by aljure et al 2015 tends to move away from the cylinder surface as the α increases the wake region is composed of similar mean flow structures at such low spin ratios in agreement with reported observations by karabelas et al 2012 and aljure et al 2015 as the spin ratio increased that corresponds to the increase in the rotation speed n of the cylinder the vortices are dispersed to exemplify the two asymmetrical vortex pair are observed approximately in the positions θ 180 and θ 150 in the case of d1n1 α 1 52 where θ represents the angular displacement the typical two vortex configurations are also formed at other low spin ratio α 3 conditions as expected then the downstream vortex gradually narrows while the upstream vortex expands in all cases the rotating boundary layer in the downstream region of the cylinder transfers the energy to the free stream in that region preventing separation in the low pressure region and causing the vortex to form away from the wall in contrast differences in the vortex sizes appear when the boundary layer that develops in the upstream region creates a reverse flow and supports the formation of the vortex structure also in cases where two vortices exist the upstream vortex rotates clockwise and the downstream vortex rotates counterclockwise at the moment of loss of the downstream vortex the velocity in the rotating boundary layer is much higher than the average value of the free stream velocity the vortex shedding phenomenon of the wake behind a rotating circular cylinder was observed to be affected by the spin ratio rather than the reynolds number the dimensional change of the vortex structure is successive when the cases of d1n2 α 3 04 d2n1 α 2 09 and d3n1 α 2 62 are sorted according to the increase in the α also the saddle points are very close to each other in the cases of d2n4 α 8 38 and d3n3 α 7 85 although re of d2n5 and d3n4 cases are different due to the varying cylinder diameters the same linear velocities ensure that the wake regions were similar to each other it is also noticeable that the distances of the saddle points dʹ to the surface of the cylinder are almost at the same location present results where the relation of the lift coefficient c l versus the spin ratio α is presented indicate an almost linear relationship between the parameters and both variables of d and n fig 15 note that the circumferential velocity of the cylinder in the spin ratio calculation depends on both rotation speed and diameter in fig 15 a the variable d is kept constant in the spin ratio calculation and the effect of changing the variable n is examined for just one diameter that is repeated for d2 and d3 besides a similar process is carried out for the constant variable of n to obtain fig 15 b the c l tends to increase with growing d and n for the range of examined α since the steep slope of the diameter based lines is higher than the steep slope of the rotation speed based lines it can be justified that the relative effect of the diameter increase on the lift force is higher than the rotation speed increase besides the lift coefficient is smaller than that of prandtl s limit c l m a x 4π the c l is 9 64 at maximum α because of the turbulent flow 4 3 seakeeping analyses with magnus force roll and heave motions which impacted the full scale motor yacht from the port side by regular fifth order stokes waves were allowed to realistically depict the ship s behavior in sea conditions while representing the roll damping mechanism it was assumed that the rotors were positioned perpendicular to the ship s hull outwardly and parallel to the free surface thus it is aimed to achieve maximum magnus force from the flow perpendicular to the lateral surface of the cylinder first the lift forces obtained from the 2d cylinder study were expanded along the length of the rotor to achieve 3d lift forces then because the rotors were operated in opposite directions the total lift force was found by taking twice a single lift force for each case the magnus based moment quantity was achieved by multiply with the moment arm ℓ m 4 82 m which is the perpendicular distance between the cylinder volume center and the ship s center of gravity consequently the roll damping effect of the magnus stabilizer was defined with an external moment application approach the maximum roll amplitudes y 4 m a x and the rms roll amplitudes y 4 r m s of the ships with magnus moment values applied were compared with those of the original motor yacht case my the relative difference calculation can be expressed as follows 6 δ y 4 y 4 my y 4 y 4 my y 4 my 100 firstly the motion problems for my my w d1n3 my w d2n3 and my w d3n3 cases were simulated using t max 100 s fig 16 the maximum difference between the roll rms values obtained from the 100 s signals and the 35 s signals is calculated as 0 116 degree since a slight difference is observed and the fundamental roll signals maintain the periodicity the overall solution time is chosen as 35 s considering the computational cost consequently the external moment application provides a practical engineering approach for the solution of seemingly complex ship rotor interaction and the magnus stabilizer ensures a decrease between 9 13 and 85 84 in roll motion as listed in table 5 in cases where the relative difference value is almost the same the coercive moment values obtained from the cylinder are actually quite close to each other the rms roll amplitudes of the ships exerted magnus moment are presented with respect to spin ratio in fig 17 fig 18 and fig 19 display the change in roll amplitude y 4 at different rotor diameters and rotation speeds it is noteworthy to mention that the time intervals corresponding to negative values in the figures represent the ship s rolling to the port side while the positive values stand for rolling to the starboard side the curves indicate that the magnus damping moment clearly reduces the ship s roll amplitude while the average roll amplitude difference between my case and my w d1n1 case at constant free stream velocity is around 9 13 that difference is 26 48 for my w d1n5 case similar changes are valid for all situations where revolution increases for example the decrease in the average roll amplitude which is 19 18 for the rotation speed of 300 rpm has reaches 49 77 for 1500 rpm if the diameter is taken as a 40 cm the greatest reduction in roll amplitude is 85 84 at 1500 rpm for the 50 cm diameter rotor my w d3n5 there are remarkable behaviors in the roll motion characteristics of the hull under the action of the forced roll device as shown in figs 18 and 19 the my model completes the motion in the direction of the port side at 2 45 in about 20 s of the analysis then the motion is completed at a nearly upright position 0 05 at 23rd seconds and continued to the port direction also the ship rotor system is found to have larger amplitudes than the my in the third cycle of all cases both the presence of the my behavior and the observation of larger amplitudes in ship rotor systems in the same cycle compared to the my despite the effectiveness of the damping moment are unexpected responses at first glance hence that can be considered as an irregular motion characteristic due to the non linearity of the problem both in terms of the dynamic character of the ship and the factors that cause motion still the behavior may be explained mathematically in a simple way the harmonic components hc of the signal may be obtained as complex quantities by applying fast fourier transform fft algorithm to the time series of roll data each component is distinguished from the others by its frequency amplitude and phase angle or its real and imaginary parts given the my case it is noticed that the time varying roll angle can be represented by nine harmonic components if components whose amplitude is less than 0 001 radians are neglected these harmonic components are given in fig 20 a with corresponding waveforms total roll signals starting with the first harmonic component with the smallest frequency and adding an increasing number of components to the previous ones are presented in fig 20 b each added component depending on its amplitude and phase angle may partially or entirely change the form of the time signal within a certain time interval eventually the sudden deviation observed in the range of 20 25 s with the addition of the 7th harmonic component hc7 in the case of my similar behaviors were observed in other combinations such as my w d2n3 as can be seen in fig 21 theoretically the parallelism between the increase in rotation speed and the decrease in roll angle should be continuous liang et al 2017 however an uninterrupted efficiency cannot be obtained from a system with constant rotation speed one way to resolve this contradiction may be to change the physical parameters or working conditions of magnus stabilizer instantly the damping provided by a lower higher rotation speeds may be more effective at some moments as can be seen in the examples and the importance of a control system for the magnus stabilizer increases the results of roll angular velocity y 4 are presented in fig 22 here the left vertical axis refers to the roll angular velocities obtained from the ship rotor system analyses and the right vertical axis represents the roll angular velocities of my scaled by 0 2 the first thing that draws attention in the graphs is that there is a 180 degree phase difference between the my case and all the remaining cases as expected the increases in rotation speed and diameter reduce the angular velocity of the rolling the maximum value reaching around 0 5 rad s for the my decreases remarkably to 0 05 rad s with the magnus stabilizer appendage in addition the my w d3n5 case behaves differently than others and at some time intervals 5 7 s and 15 17 s the roll angular velocity is almost zero it is also notable that the roll amplitude is around 0 06 during these periods the roll acceleration y 4 results which are important parameters especially for passenger comfort are given in fig 23 it should not be forgotten that another purpose of roll reduction systems e g fin stabilizer gyroscope or magnus stabilizer is to decrease the acceleration characteristics of the marine vessels although the ship moves with low roll amplitudes high vertical accelerations may negatively affect the passengers and crew as it is discussed in the study of cakici et al 2018b the roll acceleration is reduced for the first two cycles however there is an increase in the peak of the third and fourth cycles of some cases as seen at the time histories of other parameters above it is unnecessary to take that increase as a negative indicator because the roll acceleration is obtained always at low levels the case my w d3n5 differentiates from the general system behavior fig 23 c and serious oscillations are observed in the roll acceleration curve however that case has an efficient configuration for roll reduction which is clearly visible in fig 18 c as such it can be considered that a system with these conditions is not feasible however the fact that the behavior stables after about 25 s suggests that analysis has to be resolved over a longer time period in order to make a more precise interpretation fig 24 and fig 25 graphically display the effects of the magnus stabilizer on the heave amplitude y 3 and heave acceleration y 3 respectively as can be seen from both figures the scalars defining the magnus stabilizer have no significant effect on either the heave motion or the acceleration the heave amplitude has slight changes around the 28th second in the conditions where the 40 cm diameter cylinder rotates faster than 300 rpm it is possible to see the similar reduction effects in the 50 cm diameter cases also the heave amplitudes are not affected even in the highest rotation speed which is favorable outcomes to the roll motion because of the insignificant effect of the magnus stabilizer on the heave acceleration the values are much higher compared to the roll acceleration that indicates the heave motion may be more determinant as a vertical component in the motion sickness disturbances i e sea sickness associated with the vertical acceleration of the ship 5 concluding remarks the emphasis in the study is on the effects of a circular cross section magnus rotating roll stabilizer on the roll and heave motions and the associated accelerations of a 35 m motor yacht the work was first conducted by simulating the flow around the two dimensional rotating circular cylinders of three different high reynolds numbers 7 33 105 1 01 106 and 1 26 106 and fifteen different spin ratios between 1 52 and 13 09 discussing at wider spin ratios and higher reynolds numbers yielded a specialized aspect to the studies about flow around the rotating cylinder then the magnus based lift force obtained from rotating cylinder analyses was externally enforced from the gravity center of ship in three dimensional seakeeping simulations the effect of magnus moment applied in a facilitated way on ship motion was investigated by systematic analyses the lift force generated by cylinders and roll heave characteristics of the motor yacht were estimated by reynolds averaged navier stokes rans based computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis with the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model the discrepancy for the lift coefficient was found to be less than 1 for the rotating cylinder compared the available data a very good correlation was also found with that of available cfd analyses in terms of instantaneous streamline patterns in the wakefield pointing out the flow phenomenon of vortex shedding regarding the evaluation of the vortex shedding around the rotating cylinder a change in spin ratio affected the streamline pattern noticeably and the magnus lift force increased almost linearly with growing spin ratio as a result of the parametric analysis it was found that the increase in the cylinder diameter would be more effective than the rotational speed in the production of magnus lift force the rotating wall approach which ensures the rotational motion of the cylinder was concluded as quite successful in predicting the lift force and changes in vortex formation the numerical model of the rotating cylinder and motor yacht were verified by the grid convergence index in terms of lift coefficient and roll amplitudes respectively the effect of the magnus stabilizer system on the heave motion was almost negligible while significant decreases in roll related parameters amplitude velocity and acceleration were achieved an encouraging outcome from the present study was that the magnus stabilizer can reduce the rms roll amplitude of the full scale motor yacht up to 85 84 with the combination of appropriate geometric characteristics and operating conditions external moment application as a practical engineering approach yielded successful in modeling ship rotor interaction this approach also provided a fast and facilitated aspect in numerical modeling of various dynamic stabilizers additionally a decrease in accelerations of ship motions may cause magnus stabilizers to have a reducing effect on the motion sickness index credit authorship contribution statement deniz ozturk conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation resources

21374,to describe the effect of the coupled damage caused by corrosion and low fatigue hysteresis on the mechanical performance of marine steel a generalized hysteretic constitutive model is developed based on the results of a reversed cyclic test that was conducted previously on the commonly used d36 steel considering different corrosion scenarios and loading schemes three typical hardening models namely the nliso isotropic model chaboche kinematic model and combined hardening model in abaqus are first studied using the parameters calibrated with the test data the combined model is found to be capable of performing desirable simulations for all pitting corrosion cases however it is difficult to explicitly clarify the relation between its parameters and the volume loss ratio vlr which is not applicable for general purposes the developed hysteretic model consists of a cyclic hardening skeleton segment an unloading segment and a reloading segment a direct link is established between its parameters and vlr via regressive analysis this generalized model can comprehensively account for with desirable prediction accuracy the influence of pitting induced volume loss stress concentration

addition to in service high cycle low stress dynamic loads such as waves ocean currents ice pressure etc some marine structures e g platforms are supposed to withstand extreme low cycle high stress dynamic excitations such as earthquakes during their service period wang et al 2006 when the volume loss stress concentration and eccentricity caused by corrosion are combined with large amplitude strain reversals the damage development in marine structures will be accelerated which could affect their dynamic performance significantly apostolopoulos and matikas 2018 in contrast to uniform corrosion pitting corrosion is more crucial for assessing the performance of marine structures when they are confronted with large dynamic excitations however from the perspective of computational efficiency or stability it is not numerically feasible to simulate corrosion pits locally in structure level analysis therefore it is practically useful to rationally incorporate the effect of pitting corrosion into a generalized hysteretic model for corroded steel components the effect of uniform corrosion on the mechanical behaviour of a steel component can be manifested in terms of the section loss qin et al 2016 the resulting damage is evenly distributed on the surface of the concerned component if a sufficient section allowance is maintained the consequences of such damage can be controlled in contrast the pitting induced stress concentration and eccentricity as well as section loss can result in higher stresses in steel components when subjected to cyclic loadings jia et al 2019 as the pitting induced damage develops both the strength and deformability of steel can be affected and the yield plateau tends to decrease gradually yao et al 2018 even if the section loss caused by pitting corrosion is not substantial the failure mode of steel components might be altered unexpectedly strain reversals can cause cyclic strain hardening in steel components but at the cost of reduced yield plateau and elongation ma et al 2019 however significant strength degradation can be observed if the damage caused by pitting corrosion is severe and occurs in combination with large amplitude strain reversals uniform corrosion can be described in terms of just the corrosive depth whereas the description of corrosion pits involves more parameters such as the shape diameter depth and distribution pattern paik et al 2004 therefore it is not acceptable to assess pitting induced damage by a single specific parameter as a compromise three comprehensive corrosion indicators namely degree of pitting dop corrosion volume loss ratio vlr and section loss ratio slr are used wang et al 2014 as dop is the ratio of the corroded surface area to the overall area it is suitable for the characterization of damage on the surface of a uniformly corroded steel plate both vlr and slr can relate some corrosive parameters to the specimen configuration they can be used to describe the damage caused by either pitting corrosion or uniform corrosion wang 2008 paik et al 2003 unlike slr vlr can reflect the three dimensional effect of pitting damage in a corroded steel plate huang et al 2010 jiang and soares 2012 in the case of pitting corroded specimens under reversed cyclic loading as considered here vlr seems to be more appropriate strain hardening models play an important role in the characterization of the hysteretic performance of steel under cyclic loading they consist of mainly three types isotropic kinematic and combined strain hardening models in an isotropic hardening model the subsequent yield surfaces are assumed to vary only in size with respect to the initial yield surface with a fixed central point zaverl and lee 1978 structured an isotropic hardening model with an internal variable in terms of the accumulated plastic strain this model can be numerically implemented easily with only a few parameters however a significant deviation was observed in the simulation of the response of the reloading segment of steel to improve the prediction accuracy of the model cailletaud and chaboche 1980 proposed a nonlinear isotropic nliso hardening model based on voce s hardening law when subjected to reversed cyclic loadings steel exhibits the well known bauschinger effect in the reloading segment obviously such an effect is associated with the translation of the yield surface and cannot be rationally described by an isotropic hardening model a kinematic hardening model is capable of describing the translation phenomenon of the yield surface in the stress space in which the sizes of all the initial and subsequent yield surfaces are constant during the translation prager 1956 the nonlinear kinematic hardening model developed by chaboche 1986 1991 assumes that the overall elasticity range is a constant this means that an increase in the stress level in one direction due to strain hardening will result in an equal decrease in the yield stress in its opposite direction generally the strain hardening of any material involves variations in both the size and translation of the yield surface the combined hardening models seem to be more promising although they are computationally inefficient romashchenko et al 1999 their advantages have been demonstrated in the simulation of steel plates subjected to strain reversals the type of plastic formation has been found to have a significant effect on the strength and stiffness tekgoz and garbatov 2020 to obtain an insight into the coupled damage induced by corrosion especially in the case of pitting corrosion as well as the low fatigue large amplitude hysteresis on the mechanical performance of marine steel a generalized hysteretic constitutive model is developed based on the results of the reversed cyclic test conducted previously on the commonly used d36 steel where different corrosion scenarios and loading schemes are considered as corrosion in offshore platforms develops mostly on the outer surface of the steel components the developed generalized hysteretic model is expected to be able to comprehensively address pitting induced volume loss stress concentration and eccentricity first three hardening models namely nliso isotropic model chaboche kinematic model and the combined model in abaqus abaqus standard user s manuals v6 9 2009 are studied using parameters calibrated with the test data to check their applicability in describing the hysteretic behaviour of corroded steel components generalized hysteretic model which consists of a cyclic hardening skeleton segment an unloading segment and a reloading segment is developed and the link between all the characteristic parameters and the corrosion indicator i e vlr is explicitly clarified based on the test data 2 three typical strain hardening models 2 1 outlines of previous reversed cyclic tests the configuration of the specimens tested previously ma et al 2019 jia et al 2019 consist of the test part transition part and clamped part see fig 1 the claimed yield strength σ y ultimate strength σ u and elongation δ provided by wuyang iron and steel co ltd were 430 mpa 553 mpa and 26 respectively the actual tested yield strength and tensile strength were 414 mpa and 550 mpa respectively corrosion was generated in the specimens by using the accelerated electrochemical corrosion method considering both the typical range of diameters of the corrosion pits in the splash zone of steel offshore platforms as well as the dimensions of the specimens four nominal diameters 8 mm 9 mm 10 mm and 11 mm were used to prepare the specimens all the pitting corroded specimens had corrosion pits located on a single side to address the corrosion development in the steel components of offshore platforms the corrosive depths of all the specimens were required to be not greater than one half of the thickness daidola et al 1997 four target volume loss ratios vlrs namely vlr 1 6 3 2 4 8 and 6 4 corresponding to corrosion degrees ranging from slight to severe were considered for the pitting corroded specimens as listed in table 1 the target vlrs were used to evaluate the target corrosive amount and the time required for accelerated electrochemical corrosion by using faraday s law the corresponding actual vlrs measured using the archimedes method after the accelerated corrosion process were 1 62 3 23 4 98 and 6 75 respectively ma et al 2019 for the purpose of comparison two specimens with uniform corrosion were also prepared with target vlrs of 4 8 and 16 with measured vlrs of 5 3 and 15 2 respectively after accelerated corrosion the non corroded parts of all the specimens were protected from corrosion the measured residual width d r and residual thickness w r of the uniformly corroded specimens as well as the depth h and diameter d of the pitting corroded specimens are also listed in table 1 all the specimens were tested using instron 8801 material testing machine ma et al 2019 jia et al 2019 which has a maximum load range of 100 kn the room temperature was controlled within the range of 20 c to 25 c satisfying the test conditions specified by the american society for testing materials astm 1998 considering that the strain rate of earthquake action varies between 2 5 10 4 s and 1 0 10 1 s the strain rate used in the cyclic test was 5 10 2 s this was also based on the considerations of large strain amplitude around 3 5 and possible damage in the testing machine due to failure of the tested specimens if the strain rate is high to capture the peak points and inflexion points of the hysteresis loops during strain reversals more accurately the sampling frequency of the strains was set as 50 hz with a 12 5 mm length extensometer having a maximum range of 3 5 if the strain range of the extensometer is exceeded the relative displacement recorded by the sensors located at the ends of the testing machine is used to minimise the deviation between the testing machine and the axes of the tested specimens the upper and lower clamping devices were calibrated and the clamped part of the specimens were adjusted simultaneously the machining errors of the specimens were also controlled during the preparation to reflect the randomness in earthquake excitations six loading schemes were applied to the tested specimens see fig 2 fig 3 shows the hysteretic response curves of specimens uc 4 8 and pc 4 8 which had the same target vlrs as well as an intact specimen under the cl 3 loading program it can be observed that uniform corrosion does not have a significant influence on the stress vs strain response of uc 4 8 whereas the influence of pitting corrosion on the stress vs strain response of pc 4 8 is obvious under the same strain amplitude the peak stresses of pc 4 8 were lower approximately 13 than those of uc 4 8 the unloading segments of the three specimens agreed well with each other the differences were mainly found in the reloading and cyclic hardening skeleton segments to verify the accuracy of a hysteretic model of concern the test data are compared with the results from finite element analysis fea using abaqus abaqus standard user s manuals v6 9 2009 with the calibrated material parameters by the test data in the feas of all the specimens the c3d8r element is used with poisson s ratio μ taken as 0 30 in the numerical modelling the lower end of all the specimens is fixed and the upper end is free 2 2 results using nliso isotropic hardening model fig 4 illustrates the basic features of the isotropic and kinematic strain hardening models as discussed previously an isotropic hardening model see fig 4 a is described mainly by the development of the peak stresses σ i t and σ i c with the plastic strain amplitude of ε c i pl ε t i pl at each cycle from σ 1 t to σ n t while the central point is always positioned at the origin in a kinematic hardening model the stress σ j and plastic strain ε j pl are determined during the translation of the yield surface during each cycle with a constant strain range of δ ε see fig 4 b the isotropic hardening behaviour using the nliso model is described by the evolution of the yield surface size σ i 0 of the ith cycle with the corresponding plastic strain of ε i pl as follows chaboche 1986 1 σ i 0 σ i t σ i c 2 σ 0 q 1 exp b ε i pl where σ 0 is the yield stress at zero plastic strain it can be taken as the yield strength of intact steel σ y or corroded steel σ y σ i t is the peak tensile stress corresponding to the plastic tensile strain of the ith cycle ε t i p l σ i c is the peak compressive stress corresponding to the plastic compressive strain of the ith cycle ε c i p l q is the maximum change rate of the yield surface size and b is the change rate of the yield surface size in the development of the ith cycle plastic strain of ε i pl based on the test data ε i pl is determined by the ith cycle plastic strain range of δ ε i pl i e 2 ε i pl 1 2 4 i 3 δ ε i pl 1 2 4 i 3 ε t i pl ε c i pl 1 2 4 i 3 δ ε 2 σ i t e where e is the elasticity modulus of a corroded steel specimen as considered herein for the pitting corroded specimens e was measured as 196 68 gpa 186 63 gpa 165 18 gpa and 150 69 gpa for pc 1 6 pc 3 2 pc 4 8 and pc 6 4 respectively ma et al 2019 the elasticity modulus of the uniformly corroded specimens uc 4 8 and uc 16 e was tested as 210 0 gpa jia et al 2019 fig 5 a shows the results predicted by the nliso model for pc 1 6 under the cl 3 loading program where the material parameters are calibrated as σ 0 405 mpa q 131 mpa and b 2 5 using the test data it can be seen that the nliso strain hardening model can accurately predict the peak stresses of all the hysteresis loops as it is not capable of describing the bauschinger effect a large error can be observed in the reloading segment see red circle in fig 5 a 2 3 results using chaboche kinematic hardening model if the dependency between temperature and field variables is ignored in the chaboche model chaboche 1986 the back stresses associated with the translation of yield surfaces are determined by 3 α k c k γ k 1 exp γ k ε j pl α k 1 exp γ k ε j pl where α k is the kth back stress k 1 2 p p is the number of back stresses included α k 1 is the first data point of the kth back stress and c k and γ k are the material parameters calibrated using cyclic test data the translation of the yield surfaces is related to the accumulation of the back stresses chaboche 1986 included α j i e 4 α j k 1 p α k the parameters α k 1 c k and γ k k 1 2 p are calibrated by equating eq 4 with the stress at any intermediate point α j in the reloading hardening segment i e 5 α j σ j σ s σ j σ 1 σ m 2 where σ s is the average stress of the first data point σ y and last data point σ m see fig 4 b m is the number of data points between the first data point σ 1 and last data point σ m σ 1 can be taken as the stress level at the intersection point between the unloading segment and reloading segment during a stable strain cycle about one half of the total strain cycles σ m can be taken as the stress level at the intersection point between the reloading segment and the skeleton segment the corresponding plastic strain ε j pl is updated by 6 ε j p l ε j σ j e ε 0 p l where ε j is the strain at point j and ε 0 pl is the plastic strain of the first data point at a stable strain cycle fig 5 b shows the results predicted by the chaboche model for pc 1 6 with the cl 3 loading program where the parameters are p 4 c 1 c 4 7948 mpa 5310 mpa 3005 mpa and 1200 mpa and γ 1 γ 4 151 96 456 and 48 compared with the nliso model the reloading segment predicted by the chaboche model is closer to the tested data however the peak stresses are overestimated see the red circle in fig 5 b 2 4 results using combined hardening model as discussed above neither the nliso isotropic model nor the chaboche kinematic model can provide accurate predictions about the hysteretic response of pitting corroded steel subjected to strain reversals is it possible to obtain more accurate predictions by using the combined hardening model with the parameters determined above for each part separately the parameters calibrated for eqs 1 and 3 of the nliso isotropic and chaboche kinematic models are directly adopted to generate the predictions of the combined hardening model as shown in fig 5 c a slight improvement in the prediction accuracy can be observed however the peak response is still unacceptably overestimated this is attributed to the inconsistent calibration of the material parameters for the reloading segment and peak response points to eliminate the inconsistency the parameters were adjusted based on the sensitivity analysis based on the parametric analysis conducted previously q was found to have less influence on the shape of the yield surface however an increase in q could result in an exponential increase in the size of the yield surface the unloading segment of the hysteretic response curves was observed to be sensitive to the parameter b a smaller value of b implies a faster unloading rate the parameters of the chaboche model i e c 1 c 4 and γ 1 γ 4 are correlated more or less with each other the parameters c 1 c 4 significantly affect the peak stresses of the hysteretic curves a decrease in γ 1 γ 4 can cause an increase in the slopes of the unloading and reloading segments the ratios of c k γ k k 1 2 3 4 are closely related to the shape of the yield surface according to these observations and the predicted response shown in fig 5 c the parameters were calibrated as q 10 mpa b 1 0 c 1 c 4 5000 mpa 4500 mpa 2500 mpa and 800 mpa and γ 1 γ 4 140 90 400 and 33 as shown in fig 6 a desirable agreement is achieved by the combined hardening model with the adjusted parameters from the perspective of either the size or the shape of the yield surface fig 7 further illustrates the relative errors e r x fea x test x test x fea and x test are the results of fea and the test respectively of the peak tensile stresses σ i t and yield surface sizes σ i 0 of pc 1 6 under the cl 3 loading programs most of the errors are less than 10 indicating the effectiveness of the model 3 parametrized combined hardening model for different corrosion scenarios 3 1 different vlrs for pitting corrosion as shown in fig 8 the strength and stiffness degradation of steel becomes significant as the damage induced by pitting corrosion develops the model parameters calibrated by the data of specimen pc 1 6 are not applicable for other corrosion cases table 2 lists the adjusted parameters of all pitting corrosion cases for the combined hardening model based on the corresponding test data with the corrosion related parameters a desirable agreement between the test data and fea simulations can be reached as shown in fig 9 figs 10 and 11 illustrate the relative errors of the results from the test and fea using the combined model for different target vlrs under the cl 3 loading scheme for the peak stress σ i t or yield surface size σ i 0 at each strain cycle the errors are globally acceptable although some errors are obvious at the initial small amplitude stage of the strain reversals as the strain amplitude becomes larger the predictions from the fea tend to be closer to the test data the errors do not exhibit a clear relation with vlr indicating the rationality of the combined hardening model with the adjusted parameters however owing to the inter related parameters it is difficult to explicitly clarify the relationship between the adjusted parameters and vlr 3 2 different corrosion types as shown in figs 3 and 8 the hysteretic response of the corroded specimens is closely related to both the vlr and corrosion type therefore the parameters calibrated by the test data are also related to both the vlr and corrosion type figs 12 and 13 show the fea results of pc 4 8 and uc 4 8 using the combined model with the parameters calibrated using the test data of uc 4 8 and pc 4 8 respectively the uc 4 8 based parameters are calibrated as σ 0 407 mpa q 97 mpa b 1 1 c 1 c 4 11 198 mpa 3000 mpa 2277 mpa and 855 mpa and γ 1 γ 4 1500 250 50 and 3 4 the pc 4 8 based calibrated parameters are selected from table 2 as shown in fig 12 using the parameters calibrated based on the test data of uc 4 8 can result in an obviously overestimated prediction of the peak stresses and reloading stiffness in the initial stage therefore the energy dissipation ability of pc 4 8 is amplified if uc 4 8 is simulated with the parameters calibrated using pc 4 8 the peak stresses and reloading stiffness in the later stage are significantly underestimated the differences in the simulations mainly lie in the corrosion induced load eccentricity however such inconsistent treatment is physically unacceptable 4 three segment generalized hysteretic model 4 1 regressive parameters associated with the cyclic hardening skeleton segment as mentioned previously the combined model is not practically useful for general applications it might be feasible to describe the hysteretic curves of corroded steel by establishing a direct link between a corrosion indicator e g vlr and the three constituent segments namely skeleton unloading and reloading segments of the hysteresis loops as observed from the test data see fig 9 the unloading segment of the hysteresis loops is nearly parallel to the elastic segment i e no obvious stiffness degradation takes place during the unloading process therefore the description of the three segment generalized model is focussed on the cyclic hardening skeleton segment and reloading segment the skeleton curves of the specimens were generated by connecting the peak points of the hysteresis loops as shown in fig 14 it can be clearly observed that even under cyclic loading the specimens still exhibit a reduced yield plateau in the forward loading direction the so called cyclic strain hardening is also distinct compared with the stress vs strain curve obtained from the monotonic tension test as the degree of corrosion increases either for uniform corrosion or for pitting corrosion the yield strength and cyclic hardening tend to decrease as listed in table 3 in the case of pitting corrosion a decrease of 17 2 in the yield stress σ y is observed as vlr increases up to 6 4 the stresses of uc 4 8 and pc 4 8 which have the same target vlr exhibit a relative difference of 10 3 the ultimate strengths σ u listed in table 3 were obtained by performing a monotonic tension test until failure when specified strain reversals were accomplished the ultimate strengths also decreased as the vlr increased it should be noted that the ultimate strength of pc 6 4 is not available due to premature failure as a result of severe corrosion according to the above observations the skeleton curves of the specimens can be characterized by a linearly elastic segment a yield plateau in the forward direction and a cyclic hardening segment as illustrated in fig 15 the linearly elastic segment starts from the origin ε 0 σ 0 0 0 the elasticity modulus e and yield strength σ y of the pitting corroded specimens can be obtained from the test data i e 7 e e 0 9 3 vlr 8 σ y β σ y 12 1 vlr where e 0 is the elasticity modulus of intact steel e 0 211 5 gpa for the marine steel used and σ y is the yield strength of intact steel obtained from the standard coupon test here σ y 414 mpa and β is the cyclic hardening ratio at the yielding point according to table 3 β 423 414 1 024 as shown in figs 16 and 17 eqs 7 and 8 can have coefficients of determination of goodness of fit r 2 close to unity with a known σ y the yield strain ε y is determined by 9 ε y σ y e as for the cyclic hardening segment the following expression suggested by zhou 1989 can be used to describe the post yielding stress development 10 σ p t c a t c r t c exp k t c ε p t c where σ p t c and are ε p t c the stress and strain on the skeleton curve respectively the superscripts t and c denote tension and compression respectively a t c r t c and k t c are the coefficients obtained from the test data in the tension t and compression parts c as follows a t 7 2 vlr 571 0 11a a c 20 7 vlr 723 0 r t 0 8 vl r 2 4 6 vlr 222 7 11b r c 3 4 vl r 2 19 0 vlr 288 5 k t 3 6 vlr 63 5 11c k c 0 3 vl r 2 3 6 vlr 23 2 fig 18 shows the desirable goodness of fit for all coefficients with these coefficients the strain at the end of the yielding plateau ε k can be determined by eqs 8 and 10 as shown in fig 19 the three segment skeleton curves generated by eqs 7 11 agree more desirably with the test data than with those generated by the combined model that was discussed previously especially in the yielding and cyclic hardening segments using the combined model can result in overestimated predictions about the stress levels in these two segments 4 2 regressive parameters associated reloading segment the reloading segment at the ith cycle of the strain reversals starts from an end point of the unloading segment ε 0 i t c σ 0 i t c and terminates at a peak point ε p i t c σ p i t c on the skeleton segment discussed above as illustrated in fig 20 in the case of the pitting corroded marine steel which is discussed here the expression proposed by shi et al 2011 is modified as follows to

corroded marine steel under strain reversals fig 22 shows a comparison between the recorded and simulated hysteretic responses of four pitting corroded specimens under the cl 3 loading scheme the generalized hysteretic model can provide desirable simulations of the skeleton segment unloading segment and most parts of the reloading segment a slightly underestimated softening is observed in the

4 8 and 6 4 under the cl 3 loading scheme although relatively large prediction errors occur during a few small amplitude strain reversals especially for the yield surface size σ i 0 most of the errors in the peak stresses σ i t and yield surface sizes are less than 5 the generalized model can be applied for engineering practice with some rationally acceptable conservation 5 conclusions based on the results of a reversed cyclic test that was conducted previously on d36 marine structural steel a generalized hysteretic material model was developed to account for the effect of different pitting corrosion scenarios on the hysteretic response of corroded steel as a result the following observations were made 1 the hysteresis loops of the corroded steel specimens are significantly affected by both the corrosion degree and corrosion type specifically in contrast with uniform corrosion the eccentricity induced by pitting corrosion has a more adverse effect on the reloading segment and cyclic strain hardening as a result of cyclic hardening there is an increase in the yield strength and ultimate strength of marine steel a reduced yielding plateau compared with the intact specimen still exists in the corroded specimens 2 with the parameters calibrated using the test data the nliso isotropic hardening model could reliably predict the peak stresses of the hysteresis loops of the pitting corroded specimens however due to the incapability of the nliso model in the characterisation of the bauschinger effect a significant error could be observed in the reloading segment comparatively the reloading segment simulated by the chaboche kinematic hardening model agrees well with the test data however it may cause overestimated peak stresses 3 direct incorporation of the parameters of the nliso and chaboche models into the combined hardening model could improve the prediction accuracy slightly a more desirable agreement could be achieved from the perspective of either the size or the shape of the yield surface by the combined model with the parameters calibrated based on the sensitivity analysis these parameters can be adjusted to account for the damage caused by different corrosion cases however it is difficult to explicitly clarify the relationship between the adjusted parameters and the vlr 4 the generalized hysteretic model developed for pitting corroded steel consists of three segments a cyclic hardening skeleton segment an unloading segment and a reloading segment the parameters of all the segments were determined using regressive analysis and were explicitly related to the vlr the generalized model could comprehensively account for with desirable prediction accuracy the influence of pitting induced volume loss stress concentration and eccentricity on the hysteretic behaviour of marine steel it can be applied to engineering practice with rational conservation 5 the temperature effect that can affect the performance of corroded marine steel was not addressed in this study the low temperature brittleness of steel may cause premature rupture under strain reversals for safety reasons the corrosion temperature coupling effect on the hysteretic behaviour of marine steel needs to be identified in future investigations credit authorship contribution statement yang yang methodology supervision writing original revision writing

21374,to describe the effect of the coupled damage caused by corrosion and low fatigue hysteresis on the mechanical performance of marine steel a generalized hysteretic constitutive model is developed based on the results of a reversed cyclic test that was conducted previously on the commonly used d36 steel considering different corrosion scenarios and loading schemes three typical hardening models namely the nliso isotropic model chaboche kinematic model and combined hardening model in abaqus are first studied using the parameters calibrated with the test data the combined model is found to be capable of performing desirable simulations for all pitting corrosion cases however it is difficult to explicitly clarify the relation between its parameters and the volume loss ratio vlr which is not applicable for general purposes the developed hysteretic model consists of a cyclic hardening skeleton segment an unloading segment and a reloading segment a direct link is established between its parameters and vlr via regressive analysis this generalized model can comprehensively account for with desirable prediction accuracy the influence of pitting induced volume loss stress concentration

addition to in service high cycle low stress dynamic loads such as waves ocean currents ice pressure etc some marine structures e g platforms are supposed to withstand extreme low cycle high stress dynamic excitations such as earthquakes during their service period wang et al 2006 when the volume loss stress concentration and eccentricity caused by corrosion are combined with large amplitude strain reversals the damage development in marine structures will be accelerated which could affect their dynamic performance significantly apostolopoulos and matikas 2018 in contrast to uniform corrosion pitting corrosion is more crucial for assessing the performance of marine structures when they are confronted with large dynamic excitations however from the perspective of computational efficiency or stability it is not numerically feasible to simulate corrosion pits locally in structure level analysis therefore it is practically useful to rationally incorporate the effect of pitting corrosion into a generalized hysteretic model for corroded steel components the effect of uniform corrosion on the mechanical behaviour of a steel component can be manifested in terms of the section loss qin et al 2016 the resulting damage is evenly distributed on the surface of the concerned component if a sufficient section allowance is maintained the consequences of such damage can be controlled in contrast the pitting induced stress concentration and eccentricity as well as section loss can result in higher stresses in steel components when subjected to cyclic loadings jia et al 2019 as the pitting induced damage develops both the strength and deformability of steel can be affected and the yield plateau tends to decrease gradually yao et al 2018 even if the section loss caused by pitting corrosion is not substantial the failure mode of steel components might be altered unexpectedly strain reversals can cause cyclic strain hardening in steel components but at the cost of reduced yield plateau and elongation ma et al 2019 however significant strength degradation can be observed if the damage caused by pitting corrosion is severe and occurs in combination with large amplitude strain reversals uniform corrosion can be described in terms of just the corrosive depth whereas the description of corrosion pits involves more parameters such as the shape diameter depth and distribution pattern paik et al 2004 therefore it is not acceptable to assess pitting induced damage by a single specific parameter as a compromise three comprehensive corrosion indicators namely degree of pitting dop corrosion volume loss ratio vlr and section loss ratio slr are used wang et al 2014 as dop is the ratio of the corroded surface area to the overall area it is suitable for the characterization of damage on the surface of a uniformly corroded steel plate both vlr and slr can relate some corrosive parameters to the specimen configuration they can be used to describe the damage caused by either pitting corrosion or uniform corrosion wang 2008 paik et al 2003 unlike slr vlr can reflect the three dimensional effect of pitting damage in a corroded steel plate huang et al 2010 jiang and soares 2012 in the case of pitting corroded specimens under reversed cyclic loading as considered here vlr seems to be more appropriate strain hardening models play an important role in the characterization of the hysteretic performance of steel under cyclic loading they consist of mainly three types isotropic kinematic and combined strain hardening models in an isotropic hardening model the subsequent yield surfaces are assumed to vary only in size with respect to the initial yield surface with a fixed central point zaverl and lee 1978 structured an isotropic hardening model with an internal variable in terms of the accumulated plastic strain this model can be numerically implemented easily with only a few parameters however a significant deviation was observed in the simulation of the response of the reloading segment of steel to improve the prediction accuracy of the model cailletaud and chaboche 1980 proposed a nonlinear isotropic nliso hardening model based on voce s hardening law when subjected to reversed cyclic loadings steel exhibits the well known bauschinger effect in the reloading segment obviously such an effect is associated with the translation of the yield surface and cannot be rationally described by an isotropic hardening model a kinematic hardening model is capable of describing the translation phenomenon of the yield surface in the stress space in which the sizes of all the initial and subsequent yield surfaces are constant during the translation prager 1956 the nonlinear kinematic hardening model developed by chaboche 1986 1991 assumes that the overall elasticity range is a constant this means that an increase in the stress level in one direction due to strain hardening will result in an equal decrease in the yield stress in its opposite direction generally the strain hardening of any material involves variations in both the size and translation of the yield surface the combined hardening models seem to be more promising although they are computationally inefficient romashchenko et al 1999 their advantages have been demonstrated in the simulation of steel plates subjected to strain reversals the type of plastic formation has been found to have a significant effect on the strength and stiffness tekgoz and garbatov 2020 to obtain an insight into the coupled damage induced by corrosion especially in the case of pitting corrosion as well as the low fatigue large amplitude hysteresis on the mechanical performance of marine steel a generalized hysteretic constitutive model is developed based on the results of the reversed cyclic test conducted previously on the commonly used d36 steel where different corrosion scenarios and loading schemes are considered as corrosion in offshore platforms develops mostly on the outer surface of the steel components the developed generalized hysteretic model is expected to be able to comprehensively address pitting induced volume loss stress concentration and eccentricity first three hardening models namely nliso isotropic model chaboche kinematic model and the combined model in abaqus abaqus standard user s manuals v6 9 2009 are studied using parameters calibrated with the test data to check their applicability in describing the hysteretic behaviour of corroded steel components generalized hysteretic model which consists of a cyclic hardening skeleton segment an unloading segment and a reloading segment is developed and the link between all the characteristic parameters and the corrosion indicator i e vlr is explicitly clarified based on the test data 2 three typical strain hardening models 2 1 outlines of previous reversed cyclic tests the configuration of the specimens tested previously ma et al 2019 jia et al 2019 consist of the test part transition part and clamped part see fig 1 the claimed yield strength σ y ultimate strength σ u and elongation δ provided by wuyang iron and steel co ltd were 430 mpa 553 mpa and 26 respectively the actual tested yield strength and tensile strength were 414 mpa and 550 mpa respectively corrosion was generated in the specimens by using the accelerated electrochemical corrosion method considering both the typical range of diameters of the corrosion pits in the splash zone of steel offshore platforms as well as the dimensions of the specimens four nominal diameters 8 mm 9 mm 10 mm and 11 mm were used to prepare the specimens all the pitting corroded specimens had corrosion pits located on a single side to address the corrosion development in the steel components of offshore platforms the corrosive depths of all the specimens were required to be not greater than one half of the thickness daidola et al 1997 four target volume loss ratios vlrs namely vlr 1 6 3 2 4 8 and 6 4 corresponding to corrosion degrees ranging from slight to severe were considered for the pitting corroded specimens as listed in table 1 the target vlrs were used to evaluate the target corrosive amount and the time required for accelerated electrochemical corrosion by using faraday s law the corresponding actual vlrs measured using the archimedes method after the accelerated corrosion process were 1 62 3 23 4 98 and 6 75 respectively ma et al 2019 for the purpose of comparison two specimens with uniform corrosion were also prepared with target vlrs of 4 8 and 16 with measured vlrs of 5 3 and 15 2 respectively after accelerated corrosion the non corroded parts of all the specimens were protected from corrosion the measured residual width d r and residual thickness w r of the uniformly corroded specimens as well as the depth h and diameter d of the pitting corroded specimens are also listed in table 1 all the specimens were tested using instron 8801 material testing machine ma et al 2019 jia et al 2019 which has a maximum load range of 100 kn the room temperature was controlled within the range of 20 c to 25 c satisfying the test conditions specified by the american society for testing materials astm 1998 considering that the strain rate of earthquake action varies between 2 5 10 4 s and 1 0 10 1 s the strain rate used in the cyclic test was 5 10 2 s this was also based on the considerations of large strain amplitude around 3 5 and possible damage in the testing machine due to failure of the tested specimens if the strain rate is high to capture the peak points and inflexion points of the hysteresis loops during strain reversals more accurately the sampling frequency of the strains was set as 50 hz with a 12 5 mm length extensometer having a maximum range of 3 5 if the strain range of the extensometer is exceeded the relative displacement recorded by the sensors located at the ends of the testing machine is used to minimise the deviation between the testing machine and the axes of the tested specimens the upper and lower clamping devices were calibrated and the clamped part of the specimens were adjusted simultaneously the machining errors of the specimens were also controlled during the preparation to reflect the randomness in earthquake excitations six loading schemes were applied to the tested specimens see fig 2 fig 3 shows the hysteretic response curves of specimens uc 4 8 and pc 4 8 which had the same target vlrs as well as an intact specimen under the cl 3 loading program it can be observed that uniform corrosion does not have a significant influence on the stress vs strain response of uc 4 8 whereas the influence of pitting corrosion on the stress vs strain response of pc 4 8 is obvious under the same strain amplitude the peak stresses of pc 4 8 were lower approximately 13 than those of uc 4 8 the unloading segments of the three specimens agreed well with each other the differences were mainly found in the reloading and cyclic hardening skeleton segments to verify the accuracy of a hysteretic model of concern the test data are compared with the results from finite element analysis fea using abaqus abaqus standard user s manuals v6 9 2009 with the calibrated material parameters by the test data in the feas of all the specimens the c3d8r element is used with poisson s ratio μ taken as 0 30 in the numerical modelling the lower end of all the specimens is fixed and the upper end is free 2 2 results using nliso isotropic hardening model fig 4 illustrates the basic features of the isotropic and kinematic strain hardening models as discussed previously an isotropic hardening model see fig 4 a is described mainly by the development of the peak stresses σ i t and σ i c with the plastic strain amplitude of ε c i pl ε t i pl at each cycle from σ 1 t to σ n t while the central point is always positioned at the origin in a kinematic hardening model the stress σ j and plastic strain ε j pl are determined during the translation of the yield surface during each cycle with a constant strain range of δ ε see fig 4 b the isotropic hardening behaviour using the nliso model is described by the evolution of the yield surface size σ i 0 of the ith cycle with the corresponding plastic strain of ε i pl as follows chaboche 1986 1 σ i 0 σ i t σ i c 2 σ 0 q 1 exp b ε i pl where σ 0 is the yield stress at zero plastic strain it can be taken as the yield strength of intact steel σ y or corroded steel σ y σ i t is the peak tensile stress corresponding to the plastic tensile strain of the ith cycle ε t i p l σ i c is the peak compressive stress corresponding to the plastic compressive strain of the ith cycle ε c i p l q is the maximum change rate of the yield surface size and b is the change rate of the yield surface size in the development of the ith cycle plastic strain of ε i pl based on the test data ε i pl is determined by the ith cycle plastic strain range of δ ε i pl i e 2 ε i pl 1 2 4 i 3 δ ε i pl 1 2 4 i 3 ε t i pl ε c i pl 1 2 4 i 3 δ ε 2 σ i t e where e is the elasticity modulus of a corroded steel specimen as considered herein for the pitting corroded specimens e was measured as 196 68 gpa 186 63 gpa 165 18 gpa and 150 69 gpa for pc 1 6 pc 3 2 pc 4 8 and pc 6 4 respectively ma et al 2019 the elasticity modulus of the uniformly corroded specimens uc 4 8 and uc 16 e was tested as 210 0 gpa jia et al 2019 fig 5 a shows the results predicted by the nliso model for pc 1 6 under the cl 3 loading program where the material parameters are calibrated as σ 0 405 mpa q 131 mpa and b 2 5 using the test data it can be seen that the nliso strain hardening model can accurately predict the peak stresses of all the hysteresis loops as it is not capable of describing the bauschinger effect a large error can be observed in the reloading segment see red circle in fig 5 a 2 3 results using chaboche kinematic hardening model if the dependency between temperature and field variables is ignored in the chaboche model chaboche 1986 the back stresses associated with the translation of yield surfaces are determined by 3 α k c k γ k 1 exp γ k ε j pl α k 1 exp γ k ε j pl where α k is the kth back stress k 1 2 p p is the number of back stresses included α k 1 is the first data point of the kth back stress and c k and γ k are the material parameters calibrated using cyclic test data the translation of the yield surfaces is related to the accumulation of the back stresses chaboche 1986 included α j i e 4 α j k 1 p α k the parameters α k 1 c k and γ k k 1 2 p are calibrated by equating eq 4 with the stress at any intermediate point α j in the reloading hardening segment i e 5 α j σ j σ s σ j σ 1 σ m 2 where σ s is the average stress of the first data point σ y and last data point σ m see fig 4 b m is the number of data points between the first data point σ 1 and last data point σ m σ 1 can be taken as the stress level at the intersection point between the unloading segment and reloading segment during a stable strain cycle about one half of the total strain cycles σ m can be taken as the stress level at the intersection point between the reloading segment and the skeleton segment the corresponding plastic strain ε j pl is updated by 6 ε j p l ε j σ j e ε 0 p l where ε j is the strain at point j and ε 0 pl is the plastic strain of the first data point at a stable strain cycle fig 5 b shows the results predicted by the chaboche model for pc 1 6 with the cl 3 loading program where the parameters are p 4 c 1 c 4 7948 mpa 5310 mpa 3005 mpa and 1200 mpa and γ 1 γ 4 151 96 456 and 48 compared with the nliso model the reloading segment predicted by the chaboche model is closer to the tested data however the peak stresses are overestimated see the red circle in fig 5 b 2 4 results using combined hardening model as discussed above neither the nliso isotropic model nor the chaboche kinematic model can provide accurate predictions about the hysteretic response of pitting corroded steel subjected to strain reversals is it possible to obtain more accurate predictions by using the combined hardening model with the parameters determined above for each part separately the parameters calibrated for eqs 1 and 3 of the nliso isotropic and chaboche kinematic models are directly adopted to generate the predictions of the combined hardening model as shown in fig 5 c a slight improvement in the prediction accuracy can be observed however the peak response is still unacceptably overestimated this is attributed to the inconsistent calibration of the material parameters for the reloading segment and peak response points to eliminate the inconsistency the parameters were adjusted based on the sensitivity analysis based on the parametric analysis conducted previously q was found to have less influence on the shape of the yield surface however an increase in q could result in an exponential increase in the size of the yield surface the unloading segment of the hysteretic response curves was observed to be sensitive to the parameter b a smaller value of b implies a faster unloading rate the parameters of the chaboche model i e c 1 c 4 and γ 1 γ 4 are correlated more or less with each other the parameters c 1 c 4 significantly affect the peak stresses of the hysteretic curves a decrease in γ 1 γ 4 can cause an increase in the slopes of the unloading and reloading segments the ratios of c k γ k k 1 2 3 4 are closely related to the shape of the yield surface according to these observations and the predicted response shown in fig 5 c the parameters were calibrated as q 10 mpa b 1 0 c 1 c 4 5000 mpa 4500 mpa 2500 mpa and 800 mpa and γ 1 γ 4 140 90 400 and 33 as shown in fig 6 a desirable agreement is achieved by the combined hardening model with the adjusted parameters from the perspective of either the size or the shape of the yield surface fig 7 further illustrates the relative errors e r x fea x test x test x fea and x test are the results of fea and the test respectively of the peak tensile stresses σ i t and yield surface sizes σ i 0 of pc 1 6 under the cl 3 loading programs most of the errors are less than 10 indicating the effectiveness of the model 3 parametrized combined hardening model for different corrosion scenarios 3 1 different vlrs for pitting corrosion as shown in fig 8 the strength and stiffness degradation of steel becomes significant as the damage induced by pitting corrosion develops the model parameters calibrated by the data of specimen pc 1 6 are not applicable for other corrosion cases table 2 lists the adjusted parameters of all pitting corrosion cases for the combined hardening model based on the corresponding test data with the corrosion related parameters a desirable agreement between the test data and fea simulations can be reached as shown in fig 9 figs 10 and 11 illustrate the relative errors of the results from the test and fea using the combined model for different target vlrs under the cl 3 loading scheme for the peak stress σ i t or yield surface size σ i 0 at each strain cycle the errors are globally acceptable although some errors are obvious at the initial small amplitude stage of the strain reversals as the strain amplitude becomes larger the predictions from the fea tend to be closer to the test data the errors do not exhibit a clear relation with vlr indicating the rationality of the combined hardening model with the adjusted parameters however owing to the inter related parameters it is difficult to explicitly clarify the relationship between the adjusted parameters and vlr 3 2 different corrosion types as shown in figs 3 and 8 the hysteretic response of the corroded specimens is closely related to both the vlr and corrosion type therefore the parameters calibrated by the test data are also related to both the vlr and corrosion type figs 12 and 13 show the fea results of pc 4 8 and uc 4 8 using the combined model with the parameters calibrated using the test data of uc 4 8 and pc 4 8 respectively the uc 4 8 based parameters are calibrated as σ 0 407 mpa q 97 mpa b 1 1 c 1 c 4 11 198 mpa 3000 mpa 2277 mpa and 855 mpa and γ 1 γ 4 1500 250 50 and 3 4 the pc 4 8 based calibrated parameters are selected from table 2 as shown in fig 12 using the parameters calibrated based on the test data of uc 4 8 can result in an obviously overestimated prediction of the peak stresses and reloading stiffness in the initial stage therefore the energy dissipation ability of pc 4 8 is amplified if uc 4 8 is simulated with the parameters calibrated using pc 4 8 the peak stresses and reloading stiffness in the later stage are significantly underestimated the differences in the simulations mainly lie in the corrosion induced load eccentricity however such inconsistent treatment is physically unacceptable 4 three segment generalized hysteretic model 4 1 regressive parameters associated with the cyclic hardening skeleton segment as mentioned previously the combined model is not practically useful for general applications it might be feasible to describe the hysteretic curves of corroded steel by establishing a direct link between a corrosion indicator e g vlr and the three constituent segments namely skeleton unloading and reloading segments of the hysteresis loops as observed from the test data see fig 9 the unloading segment of the hysteresis loops is nearly parallel to the elastic segment i e no obvious stiffness degradation takes place during the unloading process therefore the description of the three segment generalized model is focussed on the cyclic hardening skeleton segment and reloading segment the skeleton curves of the specimens were generated by connecting the peak points of the hysteresis loops as shown in fig 14 it can be clearly observed that even under cyclic loading the specimens still exhibit a reduced yield plateau in the forward loading direction the so called cyclic strain hardening is also distinct compared with the stress vs strain curve obtained from the monotonic tension test as the degree of corrosion increases either for uniform corrosion or for pitting corrosion the yield strength and cyclic hardening tend to decrease as listed in table 3 in the case of pitting corrosion a decrease of 17 2 in the yield stress σ y is observed as vlr increases up to 6 4 the stresses of uc 4 8 and pc 4 8 which have the same target vlr exhibit a relative difference of 10 3 the ultimate strengths σ u listed in table 3 were obtained by performing a monotonic tension test until failure when specified strain reversals were accomplished the ultimate strengths also decreased as the vlr increased it should be noted that the ultimate strength of pc 6 4 is not available due to premature failure as a result of severe corrosion according to the above observations the skeleton curves of the specimens can be characterized by a linearly elastic segment a yield plateau in the forward direction and a cyclic hardening segment as illustrated in fig 15 the linearly elastic segment starts from the origin ε 0 σ 0 0 0 the elasticity modulus e and yield strength σ y of the pitting corroded specimens can be obtained from the test data i e 7 e e 0 9 3 vlr 8 σ y β σ y 12 1 vlr where e 0 is the elasticity modulus of intact steel e 0 211 5 gpa for the marine steel used and σ y is the yield strength of intact steel obtained from the standard coupon test here σ y 414 mpa and β is the cyclic hardening ratio at the yielding point according to table 3 β 423 414 1 024 as shown in figs 16 and 17 eqs 7 and 8 can have coefficients of determination of goodness of fit r 2 close to unity with a known σ y the yield strain ε y is determined by 9 ε y σ y e as for the cyclic hardening segment the following expression suggested by zhou 1989 can be used to describe the post yielding stress development 10 σ p t c a t c r t c exp k t c ε p t c where σ p t c and are ε p t c the stress and strain on the skeleton curve respectively the superscripts t and c denote tension and compression respectively a t c r t c and k t c are the coefficients obtained from the test data in the tension t and compression parts c as follows a t 7 2 vlr 571 0 11a a c 20 7 vlr 723 0 r t 0 8 vl r 2 4 6 vlr 222 7 11b r c 3 4 vl r 2 19 0 vlr 288 5 k t 3 6 vlr 63 5 11c k c 0 3 vl r 2 3 6 vlr 23 2 fig 18 shows the desirable goodness of fit for all coefficients with these coefficients the strain at the end of the yielding plateau ε k can be determined by eqs 8 and 10 as shown in fig 19 the three segment skeleton curves generated by eqs 7 11 agree more desirably with the test data than with those generated by the combined model that was discussed previously especially in the yielding and cyclic hardening segments using the combined model can result in overestimated predictions about the stress levels in these two segments 4 2 regressive parameters associated reloading segment the reloading segment at the ith cycle of the strain reversals starts from an end point of the unloading segment ε 0 i t c σ 0 i t c and terminates at a peak point ε p i t c σ p i t c on the skeleton segment discussed above as illustrated in fig 20 in the case of the pitting corroded marine steel which is discussed here the expression proposed by shi et al 2011 is modified as follows to determine the stress level σ at any strain ε for the reloading segment 12 σ σ 0 i t c e e η e k i t c η ε ε 0 i t c where e k i t c is the secant stiffness of the straight line connecting the starting point ε 0 i t c σ 0 i t c and the end point ε p i t c σ p i t c see fig 20 and η is a scale factor that controls the fullness of the hysteresis loops it is evaluated based on the regressive analysis

the two intermediate stresses d 1 and d 2 according to the generalized hysteretic model determined by eqs 7 14 fig 21 provides a flowchart for generating the complete hysteresis loops of pitting corroded marine steel under strain reversals fig 22 shows a comparison between the recorded and simulated hysteretic responses of four pitting corroded specimens under the cl 3 loading scheme the generalized hysteretic model can provide desirable simulations of the skeleton segment unloading segment and most parts of the reloading segment a slightly underestimated softening is observed in the middle part of the reloading segment figs 23 and 24 illustrate the relative errors e r of the results from the test and fea using the generalized hysteretic model for four target vlrs i e vlr 1 6 3 2 4 8 and 6 4 under the cl 3 loading scheme although relatively large prediction errors occur during a few small amplitude strain reversals especially for the yield surface size σ i 0 most of the errors in the peak stresses σ i t and yield surface sizes are less than 5 the generalized model can be applied for engineering practice with some rationally acceptable conservation 5 conclusions based on the results of a reversed cyclic test that was conducted previously on d36 marine structural steel a generalized hysteretic material model was developed to account for the effect of different pitting corrosion scenarios on the hysteretic response of corroded steel as a result the following observations were made 1 the hysteresis loops of the corroded steel specimens are significantly affected by both the corrosion degree and corrosion type specifically in contrast with uniform corrosion the eccentricity induced by pitting corrosion has a more adverse effect on the reloading segment and cyclic strain hardening as a result of cyclic hardening there is an increase in the yield strength and ultimate strength of marine steel a reduced yielding plateau compared with the intact specimen still exists in the corroded specimens 2 with the parameters calibrated using the test data the nliso isotropic hardening model could reliably predict the peak stresses of the hysteresis loops of the pitting corroded specimens however due to the incapability of the nliso model in the characterisation of the bauschinger effect a significant error could be observed in the reloading segment comparatively the reloading segment simulated by the chaboche kinematic hardening model agrees well with the test data however it may cause overestimated peak stresses 3 direct incorporation of the parameters of the nliso and chaboche models into the combined hardening model could improve the prediction accuracy slightly a more desirable agreement could be achieved from the perspective of either the size or the shape of the yield surface by the combined model with the parameters calibrated based on the sensitivity analysis these parameters can be adjusted to account for the damage caused by different corrosion cases however it is difficult to explicitly clarify the relationship between the adjusted parameters and the vlr 4 the generalized hysteretic model developed for pitting corroded steel consists of three segments a cyclic hardening skeleton segment an unloading segment and a reloading segment the parameters of all the segments were determined using regressive analysis and were explicitly related to the vlr the generalized model could comprehensively account for with desirable prediction accuracy the influence of pitting induced volume loss stress concentration and eccentricity on the hysteretic behaviour of marine steel it can be applied to engineering practice with rational conservation 5 the temperature effect that can affect the performance of corroded marine steel was not addressed in this study the low temperature brittleness of steel may cause premature rupture under strain reversals for safety reasons the corrosion temperature coupling effect on the hysteretic behaviour of marine steel needs to be identified in future investigations credit authorship contribution statement yang yang methodology supervision writing original revision writing
