2950,measurement of hydraulic parameters which are very important in soil water and environmental studies is difficult time consuming and expensive therefore the present study aimed to predict near saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity kψ of calcareous soils by i developing stepwise multiple linear regression smlr based pedotransfer functions ptfs using basic soil properties ii using partial least square regression plsr based method and spectral reflectance data in the visible and near infrared vis nir range plsr spectra and iii developing smlr based functions that combine or not basic soil properties and effective vis nir spectral reflectance bands spectro pedotransfer functions sptfs and spectrotransfer functions stfs hydraulic conductivity was determined in the field from water infiltration measurements with a tension disk infiltrometer at 15 10 5 and 0 cm tensions at 102 locations across calcareous soils of the fars province iran the spectral reflectance of soil samples taken at the same location was in the range of vis nir 400 2500 nm while basic soil properties included particle size distribution and its related parameters ph electrical conductivity soluble sodium potassium calcium and magnesium sodium adsorption ratio soil organic matter content som calcium carbonate equivalent cce aggregates mean weight diameter and bulk density the developed ptfs showed relatively acceptable performance validation determination coefficient r2 values of 0 55 0 52 0 56 and 0 63 for k 15 k 10 k 5 and k 0 predictions respectively the plsr spectra performed poorer showing validation r2 values of 0 39 0 47 0 40 and 0 48 for predicting k 15 k 10 k 5 and k 0 respectively yet the plsr spectra predicted cce and som contents excellently r2 0 80 and residual prediction deviation rpd 2 5 for both calibration and validation datasets and clay relatively well but not ph the effective spectral reflectance bands mostly substitute with som and cce were very useful as input variables to predict k 5 and k 0 when coupled with basic soil properties resulting in sptfs on the other hand to predict k 15 and k 10 once any soil properties were added to smlr models the effective spectral reflectance bands were disappeared and consequently stfs were developed overall we concluded that the accuracy of the studied approaches to predict kψ were ranked as ptf plsr spectra stf for predicting k 15 and k 10 and ptf sptf plsr spectra for predicting k 5 and k 0 keywords basic soil properties effective spectral reflectance bands partial least square regression spectro pedotransfer functions spectrotransfer functions stepwise multiple linear regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity kψ is an important parameter for characterizing many aspects of unsaturated soil water flow such as rainfall infiltration and runoff irrigation migration of nutrients pesticides and contaminants aquifer recharge water balance and for designing and monitoring irrigation and drainage systems bagarello et al 2005 rahmati et al 2018 spatial temporal variations in kψ and thus the contribution of pores size classes to water flow is highly affected by soil structure mozaffari et al 2021a despite the importance of hydraulic properties in water behavior in soil their quantification and interpretation strongly depend on the methods used for their determination verbist et al 2013 furthermore their measurement in the field e g by tension disk infiltrometer double ring or guelph permeameter and in the laboratory e g with falling and constant head procedures is difficult time consuming and expensive vereecken et al 2010 therefore numerous attempts have been made to estimate saturated and to a much lesser extent unsaturated hydraulic conductivity indirectly by developing so called pedotranfer functions ptfs using basic soil properties including among others soil texture sand silt and clay contents bulk density bd fractal dimensions d soil organic matter content som calcium carbonate equivalent cce and mean weight diameter mwd with a suite of conventional methods like linear regression gamie and de smedt 2018 kotlar et al 2019a azadmard et al 2020 non linear regression mady and shein 2018 sihag et al 2019 regression tree jorda et al 2015 tóth et al 2015 sihag et al 2019 machine learning techniques mady and shein 2018 kotlar et al 2019a araya and ghezzehei 2019 and artificial neural networks moosavi and sepaskhah 2012a zhang and schaap 2017 sihag 2018 however the accuracy of kψ prediction by ptfs remains low primarily because soil structure which highly affects kψ is typically not accounted for van looy et al 2017 nowadays spectroscopy based techniques are used to predict different soil properties as they provide a rapid low preparation and less expensive analysis of soil samples compared with conventional laboratory analyzes hobley and prater 2019 both organic and inorganic soil components can be quantitatively assessed using visible vis 350 700 nm near infrared nir 700 2500 nm and mid infrared mir 2500 25 000 nm portions of the electromagnetic spectrum due to their sensitivity to spectra in vis nir mir or subsets thereof range estimation of soil properties is possible using specific spectral absorbance reflectance bands and their correlation with soil properties soriano disla et al 2014 as a result cce and gypsum khayamim et al 2015 ostovari et al 2018 clay and sand contents the ratio of silt clay som content exchangeable hydrogen and aluminum al cation exchange capacity cec percentage of base saturation pbs and al saturation pinheiro et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 ostovari et al 2018 mozaffari et al 2022a gravimetric and volumetric water contents and bulk density zhang et al 2017 soil erodibility factor ostovari et al 2018 and threshold velocity of wind erosion mina et al 2021 among others have been predicted with good and relatively good accuracy using spectroscopy based approaches it should be pointed out that prediction of a property using a spectroscopy based technique requires a separate calibration model of course providing a calibration model requires enough data through laboratory measurements and the developed models may need to be tested for new sets of data various statistical methods like stepwise multiple linear regression smlr liu et al 2018 mozaffari et al 2022a artificial neural networks anns nawar and mouazen 2017 principal component analysis pca nocita et al 2014 and partial least square regression plsr ostovari et al 2018 have been used to analyze the spectral data and predict different soil properties the plsr currently is the most common calibration method used for predicting soil properties from spectral data mainly due to its robustness the plsr can cope with data containing large numbers of predictor variables like hyperspectral data in the vis nir range that are highly repetitive and correlated stenberg 2010 askari et al 2015 khayamim et al 2015 regarding the capability of spectroscopy based methods to predict soil water related properties several studies focused on the estimation of soil moisture content and its related parameters janik et al 2007 tranter et al 2008 babaeian et al 2016 marakkala manage et al 2018 only a few studies used spectral reflectance data to estimate soil hydraulic conductivity for example cohen et al 2007 in southeastern usa florida used spectral reflectance data to predict saturated hydraulic conductivity k 0 with r2 of 0 477 for the calibration dataset babaeian et al 2015 in northwest of iran predicted log transformed k 0 by providing a spectrotransfer function stf with an r2 value of 0 58 and a root mean squared residual of 0 619 ln cm d 1 for a validation dataset using a full spectrum of wavelengths from 350 to 2500 nm xu et al 2017 in southwestern china showed that including soil spectral reflectance data as additional inputs with basic soil properties can improve the performance of k 0 prediction to the best of our knowledge vis nir spectroscopy has never been used to predict the kψ at different tensions this study aimed to predict near saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity kψ of calcareous soils using i basic soil properties by applying the smlr method for developing ptfs ii soil spectral reflectance data in the vis nir range by applying the plsr method plsr spectra and iii combination of basic soil properties and effective vis nir spectral reflectance bands by applying the smlr method for developing spectro pedotransfer functions sptfs it was hypothesized that kψ is strongly related to soil structure and pores size distribution and vis nir spectroscopy data depend on basic soil attributes such as particle size distribution psd parameters e g sand silt and clay contents som content and cce which affecting soil structure and pores size distribution therefore prediction of kψ could be useful by applying vis nir spectroscopy based information and substituting the basic physico chemical properties by the vis nir spectra in ptfs in order to decrease consumption of chemicals and save time and costs 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area and experimental setup the study was conducted in the fars province located in the south and southwest of iran between 50 30 55 38 e and 27 03 31 42 n encompassing an area of 132 000 km2 it has an arid and semi arid climate with mean annual precipitation ranging from 50 to 1000 mm mpb 1994 its elevation varies from nearly 500 to 4000 m above the mean sea level in the southern and northern parts respectively khormali and abtahi 2003 according to banaei 1998 the fars province experiences xeric ustic and aridic soil moisture regimes along with mesic thermic and hyperthermic soil temperature regimes the soils of the study area are calcareous and relatively calcareous ostovari et al 2021 ostovari et al 2022 formed from soluble dolomite and calcite limestone e g the soil cce contents were in the range of 12 5 to 70 in the studied soils soil physical chemical and hydraulic properties were measured at 102 locations covering the most relevant soil types and land uses in the area according to soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 the sampled soils were mainly classified as inceptisols 71 soils entisols 13 soils and aridisols 18 soils which comprise nearly 69 6 12 7 and 17 7 of the studied soils respectively khormali and abtahi 2003 natural resources and forestry organization of fars province 2010 furthermore to ensure a wide range of variability and to cover various land uses the soil samples were collected and measurements were made on croplands under wheat barley corn and rice on fallow lands pastures and woodlands oak forests at each of the 102 selected locations which were randomly selected infiltration measurements were made with a tension disk infiltrometer and intact core using stainless rings and composite 2 kg of soil from 0 to 20 cm depth soil samples were taken 2 2 physical and chemical analysis of the soils the composite soil samples were air dried in the laboratory grounded and passed through a 2 mm sieve table 1 lists the soil physical and chemical properties that were determined and the standard methods used more specifically to determine psd the mass fractions of the particles smaller than 0 05 mm diameter were measured using the hydrometer method by determining the density of suspension at 2 5 and 10 min and 1 3 6 and 24 h to measure the mass fractions of sand sieves with mesh sizes of 1000 500 150 and 50 μm were used gee and bauder 1986 mozaffari et al 2022b in addition some indices including sodium adsorption ratio sar geometric mean of particle size diameter dg geometric standard deviation of particle size diameter σg and fractal dimension of primary particles d were calculated the sar meq0 5 l 0 5 was calculated as 1 sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where na ca2 and mg2 are soluble sodium calcium and magnesium meq l 1 respectively the dg l and σg l was obtained from the psd curve shirazi and boersma 1984 2 d g exp a a 0 01 i 1 m f i ln d i 3 σ g exp b b 2 0 01 i 1 m f i ln d i 2 a 2 where the multiplier 0 01 is used to convert percent frequencies into fraction m is the number of soil separate groups e g sand silt clay fi is the percent of total soil mass having diameters equal to or less than d i diameter and d i is the mean diameter l of each soil separate groups the d was calculated based on the following power equation using psd data tyler and wheatcraft 1992 4 m x m t x x max 3 d where m x is the cumulative mass that is smaller than a specific size x m mt is the total soil sample mass m and x max is the maximum size of particles l to determine d there are linear and non linear regression methods in the present study the linear method was used if the natural logarithm ln is taken from eq 4 the following linear equation is obtained 5 ln m x m t 3 d ln x j 6 j 3 d ln x max where the parameter j is constant for each soil values of ln m x m t were plotted against ln x and d was calculated from the slope of the resultant line 2 3 infiltration experiments the infiltration experiments were conducted using a single disc tension infiltrometer with 20 cm diameter fig 1 during summer august and september 2019 in accordance with moosavi and sepaskhah 2012a 2012b and mozaffari et al 2021a at each experimental location plant residues were first removed from the soil surface without altering the surface soil structure in order to ensure an appropriate hydraulic contact between the disk membrane and the soil a thin nearly 5 mm thick contact layer of fine sand 0 1 0 25 mm diameter was placed between the disc membrane of the infiltrometer and the soil surface the infiltrometer was pushed slightly onto the sand layer after filling the device reservoir with fresh water ec 0 6 ds m 1 and sar 0 5 meq0 5 l 0 5 the maximum desired tension i e 15 cm in present study was set by the air tower and mariotte tube tension disc operating instruction 2008 after setting up the tension infiltration tests were carried out at successive applied tensions of 15 10 5 and 0 cm at each experimental location at each of the applied tensions after moistening the sand layer nearly 30 s water infiltration into the soil was manually recorded at time intervals of 15 s for the first 300 s and then every 60 s until steady state conditions were met conditions were considered as steady state when at least five successive readings of the infiltrated flow rate became similar angulo jaramillo et al 2000 2 4 determination of near saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity kψ to determine the kψ the method proposed by ankeny et al 1991 was used soil hydraulic properties were determined from the infiltration data using the analytical solution of the variably saturated water flow equation presented by wooding 1968 gardner 1958 assumed that kψ varies exponentially with tension ψ eq 7 when water infiltrates into the soil from a circular source with a constant tension at the soil surface wooding 1968 simunek et al 1998 7 k ψ k 0 exp α ψ where k 0 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t α is the sorptive number l 1 which is equal to the inverse of macroscopic capillary length λ l white and sully 1987 the analytical solution derived by wooding 1968 reads as 8 q ψ π r 2 k ψ 4 π r 2 k ψ π r α π r 2 k ψ 1 4 π r α where qψ and r are the volume of water entering the soil per unit time at steady state conditions at tension ψ l3 t 1 and the radius of the infiltrometer disc l respectively according to ankeny et al 1991 by using wooding s solution for unsaturated conditions steady state fluxes were obtained at different tensions e g ψi and ψi 1 replacing kψ by eq 7 and by substituting ψi and ψi 1 in the combined equation yields two equations which solving them simultaneously resulted in the following equations ankeny et al 1991 9 k ψ i 1 q ψ i π r 2 2 δ ψ r 1 q ψ i 1 q ψ i 1 q ψ i 1 q ψ i 10 k ψ i 2 q ψ i 1 k ψ i 1 q ψ i three equations were solved simultaneously using ψ values of 0 and 5 5 and 10 and 10 and 15 cm ankeny et al 1991 defined the best estimate of kψ as the arithmetic mean of the available estimates where k ψ i is calculated from the ψi ψi 1 rate pair k ψ i k ψ i 1 k ψ i 2 detailed information can be seen in moosavi and sepaskhah 2012a 2012b mozaffari et al 2021a 2 5 spectral vis nir measurements nearly 25 g of 2 mm sieved air dried and thoroughly mixed soil samples were placed in a container with 4 cm diameter and then lighted in a camera obscure via a 50 w halogen lamp with an incident angle of 45 and a distance of nearly 50 cm from the sample surface the nirs xds model apparatus metrohm company switzerland was used to collect spectral data of the soil samples in vis nir 400 2500 nm range with 0 5 nm spectral resolution it should be noted that in order to reduce the complexity the spectra with 1 nm increment were considered for developing models the mentioned apparatus measured the absorbance a of soil samples the absorbance data were converted to reflectance r using a 1 10 a relation for each soil sample the average of three recorded spectra was considered fig 2 provides the representative reflectance spectral data for all of soil samples n 102 the spectral absorbance obtained at regions of 400 to 417 nm and 2483 to 2500 nm were removed in order to eliminate noises various pre processing techniques including savitzky golay derivative savitzky and golay 1964 with five smoothing points and a zero order polynomial approximation mouazen et al 2005 were used to improve the quality of the spectral data and predictions 2 6 models development the 102 soil samples were shuffled kotlar et al 2019b using the matlab software package mathworks makers of matlab and simulink 2021 before developing the models the shuffled data were imported to the unscrambler x v 9 7 software package camo technologies inc 2013 and randomly divided into the calibration and validation datasets containing nearly 75 76 samples and 25 26 samples respectively the calibration dataset was used to develop the ptfs stfs and sptfs and also plsr models in addition the t test was used to compare the mean values of dependent variables related to the selected calibration and validation datasets two regression methods were applied stepwise multiple linear regression smlr being still one of the most widely and standard methods van looy et al 2017 in ptfs development was used to develop ptfs but also stfs and sptfs a forward approach was used to select the significant predictor variables at the probability level of 5 the kψ at different tensions were selected as dependent variables and basic soil properties for developing ptfs effective spectral reflectance bands for developing stfs and combination of both basic soil properties and effective spectral reflectance bands for developing sptfs were selected as independent variables all analyzes were carried out in the statistica software package partial least squares regression plsr was used for calibrating soil reflectance data to individual soil parameters and using them to predict the selected basic physico chemical properties and kψ at different tensions mainly because of its superiority over traditional methods in dealing with high dimensional multicollinearity stenberg 2010 bilgili et al 2011 the plsr has been widely used in vis nir reflectance spectroscopy and is a method for relating two data matrices by a linear multivariate model bilgili et al 2011 in the present study for operating the plsr models to predict different soil properties the maximum number of latent variables lvs was considered as 20 the models were generated using unscrambler x v 9 7 software package it should be pointed out that the effective and important spectral reflectance bands rs which were related to the selected soil properties were recognized considering the plot of regression coefficient b versus wavelength of developed plsr model 2 7 models evaluation several statistical indices were used to evaluate the models performance including the normalized root mean square error nrmse the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns the residual prediction deviation rpd and the determination coefficient r2 11 nrmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n o 100 12 ns 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 13 rpd sd sep 14 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 where oi and pi are the observed and predicted values n is numbers of data sd is standard deviation of the observed values and sep is the standard error which is calculated as root mean square error of the prediction the nrmse is a measure of error between the observed and predicted values and varies between zero the highest accuracy and infinity the ns statistic is a measure of model efficiency and changes from one the highest accuracy to negative infinity ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 feng et al 2017 the rpd is a factor by which the prediction accuracy has been increased compared to the mean composition for all samples mouazen et al 2010 while r2 is a measure of model accuracy and change from 0 the lowest accuracy to 1 the highest accuracy table 2 shows the classification of the mentioned models performance criteria all statistics were calculated and curves were fitted in the excel version 2013 software package 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics and statistical analysis of soil properties table 3 shows the summary statistics and the normal distribution criteria of the studied soil properties the lowest and the highest coefficient of variations cv were related to d 2 1 and sar 277 respectively according to wilding 1985 k 15 k 10 k 0 ec na k ca2 mg2 sar som sand clay and dg fall in the high variability class cv 35 q 15 where denotes steady state conditions q 10 q 5 q 0 k 5 cce mwd silt and σg fall in the moderate variability class 15 cv 35 and ph d and bd fall in the low variability class 0 cv 15 the low variability of the latter variables is expected especially when considering that almost all samples 83 are from the soil textures silt loam and loam fig 3 and table 3 according to table 3 and the kolmogorov smirnov normality test the ec na k ca2 mg2 and sar were lognormally distributed in the studied soil samples the other studied properties followed a normal distribution table 4 shows the correlation coefficient r among the studied soil hydraulic and physico chemical properties the k 15 and k 10 were strongly correlated with psd attributes i e sand silt dg and σg and cce it can be seen that at higher tensions the variation in kψ is better explained by soil texture and psd than by parameters associated with soil structure on the other hand closer to saturation the soil structure related properties become better correlated to kψ so that k 5 and k 0 being significantly correlated with ph ln sar cce som and bd it is well known that high na concentrations reflected by high sar values can destroy soil structure due to large hydrated radius resulting in dispersion of soil particles tajik et al 2003 mozaffari et al 2021a mozaffari et al 2022c the ca2 that is represented by a high cce value and som act as binding agents for flocculation of mineral colloids thus promoting aggregation and enhancing aggregate stability vaezi et al 2010 ostovari et al 2016 mozaffari et al 2021b yang et al 2019 in the spindletop research farm of kentucky university lexington usa found that ln k 0 and ln k 1 was significantly correlated with clay and som content further they reported ln k 5 and ln k 10 to be significantly correlated with mwd kotlar et al 2019a showed that log k 10 was strongly correlated with psd components such as sand silt and clay contents in soil samples taken from different locations of denmark they observed that the effect of psd features on log k 0 decreased while the effect of structure related parameters bd and mwd increased which is in line with the results of the present study 3 2 developing ptfs to predict kψ using basic soil properties by smlr method according to t test analysis there was no significant difference between the mean values of the calibration and validation datasets of kψ at all studied tensions the ptfs developed by smlr method and their performance for predicting kψ using selected physical and chemical properties are summarized in table 5 in addition fig 4 illustrates the observed versus predicted values of kψ for both calibration and validation datasets the k 15 and k 10 pfts with dg σg silt cce and ln sar for k 10 as input variables provided relatively acceptable results based on the performance criteria they had r2 values of 0 55 and 0 52 nrmse values of 27 4 and 25 9 ns values of 0 52 and 0 47 and rpd values of 1 47 and 1 40 for the validation dataset wang et al 2017 and zhang and schaap 2019 also stated that the psd directly affects soil hydraulic conductivity at all tensions for both k 5 and k 0 predictions the σg silt cce and som positively and ln sar negatively appeared in the ptfs in addition ph and bd were effective factors with negative sign to predict k 0 although the values of ln na are significantly correlated with k 5 and k 0 table 4 the effect of ln sar was more obvious this can be due to the effects of ca2 and mg2 in the calculation of sar that may contribute to flocculation of the soil components and consequently better soil structure the r2 nrmse ns and rpd values of the validation dataset were 0 56 18 1 0 49 and 1 44 for predicting k 5 and 0 63 25 4 0 57 and 1 56 for predicting k 0 respectively based on the obtained nrmse values the developed ptfs for predicting k 15 k 10 and k 0 were classified as fair 20 nrmse 30 and for predicting k 5 as good 10 nrmse 20 according to r2 rpd classification viscarra rossel 2007 mouazen et al 2010 k 15 k 10 and k 5 were poorly predicted rpd 1 5 and r2 0 60 and k 0 moderately well rpd of 1 5 2 and r2 0 60 overall k 0 was predicted with higher accuracy than k 15 k 10 and k 5 the relatively moderate performance of kψ ptfs was expected given its very high variability even in similar soils and highly dependent to pores geometry van looy et al 2017 although the structure related parameters which were used in the present study i e cce ln sar som mwd ph and bd may have significant relationship with pores size distribution they cannot entirely reflect soil structure in fact the actual soil structure related parameters e g tortuosity amounts of macropores mesopores and micropores etc may be able to predict saturated and near saturated hydraulic conductivity accurately however their measurement may be difficult time consuming and expensive generally since hydraulic conductivity is a hardly measurable soil parameter which measurement is costly laborious and time consuming vereecken et al 2010 even a model that only moderately predicts this property can be very useful and valuable our results were in accordance with the findings of gamie and de smedt 2018 who reported that in comparison with soil properties associated with soil texture those parameters associated with soil structure were more correlated with k 0 in the western desert of egypt in contrast azadmard et al 2020 in northwestern iran found that their ptfs based on the multiple linear regression mlr using basic soil properties were not able to predict kψ accurately r2 values were 0 17 0 21 0 14 0 19 and 0 19 for prediction of k 15 k 10 k 5 k 2 and k 0 respectively due to the existence of non linear relationships among the soil physico chemical and hydraulic properties kotlar et al 2019a reported the smlr method to predict log k 0 and log k 10 with r2 values of 0 26 and 0 65 respectively generally according to the statistical measures in the present study the kψ at 15 10 5 and 0 cm tensions were predicted with relatively acceptable and reasonable accuracy the developed ptfs can be tested and used in other regions with similar soils 3 3 soil spectra analysis fig 5 shows the mean of reflectance spectra according to different groups of soil ph a texture b cce c som d soil type e and land use type f while table 6 lists the mean values of ph clay cce and som for different mentioned groups of soil samples as can be seen in fig 5a the reflectance spectra in vis nir range were not highly affected by different soil ph groups wan et al 2019 also did not report high differences of reflectance spectra in vis nir range according to 4 different groups of ph including 5 5 5 6 5 6 5 7 5 and 7 5 there was a larger increase in the mean of reflectance spectra for the silty clay in 400 1200 nm range and sandy loam in 1200 2500 nm range textures than that of the other soil textural classes the lowest mean of reflectance spectra was observed in the silt in 400 570 nm and 1200 2500 nm ranges and silty clay loam in 570 1200 nm range textures fig 5b in addition according to table 6 the lowest som content and the highest cce were observed in the sandy loam while the highest som were observed in the silty clay loam and the lowest cce in the silt these results are in line with the findings of santra et al 2009 conforti et al 2017 and ostovari et al 2018 the soil spectra also were classified based on three ranges of cce i e 10 30 30 50 and 50 70 and som content i e 0 1 1 2 and 2 4 according to fig 5c and 5d the lower cce and the higher som contents resulted in the lower reflectance spectra in soil due to the higher absorption of spectra in vis nir range the same results also have been reported by santra et al 2009 and xu et al 2018 fig 5e and f show the mean of reflectance spectra of the various soil types and land uses bold lines along with the minimum and the maximum of reflectance spectra for each soil type and land use dash lines as can be seen in fig 5e the mean of reflectance spectra in the aridisols is higher than that of the entisols and inceptisols across the full range of spectra the mean of som and clay contents were the lowest 1 05 and 11 7 respectively in the aridisols furthermore in comparison with aridisols and entisols the mean value of cce in the inseptisols was the lowest table 6 overall the aridisols were lighter than the entisols and inceptisols in the arid region of south and southwest of iran where aridisols dominate the very low plants cover due to high temperature low precipitation and the limited availability of fresh water result in a lower som content ostovari et al 2018 also reported that the mean of reflectance spectra of soil types shows the following order aridisols entisols inceptisols which matches with our observations regarding land use mean of reflectance spectra was ranked as pasture cropland woodland fig 5f the lowest reflectance spectra in the woodland can be explained by its higher clay and som contents and lower cce table 6 the opposite was observed in the pastures in addition almost all of the cropland and woodland were inceptisols viscarra rossel 2007 stated the ph psd caco3 and som are well known soil properties affecting the soil reflectance spectral bands across the full range of spectra which may vary with location soil type and land use higher cce and lower clay and som contents are associated with lighter colored soil resulting in higher reflections and lower absorptions of spectra 3 4 prediction of selected soil properties using spectral reflectance data in vis nir range by plsr method 3 4 1 ph clay cce and som table 7 shows the performance of plsr method using spectral reflectance data in vis nir range plsr spectra to predict ph clay cce and som contents fig 6 illustrates values of the observed versus plsr spectra predicted data for the calibration and the validation datasets along with plots of the regression coefficient b versus wavelength which enable to deduce the important and effective bands i e those correspond to high absolute values of b the plsr spectra was unable to predict ph values accurately with low values of r2 and rpd while predicted clay content with relatively well accuracy table 7 and fig 6a and c yet the effective bands for predicting ph were in the ranges of 420 700 nm and 1700 2480 nm and for predicting clay in the full range of spectra fig 6b and d conforti et al 2017 in acidic soils of calabria region southern italy predicted ph moderately well with r2 and rmse values of 0 70 and 0 15 using vis nir spectra and plsr method according to viscarra rossel et al 2006 intense fundamental molecular frequencies related to soil components occur in the mir 2500 25 000 nm region they stated that the mir region is more capable to predict soil ph with adjusted r2 r2 adj value of 0 75 than vis r2 adj 0 36 and nir r2 adj 0 54 ranges when plsr method was used in addition to this the low variability in ph of our soil samples could be another reason to explain the relatively poor results for predicting ph the absorption at 1416 1915 and 2212 nm wavelengths are dominantly related to water adsorbed to surface of clays gomez et al 2008 ostovari et al 2018 this is in line with fig 6d showing the effective spectral reflectance bands for predicting clay near to 1416 1915 and 2212 nm also hobley and prater 2019 in three states across germany reported that the region around 1910 and 2190 nm are effective bands to predict clay content furthermore our results support those of hermansen et al 2016 who reported that in agricultural fields of greenland denmark the most significant absorption bands for clay prediction occurred around 1412 1907 and 2208 nm they reported highly accurate prediction of clay with r2 value of 0 94 for both calibration and validation datasets the lower performance of the plsr spectra to predict clay content in our study in comparison with the mentioned studies may be due to low spatial variability of clay content in our study sites differences in the size of the study sites and differences in the applied laboratory measurement methods in addition according to khormali and abtahi 2003 the major clay mineral in the study area fars province are illite and chlorite with some evidences to form smectites in well drained alfisols somewhat poorly drained mollisols and calcixerepts with high precipitation they reported that the mean value of soil cation exchange capacity cec in the fars province is 43 cmol kg 1 the nature of the clay with their low cec in the soils in the study area point to a low negative charge at the clay particle low adsorption of bipolar water molecules and consequently low absorption of vis nir spectra by soil as can be seen in fig 2 the mean of reflectance spectra in the soil samples showed four significant absorption bands around 1416 1915 2212 and 2340 nm as mentioned gomez et al 2008 and ostovari et al 2018 confirmed that these absorption bands are mainly related to the overtone of oh stretches moisture adsorbed to surface of clay combination of oh stretches and hoh in water molecules trapped in the clay crystal lattice ohmetal band and oh stretch combinations and co3 groups in carbonate minerals respectively therefore clays with high cec and high capacity to absorb water molecules will absorb more spectra at wavelengths of 1416 1915 and 2212 nm and consequently prediction of the mentioned clays by vis nir spectra can be accompanied with high accuracy in contrast the plsr spectra provided very good estimations of cce and som contents table 7 and fig 6e and g with the validation dataset r2 nrmse ns and rpd values of 0 86 9 86 0 85 and 2 62 for cce and 0 88 19 8 0 86 and 2 77 for som predictions respectively the prediction of cce was excellent in terms of nrmse 10 r2 0 80 and rpd 2 5 and good in terms of ns 0 8 ns 0 9 likewise the prediction of som was excellent according to rpd and r2 and good according to nrmse 10 nrmse 20 and ns classification guidelines the plsr approach showed that the effective and important bands to predict cce mainly were in the 1900 2480 nm range fig 6f khayamim et al 2015 and ostovari et al 2018 also predicted caco3 with relatively good accuracy using vis nir spectroscopy combined with plsr method they highlighted that the most effective band to predict carbonate content is around 2340 nm bilgili et al 2010 in turkish soils and summers et al 2011 in australian soils demonstrates a good performance of the plsr method using vis nir spectra for predicting caco3 with r2 values of 0 64 and 0 69 respectively similarly clark et al 1990 reported some effective bands for predicting co3 components in 2300 2350 and 2500 2550 nm ranges the important spectral bands to predict som content were in wavelength ranges of 420 1000 nm and 1400 2480 nm fig 6h martin et al 2002 and stenberg 2010 stated that spectral bands around 1100 1600 1700 1800 2000 and 2200 2400 nm are effective to predict som using soil vis nir spectroscopy in another research hermansen et al 2016 using the plsr method in vis nir spectra range for predicting organic carbon oc content reported r2 values of 0 91 and 0 88 for calibration and validation datasets respectively ostovari et al 2018 predicted som using the plsr method in vis nir range with lower but still relatively good accuracy r2 of 0 67 and 0 65 for calibration and validation datasets respectively they reported significant correlations between som and spectral reflectance values at 490 671 785 1090 1420 1860 and 2420 nm some of these spectral reflectance bands are near the recognized effective bands in our study to predict som babaeian et al 2015 reported significant correlation between som content and spectral bands in 497 677 707 772 1402 1862 2342 and 2447 nm that is to some extent in line with our results 3 4 2 near saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity kψ table 8 shows the performance of the plsr spectra to predict kψ also fig 7 illustrates scatter plots of the observed versus plsr spectra predicted kψ values along with plots of b versus wavelength the plsr spectra provided relatively weak predictions for kψ with r2 nrmse ns and rpd values of 0 39 31 8 0 35 and 1 26 for k 15 0 47 25 5 0 45 and 1 37 for k 10 0 4 18 6 0 4 and 1 31 for k 5 and 0 48 27 2 0 47 and 1 4 for k 0 related to validation dataset respectively according to fig 7 the effective bands to predict k 15 and k 10 and also k 5 and k 0 were relatively similar due to high and significant correlation between them the most effective spectral reflectance bands for predicting kψ at all applied tensions were placed in the 1900 2480 nm range which were mostly related to cce and som contents fig 6 according to table 4 cce significantly correlated with kψ at all applied tensions and som significantly correlated with k 5 and k 0 therefore it can be expected that the recognized effective bands for predicting cce and som due to high correlation with spectral data be also effective for predicting kψ based on the obtained performance criteria the k 0 prediction were more accurate than that of the other kψ s using plsr spectra this can be due to the higher correlation between k 0 and som r 0 52 table 4 therefore almost all of the spectral reflectance bands that are significant to predict k 0 were significant for predicting cce and som contents overall the performance of the plsr spectra for predicting the selected kψ s was relatively poor with r2 0 6 18 nrmse 32 ns 0 65 and rpd 1 5 table 8 and fig 7 babaeian et al 2015 in the northwest of iran poorly predicted the log transformed k 0 determined by constant and falling head methods in the laboratory on undisturbed soil cores with stfs using vis nir spectra with r2 value of 0 29 for calibration dataset they also used some spectral bands around 552 877 1417 1932 2167 2277 and 2432 nm to create stfs which to some extent are in accordance with the bands we found effective for predicting k 0 santra et al 2009 reported that stfs and ptfs have approximately similar performances to predict k 0 determined by the constant head approach klute and dirksen 1986 in the present study the smlr method used to develop ptfs from basic soil properties had a higher capability and better performance to estimate the kψ than the plsr spectra however kψ was not only significantly correlated with ph cce and som content but also some physical and chemical properties including psd parameters e g silt dg and σg ln sar and bd were strongly effective to estimate kψ in the present study though we observed that vis nir reflectance spectra cannot completely explain the water behavior in near saturated and saturated conditions the method can be very effective and useful to predict some basic properties like cce and som contents therefore we analyzed the capability of coupling basic soil properties with effective spectral reflectance bands rs as independent variables to estimate kψ by applying smlr for developing sptfs see section 3 5 below 3 5 prediction of kψ using basic soil properties coupled with effective spectral reflectance bands by smlr method in order to develop sptfs for predicting kψ at first we removed cce and som as input variables of the models due to their high correlation with spectral reflectance bands in vis nir range and their precise estimation by plsr spectra in addition they had good correlations with kψ at all applied tensions table 4 according to table 9 k15 and k10 were directly predicted using the effective spectral reflectance bands only it is noteworthy to mention that we recognized the effective and important spectral reflectance bands rs to predict kψ at all applied tensions using plots of b versus wavelength which were obtained from the plsr analysis see right hand side of fig 7 in these plots there is a possibility of existing positive or negative relationship between the reflectance values at peaks wavelengths and kψ therefore the reflectance values at all peaks wavelengths were selected as effective and important bands for developing sptfs to predict kψ all the recognized effective bands along with the basic soil properties except cce and som were imported to smlr models for k 15 and k 10 predictions by adding any basic soil properties all of the recognized effective spectral reflectance bands were disappeared from the models because the introduced rs showed a linear relationship with the effective basic soil properties therefore the basic soil properties and effective spectral reflectance bands were not combined for predicting k 15 and k 10 and consequently the stfs were developed eqs 19 and 20 on the other hand the basic soil properties and the recognized effective spectral reflectance bands were combined to predict k 5 and k 0 and therefore the sptfs were developed eqs 21 and 22 the accuracy of stfs for predicting k 15 and k 10 with smlr method was relatively low and similar to that of plsr spectra tables 8 and 9 the introduced ptfs showed higher validation r2 values by 41 and 13 in comparison to that of the developed stfs for predicting k 15 and k 10 respectively therefore the developed stf for predicting k 10 have relatively fair accuracy and can be applied as a relatively reliable method however a combination of basic soil properties and effective spectral reflectance bands using smlr method for developing sptfs provided more accurate predictions of k 5 and k 0 than the plsr spectra according to eq 21 the spectral reflectance bands at 1930 2100 2191 2238 and 2480 nm which all were effective to predict cce and som were coupled with dg σg sand ln sar and bd as additional variables for predicting k 5 furthermore the spectral reflectance bands at 592 1901 1927 and 2222 nm that also are related to cce and som contents were very effective and combined with σg ln sar ph and bd in the developed sptf to predict k 0 eq 22 therefore while the spectroscopy based methods alone seem not accurate to predict near saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity combining them with basic soil properties can be useful to predict kψ in calcareous soils the developed ptfs for predicting k 5 and k 0 increased the validation dataset r2 values by 9 8 and 14 5 in comparison to the developed sptfs therefore both k 5 and k 0 were predicted by sptfs with close agreement to ptfs there is no need to include cce and som in the sptf for predicting k 0 and k 5 this is beneficial as the measurements of these properties are time consuming expensive and require different hazardous chemicals e g acids bases oxidants and reductants in this regard xu et al 2017 showed that importing soil spectral data as additional inputs improved the performance of the ptfs for predicting k 0 increasing r2 by 0 33 fig 8 illustrates scatter plots of the stfs sptfs predicted kψ versus the observed values 3 6 hydraulic conductivity curve fig 9 illustrates curves of the measured and predicted by ptfs plsr spectra and stfs sptfs kψ as a function of the applied tensions along with their exponential trend line and their related equations that are related to the studied 102 locations as can be seen the mean values of kψ for a specific tension are very close in four plots therefore they show relatively similar trends and equations while in the previous parts we observed relatively weak to acceptable capability of the ptfs plsr spectra and stfs sptfs to predict kψ values according to the obtained results from fig 9 it can be concluded that if an approach e g plsr spectra in the present study even poorly predicted kψ the mean of all predicted values become close to the measured ones therefore when a developed ptf stf or sptf works moderately well to predict kψ in a small area e g a specific small land use or catchment it can be possible to have a kψ curve based on the mean values which is very close to the measured ones and can be used for modeling and managerial plans in regions which have a specific and reasonable ptfs for predicting kψ it can be recommended to use the mean value of predicted kψ by the available ptfs in several locations and then the obtained kψ curve based on the mean values be used for further managerial plans in addition results revealed that the measured k 15 k 10 and k 0 values belong to the high variability class cv 35 while all of the other obtained kψ values both the measured and predicted values belong to the moderate variability class 15 cv 35 based on the wilding 1985 classification guideline fig 9 the measured and the predicted kψ values ranked as k 0 k 15 k 10 k 5 in terms of their cv values the higher variability of kψ at saturated conditions compared to unsaturated conditions may be due to high variability of macropores which are so effective and important in measuring k 0 mozaffari et al 2022c similar results were also reported by moosavi and sepaskhah 2012a and mozaffari et al 2021a generally the cv values of k 5 and k 0 were ranked as the measured data ptfs sptfs plsr spectra while for k 15 and k 10 the determination approaches were ranked as the measured data ptfs stfs plsr spectra in terms of their cv values this shows that the ptfs are more reliable than the other studied approaches to predict kψ values 4 conclusion we showed that the smlr method was able to predict kψ relatively well using basic soil physical and chemical properties with validation dataset r2 values of 0 55 0 52 0 56 and 0 63 for k 15 k 10 k 5 and k 0 respectively it was demonstrated that soils with high values of som and low values of cce can absorb more and reflect less spectra in the vis nir range since som and cce increase and decrease the soil darkness respectively the plsr spectra poorly predicted ph r2 0 60 and rpd 1 5 while predicted clay content relatively well r2 0 60 and 1 5 rpd 2 and predicted cce and som contents excellently r2 0 80 and rpd 2 5 the plsr spectra also showed relatively low performance to predict kψ r2 0 60 and rpd 1 5 however k 0 with r2 and rpd values of 0 48 and 1 4 for the validation dataset was predicted with more accuracy than the other kψ s probably due to a better correlation with som according to the forward smlr approach basic soil properties were not added on top of spectral reflectance bands to predict k 15 and k 10 and spectral reflectance bands were thus the only inputs there was no difference in model performance between the developed stfs and the plsr spectra results to predict k 15 and k 10 while a combination of basic soil properties and spectral reflectance bands developed stronger smlr based models sptfs to predict k 5 and k 0 than the plsr spectra itself overall the accuracy of the studied methods to predict kψ were ranked as smlr based ptfs smlr based stfs plsr spectra for predicting k 15 and k 10 and smlr based ptfs smlr based sptfs plsr spectra for predicting k 5 and k 0 both developed sptfs for predicting k 5 and k 0 and developed stf for predicting k 10 can be used with relatively close agreement with ptfs regarding k 15 prediction we suggest to use related ptf the better performance of the ptfs can be due to using different attributes like psd representative parameters e g dg σg and silt and properties that are associated with soil structure e g cce ln sar som ph and bd to develop ptfs for predicting kψ these attributes and properties seem not fully recognizable with spectroscopy in vis nir range although spectral reflectance data can predict some important and basic parameters like cce and som with high accuracy their capability to predict kψ was lower than that of the mentioned chemical attributes therefore it can be suggested that the spectral reflectance data be used as additional inputs along with the basic soil properties to predict near saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity in comparison with just using the spectral data in order to achieve sptfs with low cost non destructive and fast measurement of independent variables we think the benefits of spectroscopy data for predicting hydraulic properties become more obvious when they completely substitute the basic soil attributes e g clay som and cce and are coupled with actual soil structure related parameters like tortuosity amounts of macropores mesopores and micropores etc however their measurements may also be time consuming and expensive therefore for further studies we suggest to combine actual soil structure related parameters with spectra to develop sptfs for predicting hydraulic properties credit authorship contribution statement hasan mozaffari methodology software validation writing original draft ali akbar moosavi

2950,measurement of hydraulic parameters which are very important in soil water and environmental studies is difficult time consuming and expensive therefore the present study aimed to predict near saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity kψ of calcareous soils by i developing stepwise multiple linear regression smlr based pedotransfer functions ptfs using basic soil properties ii using partial least square regression plsr based method and spectral reflectance data in the visible and near infrared vis nir range plsr spectra and iii developing smlr based functions that combine or not basic soil properties and effective vis nir spectral reflectance bands spectro pedotransfer functions sptfs and spectrotransfer functions stfs hydraulic conductivity was determined in the field from water infiltration measurements with a tension disk infiltrometer at 15 10 5 and 0 cm tensions at 102 locations across calcareous soils of the fars province iran the spectral reflectance of soil samples taken at the same location was in the range of vis nir 400 2500 nm while basic soil properties included particle size distribution and its related parameters ph electrical conductivity soluble sodium potassium calcium and magnesium sodium adsorption ratio soil organic matter content som calcium carbonate equivalent cce aggregates mean weight diameter and bulk density the developed ptfs showed relatively acceptable performance validation determination coefficient r2 values of 0 55 0 52 0 56 and 0 63 for k 15 k 10 k 5 and k 0 predictions respectively the plsr spectra performed poorer showing validation r2 values of 0 39 0 47 0 40 and 0 48 for predicting k 15 k 10 k 5 and k 0 respectively yet the plsr spectra predicted cce and som contents excellently r2 0 80 and residual prediction deviation rpd 2 5 for both calibration and validation datasets and clay relatively well but not ph the effective spectral reflectance bands mostly substitute with som and cce were very useful as input variables to predict k 5 and k 0 when coupled with basic soil properties resulting in sptfs on the other hand to predict k 15 and k 10 once any soil properties were added to smlr models the effective spectral reflectance bands were disappeared and consequently stfs were developed overall we concluded that the accuracy of the studied approaches to predict kψ were ranked as ptf plsr spectra stf for predicting k 15 and k 10 and ptf sptf plsr spectra for predicting k 5 and k 0 keywords basic soil properties effective spectral reflectance bands partial least square regression spectro pedotransfer functions spectrotransfer functions stepwise multiple linear regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity kψ is an important parameter for characterizing many aspects of unsaturated soil water flow such as rainfall infiltration and runoff irrigation migration of nutrients pesticides and contaminants aquifer recharge water balance and for designing and monitoring irrigation and drainage systems bagarello et al 2005 rahmati et al 2018 spatial temporal variations in kψ and thus the contribution of pores size classes to water flow is highly affected by soil structure mozaffari et al 2021a despite the importance of hydraulic properties in water behavior in soil their quantification and interpretation strongly depend on the methods used for their determination verbist et al 2013 furthermore their measurement in the field e g by tension disk infiltrometer double ring or guelph permeameter and in the laboratory e g with falling and constant head procedures is difficult time consuming and expensive vereecken et al 2010 therefore numerous attempts have been made to estimate saturated and to a much lesser extent unsaturated hydraulic conductivity indirectly by developing so called pedotranfer functions ptfs using basic soil properties including among others soil texture sand silt and clay contents bulk density bd fractal dimensions d soil organic matter content som calcium carbonate equivalent cce and mean weight diameter mwd with a suite of conventional methods like linear regression gamie and de smedt 2018 kotlar et al 2019a azadmard et al 2020 non linear regression mady and shein 2018 sihag et al 2019 regression tree jorda et al 2015 tóth et al 2015 sihag et al 2019 machine

kψ prediction by ptfs remains low primarily because soil structure which highly affects kψ is typically not accounted for van looy et al 2017 nowadays spectroscopy based techniques are used to predict different soil properties as they provide a rapid low preparation and less expensive analysis of soil samples compared with conventional laboratory analyzes hobley and prater 2019 both organic and inorganic soil components can be quantitatively assessed using visible vis 350 700 nm near infrared nir 700 2500 nm and mid infrared mir 2500 25 000 nm portions of the electromagnetic spectrum due to their sensitivity to spectra in vis nir mir or subsets thereof range estimation of soil properties is possible using specific spectral absorbance reflectance bands and their correlation with soil properties soriano disla et al 2014 as a result cce and gypsum khayamim et al 2015 ostovari et al 2018 clay and sand contents the ratio of silt clay som content exchangeable hydrogen and aluminum al cation exchange capacity cec percentage of base saturation pbs and al saturation pinheiro et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 ostovari et al 2018 mozaffari et al 2022a gravimetric and volumetric water contents and bulk density zhang et al 2017 soil erodibility factor ostovari et al 2018 and threshold velocity of wind erosion mina et al 2021 among others have been predicted with good and relatively good accuracy using spectroscopy based approaches it should be pointed out that prediction of a property using a spectroscopy based technique requires a separate calibration model of course providing a calibration model requires enough data through laboratory measurements and the developed models may need to be tested for new sets of data various statistical methods like stepwise multiple linear regression smlr liu et al 2018 mozaffari et al 2022a artificial neural networks anns nawar and mouazen 2017 principal component analysis pca nocita et al 2014 and partial least square regression plsr ostovari et al 2018 have been used to analyze the spectral data and predict different soil properties the plsr currently is the most common calibration method used for predicting soil properties from spectral data mainly due to its robustness the plsr can cope with data containing large numbers of predictor variables like hyperspectral data in the vis nir range that are highly repetitive and correlated stenberg 2010 askari et al 2015 khayamim et al 2015 regarding the capability of spectroscopy based methods to predict soil water related properties several studies focused on the estimation of soil moisture content and its related parameters janik et al 2007 tranter et al 2008 babaeian et al 2016 marakkala manage et al 2018 only a few studies used spectral reflectance data to estimate soil hydraulic conductivity for example cohen et al 2007 in southeastern usa florida used spectral reflectance data to predict saturated hydraulic conductivity k 0 with r2 of 0 477 for the calibration dataset babaeian et al 2015 in northwest of iran predicted log transformed k 0 by providing a spectrotransfer function stf with an r2 value of 0 58 and a root mean squared residual of 0 619 ln cm d 1 for a validation dataset using a full spectrum of wavelengths from 350 to 2500 nm xu et al 2017 in southwestern china showed that including soil spectral reflectance data as additional inputs with basic soil properties can improve the performance of k 0 prediction to the best of our knowledge vis nir spectroscopy has never been used to predict the kψ at different tensions this study aimed to predict near saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity kψ of calcareous soils using i basic soil properties by applying the smlr method for developing ptfs ii soil spectral reflectance data in the vis nir range by applying the plsr method plsr spectra and iii combination of basic soil properties and effective vis nir spectral reflectance bands by applying the smlr method for developing spectro pedotransfer functions sptfs it was hypothesized that kψ is strongly related to soil structure and pores size distribution and vis nir spectroscopy data depend on basic soil attributes such as particle size distribution psd parameters e g sand silt and clay contents som content and cce which affecting soil structure and pores size distribution therefore prediction of kψ could be useful by applying vis nir spectroscopy based information and substituting the basic physico chemical properties by the vis nir spectra in ptfs in order to decrease consumption of chemicals and save time and costs 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area and experimental setup the study was conducted in the fars province located in the south and southwest of iran between 50 30 55 38 e and 27 03 31 42 n encompassing an area of 132 000 km2 it has an arid and semi arid climate with mean annual precipitation ranging from 50 to 1000 mm mpb 1994 its elevation varies from nearly 500 to 4000 m above the mean sea level in the southern and northern parts respectively khormali and abtahi 2003 according to banaei 1998 the fars province experiences xeric ustic and aridic soil moisture regimes along with mesic thermic and hyperthermic soil temperature regimes the soils of the study area are calcareous and relatively calcareous ostovari et al 2021 ostovari et al 2022 formed from soluble dolomite and calcite limestone e g the soil cce contents were in the range of 12 5 to 70 in the studied soils soil physical chemical and hydraulic properties were measured at 102 locations covering the most relevant soil types and land uses in the area according to soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 the sampled soils were mainly classified as inceptisols 71 soils entisols 13 soils and aridisols 18 soils which comprise nearly 69 6 12 7 and 17 7 of the studied soils respectively khormali and abtahi 2003 natural resources and forestry organization of fars province 2010 furthermore to ensure a wide range of variability and to cover various land uses the soil samples were collected and measurements were made on croplands under wheat barley corn and rice on fallow lands pastures and woodlands oak forests at each of the 102 selected locations which were randomly selected infiltration measurements were made with a tension disk infiltrometer and intact core using stainless rings and composite 2 kg of soil from 0 to 20 cm depth soil samples were taken 2 2 physical and chemical analysis of the soils the composite soil samples were air dried in the laboratory grounded and passed through a 2 mm sieve table 1 lists the soil physical and chemical properties that were determined and the standard methods used more specifically to determine psd the mass fractions of the particles smaller than 0 05 mm diameter were measured using the hydrometer method by determining the density of suspension at 2 5 and 10 min and 1 3 6 and 24 h to measure the mass fractions of sand sieves with mesh sizes of 1000 500 150 and 50 μm were used gee and bauder 1986 mozaffari et al 2022b in addition some indices including sodium adsorption ratio sar geometric mean of particle size diameter dg geometric standard deviation of particle size diameter σg and fractal dimension of primary particles d were calculated the sar meq0 5 l 0 5 was calculated as 1 sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where na ca2 and mg2 are soluble sodium calcium and magnesium meq l 1 respectively the dg l and σg l was obtained from the psd curve shirazi and boersma 1984 2 d g exp a a 0 01 i 1 m f i ln d i 3 σ g exp b b 2 0 01 i 1 m f i ln d i 2 a 2 where the multiplier 0 01 is used to convert percent frequencies into fraction m is the number of soil separate groups e g sand silt clay fi is the percent of total soil mass having diameters equal to or less than d i diameter and d i is the mean diameter l of each soil separate groups the d was calculated based on the following power equation using psd data tyler and wheatcraft 1992 4 m x m t x x max 3 d where m x is the cumulative mass that is smaller than a specific size x m mt is the total soil sample mass m and x max is the maximum size of particles l to determine d there are linear and non linear regression methods in the present study the linear method was used if the natural logarithm ln is taken from eq 4 the following linear equation is obtained 5 ln m x m t 3 d ln x j 6 j 3 d ln x max where the parameter j is constant for each soil values of ln m x m t were plotted against ln x and d was calculated from the slope of the resultant line 2 3 infiltration experiments the infiltration experiments were conducted using a single disc tension infiltrometer with 20 cm diameter fig 1 during summer august and september 2019 in accordance with moosavi and sepaskhah 2012a 2012b and mozaffari et al 2021a at each experimental location plant residues were first removed from the soil surface without altering the surface soil structure in order to ensure an appropriate hydraulic contact between the disk membrane and the soil a thin nearly 5 mm thick contact layer of fine sand 0 1 0 25 mm diameter was placed between the disc membrane of the infiltrometer and the soil surface the infiltrometer was pushed slightly onto the sand layer after filling the device reservoir with fresh water ec 0 6 ds m 1 and sar 0 5 meq0 5 l 0 5 the maximum desired tension i e 15 cm in present study was set by the air tower and mariotte tube tension disc operating instruction 2008 after setting up the tension infiltration tests were carried out at successive applied tensions of 15 10 5 and 0 cm at each experimental location at each of the applied tensions after moistening the sand layer nearly 30 s water infiltration into the soil was manually recorded at time intervals of 15 s for the first 300 s and then every 60 s until steady state conditions were met conditions were considered as steady state when at least five successive readings of the infiltrated flow rate became similar angulo jaramillo et al 2000 2 4 determination of near saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity kψ to determine the kψ the method proposed by ankeny et al 1991 was used soil hydraulic properties were determined from the infiltration data using the analytical solution of the variably saturated water flow equation presented by wooding 1968 gardner 1958 assumed that kψ varies exponentially with tension ψ eq 7 when water infiltrates into the soil from a circular source with a constant tension at the soil surface wooding 1968 simunek et al 1998 7 k ψ k 0 exp α ψ where k 0 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t α is the sorptive number l 1 which is equal to the inverse of macroscopic capillary length λ l white and sully 1987 the analytical solution derived by wooding 1968 reads as 8 q ψ π r 2 k ψ 4 π r 2 k ψ π r α π r 2 k ψ 1 4 π r α where qψ and r are the volume of water entering the soil per unit time at steady state conditions at tension ψ l3 t 1 and the radius of the infiltrometer disc l respectively according to ankeny et al 1991 by using wooding s solution for unsaturated conditions steady state fluxes were obtained at different tensions e g ψi and ψi 1 replacing kψ by eq 7 and by substituting ψi and ψi 1 in the combined equation yields two equations which solving them simultaneously resulted in the following equations ankeny et al 1991 9 k ψ i 1 q ψ i π r 2 2 δ ψ r 1 q ψ i 1 q ψ i 1 q ψ i 1 q ψ i 10 k ψ i 2 q ψ i 1 k ψ i 1 q ψ i three equations were solved simultaneously using ψ values of 0 and 5 5 and 10 and 10 and 15 cm ankeny et al 1991 defined the best estimate of kψ as the arithmetic mean of the available estimates where k ψ i is calculated from the ψi ψi 1 rate pair k ψ i k ψ i 1 k ψ i 2 detailed information can be seen in moosavi and sepaskhah 2012a 2012b mozaffari et al 2021a 2 5 spectral vis nir measurements nearly 25 g of 2 mm sieved air dried and thoroughly mixed soil samples were placed in a container with 4 cm diameter and then lighted in a camera obscure via a 50 w halogen lamp with an incident angle of 45 and a distance of nearly 50 cm from the sample surface the nirs xds model apparatus metrohm company switzerland was used to collect spectral data of the soil samples in vis nir 400 2500 nm range with 0 5 nm spectral resolution it should be noted that in order to reduce the complexity the spectra with 1 nm increment were considered for developing models the mentioned apparatus measured the absorbance a of soil samples the absorbance data were converted to reflectance r using a 1 10 a relation for each soil sample the average of three recorded spectra was considered fig 2 provides the representative reflectance spectral data for all of soil samples n 102 the spectral absorbance obtained at regions of 400 to 417 nm and 2483 to 2500 nm were removed in order to eliminate noises various pre processing techniques including savitzky golay derivative savitzky and golay 1964 with five smoothing points and a zero order polynomial approximation mouazen et al 2005 were used to improve the quality of the spectral data and predictions 2 6 models development the 102 soil samples were shuffled kotlar et al 2019b using the matlab software package mathworks makers of matlab and simulink 2021 before developing the models the shuffled data were imported to the unscrambler x v 9 7 software package camo technologies inc 2013 and randomly divided into the calibration and validation datasets containing nearly 75 76 samples and 25 26 samples respectively the calibration dataset was used to develop the ptfs stfs and sptfs and also plsr models in addition the t test was used to compare the mean values of dependent variables related to the selected calibration and validation datasets two regression methods were applied stepwise multiple linear regression smlr being still one of the most widely and standard methods van looy et al 2017 in ptfs development was used to develop ptfs but also stfs and sptfs a forward approach was used to select the significant predictor variables at the probability level of 5 the kψ at different tensions were selected as dependent variables and basic soil properties for developing ptfs effective spectral reflectance bands for developing stfs and combination of both basic soil properties and effective spectral reflectance bands for developing sptfs were selected as independent variables all analyzes were carried out in the statistica software package partial least squares regression plsr was used for calibrating soil reflectance data to individual soil parameters and using them to predict the selected basic physico chemical properties and kψ at different tensions mainly because of its superiority over traditional methods in dealing with high dimensional multicollinearity stenberg 2010 bilgili et al 2011 the plsr has been widely used in vis nir reflectance spectroscopy and is a method for relating two data matrices by a linear multivariate model bilgili et al 2011 in the present study for operating the plsr models to predict different soil properties the maximum number of latent variables lvs was considered as 20 the models were generated using unscrambler x v 9 7 software package it should be pointed out that the effective and important spectral reflectance bands rs which were related to the selected soil properties were recognized considering the plot of regression coefficient b versus wavelength of developed plsr model 2 7 models evaluation several statistical indices were used to evaluate the models performance including the normalized root mean square error nrmse the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns the residual prediction deviation rpd and the determination coefficient r2 11 nrmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n o 100 12 ns 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 13 rpd sd sep 14 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 where oi and pi are the observed and predicted values n is numbers of data sd is standard deviation of the observed values and sep is the standard error which is calculated as root mean square error of the prediction the nrmse is a measure of error between the observed and predicted values and varies between zero the highest accuracy and infinity the ns statistic is a measure of model efficiency and changes from one the highest accuracy to negative infinity ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 feng et al 2017 the rpd is a factor by which the prediction accuracy has been increased compared to the mean composition for all samples mouazen et al 2010 while r2 is a measure of model accuracy and change from 0 the lowest accuracy to 1 the highest accuracy table 2 shows the classification of the mentioned models performance criteria all statistics were calculated and curves were fitted in the excel version 2013 software package 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics and statistical analysis of soil properties table 3 shows the summary statistics and the normal distribution criteria of the studied soil properties the lowest and the highest coefficient of variations cv were related to d 2 1 and sar 277 respectively according to wilding 1985 k 15 k 10 k 0 ec na k ca2 mg2 sar som sand clay and dg fall in the high variability class cv 35 q 15 where denotes steady state conditions q 10 q 5 q 0 k 5 cce mwd silt and σg fall in the moderate variability class 15 cv 35 and ph d and bd fall in the low variability class 0 cv 15 the low variability of the latter variables is expected especially when considering that almost all samples 83 are from the soil textures silt loam and loam fig 3 and table 3 according to table 3 and the kolmogorov smirnov normality test the ec na k ca2 mg2 and sar were lognormally distributed in the studied soil samples the other studied properties followed a normal distribution table 4 shows the correlation coefficient r among the studied soil hydraulic and physico chemical properties the k 15 and k 10 were strongly correlated with psd attributes i e sand silt dg and σg and cce it can be seen that at higher tensions the variation in kψ is better explained by soil texture and psd than by parameters associated with soil structure on the other hand closer to saturation the soil structure related properties become better correlated to kψ so that k 5 and k 0 being significantly correlated with ph ln sar cce som and bd it is well known that high na concentrations reflected by high sar values can destroy soil structure due to large hydrated radius resulting in dispersion of soil particles tajik et al 2003 mozaffari et al 2021a mozaffari et al 2022c the ca2 that is represented by a high cce value and som act as binding agents for flocculation of mineral colloids thus promoting aggregation and enhancing aggregate stability vaezi et al 2010 ostovari et al 2016 mozaffari et al 2021b yang et al 2019 in the spindletop research farm of kentucky university lexington usa found that ln k 0 and ln k 1 was significantly correlated with clay and som content further they reported ln k 5 and ln k 10 to be significantly correlated with mwd kotlar et al 2019a showed that log k 10 was strongly correlated with psd components such as sand silt and clay contents in soil samples taken from different locations of denmark they observed that the effect of psd features on log k 0 decreased while the effect of structure related parameters bd and mwd increased which is in line with the results of the present study 3 2 developing ptfs to predict kψ using basic soil properties by smlr method according to t test analysis there was no significant difference between the mean values of the calibration and validation datasets of kψ at all studied tensions the ptfs developed by smlr method and their performance for predicting kψ using selected physical and chemical properties are summarized in table 5 in addition fig 4 illustrates the observed versus predicted values of kψ for both calibration and validation datasets the k 15 and k 10 pfts with dg σg silt cce and ln sar for k 10 as input variables provided relatively acceptable results based on the performance criteria they had r2 values of 0 55 and 0 52 nrmse values of 27 4 and 25 9 ns values of 0 52 and 0 47 and rpd values of 1 47 and 1 40 for the validation dataset wang et al 2017 and zhang and schaap 2019 also stated that the psd directly affects soil hydraulic conductivity at all tensions for both k 5 and k 0 predictions the σg silt cce and som positively and ln sar negatively appeared in the ptfs in addition ph and bd were effective factors with negative sign to predict k 0 although the values of ln na are significantly correlated with k 5 and k 0 table 4 the effect of ln sar was more obvious this can be due to the effects of ca2 and mg2 in the calculation of sar that may contribute to flocculation of the soil components and consequently better soil structure the r2 nrmse ns and rpd values of the validation dataset were 0 56 18 1 0 49 and 1 44 for predicting k 5 and 0 63 25 4 0 57 and 1 56 for predicting k 0 respectively based on the obtained nrmse values the developed ptfs for predicting k 15 k 10 and k 0 were classified as fair 20 nrmse 30 and for predicting k 5 as good 10 nrmse 20 according to r2 rpd classification viscarra rossel 2007 mouazen et al 2010 k 15 k 10 and k 5 were poorly predicted rpd 1 5 and r2 0 60 and k 0 moderately well rpd of 1 5 2 and r2 0 60 overall k 0 was predicted with higher accuracy than k 15 k 10 and k 5 the relatively moderate performance of kψ ptfs was expected given its very high variability even in similar soils and highly dependent to pores geometry van looy et al 2017 although the structure related parameters which were used in the present study i e cce ln sar som mwd ph and bd may have significant relationship with pores size distribution they cannot entirely reflect soil structure in fact the actual soil structure related parameters e g tortuosity amounts of macropores mesopores and micropores etc may be able to predict saturated and near saturated hydraulic conductivity accurately however their measurement may be difficult time consuming and expensive generally since hydraulic conductivity is a hardly measurable soil parameter which measurement is costly laborious and time consuming vereecken et al 2010 even a model that only moderately predicts this property can be very useful and valuable our results were in accordance with the findings of gamie and de smedt 2018 who reported that in comparison with soil properties associated with soil texture those parameters associated with soil structure were more correlated with k 0 in the western desert of egypt in contrast azadmard et al 2020 in northwestern iran found that their ptfs based on the multiple linear regression mlr using basic soil properties were not able to predict kψ accurately r2 values were 0 17 0 21 0 14 0 19 and 0 19 for prediction of k 15 k 10 k 5 k 2 and k 0 respectively due to the existence of non linear relationships among the soil physico chemical and hydraulic properties kotlar et al 2019a reported the smlr method to predict log k 0 and log k 10 with r2 values of 0 26 and 0 65 respectively generally according to the statistical measures in the present study the kψ at 15 10 5 and 0 cm tensions were predicted with relatively acceptable and reasonable accuracy the developed ptfs can be tested and used in other regions with similar soils 3 3 soil spectra analysis fig 5 shows the mean of reflectance spectra according to different groups of soil ph a texture b cce c som d soil type e and land use type f while table 6 lists the mean values of ph clay cce and som for different mentioned groups of soil samples as can be seen in fig 5a the reflectance spectra in vis nir range were not highly affected by different soil ph groups wan et al 2019 also did not report high differences of reflectance spectra in vis nir range according to 4 different groups of ph including 5 5 5 6 5 6 5 7 5 and 7 5 there was a larger increase in the mean of reflectance spectra for the silty clay in 400 1200 nm range and sandy loam in 1200 2500 nm range textures than that of the other soil textural classes the lowest mean of reflectance spectra was observed in the silt in 400 570 nm and 1200 2500 nm ranges and silty clay loam in 570 1200 nm range textures fig 5b in addition according to table 6 the lowest som content and the highest cce were observed in the sandy loam while the highest som were observed in the silty clay loam and the lowest cce in the silt these results are in line with the findings of santra et al 2009 conforti et al 2017 and ostovari et al 2018 the soil spectra also were classified based on three ranges of cce i e 10 30 30 50 and 50 70 and som content i e 0 1 1 2 and 2 4 according to fig 5c and 5d the lower cce and the higher som contents resulted in the lower reflectance spectra in soil due to the higher absorption of spectra in vis nir range the same results also have been reported by santra et al 2009 and xu et al 2018 fig 5e and f show the mean of reflectance spectra of the various soil types and land uses bold lines along with the minimum and the maximum of reflectance spectra for each soil type and land use dash lines as can be seen in fig 5e the mean of reflectance spectra in the aridisols is higher than that of the entisols and inceptisols across the full range of spectra the mean of som and clay contents were the lowest 1 05 and 11 7 respectively in the aridisols furthermore in comparison with aridisols and entisols the mean value of cce in the inseptisols was the lowest table 6 overall the aridisols were lighter than the entisols and inceptisols in the arid region of south and southwest of iran where aridisols dominate the very low plants cover due to high temperature low precipitation and the limited availability of fresh water result in a lower som content ostovari et al 2018 also reported that the mean of reflectance spectra of soil types shows the following order aridisols entisols inceptisols which matches with our observations regarding land use mean of reflectance spectra was ranked as pasture cropland woodland fig 5f the lowest reflectance spectra in the woodland can be explained by its higher clay and som contents and lower cce table 6 the opposite was observed in the pastures in addition almost all of the cropland and woodland were inceptisols viscarra rossel 2007 stated the ph psd caco3 and som are well known soil properties affecting the soil reflectance spectral bands across the full range of spectra which may vary with location soil type and land use higher cce and lower clay and som contents are associated with lighter colored soil resulting in higher reflections and lower absorptions of spectra 3 4 prediction of selected soil properties using spectral reflectance data in vis nir range by plsr method 3 4 1 ph clay cce and som table 7 shows the performance of plsr method using spectral reflectance data in vis nir range plsr spectra to predict ph clay cce and som contents fig 6 illustrates values of the observed versus plsr spectra predicted data for the calibration and the validation datasets along with plots of the regression coefficient b versus wavelength which enable to deduce the important and effective bands i e those correspond to high absolute values of b the plsr spectra was unable to predict ph values accurately with low values of r2 and rpd while predicted clay content with relatively well accuracy table 7 and fig 6a and c yet the effective bands for predicting ph were in the ranges of 420 700 nm and 1700 2480 nm and for predicting clay in the full range of spectra fig 6b and d conforti et al 2017 in acidic soils of calabria region southern italy predicted ph moderately well with r2 and rmse values of 0 70 and 0 15 using vis nir spectra and plsr method according to viscarra rossel et al 2006 intense fundamental molecular frequencies related to soil components occur in the mir 2500 25 000 nm region they stated that the mir region is more capable to predict soil ph with adjusted r2 r2 adj value of 0 75 than vis r2 adj 0 36 and nir r2 adj 0 54 ranges when plsr method was used in addition to this the low variability in ph of our soil samples could be another reason to explain the relatively poor results for predicting ph the absorption at 1416 1915 and 2212 nm wavelengths are dominantly related to water adsorbed to surface of clays gomez et al 2008 ostovari et al 2018 this is in line with fig 6d showing the effective spectral reflectance bands for predicting clay near to 1416 1915 and 2212 nm also hobley and prater 2019 in three states across germany reported that the region around 1910 and 2190 nm are effective bands to predict clay content furthermore our results support those of hermansen et al 2016 who reported that in agricultural fields of greenland denmark the most significant absorption bands for clay prediction occurred around 1412 1907 and 2208 nm they reported highly accurate prediction of clay with r2 value of 0 94 for both calibration and validation datasets the lower performance of the plsr spectra to predict clay content in our study in comparison with the mentioned studies may be due to low spatial variability of clay content in our study sites differences in the size of the study sites and differences in the applied laboratory measurement methods in addition according to khormali and abtahi 2003 the major clay mineral in the study area fars province are illite and chlorite with some evidences to form smectites in well drained alfisols somewhat poorly drained mollisols and calcixerepts with high precipitation they reported that the mean value of soil cation exchange capacity cec in the fars province is 43 cmol kg 1 the nature of the clay with their low cec in the soils in the study area point to a low negative charge at the clay particle low adsorption of bipolar water molecules and consequently low absorption of vis nir spectra by soil as can be seen in fig 2 the mean of reflectance spectra in the soil samples showed four significant absorption bands around 1416 1915 2212 and 2340 nm as mentioned gomez et al 2008 and ostovari et al 2018 confirmed that these absorption bands are mainly related to the overtone of oh stretches moisture adsorbed to surface of clay combination of oh stretches and hoh in water molecules trapped in the clay crystal lattice ohmetal band and oh stretch combinations and co3 groups in carbonate minerals respectively therefore clays with high cec and high capacity to absorb water molecules will absorb more spectra at wavelengths of 1416 1915 and 2212 nm and consequently prediction of the mentioned clays by vis nir spectra can be accompanied with high accuracy in contrast the plsr spectra provided very good estimations of cce and som contents table 7 and fig 6e and g with the validation dataset r2 nrmse ns and rpd values of 0 86 9 86 0 85 and 2 62 for cce and 0 88 19 8 0 86 and 2 77 for som predictions respectively the prediction of cce was excellent in terms of nrmse 10 r2 0 80 and rpd 2 5 and good in terms of ns 0 8 ns 0 9 likewise the prediction of som was excellent according to rpd and r2 and good according to nrmse 10 nrmse 20 and ns classification guidelines the plsr approach showed that the effective and important bands to predict cce mainly were in the 1900 2480 nm range fig 6f khayamim et al 2015 and ostovari et al 2018 also predicted caco3 with relatively good accuracy using vis nir spectroscopy combined with plsr method they highlighted that the most effective band to predict carbonate content is around 2340 nm bilgili et al 2010 in turkish soils and summers et al 2011 in australian soils demonstrates a good performance of the plsr method using vis nir spectra for predicting caco3 with r2 values of 0 64 and 0 69 respectively similarly clark et al 1990 reported some effective bands for predicting co3 components in 2300 2350 and 2500 2550 nm ranges the important spectral bands to predict som content were in wavelength ranges of 420 1000 nm and 1400 2480 nm fig 6h martin et al 2002 and stenberg 2010 stated that spectral bands around 1100 1600 1700 1800 2000 and 2200 2400 nm are effective to predict som using soil vis nir spectroscopy in another research hermansen et al 2016 using the plsr method in vis nir spectra range for predicting organic carbon oc content reported r2 values of 0 91 and 0 88 for calibration and validation datasets respectively ostovari et al 2018 predicted som using the plsr method in vis nir range with lower but still relatively good accuracy r2 of 0 67 and 0 65 for calibration and validation datasets respectively they reported significant correlations between som and spectral reflectance values at 490 671 785 1090 1420 1860 and 2420 nm some of these spectral reflectance bands are near the recognized effective bands in our study to predict som babaeian et al 2015 reported significant correlation between som content and spectral bands in 497 677 707 772 1402 1862 2342 and 2447 nm that is to some extent in line with our results 3 4 2 near saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity kψ table 8 shows the performance of the plsr spectra to predict kψ also fig 7 illustrates scatter plots of the observed versus plsr spectra predicted kψ values along with plots of b versus wavelength the plsr spectra provided relatively weak predictions for kψ with r2 nrmse ns and rpd values of 0 39 31 8 0 35 and 1 26 for k 15 0 47 25 5 0 45 and 1 37 for k 10 0 4 18 6 0 4 and 1 31 for k 5 and 0 48 27 2 0 47 and 1 4 for k 0 related to validation dataset respectively according to fig 7 the effective bands to predict k 15 and k 10 and also k 5 and k 0 were relatively similar due to high and significant correlation between them the most effective spectral reflectance bands for predicting kψ at all applied tensions were placed in the 1900 2480 nm range which were mostly related to cce and som contents fig 6 according to table 4 cce significantly correlated with kψ at all applied tensions and som significantly correlated with k 5 and k 0 therefore it can be expected that the recognized effective bands for predicting cce and som due to high correlation with spectral data be also effective for predicting kψ based on the obtained performance criteria the k 0 prediction were more accurate than that of the other kψ s using plsr spectra this can be due to the higher correlation between k 0 and som r 0 52 table 4 therefore almost all of the spectral reflectance bands that are significant to predict k 0 were significant for predicting cce and som contents overall the performance of the plsr spectra for predicting the selected kψ s was relatively poor with r2 0 6 18 nrmse 32 ns 0 65 and rpd 1 5 table 8 and fig 7 babaeian et al 2015 in the northwest of iran poorly predicted the log transformed k 0 determined by constant and falling head methods in the laboratory on undisturbed soil cores with stfs using vis nir spectra with r2 value of 0 29 for calibration dataset they also used some spectral bands around 552 877 1417 1932 2167 2277 and 2432 nm to create stfs which to some extent are in accordance with the bands we found effective for predicting k 0 santra et al 2009 reported that stfs and ptfs have approximately similar performances to predict k 0 determined by the constant head approach klute and dirksen 1986 in the present study the smlr method used to develop ptfs from basic soil properties had a higher capability and better performance to estimate the kψ than the plsr spectra however kψ was not only significantly correlated with ph cce and som content but also some physical and chemical properties including psd parameters e g silt dg and σg ln sar and bd were strongly effective to estimate kψ in the present study though we observed that vis nir reflectance spectra cannot completely explain the water behavior in near saturated and saturated conditions the method can be very effective and useful to predict some basic properties like cce and som contents therefore we analyzed the capability of coupling basic soil properties with effective spectral reflectance bands rs as independent variables to estimate kψ by applying smlr for developing sptfs see section 3 5 below 3 5 prediction of kψ using basic soil properties coupled with effective spectral reflectance bands by smlr method in order to develop sptfs for predicting kψ at first we removed cce and som as input variables of the models due to their high correlation with spectral reflectance bands in vis nir range and their precise estimation by plsr spectra in addition they had good correlations with kψ at all applied tensions table 4 according to table 9 k15 and k10 were directly predicted using the effective spectral reflectance bands only it is noteworthy to mention that we recognized the effective and important spectral reflectance bands rs to predict kψ at all applied tensions using plots of b versus wavelength which were obtained from the plsr analysis see right hand side of fig 7 in these plots there is a possibility of existing positive or negative relationship between the reflectance values at peaks wavelengths and kψ therefore the reflectance values at all peaks wavelengths were selected as effective and important bands for developing sptfs to predict kψ all the recognized effective bands along with the basic soil properties except cce and som were imported to smlr models for k 15 and k 10 predictions by adding any basic soil properties all of the recognized effective spectral reflectance bands were disappeared from the models because the introduced rs showed a linear relationship with the effective basic soil properties therefore the basic soil properties and effective spectral reflectance bands were not combined for predicting k 15 and k 10 and consequently the stfs were developed eqs 19 and 20 on the other hand the basic soil properties and the recognized effective spectral reflectance bands were combined to predict k 5 and k 0 and therefore the sptfs were developed eqs 21 and 22 the accuracy of stfs for predicting k 15 and k 10 with smlr method was relatively low and similar to that of plsr spectra tables 8 and 9 the introduced ptfs showed higher validation r2 values by 41 and 13 in comparison to that of the developed stfs for predicting k 15 and k 10 respectively therefore the developed stf for predicting k 10 have relatively fair accuracy and can be applied as a relatively reliable method however a combination of basic soil properties and effective spectral reflectance bands using smlr method for developing sptfs provided more accurate predictions of k 5 and k 0 than the plsr spectra according to eq 21 the spectral reflectance bands at 1930 2100 2191 2238 and 2480 nm which all were effective to predict cce and som were coupled with dg σg sand ln sar and bd as additional variables for predicting k 5 furthermore the spectral reflectance bands at 592 1901 1927 and 2222 nm that also are related to cce and som contents were very effective and combined with σg ln sar ph and bd in the developed sptf to predict k 0 eq 22 therefore while the spectroscopy based methods alone seem not accurate to predict near saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity combining them with basic soil properties can be useful to predict kψ in calcareous soils the developed ptfs for predicting k 5 and k 0 increased the validation dataset r2 values by 9 8 and 14 5 in comparison to the developed sptfs therefore both k 5 and k 0 were predicted by sptfs with close agreement to ptfs there is no need to include cce and som in the sptf for predicting k 0 and k 5 this is beneficial as the measurements of these properties are time consuming expensive and require different hazardous chemicals e g acids bases oxidants and reductants in this regard xu et al 2017 showed that importing soil spectral data as additional inputs improved the performance of the ptfs for predicting k 0 increasing r2 by 0 33 fig 8 illustrates scatter plots of the stfs sptfs predicted kψ versus the observed values 3 6 hydraulic conductivity curve fig 9 illustrates curves of the measured and predicted by ptfs plsr spectra and stfs sptfs kψ as a function of the applied tensions along with their exponential trend line and their related equations that are related to the studied 102 locations as can be seen the mean values of kψ for a specific tension are very close in four plots therefore they show relatively similar trends and equations while in the previous parts we observed relatively weak to acceptable capability of the ptfs plsr spectra and stfs sptfs to predict kψ values according to the obtained results from fig 9 it can be concluded that if an approach e g plsr spectra in the present study even poorly predicted kψ the mean of all predicted values become close to the measured ones therefore when a developed ptf stf or sptf works moderately well to predict kψ in a small area e g a specific small land use or catchment it can be possible to have a kψ curve based on the mean values which is very close to the measured ones and can be used for modeling and managerial plans in regions which have a specific and reasonable ptfs for predicting kψ it can be recommended to use the mean value of predicted kψ by the available ptfs in several locations and then the obtained kψ curve based on the mean values be used for further managerial plans in addition results revealed that the measured k 15 k 10 and k 0 values belong to the high variability class cv 35 while all of the other obtained kψ values both the measured and predicted values belong to the moderate variability class 15 cv 35 based on the wilding 1985 classification guideline fig 9 the measured and the predicted kψ values ranked as k 0 k 15 k 10 k 5 in terms of their cv values the higher variability of kψ at saturated conditions compared to unsaturated conditions may be due to high variability of macropores which are so effective and important in measuring k 0 mozaffari et al 2022c similar results were also reported by moosavi and sepaskhah 2012a and mozaffari et al 2021a generally the cv values of k 5 and k 0 were ranked as the measured data ptfs sptfs plsr spectra while for k 15 and k 10 the determination approaches were ranked as the measured data ptfs stfs plsr spectra in terms of their cv values this shows that the ptfs are more reliable than the other studied approaches to predict kψ values 4 conclusion we showed that the smlr method was able to predict kψ relatively well using basic soil physical and chemical properties with validation dataset r2 values of 0 55 0 52 0 56 and 0 63 for k 15 k 10 k 5 and k 0 respectively it was demonstrated that soils with high values of som and low values of cce can absorb more and reflect less spectra in the vis nir range since som and cce increase and decrease the soil darkness respectively the plsr spectra poorly predicted ph r2 0 60 and rpd 1 5 while predicted clay content relatively well r2 0 60 and 1 5 rpd 2 and predicted cce and som contents excellently r2 0 80 and rpd 2 5 the plsr spectra also showed relatively low performance to predict kψ r2 0 60 and rpd 1 5 however k 0 with r2 and rpd values of 0 48 and 1 4 for the validation dataset was predicted with more accuracy than the other kψ s probably due to a better correlation with som according to the forward smlr approach basic soil properties were not added on top of spectral reflectance bands to predict k 15 and k 10 and spectral reflectance bands were thus the only inputs there was no difference in model performance between the developed stfs and the plsr spectra results to predict k 15 and k 10 while a combination of basic soil properties and spectral reflectance bands developed stronger smlr based models sptfs to predict k 5 and k 0 than the plsr spectra itself overall the accuracy of the studied methods to predict kψ were ranked as smlr based ptfs smlr based stfs plsr spectra for predicting k 15 and k 10 and smlr based ptfs smlr based sptfs plsr spectra for predicting k 5 and k 0 both developed sptfs for predicting k 5 and k 0 and developed stf for predicting k 10 can be used with relatively close agreement with ptfs regarding k 15 prediction we suggest to use related ptf the better performance of the ptfs can be due to using different attributes like psd representative parameters e g dg σg and silt and properties that are associated with soil structure e g cce ln sar som ph and bd to develop ptfs for predicting kψ these attributes and properties seem not fully recognizable with spectroscopy in vis nir range although spectral reflectance data can predict some important and basic parameters like cce and som with high accuracy their capability to predict kψ was lower than that of the mentioned chemical attributes therefore it can be suggested that the spectral reflectance data be used as additional inputs along with the basic soil properties to predict near saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity in comparison with just using the spectral data in order to achieve sptfs with low cost non destructive and fast measurement of independent variables we think the benefits of spectroscopy data for predicting hydraulic properties become more obvious when they completely substitute the basic soil attributes e g clay som and cce and are coupled with actual soil structure related parameters like tortuosity amounts of macropores mesopores and micropores etc however their measurements may also be time consuming and expensive therefore for further studies we suggest to combine actual soil structure related parameters with spectra to develop sptfs for predicting hydraulic properties credit authorship contribution statement hasan mozaffari methodology software validation writing original draft ali akbar moosavi

2951,climate change is increasing the threat of coastal flooding worldwide and the incorporation of tidal wetlands into coastal protection is being widely promoted these circumstances have motivated extensive research on wetland induced wave damping while its distribution across the frequency scales remains poorly understood here field observations during typhoon rumbia were adopted to examine the frequency dependent wave damping by a changjiang estuarine wetland which consists of a salt marsh followed seaward by an unvegetated mudflat under storm conditions the results showed that the typhoon produced waves with approximately trimodal spectra comprising low frequency swell 0 02 0 15 hz moderate frequency wind sea 0 15 0 48 hz and high frequency components 0 48 0 70 hz at the mudflat edge as the waves propagate landward across the mudflat and salt marsh the integral wave heights are successively attenuated by 16 and 32 and the wind sea waves continuously experienced the largest height attenuation mechanisms for the frequency dependent wave damping were explored by discriminating energy dissipation and nonlinear transfer and reconstructing wave spectra induced by each of them the frequency dependent wave damping by unvegetated mudflats is controlled by nonlinear energy transfer which shifts 10 of the gross energy from the wind sea to high frequency components the wind sea waves attenuation is increased by 66 but the high frequency wave attenuation is reduced by 88 compared with the regime controlled solely by direct dissipation direct dissipation regulates the frequency dependent wave damping across the salt marsh and the contribution of nonlinear energy transfer to height attenuation of the wave components is below 15 the similar regime but differing mechanisms by which the studied wetland units damp waves of different frequencies provide new insights for wetland wave interactions keywords frequency dependent wave damping height attenuation nonlinear energy transfer unvegetated mudflat salt marsh storm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal communities are facing increasing pressures from erosive waves sea level rise and strengthening storms arkema et al 2013 tessler et al 2015 in this context conventional engineering solutions e g seawalls and breakwaters for coastal protection are becoming less economically and ecologically sustainable in contrast the incorporation of natural coastal landforms such as tidal wetlands is being widely promoted temmerman et al 2013 morris et al 2018 to design hybrid schemes combining natural with artificial defence solutions an understanding of wave damping across tidal wetlands under storm conditions is critically required tidal wetlands in the mid high latitudes are often occupied by salt marsh vegetation e g comprising dense stands of salt tolerant plants on the inland side with unvegetated mudflats herein specifically referred to the mudflat regions hardly covered by salt marsh vegetation on the seaward side some studies have investigated the wave damping capabilities of these wetland units generally the main contributions fall into the attenuation of integral wave heights for summary see houser and hill 2010 leonardi et al 2018 it is widely acknowledged that waves lose energy primarily due to dissipation through bed friction as they propagate across unvegetated mudflats le hir et al 2000 and mostly due to the work exerted on vegetation across salt marshes dalrymple et al 1984 the heterogeneity of this wave damping mechanism has given rise to diverse integral wave height attenuation rates between the landforms with those of salt marshes potentially 1 2 magnitudes larger than those of unvegetated mudflats pinsky et al 2013 even so the role that unvegetated mudflats play in acting as a wave buffer is considered to be just as important as that played by salt marshes since unvegetated mudflats can attenuate passing waves by up to 50 across long propagation distances and thus limit the wave exposure of vulnerable salt marshes lacy and macvean 2016 the integral wave height attenuation across tidal wetlands is found to be dependent on the water depth and incident wave energy as well bouma et al 2005 houser and hill 2010 hu et al 2014 accordingly the effectiveness and estimation of the wetland induced wave damping during storm events when water levels and wave heights are highest he et al 2020 have been popular subjects of investigation möller et al 2014 paul et al 2016 vuik et al 2016 rupprecht et al 2017 garzon et al 2019 nevertheless although these studies have provided valuable information on how and how much waves are damped integrally they give little indication of how wave damping varies across the frequency scales the frequency variant characteristics of wave damping are also important as random waves just consist of components e g swell and wind sea with different amplitudes and frequencies holthuijsen 2007 however frequency dependent wave damping has often been studied on other vegetated or unvegetated beds but rarely on salt marshes and unvegetated mudflats related studies have suggested that unvegetated beds preferentially damp low frequency waves which can reach sufficient depths into the water column and interact significantly with the bed forristall and reece 1985 norheim et al 1998 by virtue of non dissipative nonlinear boussinesq models wave propagation on beaches involving nonlinear wave wave interactions has been systematically described e g herbers et al 2000 the results have shown that on beaches of both calm and storm weathers energy is transferred to poorly damped higher frequencies resulting in the strong decay of the incident wave energy spectral peak and the possible growth of high frequency waves little is known however about how and to what degree this nonlinear transferred energy impacts the frequency distribution of wave damping on unvegetated mudflats especially during storm periods on the other hand vegetations are acknowledged as low pass wave filters but the reported frequency that experiences the largest dissipation is diverse for example bradley and houser 2009 suggested that waves with frequencies 0 75 hz are preferentially damped by seagrass as the large phase disagreement between wave velocity and blade velocity at these frequencies leads to larger resistance similar regime was observed for eelgrass hansen and reidenbach 2012 relatively nowacki et al s 2017 observation also within eelgrass showed a regime of preferential lower frequency 0 50 0 60 hz wave damping this difference can be explained by the varying preferences i e for the dissipation of waves among vegetation types paul et al 2016 rupprecht et al 2017 or by the nonlinear energy transfer among wave components nowacki et al 2017 as for salt marshes of storm periods jadhav et al 2013 revealed a preferential damping of further lower frequency 0 20 0 30 hz waves while little information is related to the processes regulating this regime overall the details of the frequency dependent characteristics of wave damping by typical tidal wetlands with a combination of unvegetated mudflat and salt marsh against storm waves remain questionable to investigate this topic an instrumented transect was deployed across a tidal wetland in the changjiang estuary china fig 1 a and 1b to record waves during a typhoon event the main objectives of this study are to 1 identify the frequency dependent damping regimes of storm waves as they propagate successively across unvegetated mudflats and salt marshes 2 distinguish the key processes regulating the regimes by discriminations of energy dissipation and nonlinear transfer and 3 quantify the relative contributions of energy dissipation and transfer the findings of our study should enhance the understanding of frequency dependent wetland wave interactions and provide important information for the design of ecosystem based coastal defences 2 materials and methods 2 1 field observation field observations were conducted along a transverse section of eastern chongming a tidal wetland of the changjiang estuary china fig 1b the tides here are mesotidal with a spring tidal range of 3 5 4 0 m the waves monitored at the estuary front 5 m below the mean low water level of springs i e mlws exhibit a multiyear average height of 1 m yang et al 2008 typhoons frequently impact this region in summer and extreme wave heights of 6 m have been recorded yang et al 2012 a large area up to 44 km2 of eastern chongming is covered by marsh vegetation succeeded seaward by wide unvegetated mudflats which span an elevation of 0 2 6 m relative to mlws and a slope of 1 7 yang et al 2008 the bathymetric profile of our survey section is convex up and shows a transition from salt marsh to unvegetated mudflat around the offshore distance away from the seawall of 1 4 km fig 1c three instrumented stations located within the salt marsh s1 at the marsh front s2 and at the mudflat edge s3 in order of seaward succession were deployed fig 1c specifically observations at the mudflat edge s3 represent the incident wave conditions of the studied tidal wetland observations from station pairs of s2 s3 and s1 s2 are used to examine evolution of the waves propagating successively across the unvegetated mudflat and the salt marsh bed sediments along the section sampled every 15 m starting from s1 on august 16 2018 exhibit a seaward increasing medium size d50 which varies between 30 and 55 μm within s1 s3 fig 1d ripples with lengths and heights of cm scales are developed at all stations whose detailed layout is shown in fig 1e the unvegetated mudflat subsection exhibits a length of 120 m and elevation difference of 0 5 m the salt marsh subsection exhibiting a length of 15 m and elevation difference of 0 3 m is covered by scirpus triqueter the vegetation has a mean stem height of 0 7 m a mean stem diameter of 4 mm and a mean stem density of 1860 m2 based on quadrat 1 m 1 m surveys at each station the water depth h and waves were measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 6 0 mhz vector current meter nortek as norway during august 14 19 2018 fig 1f an adv can measure high frequency water pressures at an error of 0 1 koftis et al 2013 herein the adv at each station was set to work at a frequency of 16 hz for 10 min every 15 min burst mode with the pressure sensors positioned 0 55 m above bed level notably the observations were significantly impacted by typhoon rumbia which was a category 3 typhoon with a lowest central air pressure of 982 kpa and a largest central wind speed of 25 m s landed in the estuary on the morning of august 17 fig 2 2 2 data processing the adv measured high frequency pressure data were first converted into water surface elevations η the signal quality was good given a cor correlation approaching 100 and an snr signal to noise ratio approaching 60 during submergence fig 3 a a criterion of cor 80 or snr 30 was used to select exposed bursts the mean η of which represents air pressures air pressures during submergence were then extrapolated from these exposed bursts through linear interpolation fig 3b for each of the submerged bursts the air pressures were removed and the elevation of the pressure sensor hs recorded by the advs was added besides spikes in the high frequency η series of a burst were identified and corrected by cubic spline interpolation following mori et al 2007 this procedure was repeated 5 times to thoroughly exclude spikes fig 3c and 3d water depth h was calculated as the burst mean surface elevation subsequently the linear trend in the water surface elevation time series from each burst was removed and the residual time series were corrected for attenuation with depth below the water surface the low frequency cut off used for correction was set as 0 02 hz and the high frequency one for a burst was defined as foster martinez et al 2018 1 f h g 4 π h h s where g is the gravitational acceleration for each measurement burst the wave energy density spectrum e f and bispectrum b f1 f2 were estimated at a frequency resolution of 0 078 hz through fourier transforms of windowed 128 s long data segments with 50 overlap ninety five percent of the spectral energy was found to be distributed within the frequency range of 0 02 0 70 hz which was therefore set as the frequency range of e f and b f1 f2 the significant wave height h was calculated as 2 h 4 m 0 where mi f i e f d f is the ith moment to reduce the errors associated with the estimate of the peak wave period tp from the spectrum which is evaluated only at discrete values of frequency a high order weighted integral method was used young 1995 young and verhagen 1996 3 t p e f 5 d f f e f 5 d f the ursell number hl2 h3 where l g 2π t p 2 is the deep water wavelength was introduced as a measure of nonlinearity holthuijsen 2007 data screening was conducted to ensure that wave energy loss due to vegetation across the salt marsh or bed friction across the unvegetated mudflat is dominant the bursts characterized by deep water waves h l 0 5 when no wave bed interactions occurred were removed holthuijsen 2007 the bursts with h h 0 5 fig 4 a were also ignored from analysis to eliminate the effects of depth limited breaking jadhav and chen 2013 besides the percentage of breaking waves of a burst i e percentage of individual waves with zero crossing heights 0 44 h was analysed banner et al 2000 babanin et al 2001 bursts with such a percentage 15 fig 4b were removed as they might suffer significant impacts from white capping jadhav and chen 2013 this filtering procedure aiming at the breaking of individual waves is important as turbulence produced by breaking waves is found to act as an additional dissipation source shown by the general succession of breaking waves followed by weak waves fig 4c and 4d finally 231 bursts 77 bursts at each of the 3 stations during the typhoon event the 4th 7th tidal cycles in our observation were analysed 2 3 identification of frequency dependent wave damping wave damping is expressed by the percentage reduction of significant wave heights k 4 k h 0 h 1 h 0 where h0 and h1 are the significant wave heights at the seaward and landward stations respectively the kurtosis k of e f was also calculated to analyse variations in the shape of the energy spectrum to identify the frequency dependent damping characteristics k was calculated for different wave components i e swell wind sea and higher frequency waves whose significant wave heights hc were calculated as vincent et al 2019 5 h c 4 f min f max e f d f where fmin fmax is the frequency range of a component vincent et al 2019 treated the dividing frequency between sea and swell as a function of wind speed specifically for waves with fully developed wind sea waves as for our observations on tidal wetland the method of jadhav and chen 2013 to conduct a division based on the ensemble averaged e f of the incident waves was introduced a trough in the spectrum or where the slope of the spectral curve changes significantly which can be detected by the first order derivative of the spectral energy density can be regarded as the dividing frequencies fig 5 shows the division of different components from the wave records at the mudflat edge s3 herein since k represents the actual wave height reduction induced by all source terms this identified frequency dependent damping on landforms is an observed actual frequency dependent wave damping regime 2 4 discrimination of energy dissipation and nonlinear transfer the following equation holds for the energy balance holthuijsen 2007 6 e 1 f c g 1 e 0 f c g 0 x s d f where e0 f e1 f and cg 0 cg 1 cg nc is the group velocity n 1 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h is a coefficient c g k w tanh k h is the phase speed kw is the wavenumber and g is the gravitational acceleration are the energy spectra and group velocities at the seaward and landward stations x is the distance between stations and sd f is the observed actual dissipation spectrum from all source terms in this study wave reflection was considered to be small given the mild slope of the survey section wave refraction was believed to be small considering the limited alongshore depth variations and directional spreading and wind wave generation were assumed to be small because of the limited distance between stations thus sd f can be further decomposed into 7 s d f s dw f s nl f where sdw f represents the direct or pure dissipation term and snl f represents the nonlinear transfer term snl f is modelled by the integrals of the bispectrum b f1 f2 as herbers et al 2000 8 s nl f 3 π f 2 i m 0 f d f b 0 f f f h 0 b 1 f f f h 1 2 0 0 7 f d f b 0 f f h 0 b 1 f f h 1 where im indicates the imaginary part and b0 b1 and h0 h1 are the bispectra and water depths at the seaward and landward stations specifically b f1 f2 describes the energy exchange within the f1 f2 f1 f2 triad a positive im b f1 f2 indicates an energy transfer from the f1 and f2 components to the higher frequency f1 f2 component and vice versa the two terms in the im of equation 8 thus represent energy transfer from lower frequency pairs of f and f f components to the f component and from the f together with f component to higher frequency f f components respectively a negative snl f then indicates net energy loss at frequency f due to nonlinear wave wave interactions following herbers et al 2000 procedure only the ensemble averaged e f b f1 f2 and cg were applied to equations 6 8 to reduce modelling errors although sd f sdw f and snl f also provide information on how wave damping varies across the frequency scales these spectra which consider only the variations in the energy flux ecg are used mainly to examine the formation of the observed frequency dependent wave damping regime defined by k thanks to the rigid data screening to remove wave records suffering significant impacts from depth limited breaking and white capping see section 2 2 sdw f predominantly represents dissipation from 1 bed friction across the unvegetated mudflat and 2 vegetation drag across the salt marsh 2 5 energy spectrum reconstruction the outgoing wave energy spectra e f across the studied salt marsh or unvegetated mudflat induced solely by the nonlinear term snl f and direct dissipation sdw f were reconstructed then the relative contributions of these two terms to the observed frequency dependent wave damping regimes were quantified by comparing the reconstructed e f with the observed ones specifically the outgoing energy spectrum ecdw f induced solely by sdw is reconstructed as 9 e cdw 1 f c g 1 e 0 f c g 0 x s dw f where cg 1 represents the wave group velocity solely induced by sdw and is set as the group velocity at the landward station as a compromise e0 f and cg 0 are the actual energy spectrum and group velocity at the seaward station and sdw is the pure dissipation calculated from equation 6 the outgoing energy spectrum ecnl f induced solely by snl is reconstructed as 10 e cnl 1 f e 0 f e 1 f e cdw 1 f where e0 f and e1 f are the actual wave energy spectra at the seaward and landward stations equation 10 is derived from the following equation e 0 f e 1 f e 0 f e cdw 1 f e 0 f e cnl 1 f the cg 1 in equation 9 was directly calculated from the wave records see the instructions below equation 6 of the landward station assuming that variations in group velocity are mostly induced by sdw and suffer limited impacts from snl based on this assumption ecnl f can also be modelled as 11 e cnl 1 f c g 0 e 0 f c g 0 x s nl f the feasibility of the compromise in cg 1 calculation is examined by comparing ecnl f modelled by equations 9 10 with that by equation 11 the little difference between the modelling results fig 6 at the marsh front and within salt marsh demonstrated that our method is feasible an energy budget was further established for the mudflat marsh system to quantify how much energy is transferred δ e nl e 0 f e cnl 1 f d f or dissipated δ e dw e 0 f e cdw 1 f d f from each wave component obviously the net change in energy δ e should equal the sum of δ e nl and δ e dw the relative contributions of these two terms to height attenuations of the different wave components are also estimated by applying equation 5 to the reconstructed spectra 3 results 3 1 incident wave conditions at the mudflat edge typhoon rumbia which exhibited a central air pressure below 98 4 kpa and struck the estuary during medium neap tides produced winds exceeding 18 m s and waves with significant wave heights nearly three times those during the pre storm period fig 2 during the typhoon event the water depth ranged within 1 31 2 49 m at the mudflat edge and the incident waves were modulated by it showing a significant wave height of 0 42 0 93 m and a peak wave period of 1 99 4 73 s fig 2d 2e and 2f table 1 in addition the incident waves were largely nonlinear with ursell numbers reaching 354 the ensemble averaged energy spectrum of the incident waves was approximately trimodal with a primary peak at 0 30 hz a secondary peak at 0 12 hz and an upheaval at approximately 0 50 hz fig 5 three frequency bands representing low frequency swell 0 02 0 15 hz moderate frequency wind sea 0 15 0 48 hz and high frequency 0 48 0 70 hz components were divided the incident waves during the typhoon event were mainly composed of wind sea component whose significant wave height was 2 3 times larger than those of the other two components table 2 3 2 wave evolution across the unvegetated mudflat propagating across the unvegetated mudflat the waves both the entirety and components were mostly attenuated except for the frequent growth of the high frequency component with data points often located above the y x reference line in fig 7 a the integral wave heights decreased by 16 on average and height reductions of the swell wind sea and high frequency components were 17 18 and 2 respectively fig 7b table 2 the height reductions of the wave components generally decreased linearly with the water depth fig 8 a 8b and 8c nevertheless the observed frequency dependent wave damping regime persisted with a large attenuation of wind sea waves and swells and a limited attenuation of high frequency waves fig 7b similar to the wave heights the wave energy densities experienced strong decays within the wind sea component and even increased at frequencies 0 60 hz across the unvegetated mudflat fig 7c the incident wave energy spectrum was flattened with a decrease of 0 44 in the kurtosis and the observed dissipation spectrum generally followed its shape with a significant nonlinear relationship sd 0 4175e1 392 r2 0 98 fig 7c 7d and 8d the transfer of energy from the wind sea to high frequency components is intense as reflected by the negative nonlinear term within 0 20 0 40 hz but the positive term at higher frequencies fig 7d the direct dissipation showed less dependence on the incident wave energy and was basically uniformly distributed across the frequency scales fig 8e 3 3 wave evolution across the salt marsh the waves at the marsh front were still dominated by the wind sea component whose significant wave heights are twice as large as the other components fig 9 a and 9c table 2 as they moved landward across the salt marsh the integral wave heights decreased by 32 and the height reductions of the swell wind sea and high frequency components were 28 33 and 27 respectively fig 9b attenuation of the wave components decreased exponentially with the water depth and the observed height reductions weakened intensely with increasing water depth fig 10 a 10b and 10c even so the wind sea component continued to exhibit the relatively largest height attenuation especially under large water depths the wave energy spectrum suffered an overall decay across the salt marsh with the strongest decay located around the peak frequency and the spectrum kurtosis further decreased to 2 26 fig 9c likewise the observed dissipation spectrum was nonlinearly related to the incident wave energy spectrum sd 7 459e1 150 r2 1 00 but the observed dissipation rate was much larger relative to that on the unvegetated mudflat fig 9d and 10d the nonlinear transfer of energy from the wind sea to the high frequency components was also detected albeit one order of magnitude smaller than the observed dissipation fig 9d accordingly the direct dissipation spectrum and the observed dissipation spectrum were alike a significant and almost linear relationship sdw 8 935e1 002 r2 0 98 existed between the direct dissipation and the incident wave energy fig 10e 4 discussion 4 1 observed frequency dependent wave damping in this study both the unvegetated mudflat and the salt marsh show a preferential wind sea wave attenuation during the typhoon event fig 7b and 9b this frequency variant characteristic of wave damping is similar to jadhav et al s 2013 observation on spartina alterniflora marsh during storms given that the storm waves are composed mainly of wind sea waves fig 5 table 2 the similar frequency dependent wave damping regime shared by the studied wetland units should favour the attenuation of integral wave heights however few researchers have reported the discriminatory wave damping of natural tidal wetlands to maximize their induced integral wave height attenuation furthermore our observation reveals the defect of unvegetated mudflats in high frequency wave attenuation and the effectiveness of salt marshes in damping waves of variant frequencies fig 7b and 9b previous studies have suggested that the landform induced integral wave height reduction k depends greatly on the water depth h typically with relationships of k h a for unvegetated mudflats lacy and macvean 2016 and k e ah for salt marshes pinsky et al 2013 our study supports these findings by further demonstrating that attenuation of the wave components by these two wetland units mostly follows these patterns figs 8 and 10 the relatively weak dependence of wave attenuation on water depth across the unvegetated mudflats results from complicated bed wave interactions affected by factors not limited to water depth also including turbulence generated by micro topography and changes in bed sediment properties lacy and macvean 2016 in contrast the marsh induced wave attenuation is dominated by the vegetation drag which largely relies on the submergence status of the vegetation foster martinez et al 2018 and is thus highly related to water depth a marked decrease in wave height reductions should occur when the vegetation transformed from a status of emergence to submergence this is clearly demonstrated by foster martinez et al 2018 observation and is partly revealed by our records the three extremely high points in fig 10a 10b and 10c which are mainly in vegetation submergent period notably the difference between the mudflat and marsh induced wave height reductions diminishes as the water depth increases figs 8 and 10 while the observed frequency dependent wave damping regime stays stable fig 7b and 9b a coupled marsh flat wave damper is promoted given the complementation of unvegetated mudflats and salt marshes in damping waves both integrally and frequency dependently the relatively accessible unvegetated mudflats e g through siltation promotion projects should be utilized to attenuate the incoming waves and limit wave exposure of the relatively vulnerable salt marshes especially when water depth and wave height are extremely large as during storms in turn the salt marshes who are effective in damping waves at high frequencies provide some remedy to the unvegetated mudflats in high frequency wave attenuation 4 2 formation of frequency dependent wave damping regime as the storm waves propagate across the studied unvegetated mudflat and salt marsh the energy spectrum flattens and the observed dissipation is scaled by the incident wave energy figs 7 and 9 same as other unvegetated or vegetated beds e g elgar and raubenheimer 2008 nowacki et al 2017 the energy density decay and the observed dissipation maximize within the wind sea band herein echoing the observed preferential wind sea wave attenuation figs 7 and 9 nevertheless the underlying processes are different nonlinear energy transfer controls the frequency dependent wave damping on unvegetated mudflats during storms as shown in this study the strong decay of the spectral peak and the overall weak height reduction together with frequent growths of the high frequency waves both arise from the transferred energy from 0 20 to 0 40 hz to higher frequencies fig 7c and 7d this characteristic wave evolution regime dominated by nonlinear energy transfer has also been demonstrated on other unvegetated beds such as beaches elgar et al 1997 and muddy sea beds elgar and raubenheimer 2008 relative to the commonly believed high pass filter of unvegetated beds forristall and reece 1985 a large direct dissipation of high frequency waves which in general interact weakly with the bottom is observed herein fig 7d a similar phenomenon has been revealed by sheremet and stone 2003 and is attributed to the significant sediment resuspension during storms the presence of ripples and potential bed liquefaction under storm conditions might also contribute to the unexpected large dissipation at high frequencies tong et al 2020 direct dissipation of the incident wave components should regulate the frequency dependent wave damping on salt marshes under storm conditions given the limited nonlinear energy transfer fig 9d this pattern has been less reported as related studies e g bradley and houser 2009 jadhav et al 2013 generally stop at the observed dissipation a significant and almost linear energy dissipation relationship between the incident wave energy density and the direct dissipation rate is obtained after removing the nonlinear energy transfer fig 10e contrary to the unvegetated beds vegetations are generally acknowledged as low pass wave filters e g lowe et al 2007 correspondingly the studied salt marsh is shown to be less effective in dissipating swell than high frequency waves given the smaller direct dissipation rates absolute values of swell relative to high frequency waves under similar incident wave energy densities fig 10e for random waves of storm conditions wave properties should also play a role in the vegetation induced frequency dependent wave damping since the incident wave energy that scales the observed and direct dissipations differs widely among frequencies fig 9c and 10e the reported divergence regarding the wave frequency 0 75 hz or 0 50 0 60 hz where the largest dissipation occurs as waves propagate across the vegetated beds e g bradley and houser 2009 nowacki et al 2017 presumably results from the inconsistence in the incident wave conditions of these studies stem stiffness also plays a role in the observed frequency dependent wave damping regime as shown in rupprecht et al 2017 laboratory experiment flexible plants such as scirpus triqueter in the study herein should damp more long period waves than rigid ones under relatively intense hydrodynamics however the experiment just treats regular waves of a small period range 1 5 5 1 s limiting its validity to random waves or regular waves with lower higher frequencies 4 3 relative contributions of energy dissipation and transfer beyond the qualitative comparisons of the direct dissipation and nonlinear term offered in previous studies e g herbers et al 2000 elgar and raubenheimer 2008 the relative contributions of these two terms to the transformation of wave energy and the formation of the observed frequency dependent damping regime were quantified by reconstructing energy spectra induced solely by the nonlinear term snl f and direct dissipation sdw f an energy budget within the mudflat marsh system was thereout established fig 11 a 11b and 11c across the studied unvegetated mudflat the wind sea energy decreases by 26 ge the gross wave energy at s3 with 16 ge directly dissipated and 10 ge nonlinearly transferred to higher frequencies fig 11c this transferred energy further weakens the high frequency energy decrease to 1 ge despite a direct dissipation of 11 ge accordingly nonlinear energy transfer contributes to 40 of the observed height reduction of wind sea waves and limits that of the high frequency component to 2 or weakens the height reduction by 88 fig 11d across the studied salt marsh the wind sea waves suffer an energy decreases of 23 ge with 22 ge directly dissipated and 1 ge transferred and the high frequency energy decreases by 5 ge despite a direct dissipation of 6 ge fig 11c in response nonlinear energy transfer contributes to only 4 of the observed height reduction of wind sea waves and reduces that of the high frequency component by 15 fig 11e presumably nonlinear energy transfer though of a limited magnitude still plays a role in the high frequency wave damping across salt marshes 5 conclusion the present study sheds light on how and why the wave damping by tidal wetlands varies across the frequency scales under storm conditions based on observations during a typhoon event in the changjiang estuary the major findings include 1 the waves during the typhoon event were composed mainly of moderate frequency wind sea 0 15 0 48 hz waves as the waves propagate landward both the unvegetated mudflat and the salt marsh show a regime of preferential wind sea wave attenuation this discriminatory wave damping regime favours the attenuation of the integral storm wave heights given that the storm waves are composed mainly of wind sea waves 2 the frequency dependent wave damping across unvegetated and vegetated beds should be controlled by nonlinear energy transfer and direct dissipation respectively the preferential wind sea wave attenuation across the unvegetated mudflat is reached on account of strong nonlinear energy transfer and at the expense of poor high frequency wave attenuation the salt marsh exhibits a significant damping of wind sea waves by enlarging its direct dissipation in response to the large incident wind sea energy 3 the relative contributions of the direct dissipation and nonlinear energy transfer to the frequency dependent damping were quantified approximately 10 of the gross energy is transferred from the wind sea to high frequency components across the unvegetated mudflat contributing to 40 of wind sea wave attenuation and resulting in a reduction of high frequency wave attenuation by 88 compared with the regime controlled solely by direct dissipation though nonlinear energy transfer is limited across the salt marsh it still reduces high frequency wave attenuation by 15 4 a coupled marsh flat wave damper is promoted given the complementation of unvegetated mudflats and salt marshes in damping waves unvegetated mudflats can be utilized to limit wave exposure of the relatively vulnerable salt marshes especially when water depth and wave height are extremely large as during storms meanwhile salt marshes provide some remedy to the unvegetated mudflats in high frequency wave attenuation 5 this study reveals the general characteristics of unvegetated vegetated beds in damping waves of different frequencies under storm conditions and provides a spectrum reconstructing method to quantify the impacts from direct dissipation and nonlinear term future work would be conducted to explore the role of other terms on frequency dependent wave damping e g directional spreading and its changing process within the typhoon period e g in response to variations of plant stiffness credit

2951,climate change is increasing the threat of coastal flooding worldwide and the incorporation of tidal wetlands into coastal protection is being widely promoted these circumstances have motivated extensive research on wetland induced wave damping while its distribution across the frequency scales remains poorly understood here field observations during typhoon rumbia were adopted to examine the frequency dependent wave damping by a changjiang estuarine wetland which consists of a salt marsh followed seaward by an unvegetated mudflat under storm conditions the results showed that the typhoon produced waves with approximately trimodal spectra comprising low frequency swell 0 02 0 15 hz moderate frequency wind sea 0 15 0 48 hz and high frequency components 0 48 0 70 hz at the mudflat edge as the waves propagate landward across the mudflat and salt marsh the integral wave heights are successively attenuated by 16 and 32 and the wind sea waves continuously experienced the largest height attenuation mechanisms for the frequency dependent wave damping were explored by discriminating energy dissipation and nonlinear transfer and reconstructing wave spectra induced by each of them the frequency dependent wave damping by unvegetated mudflats is controlled by nonlinear energy transfer which shifts 10 of the gross energy from the wind sea to high frequency components the wind sea waves attenuation is increased by 66 but the high frequency wave attenuation is reduced by 88 compared with the regime controlled solely by direct dissipation direct dissipation regulates the frequency dependent wave damping across the salt marsh and the contribution of nonlinear energy transfer to height attenuation of the wave components is below 15 the similar regime but differing mechanisms by which the studied wetland units damp waves of different frequencies provide new insights for wetland wave interactions keywords frequency dependent wave damping height attenuation nonlinear energy transfer unvegetated mudflat salt marsh storm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal communities are facing increasing pressures from erosive waves sea level rise and strengthening storms arkema et al 2013 tessler et al 2015 in this context conventional engineering solutions e g seawalls and breakwaters for coastal protection are becoming less economically and ecologically sustainable in contrast the incorporation of natural coastal landforms such as tidal wetlands is being widely promoted temmerman et al 2013 morris et al 2018 to design hybrid schemes combining natural with artificial defence solutions an understanding of wave damping across tidal wetlands under storm conditions is critically required tidal wetlands in the mid high latitudes are often occupied by salt marsh vegetation e g comprising dense stands of salt tolerant plants on the inland side with unvegetated mudflats herein specifically referred to the mudflat regions hardly covered by salt marsh vegetation on the seaward side some studies have investigated the wave damping capabilities of these wetland units generally the main contributions fall into the attenuation of integral wave heights for summary see houser and hill 2010 leonardi et al 2018 it is widely acknowledged that waves lose energy primarily due to dissipation through bed friction as they propagate across unvegetated mudflats le hir et al 2000 and mostly due to the work exerted on vegetation across salt marshes dalrymple et al 1984 the heterogeneity of this wave damping mechanism has given rise to diverse integral wave height attenuation rates between the landforms with those of salt marshes potentially 1 2 magnitudes larger than those of unvegetated mudflats pinsky et al 2013 even so the role that unvegetated mudflats play in acting as a wave buffer is considered to be just as important as that played by salt marshes since unvegetated mudflats can attenuate passing waves by up to 50 across long propagation distances and thus limit the wave exposure of vulnerable salt marshes lacy and macvean 2016 the integral wave height attenuation across tidal wetlands is found to be dependent on the water depth and incident wave energy as well bouma et al 2005 houser and hill 2010 hu et al 2014 accordingly the effectiveness and estimation of the wetland induced wave damping during storm events when water levels and wave heights are highest he et al 2020 have been popular subjects of investigation möller et al 2014 paul et al 2016 vuik et al 2016 rupprecht et al 2017 garzon et al 2019 nevertheless although these studies have provided valuable information on how and how much waves are damped integrally they give little indication of how wave damping varies across the frequency scales the frequency variant characteristics of wave damping are also important as random waves just consist of components e g swell and wind sea with different amplitudes and frequencies holthuijsen 2007 however frequency dependent wave damping has often been studied on other vegetated or unvegetated beds but rarely on salt marshes and unvegetated mudflats related studies have suggested that unvegetated beds preferentially damp low frequency waves which can reach sufficient depths into the water column and interact significantly with the bed forristall and reece 1985 norheim et al 1998 by virtue of non dissipative nonlinear boussinesq models wave propagation on beaches involving nonlinear wave wave interactions has been systematically described e g herbers et al 2000 the results have shown that on beaches of both calm and storm weathers energy is transferred to poorly damped higher frequencies resulting in the strong decay of the incident wave energy spectral peak and the possible growth of high frequency waves little is known however about how and to what degree this nonlinear transferred energy impacts the frequency distribution of wave damping on unvegetated mudflats especially during storm periods on the other hand vegetations are acknowledged as low pass wave filters but the reported frequency that experiences the largest dissipation is diverse for example bradley and houser 2009 suggested that waves with frequencies 0 75 hz are preferentially damped by seagrass as the large phase disagreement between wave velocity and blade velocity at these frequencies leads to larger resistance similar regime was observed for eelgrass hansen and reidenbach 2012 relatively nowacki et al s 2017 observation also within eelgrass showed a regime of preferential lower frequency 0 50 0 60 hz wave damping this difference can be explained by the varying preferences i e for the dissipation of waves among vegetation types paul et al 2016 rupprecht et al 2017 or by the nonlinear energy transfer among wave components nowacki et al 2017 as for salt marshes of storm periods jadhav et al 2013 revealed a preferential damping of further lower frequency 0 20 0 30 hz waves while little information is related to the processes regulating this regime overall the details of the frequency dependent characteristics of wave damping by typical tidal wetlands with a combination of unvegetated mudflat and salt marsh against storm waves remain questionable to investigate this topic an instrumented transect was deployed across a tidal wetland in the changjiang estuary china fig 1 a and 1b to record waves during a typhoon event the main objectives of this study are to 1 identify the frequency dependent damping regimes of storm waves as they propagate successively across unvegetated mudflats and salt marshes 2 distinguish the key processes regulating the regimes by discriminations of energy dissipation and nonlinear transfer and 3 quantify the relative contributions of energy dissipation and transfer the findings of our study should enhance the understanding of frequency dependent wetland wave interactions and provide important information for the design of ecosystem based coastal defences 2 materials and methods 2 1 field observation field observations were conducted along a transverse section of eastern chongming a tidal wetland of the changjiang estuary china fig 1b the tides here are mesotidal with a spring tidal range of 3 5 4 0 m the waves monitored at the estuary front 5 m below the mean low water level of springs i e mlws exhibit a multiyear average height of 1 m yang et al 2008 typhoons frequently impact this region in summer and extreme wave heights of 6 m have been recorded yang et al 2012 a large area up to 44 km2 of eastern chongming is covered by marsh vegetation succeeded seaward by wide unvegetated mudflats which span an elevation of 0 2 6 m relative to mlws and a slope of 1 7 yang et al 2008 the bathymetric profile of our survey section is convex up and shows a transition from salt marsh to unvegetated mudflat around the offshore distance away from the seawall of 1 4 km fig 1c three instrumented stations located within the salt marsh s1 at the marsh front s2 and at the mudflat edge s3 in order of seaward succession were deployed fig 1c specifically observations at the mudflat edge s3 represent the incident wave conditions of the studied tidal wetland observations from station pairs of s2 s3 and s1 s2 are used to examine evolution of the waves propagating successively across the unvegetated mudflat and the salt marsh bed sediments along the section sampled every 15 m starting from s1 on august 16 2018 exhibit a seaward increasing medium size d50 which varies between 30 and 55 μm within s1 s3 fig 1d ripples with lengths and heights of cm scales are developed at all stations whose detailed layout is shown in fig 1e the unvegetated mudflat subsection exhibits a length of 120 m and elevation difference of 0 5 m the salt marsh subsection exhibiting a length of 15 m and elevation difference of 0 3 m is covered by scirpus triqueter the vegetation has a mean stem height of 0 7 m a mean stem diameter of 4 mm and a mean stem density of 1860 m2 based on quadrat 1 m 1 m surveys at each station the water depth h and waves were measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 6 0 mhz vector current meter nortek as norway during august 14 19 2018 fig 1f an adv can measure high frequency water pressures at an error of 0 1 koftis et al 2013 herein the adv at each station was set to work at a frequency of 16 hz for 10 min every 15 min burst mode with the pressure sensors positioned 0 55 m above bed level notably the observations were significantly impacted by typhoon rumbia which was a category 3 typhoon with a lowest central air pressure of 982 kpa and a largest central wind speed of 25 m s landed in the estuary on the morning of august 17 fig 2 2 2 data processing the adv measured high frequency pressure data were first converted into water surface elevations η the signal quality was good given a cor correlation approaching 100 and an snr signal to noise ratio approaching 60 during submergence fig 3 a a criterion of cor 80 or snr 30 was used to select exposed bursts the mean η of which represents air pressures air pressures during submergence were then extrapolated from these exposed bursts through linear interpolation fig 3b for each of the submerged bursts the air pressures were removed and the elevation of the pressure sensor hs recorded by the advs was added besides spikes in the high frequency η series of a burst were identified and corrected by cubic spline interpolation following mori et al 2007 this procedure was repeated 5 times to thoroughly exclude spikes fig 3c and 3d water depth h was calculated as the burst mean surface elevation subsequently the linear trend in the water surface elevation time series from each burst was removed and the residual time series were corrected for attenuation with depth below the water surface the low frequency cut off used for correction was set as 0 02 hz and the high frequency one for a burst was defined as foster martinez et al 2018 1 f h g 4 π h h s where g is the gravitational acceleration for each measurement burst the wave energy density spectrum e f and bispectrum b f1 f2 were estimated at a frequency resolution of 0 078 hz through fourier transforms of windowed 128 s long data segments with 50 overlap ninety five percent of the spectral energy was found to be distributed within the frequency range of 0 02 0 70 hz which was therefore set as the frequency range of e f and b f1 f2 the significant wave height h was calculated as 2 h 4 m 0 where mi f i e f d f is the ith moment to reduce the errors associated with the estimate of the peak wave period tp from the spectrum which is evaluated only at discrete values of frequency a high order weighted integral method was used young 1995 young and verhagen 1996 3 t p e f 5 d f f e f 5 d f the ursell number hl2 h3 where l g 2π t p 2 is the deep water wavelength was introduced as a measure of nonlinearity holthuijsen 2007 data screening was conducted to ensure that wave energy loss due to vegetation across the salt marsh or bed friction across the unvegetated mudflat is dominant the bursts characterized by deep water waves h l 0 5 when no wave bed interactions occurred were removed holthuijsen 2007 the bursts with h h 0 5 fig 4 a were also ignored from analysis to eliminate the effects of depth limited breaking jadhav and chen 2013 besides the percentage of breaking waves of a burst i e percentage of individual waves with zero crossing heights 0 44 h was analysed banner et al 2000 babanin et al 2001 bursts with such a percentage 15 fig 4b were removed as they might suffer significant impacts from white capping jadhav and chen 2013 this filtering procedure aiming at the breaking of individual waves is important as turbulence produced by breaking waves is found to act as an additional dissipation source shown by the general succession of breaking waves followed by weak waves fig 4c and 4d finally 231 bursts 77 bursts at each of the 3 stations during the typhoon event the 4th 7th tidal cycles in our observation were analysed 2 3 identification of frequency dependent wave damping wave damping is expressed by the percentage reduction of significant wave heights k 4 k h 0 h 1 h 0 where h0 and h1 are the significant wave heights at the seaward and landward stations respectively the kurtosis k of e f was also calculated to analyse variations in the shape of the energy spectrum to identify the frequency dependent damping characteristics k was calculated for different wave components i e swell wind sea and higher frequency waves whose significant wave heights hc were calculated as vincent et al 2019 5 h c 4 f min f max e f d f where fmin fmax is the frequency range of a component vincent et al 2019 treated the dividing frequency between sea and swell as a function of wind speed specifically for waves with fully developed wind sea waves as for our observations on tidal wetland the method of jadhav and chen 2013 to conduct a division based on the ensemble averaged e f of the incident waves was introduced a trough in the spectrum or where the slope of the spectral curve changes significantly which can be detected by the first order derivative of the spectral energy density can be regarded as the dividing frequencies fig 5 shows the division of different components from the wave records at the mudflat edge s3 herein since k represents the actual wave height reduction induced by all source terms this identified frequency dependent damping on landforms is an observed actual frequency dependent wave damping regime 2 4 discrimination of energy dissipation and nonlinear transfer the following equation holds for the energy balance holthuijsen 2007 6 e 1 f c g 1 e 0 f c g 0 x s d f where e0 f e1 f and cg 0 cg 1 cg nc is the group velocity n 1 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h is a coefficient c g k w tanh k h is the phase speed kw is the wavenumber and g is the gravitational acceleration are the energy spectra and group velocities at the seaward and landward stations x is the distance between stations and sd f is the observed actual dissipation spectrum from all source terms in this study wave reflection was considered to be small given the mild slope of the survey section wave refraction was believed to be small considering the limited alongshore depth variations and directional spreading and wind wave generation were assumed to be small because of the limited distance between stations thus sd f can be further decomposed into 7 s d f s dw f s nl f where sdw f represents the direct or pure dissipation term and snl f represents the nonlinear transfer term snl f is modelled by the integrals of the bispectrum b f1 f2 as herbers et al 2000 8 s nl f 3 π f 2 i m 0 f d f b 0 f f f h 0 b 1 f f f h 1 2 0 0 7 f d f b 0 f f h 0 b 1 f f h 1 where im indicates the imaginary part and b0 b1 and h0 h1 are the bispectra and water depths at the seaward and landward stations specifically b f1 f2 describes the energy exchange within the f1 f2 f1 f2 triad a positive im b f1 f2 indicates an energy transfer from the f1 and f2 components to the higher frequency f1 f2 component and vice versa the two terms in the im of equation 8 thus represent energy transfer from lower frequency pairs of f and f f components to the f component and from the f together with f component to higher frequency f f components respectively a negative snl f then indicates net energy loss at frequency f due to nonlinear wave wave interactions following herbers et al 2000 procedure only the ensemble averaged e f b f1 f2 and cg were applied to equations 6 8 to reduce modelling errors although sd f sdw f and snl f also provide information on how wave damping varies across the frequency scales these spectra which consider only the variations in the energy flux ecg are used mainly to examine the formation of the observed frequency dependent wave damping regime defined by k thanks to the rigid data screening to remove wave records suffering significant impacts from depth limited breaking and white capping see section 2 2 sdw f predominantly represents dissipation from 1 bed friction across the unvegetated mudflat and 2 vegetation drag across the salt marsh 2 5 energy spectrum reconstruction the outgoing wave energy spectra e f across the studied salt marsh or unvegetated mudflat induced solely by the nonlinear term snl f and direct dissipation sdw f were reconstructed then the relative contributions of these two terms to the observed frequency dependent wave damping regimes were quantified by comparing the reconstructed e f with the observed ones specifically the outgoing energy spectrum ecdw f induced solely by sdw is reconstructed as 9 e cdw 1 f c g 1 e 0 f c g 0 x s dw f where cg 1 represents the wave group velocity solely induced by sdw and is set as the group velocity at the landward station as a compromise e0 f and cg 0 are the actual energy spectrum and group velocity at the seaward station and sdw is the pure dissipation calculated from equation 6 the outgoing energy spectrum ecnl f induced solely by snl is reconstructed as 10 e cnl 1 f e 0 f e 1 f e cdw 1 f where e0 f and e1 f are the actual wave energy spectra at the seaward and landward stations equation 10 is derived from the following equation e 0 f e 1 f e 0 f e cdw 1 f e 0 f e cnl 1 f the cg 1 in equation 9 was directly calculated from the wave records see the instructions below equation 6 of the landward station assuming that variations in group velocity are mostly induced by sdw and suffer limited impacts from snl based on this assumption ecnl f can also be modelled as 11 e cnl 1 f c g 0 e 0 f c g 0 x s nl f the feasibility of the compromise in cg 1 calculation is examined by comparing ecnl f modelled by equations 9 10 with that by equation 11 the little difference between the modelling results fig 6 at the marsh front and within salt marsh demonstrated that our method is feasible an energy budget was further established for the mudflat marsh system to quantify how much energy is transferred δ e nl e 0 f e cnl 1 f d f or dissipated δ e dw e 0 f e cdw 1 f d f from each wave component obviously the net change in energy δ e should equal the sum of δ e nl and δ e dw the relative contributions of these two terms to height attenuations of the different wave components are also estimated by applying equation 5 to the reconstructed spectra 3 results 3 1 incident wave conditions at the mudflat edge typhoon rumbia which exhibited a central air pressure below 98 4 kpa and struck the estuary during medium neap tides produced winds exceeding 18 m s and waves with significant wave heights nearly three times those during the pre storm period fig 2 during the typhoon event the water depth ranged within 1 31 2 49 m at the mudflat edge and the incident waves were modulated by it showing a significant wave height of 0 42 0 93 m and a peak wave period of 1 99 4 73 s fig 2d 2e and 2f table 1 in addition the incident waves were largely nonlinear with ursell numbers reaching 354 the ensemble averaged energy spectrum of the incident waves was approximately trimodal with a primary peak at 0 30 hz a secondary peak at 0 12 hz and an upheaval at approximately 0 50 hz fig 5 three frequency bands representing low frequency swell 0 02 0 15 hz moderate frequency wind sea 0 15 0 48 hz and high frequency 0 48 0 70 hz components were divided the incident waves during the typhoon event were mainly composed of wind sea component whose significant wave height was 2 3 times larger than those of the other two components table 2 3 2 wave evolution across the unvegetated mudflat propagating across the unvegetated mudflat the waves both the entirety and components were mostly attenuated except for the frequent growth of the high frequency component with data points often located above the y x reference line in fig 7 a the integral wave heights decreased by 16 on average and height reductions of the swell wind sea and high frequency components were 17 18 and 2 respectively fig 7b table 2 the height reductions of the wave components generally decreased linearly with the water depth fig 8 a 8b and 8c nevertheless the observed frequency dependent wave damping regime persisted with a large attenuation of wind sea waves and swells and a limited attenuation of high frequency waves fig 7b similar to the wave heights the wave energy densities experienced strong decays within the wind sea component and even increased at frequencies 0 60 hz across the unvegetated mudflat fig 7c the incident wave energy spectrum was flattened with a decrease of 0 44 in the kurtosis and the observed dissipation spectrum generally followed its shape with a significant nonlinear relationship sd 0 4175e1 392 r2 0 98 fig 7c 7d and 8d the transfer of energy from the wind sea to high frequency components is intense as reflected by the negative nonlinear term within 0 20 0 40 hz but the positive term at higher frequencies fig 7d the direct dissipation showed less dependence on the incident wave energy and was basically uniformly distributed across the frequency scales fig 8e 3 3 wave evolution across the salt marsh the waves at the marsh front were still dominated by the wind sea component whose significant wave heights are twice as large as the other components fig 9 a and 9c table 2 as they moved landward across the salt marsh the integral wave heights decreased by 32 and the height reductions of the swell wind sea and high frequency components were 28 33 and 27 respectively fig 9b attenuation of the wave components decreased exponentially with the water depth and the observed height reductions weakened intensely with increasing water depth fig 10 a 10b and 10c even so the wind sea component continued to exhibit the relatively largest height attenuation especially under large water depths the wave energy spectrum suffered an overall decay across the salt marsh with the strongest decay located around the peak frequency and the spectrum kurtosis further decreased to 2 26 fig 9c likewise the observed dissipation spectrum was nonlinearly related to the incident wave energy spectrum sd 7 459e1 150 r2 1 00 but the observed dissipation rate was much larger relative to that on the unvegetated mudflat fig 9d and 10d the nonlinear transfer of energy from the wind sea to the high frequency components was also detected albeit one order of magnitude smaller than the observed dissipation fig 9d accordingly the direct dissipation spectrum and the observed dissipation spectrum were alike a significant and almost linear relationship sdw 8 935e1 002 r2 0 98 existed between the direct dissipation and the incident wave energy fig 10e 4 discussion 4 1 observed frequency dependent wave damping in this study both the unvegetated mudflat and the salt marsh show a preferential wind sea wave attenuation during the typhoon event fig 7b and 9b this frequency variant characteristic of wave damping is similar to jadhav et al s 2013 observation on spartina alterniflora marsh during storms given that the storm waves are composed mainly of wind sea waves fig 5 table 2 the similar frequency dependent wave damping regime shared by the studied wetland units should favour the attenuation of integral wave heights however few researchers have reported the discriminatory wave damping of natural tidal wetlands to maximize their induced integral wave height attenuation furthermore our observation reveals the defect of unvegetated mudflats in high frequency wave attenuation and the effectiveness of salt marshes in damping waves of variant frequencies fig 7b and 9b previous studies have suggested that the landform induced integral wave height reduction k depends greatly on the water depth h typically with relationships of k h a for unvegetated mudflats lacy and macvean 2016 and k e ah for salt marshes pinsky et al 2013 our study supports these findings by further demonstrating that attenuation of the wave components by these two wetland units mostly follows these patterns figs 8 and 10 the relatively weak dependence of wave attenuation on water depth across the unvegetated mudflats results from complicated bed wave interactions affected by factors not limited to water depth also including turbulence generated by micro topography and changes in bed sediment properties lacy and macvean 2016 in contrast the marsh induced wave attenuation is dominated by the vegetation drag which largely relies on the submergence status of the vegetation foster martinez et al 2018 and is thus highly related to water depth a marked decrease in wave height reductions should occur when the vegetation transformed from a status of emergence to submergence this is clearly demonstrated by foster martinez et al 2018 observation and is partly revealed by our records the three extremely high points in fig 10a 10b and 10c which are mainly in vegetation submergent period notably the difference between the mudflat and marsh induced wave height reductions diminishes as the water depth increases figs 8 and 10 while the observed frequency dependent wave damping regime stays stable fig 7b and 9b a coupled marsh flat wave damper is promoted given the complementation of unvegetated mudflats and salt marshes in damping waves both integrally and frequency dependently the relatively accessible unvegetated mudflats e g through siltation promotion projects should be utilized to attenuate the incoming waves and limit wave exposure of the relatively vulnerable salt marshes especially when water depth and wave height are extremely large as during storms in turn the salt marshes who are effective in damping waves at high frequencies provide some remedy to the unvegetated mudflats in high frequency wave attenuation 4 2 formation of frequency dependent wave damping regime as the storm waves propagate across the studied unvegetated mudflat and salt marsh the energy spectrum flattens and the observed dissipation is scaled by the incident wave energy figs 7 and 9 same as other unvegetated or vegetated beds e g elgar and raubenheimer 2008 nowacki et al 2017 the energy density decay and the observed dissipation maximize within the wind sea band herein echoing the observed preferential wind sea wave attenuation figs 7 and 9 nevertheless the underlying processes are different nonlinear energy transfer controls the frequency dependent wave damping on unvegetated mudflats during storms as shown in this study the strong decay of the spectral peak and the overall weak height reduction together with frequent growths of the high frequency waves both arise from the transferred energy from 0 20 to 0 40 hz to higher frequencies fig 7c and 7d this characteristic wave evolution regime dominated by nonlinear energy transfer has also been demonstrated on other unvegetated beds such as beaches elgar et al 1997 and muddy sea beds elgar and raubenheimer 2008 relative to the commonly believed high pass filter of unvegetated beds forristall and reece 1985 a large direct dissipation of high frequency waves which in general interact weakly with the bottom is observed herein fig 7d a similar phenomenon has been revealed by sheremet and stone 2003 and is attributed to the significant sediment resuspension during storms the presence of ripples and potential bed liquefaction under storm conditions might also contribute to the unexpected large dissipation at high frequencies tong et al 2020 direct dissipation of the incident wave components should regulate the frequency dependent wave damping on salt marshes under storm conditions given the limited nonlinear energy transfer fig 9d this pattern has been less reported as related studies e g bradley and houser 2009 jadhav et al 2013 generally stop at the observed dissipation a significant and almost linear energy dissipation relationship between the incident wave energy density and the direct dissipation rate is obtained after removing the nonlinear energy transfer fig 10e contrary to the unvegetated beds vegetations are generally acknowledged as low pass wave filters e g lowe et al 2007 correspondingly the studied salt marsh is shown to be less effective in dissipating swell than high frequency waves given the smaller direct dissipation rates absolute values of swell relative to high frequency waves under similar incident wave energy densities fig 10e for random waves of storm conditions wave properties should also play a role in the vegetation induced frequency dependent wave damping since the incident wave energy that scales the observed and direct dissipations differs widely among frequencies fig 9c and 10e the reported divergence regarding the wave frequency 0 75 hz or 0 50 0 60 hz where the largest dissipation occurs as waves propagate across the vegetated beds e g bradley and houser 2009 nowacki et al 2017 presumably results from the inconsistence in the incident wave conditions of these studies stem stiffness also plays a role in the observed frequency dependent wave damping regime as shown in rupprecht et al 2017 laboratory experiment flexible plants such as scirpus triqueter in the study herein should damp more long period waves than rigid ones under relatively intense hydrodynamics however the experiment just treats regular waves of a small period range 1 5 5 1 s limiting its validity to random waves or regular waves with lower higher frequencies 4 3 relative contributions of energy dissipation and transfer beyond the qualitative comparisons of the direct dissipation and nonlinear term offered in previous studies e g herbers et al 2000 elgar and raubenheimer 2008 the relative contributions of these two terms to the transformation of wave energy and the formation of the observed frequency dependent damping regime were quantified by reconstructing energy spectra induced solely by the nonlinear term snl f and direct dissipation sdw f an energy budget within the mudflat marsh system was thereout established fig 11 a 11b and 11c across the studied unvegetated mudflat the wind sea energy decreases by 26 ge the gross wave energy at s3 with 16 ge directly dissipated and 10 ge nonlinearly transferred to higher frequencies fig 11c this transferred energy further weakens the high frequency energy decrease to 1 ge despite a direct dissipation of 11 ge accordingly nonlinear energy transfer contributes to 40 of the observed height reduction of wind sea waves and limits that of the high frequency component to 2 or weakens the height reduction by 88 fig 11d across the studied salt marsh the wind sea waves suffer an energy decreases of 23 ge with 22 ge directly dissipated and 1 ge transferred and the high frequency energy decreases by 5 ge despite a direct dissipation of 6 ge fig 11c in response nonlinear energy transfer contributes to only 4 of the observed height reduction of wind sea waves and reduces that of the high frequency component by 15 fig 11e presumably nonlinear energy transfer though of a limited magnitude still plays a role in the high frequency wave damping across salt marshes 5 conclusion the present study sheds light on how and why the wave damping by tidal wetlands varies across the frequency scales under storm conditions based on observations during a typhoon event in the changjiang estuary the major findings include 1 the waves during the typhoon event were composed mainly of moderate frequency wind sea 0 15 0 48 hz waves as the waves propagate landward both the unvegetated mudflat and the salt marsh show a regime of preferential wind sea wave attenuation this discriminatory wave damping regime favours the attenuation of the integral storm wave heights given that the storm waves are composed mainly of wind sea waves 2 the frequency dependent wave damping across unvegetated and vegetated beds should be controlled by nonlinear energy transfer and direct dissipation respectively the preferential wind sea wave attenuation across the unvegetated mudflat is reached on account of strong nonlinear energy transfer and at the expense of poor high frequency wave attenuation the salt marsh exhibits a significant damping of wind sea waves by enlarging its direct dissipation in response to the large incident wind sea energy 3 the relative contributions of the direct dissipation and nonlinear energy transfer to the frequency dependent damping were quantified approximately 10 of the gross energy is transferred from the wind sea to high frequency components across the unvegetated mudflat contributing to 40 of wind sea wave attenuation and resulting in a reduction of high frequency wave attenuation by 88 compared with the regime controlled solely by direct dissipation though nonlinear energy transfer is limited across the salt marsh it still reduces high frequency wave attenuation by 15 4 a coupled marsh flat wave damper is promoted given the complementation of unvegetated mudflats and salt marshes in damping waves unvegetated mudflats can be utilized to limit wave exposure of the relatively vulnerable salt marshes especially when water depth and wave height are extremely large as during storms meanwhile salt marshes provide some remedy to the unvegetated mudflats in high frequency wave attenuation 5 this study reveals the general characteristics of unvegetated vegetated beds in damping waves of different frequencies under storm conditions and provides a spectrum reconstructing method to quantify the impacts from direct dissipation and nonlinear term future work would be conducted to explore the role of other terms on frequency dependent wave damping e g directional spreading and its changing process within the typhoon period e g in response to variations of plant stiffness credit

2952,the wide occurrence of high iodine groundwater is posing negative effects on human health the land subsidence due to groundwater over exploitation causes the release of iodine rich pore water trapped in clayey sediment into groundwater however the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in pore water were still unclear in this study we selected the datong basin db and north china plain ncp with few and severe land subsidence respectively to understand the contributions of complex hydro biogeochemical processes on the enrichment of iodine in groundwater and pore water by using the inorganic organic carbon isotope and batch experiments the results showed that at the db the range of groundwater iodine was 4 2175 µg l and the enrichment of groundwater iodine is mainly related to the transformation of iron oxyhydroxides triggered by microbial degradation of organic matter which was reflected by the more depleted δ13cdic signatures of groundwater and gradual increasing trend of ratio of hcl extractable fe ii sediment fetotal and sediment δ13cdoc signatures with depth in comparison groundwater iodine at the ncp had the range of 2 1106 µg l and pore water rich in iodine preserved in the clayey sediment serves as the main source the depth profiles of sediment iron mineral fractions and δ13cdoc signatures suggested that the ncp sediments experienced lower degree of reductive transformation of iron minerals and microbial degradation of natural organic matter at some specific depths higher than 300 m the evident higher ratios of hcl extractable fe ii sediment fetotal indicate that the local transformation of iron minerals can explain the pore water rich in iodine at deep sediments which was supported by the results of microbial batch experiments the pore water with high iodine concentration preserved in the shallow sediment is more likely related to the marine transgressions this study helps to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of high iodine groundwater which may provide some new insights on further groundwater management keywords iodine groundwater datong basin north china plain hydrogeochemistry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction iodine has long been recognized as a key determinant in regulating thyroid hormones in china the drinking water rich in natural geogenic iodine serves as one of the important iodine sources especially in the northern china and it was estimated that almost 31 million people throughout 11 provinces in china are being exposed to excessive iodine uptake including anhui beijing fujian hebei henan jiangsu inner mongolia shandong shanxi tianjin and xinjiang liu et al 2022 shen et al 2011 xu et al 2016 globally it is reported that the groundwater from algeria argentina japan and denmark had anomalously high iodine concentrations wang et al 2020 long term exposure to iodine rich groundwater can cause thyroid diseases due to thyroid autoimmunity rong et al 2018 teng et al 2006 previous studies have documented that the geological deposits rich in iodine were generally considered as the sources of groundwater iodine such as the deposits affected by seawater at the coastal areas and the lacustrine deposits rich in organic matter and iodine at some inland areas li et al 2013 xue et al 2019a it is commonly accepted that the fractions of natural organic matter and iron minerals in soils sediments serve as the important iodine sink which is primarily in the form of relatively immobile organic iodine englund et al 2010 hansen et al 2011 yeager et al 2017 the soil sediments rich in organic matter tend to be rich in iodine due to the great ability to retain iodine shetaya et al 2012 xu et al 2012 in sediment from hanford site organic carbon was considered to be responsible for 57 1 90 6 of sediment iodine xu et al 2015 the enrichment of iodine in groundwater is heavily dependent on the physiochemical environment and biological properties of the surrounding groundwater system microorganisms play key roles in the release of soil sediment iodine and changes of iodine species and the iodide resulting from the biotic abiotic reduction of iodate and organic iodine is the thermodynamically stable form of groundwater iodine under the general ph and eh conditions of the groundwater system and promotes its enrichment amachi et al 2007 amachi et al 2010 hu et al 2012 li et al 2013 li et al 2017 besides the complex bio hydrogeochemical processes it has been reported that human activities also promote the enrichment of groundwater iodine at the north china plain the land subsidence caused by groundwater over exploitation can lead to the release of iodine rich pore water trapped in the clayey sediment into groundwater thereby elevating the groundwater iodine concentration xue et al 2019a however the deep mechanisms causing the enrichment of iodine in the pore water of clayey sediment are still unclear as mentioned above natural organic carbon plays an important role in the hydrogeochemical behaviors of iodine in the groundwater system cycling of inorganic organic carbon in groundwater systems can be reconstructed from inorganic organic carbon isotope records the different sources of groundwater inorganic carbon exhibit the inorganic carbon isotope 13cdic differently due to the distinct isotopic compositions of major carbon reservoirs such as 8 for atmospheric co2 28 for co2 released during the decomposition of organic matter within the aquifer sediments 15 for groundwater evolving from soils co2 and 14 6 to 1 1 for freshwater carbonates of the aquifer clark and fritz 1997 jin et al 2014 porowska 2015 when the organic carbon serves as the electron donor of microbes the resulting groundwater δ13cdic depends on the organic carbon pools and biodegradation degree of organic carbon the co2 derived from the respiration of natural organic carbon leads to a negative shift in water δ13cdic the initial δ13cdic for groundwater from c4 plants is about 23 if no carbonate weathering is involved while that from c3 plants can be down 26 schulte et al 2011 at the datong basin db and north china plain ncp which had the typical occurrence of high iodine groundwater iodine 100 µg l the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in groundwater were considered to be burial dissolution type and compaction release type respectively li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 xue et al 2019a at the db the sediment iodine serves as the main source of groundwater iodine and under the favorable environment such as the stable reducing conditions the reductive dissolution of iodine loading iron minerals and natural organic matter and the transformation of iodine species promotes the release of sediment iodine into groundwater li et al 2020 at the ncp the iodine concentration in pore water of sediment can be up to 830 µg l serving as the main source of groundwater iodine xue et al 2019a the land subsidence related to the groundwater over pumping causes the release of iodine rich pore water into the aquifer thereby elevating the concentration of groundwater iodine however sources of pore water iodine and the roles of hydro biogeochemical processes for iodine enrichment in pore water are still unknown this study reveals the iodine related hydro biogeochemical processes based on the results of groundwater inorganic carbon isotope sediment organic carbon isotope and microbial batch experiments the objectives of this study area are 1 to investigate the effects of biodegradation of natural organic matter and the transformation of iron oxides oxyhydroxides on the enrichment of groundwater and pore water iodine at the db and ncp and 2 to understand the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in pore water at the ncp which would potentially provide some new insights on the mechanisms of high iodine groundwater 2 study area db and ncp are located in the trans north china orogen and eastern north china craton of north china craton respectively which has undergone a huge tectonic transformation since the late mesozoic fig 1 cao et al 2015 ren et al 2002 xu et al 2005 during the late mesozoic and cenozoic north china craton experienced several phases of rifting and subsidence extension was widespread li et al 2012 ren et al 2002 ye et al 1985 as a consequence a series of graben basins including the db and ncp which were controlled by northeast to north northeast trending faults were developed the db and ncp had been firstly filled with clastic sediments and the sequence became dominated by fluvial and lacustrine sediments in down warping basins during the quaternary qi and yang 2010 the thick bedded silts and clay sediments at both areas are indicative of paleo lake deposits 2 1 datong basin db db is surrounded by mountains in the southeast and northwest fig 1 to the east is gneiss and basalt of hengshan segment of archean and to the west is cambrian and ordovician limestone and carboniferous and permian sandstone shale the thickness of cenozoic sediments is between 50 and 2500 m the grain size of which generally decreases from the margin to the center of the basin the quaternary groundwater systems mainly occur in the alluvial pluvial lacustrine and alluvial lacustrine aquifers and can be divided into three groups shallow medium deep and deep groundwater corresponding to the burial depths of the aquifer at 5 60 m 60 160 m and 160 m respectively the db has a typical semi arid and arid climate the annual average precipitation is between 225 and 400 mm and evaporation is above 2000 mm with 75 to 85 of rainfall occurring in july and august the annual average temperature is 6 5 c in this area groundwater is mainly recharged by vertically infiltrating meteoric water in the basin and laterally penetrating fracture water from the bedrock along the basin margins while evapotranspiration and artificial abstraction are the major discharge processes the flow directions of the groundwater are generally from northwest to southeast in the central basin and from the mountain edge to the central parts of the basin in the piedmont 2 2 north china plain ncp ncp is surrounded by the bohai sea to the east cenozoic taihang mountain uplift to the west mesozoic yanshan orogen to the north and the south by yellow river fig 1 the bohai sea is the innermost extension of the yellow sea and is a semi closed continental shelf ocean with an average water depth of 18 m according to topography variation the hydrogeological zones of ncp are divided into three parts from taihang mountain on the west to the bohai sea on the east piedmont region central plain and coastal plain xing et al 2013 the quaternary deposit has the thickness range of 200 600 m and is dominated by fluvial deposits in the piedmont plain alluvial and lacustrine deposits in the central plain and alluvial deposits with interbedded marine deposits in the littoral plain yao et al 2012 the quaternary aquifers as the main source of groundwater supply consist of four groups the holocene aquifer 10 50 m the upper 110 170 m middle 250 310 m and lower pleistocene aquifers 350 600 m chen et al 2005 liu et al 2016 six marine transgressions have been recognized since the early pleistocene including bohai transgression depth 270 290 m haixing transgression depth 185 215 m huanghua transgression depth 130 167 m baiyingdian transgression depth 44 64 m cangzhou transgression depth 30 35 m and tianjin transgression depth 20 m lin et al 2012 at the ncp the groundwater provides nearly 70 of the total water consumption for agricultural industrial and domestic purposes and therefore the land subsidence area resulting from groundwater over exploitation has become a serious environmental problem the groundwater head showed prolonged declining trend since the 1970 s with a rate of 17 8 0 1 mm yr and during 1981 2022 the rate was high up to 20 6 0 2 mm yr gong et al 2018 from 1965 until 2005 the maximum groundwater head at the cangzhou city decline reached 100 m jiang et al 2018 as a result the accumulated land subsidence is up to 3 m gong et al 2018 at the coastal area the land of 17 500 km2 has been subsiding at a rate higher than 20 mm yr ye et al 2016 under a semi arid climate the annual precipitation at ncp changes from 1200 mm in the southeast to 400 mm in the northwest with 75 of precipitation occurring from june to september while annual evaporation ranges between 1000 and 2000 mm 3 methodology 3 1 sampling 3 1 1 groundwater from 2012 to 2017 a total of 164 and 206

description of groundwater chemistry from the db and ncp was summarized in table 2 the groundwater of db and ncp had ph ranges of 6 90 9 73 and 6 46 9 03 with the median value of 7 86 and 8 08 respectively indicating the similar weak alkaline condition of both areas variable redox condition was observed at the db and ncp which varied from 216 to 224 mv and from 229 to 202 mv respectively the tds in groundwater from the db had a range of 247 10339 mg l wider than that of npc with the range of 203 3807 mg l which are related to the evapotranspiration in shallow aquifers li et al 2016a along with groundwater flowing the hydrochemical types of groundwater evolved from the ca hco3 to na hco3 and na cl types under the complex water sediment interaction at two areas wang et al 2009 fig 2 the estimated groundwater age at the db and ncp had the ranges of 5610 31170 years and 4060 25710 years respectively table 2 the groundwater age at the ncp agrees well with those reported by several previous studies chen et al 2005 kreuzer et al 2009 in both areas the older groundwater samples generally were associated with increasing sampling depth fig s1 the groundwater doc at the db and ncp had the ranges of bdl 206 6 mg l and 0 13 37 9 mg l respectively the ranges of groundwater hco3 at the db and ncp were 181 2123 mg l and 98 82 916 8 mg l respectively the groundwater δ13cdic signatures at the db and ncp varied from 25 64 to 5 59 and from 11 42 to 5 95 respectively table 2 it indicates the wider ranges of groundwater doc hco3 and δ13cdic at the db in comparison with those of ncp suggesting that the carbon cycling in groundwater at both areas experiences different biodegradation degrees the concentrations of groundwater iodine at the db and ncp had a range of 4 2175 µg l and 2 1106 µg l respectively and 70 6 and 46 3 of groundwater samples from two areas had the iodine concentration higher than 100 µg l in both areas the dominant species of groundwater iodine was iodide fig s2 under the oxidizing condition iodate can be detected and becomes the dominant species of iodine in several groundwater samples high iodine groundwater was mainly distributed in the discharge areas which was the central area of the db and coastal area of the ncp indicating that the groundwater environment of the discharge area favors iodine enrichment in groundwater fig 1 at ncp high iodine groundwater mainly occurs in the area having land subsidence fig 1c our previous studies have documented that the sediment compaction resulting from land subsidence can introduce the pore water rich in iodine into the groundwater xue et al 2019a the iodine concentration in the pore water can be up to 830 µg l the water type of hig was dominated by na hco3 and na cl fig 2 vertically high iodine groundwater can be observed at both shallow and deep confined aquifers fig 3 4 2 sediment chemistry δ13corg signatures and iron fractions the depth profiles of physic and chemical compositions of sediments from db and ncp were presented in fig 4 the mean grain size of sediments from db and ncp were 28 8 and 33 2 µm respectively the total iodine content of sediments from db and ncp had the range of bdl 1 78 µg g and 0 01 2 54 µg g respectively the toc content in sediments from db had the range of bdl 10 66 wt while the npc had the range of 0 02 0 24 wt at db and ncp a positive correlation was observed between sediment iodine and toc suggesting that organic matter plays a vital role in iodine mobilization in the groundwater system fig s3 the sediment δ13corg signatures in the db and ncp varied from 25 14 to 22 64 and from 24 99 to 17 49 respectively which is conformable with that of c3 plants and sedimentary deposits as well as metamorphic and magmatic rocks kohn 2010 rao et al 2017 at the ncp the two 13c enriched sediments 17 49 and 20 38 with sampling depth around 220 m were related to the c4 plant expansion during the early pliocene the proportion of which can be up to 63 at ca 2 2 ma lu et al 2020 the primary reservoir of iron in the aquifer sediments from both areas is the residual fraction which had the ranges of 68 88 and 77 97 of sediment iron at the db and ncp respectively the feox2 had the ranges of 5 57 22 6 and 3 56 20 6 at the db and ncp respectively around 5 75 21 2 and 0 62 4 00 of sediment iron are associated with amorphous to poorly crystalline and secondary iron oxides oxyhydroxides at the db and ncp respectively suggesting that the sediments from db experience more intense transformation of iron minerals fig 4 the hcl extractable fe ii fraction accounts for 1 72 15 9 and 0 01 3 77 of total fe at the db and ncp respectively which is consistent with the observation of a higher percentage of poorly crystalline and secondary iron oxides oxyhydroxides the xrd results also suggested that the iron minerals in the ncp sediments and dt shallow sediments was characterized by the goethite while some fe ii containing iron minerals such as pyrite and magnetite can be observed in the dt deep sediments fig s4 4 3 microbial batch experiments the variations of dissolved iodine and hcl extractable fe ii ratios of the ncp and db sediments in the microbial batch experiments were shown in fig 5 the two sediments from the ncp which were characterized by cyan clay and mixed cyan brown silty respectively had the sampling depths of 179 and 285 m and the iodine contents of 2 54 and 0 27 µg g respectively during the experimental period of 10 days the dissolved iodine concentrations of the two sediments were gradually increased from 2 43 to 36 7 µg l and from 1 30 to 4 80 µg l respectively fig 5a b c d a gradual increase of hcl extractable fe ii ratio was also observed for two sediments indicating that during the transformation of sediment iron minerals sediment iodine was released from sediment into groundwater and sediment iron minerals host a potential pool of sediment iodine at the ncp for the db sediment with depth 281 m which was characterized by grayish green silty clay no evident release of sediment iodine was observed during the microbial batch experiment fig 4e f it also needs to note that the hcl extractable fe ii ratio of untreated sediment was high up to around 25 and no evident increase of the ratio was observed for treated sediments after the 10 days it indicates that the deep sediments of db have undergone the transformation of sediment iron minerals which potentially release the sediment iodine into groundwater 5 discussion 5 1 key processes controlling groundwater iodine enrichment at the db and ncp the fluvial and lacustrine sediments are characterized by horizontally bedded and cross stratified fluvial lacustrine gray green siltstone and grayish yellow sandstone and the silty and clayey sediments are commonly rich in organic matter natural organic matter plays a significant pool for the sediment iodine englund et al 2010 li et al 2013 a relatively positive correlation was observed between sediment iodine and toc at the db and ncp fig s3 the results of sequential extraction reported by our previous study indicate that the organic matter and its related iron oxides serve as the main host of sediment iodine li et al 2013 the complex hydro biogeochemical processes cause the release of sediment iodine in both areas the groundwater having more negative δ13cdic signatures generally had higher hco3 concentrations fig 6 several hydrogeochemical processes including the chemical weathering of aluminosilicate minerals dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals calcite and dolomite and biodegradation of organic matter control the concentration of groundwater hco3 wang et al 2009 in the recharge area the chemical weathering of aluminosilicate minerals takes up atmospheric co2 and controls inorganic carbon fluxes of groundwater systems the δ13cdic signature of atmospheric co2 was around 8 chalk et al 2015 jin et al 2014 as a result the groundwater from the recharge area of db and ncp had a δ13cdic value of 9 79 and 7 86 respectively indicating the dominant effects of chemical weathering of aluminosilicate minerals on the δ13cdic of groundwater from both areas fig s5 all the groundwater samples from db and npc were supersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite the precipitation of calcite promotes the preferential removal of light carbon from groundwater and results in groundwater being enriched in 13c and having lower hco3 concentration fig 6 however in comparison with the groundwater from ncp the wider range and more negative 13cdic signature were observed in groundwater from the db indicating that besides the general hydrogeochemical processes discussed above other processes such as microbial degradation of natural organic carbon might be more intensive at the db the high iodine groundwater was commonly characterized by higher hco3 concentration and 13c depleted δ13cdic signature fig 6 if higher levels of hco3 were produced by the biological processes one would expect the depleted 13c in dissolved inorganic carbon thereby lowering the signature of δ13cdic it suggests that at the db the microbial activities play a vital role in the hydrogeochemical evolution in the groundwater system which was further supported by the signatures of sediment δ13corg and iron minerals the selective preservation of refractory organic matter such as lignin would cause the 13c depletion with depth krull and retallack 2000 wilson 2017 wilson et al 2005 at the db although no evident depth trend of sediment δ13corg was observed the deep sediments had higher δ13corg signatures fig 4a generally the decomposition of sediment organic matter leads to preferential accumulation of 13c in solid products of microbial decomposition which can be further stabilized by fine mineral particles han et al 2020 wynn 2007 wynn et al 2005 if the sediment organic matter underwent strong degradation besides the biomass detritus the sediment organic matter also consists of microbially processed organic matter and then the divergence of sediment δ13corg would reflect the degree to which heterotrophs have processed the organic matter assuming that organic matter in sediments decomposes to a fraction of its original carbon concentration and the highest carbon concentration in borehole sediments is original decomposed organic matter the fraction of decomposed organic matter was estimated by dividing the toc of each sediment sample by the maximum toc and the fractionation of organic carbon isotope follows a rayleigh distillation process during decomposition modeled initial composition of biomass is approximately 26 which is the value typical of c3 biomass lu et al 2020 the calculation provides an estimation of the effects of rayleigh distillation during decomposition on sediment δ13corg showing that the fractionation of decomposition can account for some samples having lower toc contents at db the fraction of which was less than 0 4 fig 7 for the sediments having higher toc content more enriched 13c was observed which could be related to the stronger degradation of organic matter it has been reported that the δ13c value of microbial affected organic matter can be up to approximately 6 richer than the original biomass wynn 2007 comparably the decreasing trend of sediment δ13corg was observed at ncp which is inconsistent with the typically 13c enriched trend with depth caused by organic matter decay fig 4b wynn 2007 the gradually decreasing trend of δ13corg except for depth around 220 m indicates that the degradation of organic matter was not the dominant process causing the variations of sediment δ13corg at ncp which is more controlled by the deposition sources of organic carbon lu et al 2020 besides the inorganic organic carbon the microbial activities potentially affect the transformation of iron minerals in the sediments and thereby cause the iodine mobilization in the groundwater system which was well reflected by different fractions of sediment iron mineral between db and ncp at db an increasing trend of hcl extractable fe ii sediment fetotal with depth was observed with the maximum ratio of 49 9 while all the ratios at ncp were less than 3 5 fig 4 correspondingly higher percentages of secondary and poorly crystalline iron minerals were observed at the db than those of ncp it indicates that at db the biodegradation of organic matter promotes the reductive transformation of sediment iron minerals e g from the crystalline iron minerals to poorly crystalline or secondary iron minerals the organic matter and iron minerals in sediment act as the main host of sediment iodine li et al 2013 therefore the biodegradation of organic matter and reductive dissolution of iron minerals promote the release of sediment iodine into groundwater and the groundwater environment characterized by weak reducing conditions and weak alkalinity further favors the enrichment of groundwater iodine in the form of iodide li et al 2020 comparably at the ncp the groundwater system experiences low degrees of biodegradation of organic matter and the transformation of iron minerals and as shown in fig 4 the ratio of hcl extractable fe ii sediment fetotal for the majority of sediments was lower than 0 5 it indicates that at the ncp the sediment iodine loaded on the organic matter and iron minerals is relatively stable and well preserved in the aquifer sediments 5 2 the potential mechanisms of iodine enrichment in pore water of clayey sediments at the ncp different from the db the pore water rich in iodine is considered to be the main source of groundwater iodine and sediment compaction resulting from groundwater over exploitation promotes the release of pore water into the aquifer the pore water trapped in the clayey sediments at the ncp had a wide range of iodine 18 1 830 µg l and cl br molar ratio 713 2160 xue et al 2019a two mechanisms could explain the enrichment of iodine in the pore water as shown in fig 8 the pore water with relatively higher iodine concentration 300 µg l commonly had the cl br molar ratio close to the bohai seawater at the ncp six events of transgression and regression were recognized after the early pleistocene corresponding to the depths shallower than 290 m at the coastal area and the marine iodine could be persevered or tapped in the aquifers lin et al 2012 xiao et al 2020 yi et al 2016 the sequential extraction of sediment samples from ncp indicates that for the sediment at the coastal area the dissolvable and exchangeable fraction had a significant contribution to the sediment iodine which can be up to 92 at the depth around 270 m xue et al 2022 these two fractions are prone to be released into pore water or aquifers under intense groundwater pumping as a result several high iodine groundwaters had a cl br molar ratio of around 1000 fig 8 another mechanism is the local biodegradation of organic matter and the transformation of iron minerals the ratio of hcl extractable fe ii sediment fetotal at the depth around 300 m was higher fig 4 as discussed above the reductive transformation of sediment iron minerals triggered by the biodegradation of organic matter would promote the release of sediment iodine fig 5 as a result the pore water with a cl br molar ratio of 2000 had iodine concentrations around 100 µg l fig 8 moreover several groundwater samples from the ncp were characterized by higher iodine and hco3 concentrations and depleted 13cdic further suggesting the occurrence of local transformation of iron minerals driven by microbial degradation of organic matter fig 6 6 conclusions high iodine groundwater was widely observed in the discharge area of the db and ncp with the iodine concentration ranges of 4 2175 µg l and 2 1106 µg l respectively high iodine groundwater at both areas was characterized by a similar groundwater environment including the reducing or weak oxidizing conditions weak alkalinity and iodide as the dominant species the relatively stable reducing in the deep aquifers of db conditions favors the transformations of sediment iron minerals which sever as the main host of sediment iodine thereby leading to the release of sediment iodine into groundwater in the form of iodide this process was driven by the intense microbial activities which were reflected by the signatures of groundwater 13cdic and sediment 13cdoc comparably at the ncp the pore water rich in iodine serves as the main source of groundwater iodine the pore water cl br molar ratio and chemistry suggested that the enrichment of iodine in the pore water up to 830 µg l is related to the marine transgressions and the iodine concentration around 100 µg l in pore water at a depth around 300 m results from the local transformation of sediment iron minerals credit authorship contribution statement junxia li conceptualization

2952,the wide occurrence of high iodine groundwater is posing negative effects on human health the land subsidence due to groundwater over exploitation causes the release of iodine rich pore water trapped in clayey sediment into groundwater however the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in pore water were still unclear in this study we selected the datong basin db and north china plain ncp with few and severe land subsidence respectively to understand the contributions of complex hydro biogeochemical processes on the enrichment of iodine in groundwater and pore water by using the inorganic organic carbon isotope and batch experiments the results showed that at the db the range of groundwater iodine was 4 2175 µg l and the enrichment of groundwater iodine is mainly related to the transformation of iron oxyhydroxides triggered by microbial degradation of organic matter which was reflected by the more depleted δ13cdic signatures of groundwater and gradual increasing trend of ratio of hcl extractable fe ii sediment fetotal and sediment δ13cdoc signatures with depth in comparison groundwater iodine at the ncp had the range of 2 1106 µg l and pore water rich in iodine preserved in the clayey sediment serves as the main source the depth profiles of sediment iron mineral fractions and δ13cdoc signatures suggested that the ncp sediments experienced lower degree of reductive transformation of iron minerals and microbial degradation of natural organic matter at some specific depths higher than 300 m the evident higher ratios of hcl extractable fe ii sediment fetotal indicate that the local transformation of iron minerals can explain the pore water rich in iodine at deep sediments which was supported by the results of microbial batch experiments the pore water with high iodine concentration preserved in the shallow sediment is more likely related to the marine transgressions this study helps to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of high iodine groundwater which may provide some new insights on further groundwater management keywords iodine groundwater datong basin north china plain hydrogeochemistry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction iodine has long been recognized as a key determinant in regulating thyroid hormones in china the drinking water rich in natural geogenic iodine serves as one of the important iodine sources especially in the northern china and it was estimated that almost 31 million people throughout 11 provinces in china are being exposed to excessive iodine uptake including anhui beijing fujian hebei henan jiangsu inner mongolia shandong shanxi tianjin and xinjiang liu et al 2022 shen et al 2011 xu et al 2016 globally it is reported that the groundwater from algeria argentina japan and denmark had anomalously high iodine concentrations wang et al 2020 long term exposure to iodine rich groundwater can cause thyroid diseases due to thyroid autoimmunity rong et al 2018 teng et al 2006 previous studies have documented that the geological deposits rich in iodine were generally considered as the sources of groundwater iodine such as the deposits affected by seawater at the coastal areas and the lacustrine deposits rich in organic matter and iodine at some inland areas li et al 2013 xue et al 2019a it is commonly accepted that the fractions of natural organic matter and iron minerals in soils sediments serve as the important iodine sink which is primarily in the form of relatively immobile organic iodine englund et al 2010 hansen et al 2011 yeager et al 2017 the soil sediments rich in organic matter tend to be rich in iodine due to the great ability to retain iodine shetaya et al 2012 xu et al 2012 in sediment from hanford site organic carbon was considered to be responsible for 57 1 90 6 of sediment iodine xu et al 2015 the enrichment of iodine in groundwater is heavily dependent on the physiochemical environment and biological properties of the surrounding groundwater system microorganisms play key roles in the release of soil sediment iodine and changes of iodine species and the iodide resulting from the biotic abiotic reduction of iodate and organic iodine is the thermodynamically stable form of groundwater iodine under the general ph and eh conditions of the groundwater system and promotes its enrichment amachi et al 2007 amachi et al 2010 hu et al 2012 li et al 2013 li et al 2017 besides the complex bio hydrogeochemical processes it has been reported that human activities also promote the enrichment of groundwater iodine at the north china plain the land subsidence caused by groundwater over exploitation can lead to the release of iodine rich pore water trapped in the clayey sediment into groundwater thereby elevating the groundwater iodine concentration xue et al 2019a however the deep mechanisms causing the enrichment of iodine in the pore water of clayey sediment are still unclear as mentioned above natural organic carbon plays an important role in the hydrogeochemical behaviors of iodine in the groundwater system cycling of inorganic organic carbon in groundwater systems can be reconstructed from inorganic organic carbon isotope records the different sources of groundwater inorganic carbon exhibit the inorganic carbon isotope 13cdic differently due to the distinct isotopic compositions of major carbon reservoirs such as 8 for atmospheric co2 28 for co2 released during the decomposition of organic matter within the aquifer sediments 15 for groundwater evolving from soils co2 and 14 6 to 1 1 for freshwater carbonates of the aquifer clark and fritz 1997 jin et al 2014 porowska 2015 when the organic carbon serves as the electron donor of microbes the resulting groundwater δ13cdic depends on the organic carbon pools and biodegradation degree of organic carbon the co2 derived from the respiration of natural organic carbon leads to a negative shift in water δ13cdic the initial δ13cdic for groundwater from c4 plants is about 23 if no carbonate weathering is involved while that from c3 plants can be down 26 schulte et al 2011 at the datong basin db and north china plain ncp which had the typical occurrence of high iodine groundwater iodine 100 µg l the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in groundwater were considered to be burial dissolution type and compaction release type respectively li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 xue et al 2019a at the db the sediment iodine serves as the main source of groundwater iodine and under the favorable environment such as the stable reducing conditions the reductive dissolution of iodine loading iron minerals and natural organic matter and the transformation of iodine species promotes the release of sediment iodine into groundwater li et al 2020 at the ncp the iodine concentration in pore water of sediment can be up to 830 µg l serving as the main source of groundwater iodine xue et al 2019a the land subsidence related to the groundwater over pumping causes the release of iodine rich pore water into the aquifer thereby elevating the concentration of groundwater iodine however sources of pore water iodine and the roles of hydro biogeochemical processes for iodine enrichment in pore water are still unknown this study reveals the iodine related hydro biogeochemical processes based on the results of groundwater inorganic carbon isotope sediment organic carbon isotope and microbial batch experiments the objectives of this study area are 1 to investigate the effects of biodegradation of natural organic matter and the transformation of iron oxides oxyhydroxides on the enrichment of groundwater and pore water iodine at the db and ncp and 2 to understand the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in pore water at the ncp which would potentially provide some new insights on the mechanisms of high iodine groundwater 2 study area db and ncp are located in the trans north china orogen and eastern north china craton of north china craton respectively which has undergone a huge tectonic transformation since the late mesozoic fig 1 cao et al 2015 ren et al 2002 xu et al 2005 during the late mesozoic and cenozoic north china craton experienced several phases of rifting and subsidence extension was widespread li et al 2012 ren et al 2002 ye et al 1985 as a consequence a series of graben basins including the db and ncp which were controlled by northeast to north northeast trending faults were developed the db and ncp had been firstly filled with clastic sediments and the sequence became dominated by fluvial and lacustrine sediments in down warping basins during the quaternary qi and yang 2010 the thick bedded silts and clay sediments at both areas are indicative of paleo lake deposits 2 1 datong basin db db is surrounded by mountains in the southeast and northwest fig 1 to the east is gneiss and basalt of hengshan segment of archean and to the west is cambrian and ordovician limestone and carboniferous and permian sandstone shale the thickness of cenozoic sediments is between 50 and 2500 m the grain size of which generally decreases from the margin to the center of the basin the quaternary groundwater systems mainly occur in the alluvial pluvial lacustrine and alluvial lacustrine aquifers and can be divided into three groups shallow medium deep and deep groundwater corresponding to the burial depths of the aquifer at 5 60 m 60 160 m and 160 m respectively the db has a typical semi arid and arid climate the annual average precipitation is between 225 and 400 mm and evaporation is above 2000 mm with 75 to 85 of rainfall occurring in july and august the annual average temperature is 6 5 c in this area groundwater is mainly recharged by vertically infiltrating meteoric water in the basin and laterally penetrating fracture water from the bedrock along the basin margins while evapotranspiration and artificial abstraction are the major discharge processes the flow directions of the groundwater are generally from northwest to southeast in the central basin and from the mountain edge to the central parts of the basin in the piedmont 2 2 north china plain ncp ncp is surrounded by the bohai sea to the east cenozoic taihang mountain uplift to the west mesozoic yanshan orogen to the north and the south by yellow river fig 1 the bohai sea is the innermost extension of the yellow sea and is a semi closed continental shelf ocean with an average water depth of 18 m according to topography variation the hydrogeological zones of ncp are divided into three parts from taihang mountain on the west to the bohai sea on the east piedmont region central plain and coastal plain xing et al 2013 the quaternary deposit has the thickness range of 200 600 m and is dominated by fluvial deposits in the piedmont plain alluvial and lacustrine deposits in the central plain and alluvial deposits with interbedded marine deposits in the littoral plain yao et al 2012 the quaternary aquifers as the main source of groundwater supply consist of four groups the holocene aquifer 10 50 m the upper 110 170 m middle 250 310 m and lower pleistocene aquifers 350 600 m chen et al 2005 liu et al 2016 six marine transgressions have been recognized since the early pleistocene including bohai transgression depth 270 290 m haixing transgression depth 185 215 m huanghua transgression depth 130 167 m baiyingdian transgression depth 44 64 m cangzhou transgression depth 30 35 m and tianjin transgression depth 20 m lin et al 2012 at the ncp the groundwater provides nearly 70 of the total water consumption for agricultural industrial and domestic purposes and therefore the land subsidence area resulting from groundwater over exploitation has become a serious environmental problem the groundwater head showed prolonged declining trend since the 1970 s with a rate of 17 8 0 1 mm yr and during 1981 2022 the rate was high up to 20 6 0 2 mm yr gong et al 2018 from 1965 until 2005 the maximum groundwater head at the cangzhou city decline reached 100 m jiang et al 2018 as a result the accumulated land subsidence is up to 3 m gong et al 2018 at the coastal area the land of 17 500 km2 has been subsiding at a rate higher than 20 mm yr ye et al 2016 under a semi arid climate the annual precipitation at ncp changes from 1200 mm in the southeast to 400 mm in the northwest with 75 of precipitation occurring from june to september while annual evaporation ranges between 1000 and 2000 mm 3 methodology 3 1 sampling 3 1 1 groundwater from 2012 to 2017 a total of 164 and 206 groundwater samples were collected from the db and ncp respectively fig 1 among these groundwater samples the chemistry of 121 and 133 groundwater samples from db and ncp respectively have been reported in our previous studies li et al 2014 li et al 2016b li et al 2017 the rest of the groundwater samples were collected in august 2017 before sampling the wells were purged for at least 10 min

samples were collected in iodine free polyethylene containers using a low flow pump and filtered through 0 45 μm membranes the samples for cation and trace element analysis were acidified using ultra purified hno3 to ph less than 2 and samples for anion analysis were collected directly after being filtered samples for iodine species and inorganic carbon isotope analysis were collected in pre cleaned amber glass sampler vials without headspace and stored in the dark until analysis the 9 of the 164 and 206 groundwater samples were selected from the db and ncp respectively to perform the analysis of radiocarbon activities 14c to characterize groundwater age extraction of dissolved inorganic carbon for the analysis of 14c was performed by carbonate precipitation in the field the co2 free naoh was added to 50l of groundwater to transform dissolved inorganic carbon into carbonate which was further precipitated as baco3 precipitated by adding excess bacl2 after the overnight the supernatant water was decanted and the precipitate was transferred into a 1l hdpe bottle avoiding atmospheric contact until analysis 3 1 2 sediment in august 2012 and august 2016 a 300 m and 410 m deep borehole was drilled in iodine affected areas of db and ncp respectively and correspondingly a total of 71 and 144 sediment samples were collected respectively fig 1 some chemistry results of the ncp borehole have been reported by our previous study xue et al 2019b the sediment cores were capped with a pvc pipe sealed and stored at 4 c until analysis to minimize the exposure of the sediment to the atmosphere based on the sediment texture and depth 18 and 22 samples were selected from db and ncp respectively to perform the analysis of organic carbon isotope based on the sediment chemistry 2 out of 71 and 144 sediment samples were selected to perform the microbial batch experiments to simulate the iodine released during the transformation of sediment iron minerals the results of batch experiments of 2 samples from db have been reported in our previous study li et al 2020 3 2 microbial batch experiment to understand the iodine behaviors during the transformation of sediment iron minerals a series of microbial batch experiments were performed on two sediments of ncp with sampling depths of 179 and 285 m respectively the facultatively anaerobic shewanella oneidensis strain mr 1 a dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria were introduced into the system containing 1 5 g of wet sediment samples and 15 ml 15 5 mm na hco3 and 30 mm na lactate solution in a 25 ml sterile brown serum vial three background groups including blank group lactate group and mr 1 group were also conducted under the same condition in the glove box the details on the mr 1 culture and setting of batch experiments can be found in li et al 2020 the chemistry analysis of liquid and solid samples in the batch experiments were the same as that of groundwater and sediment samples which were described following 3 3 chemistry analysis 3 3 1 groundwater alkalinity measurement was performed using a titration method within 24 h after sampling anions were analyzed using ion chromatography ic metrohm 761

spectrometry hplc icp ms ag20 analytical column ics 1500 dionex pe elan drc e with the detection limits of iodate and iodide of 0 035 μg l and 0 025 μg l respectively organic iodine concentrations were calculated using the difference between total iodine and inorganic iodine otosaka et al 2011 schwehr and santschi 2003 the chemistry analysis work was done at state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geosciences wuhan the analysis of 13c 12c ratios of dissolved inorganic carbon dic δ13cdic was performed on 30 and 33 groundwater samples from datong

analysis work was done at state key laboratory of geological process and mineral resources china university of geosciences 4 results 4 1 groundwater chemistry and δ13cdic signatures the statistical description of groundwater chemistry from the db and ncp was summarized in table 2 the groundwater of db and ncp had ph ranges of 6 90 9 73 and 6 46 9 03 with the median value of 7 86 and 8 08 respectively indicating the similar weak alkaline condition of both areas variable redox condition was observed at the db and ncp which varied from 216 to 224 mv and from 229 to 202 mv respectively the tds in groundwater from the db had a range of 247 10339 mg l wider than that of npc with the range of 203 3807 mg l which are related to the evapotranspiration in shallow aquifers li et al 2016a along with groundwater flowing the hydrochemical types of groundwater evolved from the ca hco3 to na hco3 and na cl types under the complex water sediment interaction at two areas wang et al 2009 fig 2 the estimated groundwater age at the db and ncp had the ranges of 5610 31170 years and 4060 25710 years respectively table 2 the groundwater age at the ncp agrees well with those reported by several previous studies chen et al 2005 kreuzer et al 2009 in both areas the older groundwater samples generally were associated with increasing sampling depth fig s1 the groundwater doc at the db and ncp had the ranges of bdl 206 6 mg l and 0 13 37 9 mg l respectively the ranges of groundwater hco3 at the db and ncp were 181 2123 mg l and 98 82 916 8 mg l respectively the groundwater δ13cdic signatures at the db and ncp varied from 25 64 to 5 59 and from 11 42 to 5 95 respectively table 2 it indicates the wider ranges of groundwater doc hco3 and δ13cdic at the db in comparison with those of ncp suggesting that the carbon cycling in groundwater at both areas experiences different biodegradation degrees the concentrations of groundwater iodine at the db and ncp had a range of 4 2175 µg l and 2 1106 µg l respectively and 70 6 and 46 3 of groundwater samples from two areas had the iodine concentration higher than 100 µg l in both areas the dominant species of groundwater iodine was iodide fig s2 under the oxidizing condition iodate can be detected and becomes the dominant species of iodine in several groundwater samples high iodine groundwater was mainly distributed in the discharge areas which was the central area of the db and coastal area of the ncp indicating that the groundwater environment of the discharge area favors iodine enrichment in groundwater fig 1 at ncp high iodine groundwater mainly occurs in the area having land subsidence fig 1c our previous studies have documented that the sediment compaction resulting from land subsidence can introduce the pore water rich in iodine into the groundwater xue et al 2019a the iodine concentration in the pore water can be up to 830 µg l the water type of hig was dominated by na hco3 and na cl fig 2 vertically high iodine groundwater can be observed at both shallow and deep confined aquifers fig 3 4 2 sediment chemistry δ13corg signatures and iron fractions the depth profiles of physic and chemical compositions of sediments from db and ncp were presented in fig 4 the mean grain size of sediments from db and ncp were 28 8 and 33 2 µm respectively the total iodine content of sediments from db and ncp had the range of bdl 1 78 µg g and 0 01 2 54 µg g respectively the toc content in sediments from db had the range of bdl 10 66 wt while the npc had the range of 0 02 0 24 wt at db and ncp a positive correlation was observed between sediment iodine and toc suggesting that organic matter plays a vital role in iodine mobilization in the groundwater system fig s3 the sediment δ13corg signatures in the db and ncp varied from 25 14 to 22 64 and from 24 99 to 17 49 respectively which is conformable with that of c3 plants and sedimentary deposits as well as metamorphic and magmatic rocks kohn 2010 rao et al 2017 at the ncp the two 13c enriched sediments 17 49 and 20 38 with sampling depth around 220 m were related to the c4 plant expansion during the early pliocene the proportion of which can be up to 63 at ca 2 2 ma lu et al 2020 the primary reservoir of iron in the aquifer sediments from both areas is the residual fraction which had the ranges of 68 88 and 77 97 of sediment iron at the db and ncp respectively the feox2 had the ranges of 5 57 22 6 and 3 56 20 6 at the db and ncp respectively around 5 75 21 2 and 0 62 4 00 of sediment iron are associated with amorphous to poorly crystalline and secondary iron oxides oxyhydroxides at the db and ncp respectively suggesting that the sediments from db experience more intense transformation of iron minerals fig 4 the hcl extractable fe ii fraction accounts for 1 72 15 9 and 0 01 3 77 of total fe at the db and ncp respectively which is consistent with the observation of a higher percentage of poorly crystalline and secondary iron oxides oxyhydroxides the xrd results also suggested that the iron minerals in the ncp sediments and dt shallow sediments was characterized by the goethite while some fe ii containing iron minerals such as pyrite and magnetite can be observed in the dt deep sediments fig s4 4 3 microbial batch experiments the variations of dissolved iodine and hcl extractable fe ii ratios of the ncp and db sediments in the microbial batch experiments were shown in fig 5 the two sediments from the ncp which were characterized by cyan clay and mixed cyan brown silty respectively had the sampling depths of 179 and 285 m and the iodine contents of 2 54 and 0 27 µg g respectively during the experimental period of 10 days the dissolved iodine concentrations of the two sediments were gradually increased from 2 43 to 36 7 µg l and from 1 30 to 4 80 µg l respectively fig 5a b c d a gradual increase of hcl extractable fe ii ratio was also observed for two sediments indicating that during the transformation of sediment iron minerals sediment iodine was released from sediment into groundwater and sediment iron minerals host a potential pool of sediment iodine at the ncp for the db sediment with depth 281 m which was characterized by grayish green silty clay no evident release of sediment iodine was observed during the microbial batch experiment fig 4e f it also needs to note that the hcl extractable fe ii ratio of untreated sediment was high up to around 25 and no evident increase of the ratio was observed for treated sediments after the 10 days it indicates that the deep sediments of db have undergone the transformation of sediment iron minerals which potentially release the sediment iodine into groundwater 5 discussion 5 1 key processes controlling groundwater iodine enrichment at the db and ncp the fluvial and lacustrine sediments are characterized by horizontally bedded and cross stratified fluvial lacustrine gray green siltstone and grayish yellow sandstone and the silty and clayey sediments are commonly rich in organic matter natural organic matter plays a significant pool for the sediment iodine englund et al 2010 li et al 2013 a relatively positive correlation was observed between sediment iodine and toc at the db and ncp fig s3 the results of sequential extraction reported by our previous study indicate that the organic matter and its related iron oxides serve as the main host of sediment iodine li et al 2013 the complex hydro biogeochemical processes cause the release of sediment iodine in both areas the groundwater having more negative δ13cdic signatures generally had higher hco3 concentrations fig 6 several hydrogeochemical processes including the chemical weathering of aluminosilicate minerals dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals calcite and dolomite and biodegradation of organic matter control the concentration of groundwater hco3 wang et al 2009 in the recharge area the chemical weathering of aluminosilicate minerals takes up atmospheric co2 and controls inorganic carbon fluxes of groundwater systems the δ13cdic signature of atmospheric co2 was around 8 chalk et al 2015 jin et al 2014 as a result the groundwater from the recharge area of db and ncp had a δ13cdic value of 9 79 and 7 86 respectively indicating the dominant effects of chemical weathering of aluminosilicate minerals on the δ13cdic of groundwater from both areas fig s5 all the groundwater samples from db and npc were supersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite the precipitation of calcite promotes the preferential removal of light carbon from groundwater and results in groundwater being enriched in 13c and having lower hco3 concentration fig 6 however in comparison with the groundwater from ncp the wider range and more negative 13cdic signature were observed in groundwater from the db indicating that besides the general hydrogeochemical processes discussed above other processes such as microbial degradation of natural organic carbon might be more intensive at the db the high iodine groundwater was commonly characterized by higher hco3 concentration and 13c depleted δ13cdic signature fig 6 if higher levels of hco3 were produced by the biological processes one would expect the depleted 13c in dissolved inorganic carbon thereby lowering the signature of δ13cdic it suggests that at the db the microbial activities play a vital role in the hydrogeochemical evolution in the groundwater system which was further supported by the signatures of sediment δ13corg and iron minerals the selective preservation of refractory organic matter such as lignin would cause the 13c depletion with depth krull and retallack 2000 wilson 2017 wilson et al 2005 at the db although no evident depth trend of sediment δ13corg was observed the deep sediments had higher δ13corg signatures fig 4a generally the decomposition of sediment organic matter leads to preferential accumulation of 13c in solid products of microbial decomposition which can be further stabilized by fine mineral particles han et al 2020 wynn 2007 wynn et al 2005 if the sediment organic matter underwent strong degradation besides the biomass detritus the sediment organic matter also consists of microbially processed organic matter and then the divergence of sediment δ13corg would reflect the degree to which heterotrophs have processed the organic matter assuming that organic matter in sediments decomposes to a fraction of its original carbon concentration and the highest carbon concentration in borehole sediments is original decomposed organic matter the fraction of decomposed organic matter was estimated by dividing the toc of each sediment sample by the maximum toc and the fractionation of organic carbon isotope follows a rayleigh distillation process during decomposition modeled initial composition of biomass is approximately 26 which is the value typical of c3 biomass lu et al 2020 the calculation provides an estimation of the effects of rayleigh distillation during decomposition on sediment δ13corg showing that the fractionation of decomposition can account for some samples having lower toc contents at db the fraction of which was less than 0 4 fig 7 for the sediments having higher toc content more enriched 13c was observed which could be related to the stronger degradation of organic matter it has been reported that the δ13c value of microbial affected organic matter can be up to approximately 6 richer than the original biomass wynn 2007 comparably the decreasing trend of sediment δ13corg was observed at ncp which is inconsistent with the typically 13c enriched trend with depth caused by organic matter decay fig 4b wynn 2007 the gradually decreasing trend of δ13corg except for depth around 220 m indicates that the degradation of organic matter was not the dominant process causing the variations of sediment δ13corg at ncp which is more controlled by the deposition sources of organic carbon lu et al 2020 besides the inorganic organic carbon the microbial activities potentially affect the transformation of iron minerals in the sediments and thereby cause the iodine mobilization in the groundwater system which was well reflected by different fractions of sediment iron mineral between db and ncp at db an increasing trend of hcl extractable fe ii sediment fetotal with depth was observed with the maximum ratio of 49 9 while all the ratios at ncp were less than 3 5 fig 4 correspondingly higher percentages of secondary and poorly crystalline iron minerals were observed at the db than those of ncp it indicates that at db the biodegradation of organic matter promotes the reductive transformation of sediment iron minerals e g from the crystalline iron minerals to poorly crystalline or secondary iron minerals the organic matter and iron minerals in sediment act as the main host of sediment iodine li et al 2013 therefore the biodegradation of organic matter and reductive dissolution of iron minerals promote the release of sediment iodine into groundwater and the groundwater environment characterized by weak reducing conditions and weak alkalinity further favors the enrichment of groundwater iodine in the form of iodide li et al 2020 comparably at the ncp the groundwater system experiences low degrees of biodegradation of organic matter and the transformation of iron minerals and as shown in fig 4 the ratio of hcl extractable fe ii sediment fetotal for the majority of sediments was lower than 0 5 it indicates that at the ncp the sediment iodine loaded on the organic matter and iron minerals is relatively stable and well preserved in the aquifer sediments 5 2 the potential mechanisms of iodine enrichment in pore water of clayey sediments at the ncp different from the db the pore water rich in iodine is considered to be the main source of groundwater iodine and sediment compaction resulting from groundwater over exploitation promotes the release of pore water into the aquifer the pore water trapped in the clayey sediments at the ncp had a wide range of iodine 18 1 830 µg l and cl br molar ratio 713 2160 xue et al 2019a two mechanisms could explain the enrichment of iodine in the pore water as shown in fig 8 the pore water with relatively higher iodine concentration 300 µg l commonly had the cl br molar ratio close to the bohai seawater at the ncp six events of transgression and regression were recognized after the early pleistocene corresponding to the depths shallower than 290 m at the coastal area and the marine iodine could be persevered or tapped in the aquifers lin et al 2012 xiao et al 2020 yi et al 2016 the sequential extraction of sediment samples from ncp indicates that for the sediment at the coastal area the dissolvable and exchangeable fraction had a significant contribution to the sediment iodine which can be up to 92 at the depth around 270 m xue et al 2022 these two fractions are prone to be released into pore water or aquifers under intense groundwater pumping as a result several high iodine groundwaters had a cl br molar ratio of around 1000 fig 8 another mechanism is the local biodegradation of organic matter and the transformation of iron minerals the ratio of hcl extractable fe ii sediment fetotal at the depth around 300 m was higher fig 4 as discussed above the reductive transformation of sediment iron minerals triggered by the biodegradation of organic matter would promote the release of sediment iodine fig 5 as a result the pore water with a cl br molar ratio of 2000 had iodine concentrations around 100 µg l fig 8 moreover several groundwater samples from the ncp were characterized by higher iodine and hco3 concentrations and depleted 13cdic further suggesting the occurrence of local transformation of iron minerals driven by microbial degradation of organic matter fig 6 6 conclusions high iodine groundwater was widely observed in the discharge area of the db and ncp with the iodine concentration ranges of 4 2175 µg l and 2 1106 µg l respectively high iodine groundwater at both areas was characterized by a similar groundwater environment including the reducing or weak oxidizing conditions weak alkalinity and iodide as the dominant species the relatively stable reducing in the deep aquifers of db conditions favors the transformations of sediment iron minerals which sever as the main host of sediment iodine thereby leading to the release of sediment iodine into groundwater in the form of iodide this process was driven by the intense microbial activities which were reflected by the signatures of groundwater 13cdic and sediment 13cdoc comparably at the ncp the pore water rich in iodine serves as the main source of groundwater iodine the pore water cl br molar ratio and chemistry suggested that the enrichment of iodine in the pore water up to 830 µg l is related to the marine transgressions and the iodine concentration around 100 µg l in pore water at a depth around 300 m results from the local transformation of sediment iron minerals credit authorship contribution statement junxia li conceptualization

2953,the determination of the radius of influence for mining excavation drainage is of major significance in mining both for practical and legal reasons this paper describes various definitions of the radius of influence cone of depression and discusses different methods of its determination with the consideration of their advantages and disadvantages it demonstrates specific examples of practical problems related to determination of the radius of influence resulting from the heterogeneity of the internal hydraulic network in porphyries aquifers made of dolomites and limestone and the presence of faults which affect the form of the water table in the mine drainage influence area keywords mine drainage radius of influence cone of depression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the exploitation of mineral deposits below the natural water table level requires drainage of the rock masses which results in the drawdown of the water table this entails transformation of the natural water conditions in the mine drainage influence area according to legal regulations this represents environmental damage which has to be eliminated or financially compensated for the mining industry this consequently represents a serious economic problem and is therefore one of the major issues of mining hydrogeology both at the stage of mine design as well as its operation the aspect of the determination of the radius of influence is both theoretical as well as practical the purpose of the theoretical considerations is an attempt to find the most reliable method of the radius of influence determination the practical aspect amounts to determination of the legal responsibility extent for damages resulting from mine drainage the consequence of drainage of mining excavations is a lowering of the water table and inevitably the permanent disappearance of springs drying of surface watercourses or reduction of their efficiency drainage of wetlands gradual drying of ponds and lakes and lowering or disappearance of water in wells e g younger et al 2002 wolkersdorfer 2006 these phenomena occur not only within the depression cone in hosted rocks but also in other aquifers that have various types of hydraulic connections to them however the radius of influence and the extent of legal responsibility resulting from the drainage of mining excavations overlap only partially in many cases the problems with determining the extent of mining drainage in practice begin with the selection of its definition from among various ones that can be found in the hydrogeological literature the mathematical definition of the radius of influence was first formulated by dupuit 1863 in his classic work as the upper limit of integration in a differential equation the solution of which is a formula of the water inflow to a well in the conditions of the steady flow of groundwater this theoretical concept has been since included in various versions in hydrogeological guidebooks and dictionaries e g castany and margat 1977 fetter 2001 todd and mays 2005 poehls and smith 2009 hiscock and bense 2014 de marsily 2004 singhal and gupta 2010 this type of definition however is not very useful in hydrogeological practice the question of the definition of the radius of influence and the criteria of its determination has been widely and extensively analysed in recent time by bresciani et al 2020 they have pointed to the various versions of this definition present in hydrogeological literature and divided them into three groups on the basis of an explicit absolute or relative criteria and heuristic definitions the second practical problem is the choice of the most reliable method for determining the extent of mining drainage in works on this subject the most common mathematical methods ranging from simple empirical formulas to solutions for complex hydrogeological models bresciani et al 2020 louwyck et al 2022 frequently questions asked by mining specialists inspired the authors of this paper to present the practical possibilities of the determination of the radius of influence of mine drainage since the existing literature on the subject is quite deficient the specific character of an underground mine as well as an open pit comes from the fact that unlike in the case of a well the radius of influence of the drainage of its excavations usually covers different aquifers over an area of sometimes many hundred or even several thousand square kilometres e g in north east england younger 1993 1998 and in poland różkowski 1997 the paper has been divided into three related parts the first analyses and discusses the various definitions of the radius of influence which are divided on the basis of the above mentioned criteria by bresciani et al 2020 the second discusses the methods of the radius of influence determination wherein the numerical modelling methods have only been briefly mentioned and their advantages and disadvantages indicated in the last part the authors present examples of various geological heterogeneities which have a major impact on the precision of the radius of influence determination these include the heterogeneity of the hydraulic network the multi layered nature of the drained aquifer and the presence of faults the radius of influence must be analysed individually in every area due to differences in geological structure or groundwater recharge konikow and leake 2014 since there are many examples of the other types of heterogeneity there could be a material for a separate publication this paper concentrates on the problems of the radius of influence determination in aquifers directly drained by mining excavations a separate wide ranging issue is the propagation and the radius of influence of mine drainage from a drained aquifer onto other aquifers that remain in direct or in indirect hydraulic contact with thereof 2 radius of influence definitions 2 1 general definitions due to the drainage of rock masses the level of groundwater around the draining object e g well ormining excavation is lowered which creates a cone of depression also called a drawdown cone poehls and smith 2009 or a pumping cone fetter 2001 these are some of the definitions of cone of depression can be found in the literature a mathematical definition has been given by castany and margat 1977 who define it as an ideal surface created by the equal depression curve located at different distances from a well a similar definition has been also given by todd and mays 2005 who state that in three dimensions the drawdown curve describes a conic shape known as the cone of depression a very general definition of the cone of depression has been given by fetter 2001 who states that the pumping cone is the area around a discharging well where the hydraulic head groundwater table in the aquifer has been lowered by pumping it should be noted that the quoted author ignores the question of the shape of the depression cone a similar definition of the cone of depression has been given by macioszczyk 2002 who adds that it demonstrates cylindrical symmetry whilst hiscock and bense 2014 only state that during the pumping of water in the well the surrounding area experiences the formation of a cone of depression and the shape of the cone depends on the pumping rate and on the hydraulic properties of the aquifer bocheńska 2002 uses the term mine depression cone to define the zone of drawdown of the groundwater table caused by the drainage of aquifers by the mine she also adds that the cone of depression may develop in several aquifers if they remain in constant hydraulic contact the drainage of rock masses through a well or mining excavation creates an area of the discharge of groundwater capture zone into this object it can be defined in two ways grubb 1993 defines the capture zone as the area of an aquifer in which all water will be removed by a pumping well or wells within a certain time period this definition underlines the development of the capture zone in time leap 1999 chapt 1 fig 1 34 defines the capture zone as the area around a well or well field from which water will move to the discharge point the capture zone has been similarly defined by rogoż 2004 although he identifies it with the radius of influence the boundary of the capture zone partially corresponds with the line of the radius of influence but it is defined by geological boundaries such as faults hydraulic contacts between aquifers as well as drainage divides of groundwater the area of the capture zone is therefore usually much bigger than the area defined by the radius of influence 2 2 quantitative definitions of the radius of influence from the perspective of mining practice the radius of influence of the pumped intake is of fundamental importance and the mine is considered a special case of such an intake important is also the area of the capture zone which generally overlaps with the radius of influence of the water intake but the steady state conditions usually go far beyond the radius of influence and depend on the overall flow conditions of the aquifer a wide ranging quantitative analysis of the radius of influence definition and of the criteria of its determination has been carried out by bresciani et al 2020 they have pointed to the multiplicity of various definitions which according to their character can be divided into three groups explicit relative and heuristic the first two criteria refer to the radius of influence in steady state conditions and the last to transient conditions e g theis equation for the radius of influence 2 2 1 explicit criterion definitions based on the explicit criterion originate from the classic solution of the differential equation by dupuit 1863 for the purpose of the well s water inflow calculation the flat radial schema in a homogeneous and isotropic rock formation on the basis of darcy s formula the upper limit of integration for the solution of this equation for the distance of from the well is according to dupuit op cit le rayon du massif filtrant l and for the water table height y it is the natural water table height h i e for l and for y h original diagrams from dupuit s paper fig 65 unconfined aquifer and fig 69 confined aquifer suggest that the term le rayon du massif filtrant is analogous with the term radius of influence these diagrams also demonstrate that the radius of influence is the distance from the well to the location where the value of depression equals zero in this case the value of the radius of influence is strictly defined this definition is widely accepted within the hydrogeological community e g de wiest 1965 castany and margat 1977 pazdro and kozerski 1990 kruseman and de ridder 1994 fetter 2001 de marsily 2004 todd and mays 2005 poehls and smith 2009 singhal and gupta 2010 şen 2015 it must be noted that castany and margat 1977 define the radius of influence as the distance from the well to the location where the depression is zero the absolute explicit criterion or is practically negligible thus it is partially a definition based on the relative criterion 2 2 2 relative criterion a transitional definition between the radius of influence i e the absolute and relative criterion is given by schwartz and zhang 2004 according to whom the radius of influence r is the distance from a pumped well to the edge of the cone of depression p 238 the edge of the cone of depression has not been clearly defined but we can assume that it corresponds to the location where the value of depression is zero kerkis 1967 believes that in real life conditions the cone of depression does not have any clear boundaries he therefore proposes the term theoretical radius of influence which represents the distance from the centre of an intake to the location where the drawdown of the water level or piezometric pressure has been independently assumed as insignificant p 318 the radius of influence is similarly defined by bocheńska 2002 who defines it as the distance from the point of the biggest drawdown of the piezometric surface usually at the location of the groundwater drainage to the location where this drawdown practically disappears p 111 similarly according to kashef 1986 the radius of influence is the distance from the well to the location where the drawdown is almost negligible p 283 and dragoni 1998 who defines the radius of influence as the distance beyond which the drawdown is so small that it cannot be detected moreover according to mikołajków 2012 it is the maximum distance at which the water table drawdown caused by the exploitation of the well can still be registered p 349 the above definitions of the radius of influence are difficult to apply in practice because they can be very subjective and produce major variations in the determined value of this radius for identical conditions of pumping water from an intake bearing this in mind certain boundary values of depression have been proposed which define the distance from the intake that corresponds to the radius of influence bresciani et al 2020 propose the implementation of an α coefficient defined as 1 α s r s where sr drawdown at the radius of influence at any given distance s drawdown at the well the α coefficient can achieve values in the range of 0 α 1 wherein α 0 implies that drawdown sr 0 thus the radius of influence is determined on the basis of the absolute criterion van poolen 1964 recommends the implementation of the coefficient value of α 0 01 i e for a drawdown of 1 in the well sw which simultaneously determines the value of the radius of influence for a specific depression curve wilk et al 1990 have implemented a single constant value of boundary drawdown sr 1 m in relation to the average level measured over multiple years which is independent from the depression in the well mine this value determines the value of the radius of influence but in the conditions of natural fluctuation of the water level in fissure and karst fissure aquifers at the order of several dozen or even tens of metres thus it is difficult to use this criterion for the determination of the radius of influence in practice it should be noted however that legget and hatheway 1988 p 166 have observed the drawdown of the original groundwater table by 0 3 m which is much less than 1 m suggested by many sources on the periphery of an area covered by the radius of influence of intensive drainage at a distance of 19 km from the pumping point 2 2 3 heuristic definition according to bresciani et al 2020 the number of heuristic definitions have been also proposed which are based on an approximation of the drawdown response in this approach the drawdown is assumed to be exactly equal zero beyond some distance which increases with time r f t it should be noted that the heuristic definitions does not requires the choice of a threshold criterion however it does not mean that they are less arbitrary than the criterion based methods since they are still based on the choice of an approximate response model or of a special characteristic of the response 3 methods of determining the radius of influence the radius of mine drainage influence is determined at the mine project stage and during its operation the cost of exploitation of a deposit must also take into consideration the effect of drainage of excavations on the water environment at the stage of exploitation and actual drainage it is necessary to determine the actual radius of drainage influence in the context of the occurrence of hydrogeological mining damage and any related repair costs 3 1 stage of prediction the following are available at the stage of prediction of size of the radius of influence empirical formulas hydrogeological analogy methods numerical modelling methods 3 1 1 empirical formulas empirical formulas used for the radius of influence calculations in steady state conditions can be divided into two groups those which do not include infiltration and those which include infiltration the first includes the sichardt and kusakin formulas rogoż 2004 soni et al 2014 2 s i c h a r d t f o r m u l a r 3000 s k 3 k u s a k i n f o r m u l a r 575 s kh where r radius of the cone of depression m s drawdown in well m k hydraulic conductivity m s h static height of the water table m the kerkis formula kerkis 1967 and the surow and kazański formula rogoż 2004 are examples of formulae which take into consideration the recharge of the drained layer through the infiltration of precipitation 4 k e r k i s f o r m u l a r 0 34 q w 5 s u r o w k a z a n s k i f o r m u l a r k w h 2 h 2 where q estimated inflow of water

of depression changes in time a modified theis 1938 formula reduced to a simple form after an appropriate transformation bresciani et al 2020 is most commonly used while the weber and kozeny formulas

unconfined aquifer or storage coefficient confined aquifer k hydraulic conductivity m d h static height of the water table m μ specific yield q estimated inflow of water into well m3 d empirical formulas have the advantage of being simple and easy to use however these formulas are applicable only to homogeneous and isotropic conditions which is their disadvantage they are generally used for the assessment of the radius of influence of drainage during the pumping of water from a well which diameter is negligible in relation to the size of the radius of influence the application of these formulae for the assessment of the radius of influence requires their modification by taking into account the equivalent mine radius ro which size may be similar to the calculated value of the radius of influence the modified radius of influence of drainage ro is calculated from the following formula 9 r 0 r 0 r the equivalent mine radius equals soni et al 2014 yihdego 2017 1 1 in the quoted paper the formula for the equivalent mine radius re formula 6 p 4 has been written erroneously r e f π 10 r 0 f π where f mine area among the presented formulae the sichardt and kusakin formulas are the least recommended practical experience has shown that the radius of influence of mine drainage calculated using these formulas is greatly underrated in comparison to the one observed during the drainage of mining excavations the kerkis and surow kazanski formulas assume the relationship between the radius of influence and the amount of precipitation infiltration for this reason these formulas are applicable to the conditions of unconfined aquifers i e in mining practice to open mines or to those underground mines where mining excavations are located below permeable formations in the case of simple geological structures the results of the calculation of the radius of influence using these formulas are close to actual values one of the features of formulae for transient conditions is the continuous increase of the radius of influence in time and therefore the predicted value within an unspecified time discretization will be momentarily equal to the actual value this is insufficient for prediction purposes of the effect of drainage at the designed mine on the water environment with different time discretization one of the advantages of these formulae is the possibility to estimate the radius of influence trend development in the theis formula the value of the radius of influence depends on hydrogeological properties of the drained aquifer and the c coefficient it is a constant value for different variants of the theis formula different values of the c constant have been proposed without any clear justification thus using the heuristic criterion bresciani et al 2020 according to information quoted by these authors the following values of the c constant are proposed 1 5 bear 1979 2 van poolen 1964 vela and mckinley 1970 lee 1982 2 83 hurst 1968 and 4 jones 1962 according to rogoż 2004 the values of the c constant should be in the range of 1 5 3 5 he recommends the implementation of a higher value for the calculation of the predicted radius of a water intake mining drainage influence but does not specify this value the weber formula can be converted into the theis formula and in that case the value of the c constant will be approx 9 5 the use of specific yield in this formula indicates that it is applicable to unconfined aquifers a similar observation applies to the kozeny formula which apart from the specific yield also includes the discharge inflow to mine which differentiates it from the other formulas for transient conditions however at the prognosis stage the predicted constant value of the water inflow to the mine is problematic since this value is very variable in actual conditions 3 1 2 hydrogeological analogy methods this method is based on the assumption that hydrogeological conditions in the vicinity of the mine for which the value of the radius of influence is being predicted are identical as in an active mine and differences in the radius of influence values are a consequence of different values of water inflow to the existing mine from those predicted for the designed mine kerkis 1967 11 r r 1 q q 1 12 r r 0 2 r 1 2 q q 1 where r q projected radius of influence and the projected water inflow to the planned mine r1 q1 radius of influence and groundwater inflow to the existing mine r0 equivalent radius of the planned mine formula 11 can be used to predict the radius of influence of a planned mine that is located close enough to an active mine to assume the similarity of hydrogeological conditions for both mines when deepening an existing mine e g the opening of a new mining level in an open pit formula 12 can be used in this case an equivalent radius ro is included in the formula for the mining development stage at this level if this is a cut which creates access to a new mining level or an initial mining phase at this level the equivalent radius is so small that formula 11 can be applied 3 1 3 numerical modelling method the numerical modelling method has a significant advantage over the empirical formulae as well as the hydrogeological analogies methods spitz and moreno 1996 kresic 2006 anderson et al 2015 zdechlik 2016 despite limitations resulting from an inevitable schematization of the geological structure hydrogeological conditions and especially conditions of recharge and drainage of the analysed groundwater bodies these methods enable one to consider the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the structural layers of the analysed groundwater body including aquifers as well as impermeable beds the most important fact in the context of the radius of influence determination is that this method takes into consideration all elements of the geological structure which influence the formation of areas of lower hydrodynamic pressure around the draining object this generally refers to non continuous displacements faults stratum pinch out zones or facial changes generally the boussinesq s formula cushman roisin and beckers 2011 is used as a base in these methods while the modelling assumptions are dependent on the adopted approach if the radius of influence is determined by the depression s 0 then an absolute criterion is used while when s a e g s 1 m is used to define the radius of influence a subjective criterion is adopted additionally via the identification calibration of the model depending on the degree of identification of the geological structure and hydrogeological conditions a high level of reliability of this model and thus very high precision of the performed calculations can be achieved the radius of influence of mine drainage determined using this method is therefore the most precise the precision of the numerical modelling method essentially depends however on the level of input data reliability and this requirement is often difficult to achieve in practice the identification of the geological structure and hydrogeological conditions in the outermost areas of the depression cone is often insufficient especially in cases when the cone of depression covers a large area additionally in order to determine the depression cone using this method knowledge of the original layout of the hydrodynamic field is necessary the above mentioned problems with obtaining a sufficient base of reliable data have led wolkersdorfer 2008 to state that a complicated numerical model based on a small number of unreliable data can be as unreliable as empirical formulas 3 2 stage of mine operation and actual mine drainage methods of determination of the radius of influence of mine drainage used during the prediction stage of the environmental effects of mining operations can also be used during the stage of mine operation nevertheless empirical formulae and hydrogeological analogy methods can only be used when changes in the water environment around the mine caused by the drainage of its excavations are not being monitored in such cases the results of numerical modelling methods if used for the determination of the radius of influence of drainage at the prediction stage also cannot be verified and the conceptual model cannot be corrected at this stage of mine operation analytical methods can be used but the main method of determination of the radius of influence is to analyse the results of water table changes in the drained rock masses attempts have also been made to determine the radius of influence using satellite technology zawadzki et al 2016 the possibilities of this method which is based on the condition of soil and vegetation on the terrain surface analyses are limited and according to the quoted authors it might only be useful to analyse results of the water environment changes around the drained mine in terms of the radius of influence of mine drainage 3 2 1 analytical methods theoretically for aquifers with the same permeability drawdown size and water supply to the well mine and the same mine geometry equivalent radius r0 the radius of influence for an unconfined aquifer is smaller than in a confined aquifer nevertheless only some mines have a drainage pattern that corresponds to the unconfined aquifer model most of them are compatible with the unconfined confined aquifer model due to the necessity to drain the rock mass to the level of the exploited deposit the method of groundwater dynamics formulas are rarely used in practice louwyck et al 2022 presented formulas that allow to calculate the radius of influence they are the result of solving mathematical equations for various physical models of aquifers all these models apply to homogeneous and isotropic centres which do not correspond to the actual conditions of mining drainage therefore the authors chose the simplest of them as an illustration of these methods i e the transformation of the dupuit s equation due to radius of influence from the dupuit s equation if the amount of the water inflow q into the mine is known it is possible to calculate the radius of influence r understood as the equivalent radius formula 9 following an appropriate transformation of the dupuit formula for water inflow into a complete well in unconfined and confined aquifers unconfined aquifer 13 q π k h 2 h 2 ln r r therefore 14 lnr π k h 2 h 2 q l n r confined aquifer 15 q 2 π k m s ln r r therefore 16 lnr 2 π k m s q l n r where h initial saturated thickness of an unconfined aquifer h thickness of partially drained aquifer m thickness of aquifer k hydraulic conductivity s drawdown in well m r radius of influence r radius of well when formulas 14 and 16 used in mining practice r is substituted by r0 and r by r0 according to the formula 9 the results of the radius of influence calculations with use of this method are slightly more reliable than the results obtained using empirical formulae but are affected by the same errors they are generally applicable to steady state conditions which in the case of mines and are only possible after several or 10 20 years after the beginning of the excavations drainage even in conditions which can be assumed as a quasi steady state the amount of inflow of water into a mine changes depending on the conditions of recharge which in turn depends on the amount of precipitation this raises the question whether minimum averages or maybe average inflow values for a given time period should be used in formulas 14 and 16 the other components of these formulas such as the height of the initial water table and the height of the water table drawdown as a result of drainage as well as filtration coefficients should also be averaged which would lead to the analysis of the drained rock masses as a homogeneous and isotropic formation consequently the result of these calculations is a line indicating the drainage radius of influence in the shape of a circle thus the radius of influence calculated in this way is the same in all directions and because of the operation of averaging of the components of formulas 13 15 it may differ significantly from the actual radius of influence of drainage 3 2 2 monitoring of the water environment monitoring of the water environment which includes surface and groundwater is the main method of the determination of the radius of influence and its changes in time and in different directions the results of monitoring provide a basis for the determination of the radius of influence that most closely resembles its actual geometry however the correct identification of the geological structure is of major importance here as is the quality of monitoring i e the area of terrain covered by monitoring the density of monitoring points and the frequency of observations in practice for economic reasons only the area of the planned mining of deposits and its surroundings are more precisely analysed at the cost of the outermost areas covered by the radius of influence of mine drainage therefore only more or less precise identification of its actual geometry is possible the monitoring of changes in the groundwater level is of key importance to the determination of the cone of depression geometry a clear opinion on this issue has been given by cassan 1994 who believes that the radius of influence can only be determined experimentally i e through the monitoring of changes in the level of the groundwater table near the drainage point because observation points piezometers can be installed in any given number in selected locations at different distances from the drainage point and in all aquifers that may be affected by the drainage nevertheless a necessary condition for the precise determination of the radius of influence on the basis of monitoring results is the knowledge of the initial natural condition of the groundwater level and its seasonal fluctuations during a period before the beginning of drainage in the analysed aquifer according to bieniewski 1978 the precise determination of the radius of influence requires observations of natural changes of the groundwater table level to be frequent and long lasting in order to differentiate seasonal fluctuations caused by natural factors from those caused by artificial drainage the area covered by the cone of depression can be divided into three vaguely delimited zones evident probable and uncertain fig 1 they are defined subjectively on the basis of intuition and past experience i e using the heuristic criterion and with the consideration of the amplitude of fluctuation of the groundwater level the width of vague transitions between the individual zones depends on the quality of monitoring tests this mainly applies to the density of the monitoring network and the coverage of the whole area of the depression cone and its surrounding area by this network as well as to the frequency of measurements in practice for economic reasons the piezometer network is more densely provided in the close vicinity to the mine and is very sparse in locations distant from the mine whereas only individual piezometers if any are installed on the periphery of the depression cone the frequency of measurement of the groundwater level in piezometers depends on the implemented methodology the application of appropriate recorders enables continuous measurement of the water level in a piezometer while the use of traditional measuring methods which require personal presence on the site greatly reduces their frequency the knowledge of long term patterns of groundwater level fluctuations depending on the amount of precipitation in the period before the beginning of the mine drainage facilitates the division of the area of the cone of depression into the proposed zones fig 1 the absence of such data basically enables the determination of only the first zone boundaries where the influence of mine drainage is evident in this situation the remaining area of the cone of depression outside of this zone should be classified as a zone in which the influence of drainage is uncertain a zone in which this influence is probable is therefore absent in identical weather conditions expressed as the amount of precipitation the amplitude of fluctuation of water level depends mainly on the water capacity of an aquifer which is measured by coefficients of open porosity and specific yield recession under the same amount of precipitation the lowest amplitude of fluctuation was recorded for porous aquifers while the highest amplitude was recorded for fissure and karst fissure aquifers this was demonstrated by the changes of the groundwater level in different types of aquifers in the olkusz zn pb district sw poland following catastrophic rainfall which affected southern poland in july 1997 according to adamczyk and motyka 2000 in quaternary sands porous aquifer the water level rose by about 1 5 m in jurassic limestones karst fissures aquifer by about 10 m in triassic carbonates porous karst fissures aquifer by between 2 6 and 23 m and in palaeozoic carbonates karst fissures aquifer by about 40 m for years with an average precipitation the amplitudes of the water level fluctuations were much lower but in fissure and karst fissure aquifers they were still of the order of several metres this complicates very significantly the determination of the size of depression at any given time in an area affected by mine drainage and greatly affects the precision of the determined radius of influence 3 2 3 practical examples the value of the drawdown of groundwater level measured at various distances from the drained mine represents a basis for analysis of the depression curve for the purpose of determination of the radius of influence using simple methods the least complicated analytical method is calculation of the radius of influence on the basis of measurement of depression values s1 and s2 in two different points located at the distances of r1 and r2 from the mine following appropriate transformation of the dupuit s formulas we achieve a formula for an unconfined aquifer kerkis 1967 18 lgr s 1 2 h s 1 l g r 2 s 2 2 h s 2 l g r 1 s 1 s 2 2 h s 1 s 2 and for a confined aquifer kerkis 1967 polak et al 2015 2 2 the authors have erroneously written formula 19 in the following way lgr s 1 l g x 2 s 2 l g x 1 s s s 1 19 lgr s 1 l g r 2 s 2 l g r 1 s 1 s 2 the analytical method is based on the assumption that the depression curve is a logarithmic function that is compatible with the dupuit s equation applicable to a homogeneous and isotropic formation in this case the calculation of the radius of influence only requires two random points located at different distances from the mine in which the value of depression has been measured in practice an actual rock formation is far from ideal as a result of the presence of heterogeneities inside the drained aquifer as well as geological discontinuities this can be observed for example in porphyry laccolith from zalas near cracow in which the development of the cone of depression was strictly related to the heterogeneity of the internal hydraulic structure in three piezometers which were used to measure the water table level along a line running in the ns direction fig 6 and were located at distances of 50 5 m 89 6 m and 670 m from the pumping well the values of depression of about 0 56 m 0 48 m and 2 6 m respectively were recorded the value of the radius of influence calculated using formula 19 on the basis of data from the first two piezometers was 2800 m on the basis of the first and third piezometer 25 m and on the basis of the second and third piezometer 57 m cases such as the one of the laccolith from zalas although spectacular are very rare in a mining practice a different example of the use of formula 18 for the calculation of the radius of influence is the olkusz zinc ore and lead ore mine located about 35 km to the nw of cracow the excavations of this mine have caused the drainage of carbonate triassic rocks three piezometers on the basis of conditions recorded in february of 1971 were selected for the calculation of the radius of influence of the cone of depression bo 2 b and bż 4 situated to the south of the mine fig 2 the distances of the piezometers from the reference point representing the mine were as follows the first 375 m the second 3300 m and the third 4030 m while depression in these points was measured at 96 m 18 5 m and 5 5 m respectively the values of the radius of influence r measured on the basis of the data pairs from these piezometers were as follows piezometers bo 2 and b radius r 5540 m bo 2 and bż 4 radius r 1980 m and b and bż 4 radius r 4380 m in this case the radius of influence of the cone measured on the basis of the second pair of piezometers was significantly smaller than the one calculated on the basis of the two other pairs the presented examples of application of the analytical method consisting of the calculation of the radius of influence using formulas 17 or 18 on the basis of two monitoring points in which the value of depression was determined for the same time discretization have demonstrated that this method is highly unreliable it can possibly be used in the case of homogeneous aquifers and simple geological structures in this case the cone of depression develops around the mine and can be projected for any cross section with sufficient precision by a curve generated from the dupuit s equation such an object may have for example a form of sand or gravel excavation with a relatively small radius of influence of drainage the radius of influence is determined on the basis of monitoring results using the graphical method which uses the logarithmic relation between the value of depression and the distance from a given drainage point sr f lg r in an s vs lg r axis system a straight line can be drawn through a set of points which the point of intersection with the r axis s 0 defines the radius of influence of drainage r fig 3 the advantage of this method is its simplicity and given a sufficient number of observation points located at different distances from the mine the possibility of the determination of the radius of influence in different directions fig 3 the graphical method also has its shortcomings resulting mainly from the presence of various geological factors such as for example the heterogeneity of an aquifer faults stratum pinch out zones recharge from the river or hydraulic contacts between different aquifers within the radius of influence of drainage additionally a mine that is in a development stage increases its dimensions therefore the distance to the various observation points decreases with time usually in order to determine the distance of a given piezometer from the mine a reference point that represents the middle of the mine is selected on the basis of a criterion such as the rate of water inflow to its various regions the substitution of the mine area with a reference point can be a source of error in the distance determination of a piezometer from the mine which becomes bigger when the piezometer is closer to the mining excavations with water inflows interpretation of the set of points in the s f lg r coordinate system in terms of the determination of the radius of influence can be performed using regression analysis which provides a degree of impartiality to such an interpretation in the event of a large spread of a set of points a subset of points can be subjectively selected which will visually be most favourably arranged along a straight line this then represents the use of the graphical method in its pure form but it has the disadvantage of being subjective i e the radius of influence of drainage can achieve different values which due to the logarithmic scale can differ significantly from one other depending on the selection of the sub set of points for interpretation and the route of the straight line through the selected sub set of points alternatively a statistical regression analysis method can be used for this purpose as was done for the point sets shown in fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 the determination of the radius of influence on the basis of the depression measurement across the entire set of piezometers provides as a result a single average value of the radius of influence which assumes the analysed aquifer to be a homogeneous and isotropic formation with a sufficient number of piezometers the graphical method or the regression analysis can be used to define the radius of influence of drainage for different sectors fig 3 which could reveal the irregular shape of the cone of depression an example of the above can be found in the interpretation of the monitoring results in the area of the zn pb olkusz mine based on data from 1971 the following values of the radius of influence have been achieved for individual sectors sector nr 9800 m er 11000 m sr 5500 m all piezometers r 4800 m almost double values of the radius of influence in relation to sector s were recorded for sectors n and e the lowest value of the radius of influence was recorded for the entire set of piezometers i e with the assumption that the triassic aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic the most developed form of the graphical method of the radius of influence determination is an interpretation of the depression contour map it is created on the basis of the comparison of contour maps for the natural conditions and for the drawdown within a specified time discretization this map can then constitute a basis for determination of the radius of influence in any direction an example of this is a depression contour map of the area surrounding the bolesław and olkusz zn pb ore mines near olkusz sw poland based on data from 1967 fig 4 due to the overlapping influence of the drainage of both mines examples of the radius of influence of the drainage of the olkusz mine were determined in the n e se and sw directions fig 5 the following results for the individual directions were recorded nr 1900 m er 6650 m ser 6700 m swr 4200 m the comparison of the values of radius of influence recorded for the sectors and their analysis as the result of the interpretation of the depression contour map has revealed certain shortcomings of the graphical method an average of the values of the radius of influence in the se and sw directions for the depression contour map gives the value of 5450 m for the s direction which is almost the same as for the set of piezometers in the s sector 5500 m simultaneously much higher values were recorded for the sets of piezometers in the n and e sectors in comparison to these directions selected from the depression contour map which was developed on the basis of data recorded for a period preceding the data set used for the sectors method by approximately 4 years during this time the radius of influence may have increased significantly this statement is justified in the e direction because in 1970 farming wells in settlements located at a distance of 10 km in the s and se directions experienced a water shortage that was related to the drainage of the olkusz mine excavations such large differences in the radius of influence recorded using these two methods cannot be explained in this way in the n direction there is a fault with a high discharge range at a distance of about 2 km from the olkusz mine which reduces the possibility of propagation of the depression cone in the northern direction resulting in the observed differences the graphical method based on sets of depression values in individual sectors does not allow for the consideration of various geological discontinuities such as fault zones a depression contour map can also include such discontinuities in a wider scope therefore the obtained values of the radius of influence are much more reliable 4 radius of influence of mine drainage geological factors the shape of the cone of depression around a mine and therefore the radius of influence of mine drainage is greatly affected by geological factors in the case of small mining facilities and small area drainage heterogeneities of the hydraulic network in a drained aquifer are a decisive factor when the radius of influence of drainage is in a range of several or over a dozen kilometres the shape of the cone of depression is determined by elements of the geological structure such as tectonics or hydraulic contacts of the drained aquifer with other aquifers on the basis of many years of professional experience mainly in the olkusz zn pb district the authors have given examples of the influence of selected geological factors on the shape of radius of influence of mine drainage in some cases the boundaries of the funnel may be rivers konikow and leake 2014 but in the olkusz ore mining region the groundwater level in the area of the depression cone is below the bottom of the watercourses so they do not have a significant influence on its shape 4 1 internal heterogeneities of aquifer the drainage of a homogeneous isotropic aquifer causes the creation of a cone of depression around the well in the shape of a circle of a specific radius if an aquifer is heterogeneous and anisotropic the radius of influence may have different dimensions in different directions the shape of the cone of depression in this case is determined by the hydraulic properties of the aquifer osiensky et al 2000 hiscock and bense 2014 one example of the effect of internal heterogeneities of the hydraulic network on the development of the cone of depression is demonstrated by the results of a pumping test in a lithologically homogeneous porphyry intrusion in zalas near cracow s poland the porphyry intrusion has the form of a laccolith that has pushed in between the layers of lower and upper carboniferous strata dżułyński 1955 the lower carboniferous stratum there is represented by shales with insets of sandstones limestones and breccias the upper carboniferous stratum is represented by a complex of shales and sandstones with insets of conglomerates and stony coals in the upper permian and lower triassic strata the roof of the porphyry laccolith has been eroded a large section of it is covered by random middle and upper jurassic formations fig 6 the middle jurassic formations are represented in the lower part by sands and sandstones and in the upper part by sandy limestones the upper jurassic stratum has a lithologically dual structure in the lower part it consists of marls and in the upper part of limestone slabs and rocks palaeozoic and mesozoic formations are covered by quaternary sediments moraine clays fluvioglacial sands loess and locally by saprolite clays faults of the main orientations of ene wsw and auxiliary orientations of nnw sse are present in the area of the intrusion fig 6 the discharge ranges of the faults reach 50 m porphyry is excavated in the quarry for use as a construction material hydrogeological properties of porphyry laccolith were determined on the basis of the pumping test results consisting of a system pumping well and five observation wells fig 6 pumping at the rate of 200 m3 day was performed for 32 days the results of the pumping and their interpretation were presented by bogacz et al 1984 the depression in the pumping well after several hours reached 58 m and remained at this level until the end of pumping while in the observation wells p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 23 the depression ranged between 0 7 and 0 9 m depression in piezometer p 20 on the 11th day of pumping was recorded at 2 6 m and then the water level dropped below the bottom of the piezometer at the same time the value of depression in the other four piezometers was recorded between 0 48 m and 0 67 m table 1 around the 20th day of pumping there were reports of a significant fall of the water level in farming wells collecting water from the porphyry laccolith which rendered them unusable the determination of the value of the radius of influence based on results of the presented pumping test using current methods is practically impossible one example is the graphical method which is based on the relation between the depression and the logarithm of the distance from the pumping well fig 7 the radius of influence could be determined in the ns direction on the basis of depression in piezometers p 2 and p 3 after 11 days of pumping it would equal about 340 m and at the end of pumping on the 32nd day about 560 m the value of depression in piezometer p 20 which on the 11th day of the pumping test stood at 2 6 m undermines these results the value of depression in the ne sw direction on the other hand irrespective of distance is very close both on the 11th day of pumping and at its completion on the 32nd day the graphical method cannot be implemented in this case because the radius of influence would probably reach the boundaries of the porphyry laccolith the course of the drawdown of the water table in the porphyry laccolith during the analysed pumping test presents interpretation difficulties because of mainly two reasons 1 significantly greater depression recorded in piezometer p 20 located at 670 m from the pumping well in comparison to other piezometers located in its vicinity 2 uniform drawdown of the water table in piezometers p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 23 fig 7 the problem of different values of depression in piezometer p 20 than in other piezometers has been explained by bogacz et al 1984 as resulting from the dual layer structure of the laccolith related to variable density of fractures consequently these layers have very different hydrogeological properties especially in terms of transmissivity and specific yield fig 8 tab 1 the upper zone which forms a kind of crust on the main laccolith is covered by a dense network of thermal fractures peripheral joints and also partly weathered fractures the second internal zone which includes only conical and radial joints is characterised by a more sparse network of fractures the aperture of which probably decreases with the depth of the fractures a pumping well of the depth of 70 m collected water from both zones while piezometers p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 23 of the depth of approx 15 m filtrated the upper zone and the observation well of the depth of approx 20 m in the lower zone fig 8 which is indicated by significantly lower transmissivity and specific yield than in the other piezometers tab 1 the pumping of water caused faster dewatering of fractures in the lower zone than in the upper resulting in the different rates of the groundwater table drawdown in both zones the porphyry laccolith in zalas is a relatively small geological formation in the conditions of the limited water capacity of the thermal fracture network table 1 and poor recharge from the jurassic and carboniferous aquifers the system of fractures in the laccolith was rapidly drained during the pumping process this resulted in a uniform drawdown of the water table across the entire laccolith 4 2 aquifer with a heterogeneous lithological structure examples of drainage in an aquifer made up of several layers of a similar lithological type are frequently seen in mining practice theoretically changes in the water table level in each layer should be monitored and the radius of influence should be determined for each of them for various reasons mainly economic this kind of monitoring is unfeasible it is assumed therefore that the drained rock formation is a single theoretically homogeneous aquifer this assumption may generate problems in the determination of the boundaries of the cone of depression as illustrated on the example of a triassic aquifer in the olkusz area which is drained by the excavations of zinc and lead ore mines the triassic aquifer is built up of lower and middle triassic dolomites and limestones which in the years 1946 2022 was drained from the workings of the underground zn pb ore mine carbonate triassic rocks create an aquifer of the porous karst fissure type in dolomites and karst fissure type in limestones motyka 1998 zuber and motyka 1998 fractures and caverns have a small specific volume of the order of 0 005 but high conductivity of the order of n 10 4 m s in the case of fractures and n 10 1 m s in the case of caverns motyka and szuwarzyński 1994 motyka 1998 these components of the hydraulic network in carbonate rocks are therefore a conductive element pore space has a much higher specific volume of the order of 0 02 in limestone and 0 1 in dolomites with low conductivity of the order of 10 10 m s in limestones and n 10 8 m s in dolomites it is also important that the mean value of specific yield of the pore space in limestones is 0 0006 and in dolomites is in the order of 0 03 table 2 and represents a conductive element in those rocks the mean geometrical values of filtration coefficients for diplopora and ore bearing dolomites determined on the basis of the pumping tests results are of the order of n 10 4 m s and are higher by one order of magnitude than those for the olkusz and gogolin limestones and by two orders of magnitude than those for rhoethian dolomites table 2 the mean geometrical value of the filtration coefficient for the entire triassic carbonate rock mass equals 6 5 10 5 m s motyka and wilk 1976 the values of the storage coefficient determined on the basis of pumping tests in observation wells and interpretation of the water table level changes in the triassic aquifer resulting from mine drainage wilk and motyka 1980 are approximately 0 03 in terms of hydrogeological properties the triassic aquifer locally has a triple structure its upper part consists of diplopora and ore bearing dolomites the middle part consists of olkusz and gogolin limestones and the lower of rhoethian dolomites however due to the heterogeneity and anisotropy of carbonate rocks in the scale of a single cross section measuring point the relationship between the hydrogeological properties of these three layers may differ this is reflected by the changes in the water table level resulting from mine drainage in separate layers of the triassic aquifer some of the piezometers were established to register water table levels simultaneously in different layers of this aquifer in the same measuring point these layers were usually ore bearing dolomites and rhoethian dolomites three types of reactions of the water table in those piezometers can be identified fig 9 in natural conditions and in conditions affected by mine drainage there is practically the same water level in both layers a in natural conditions and in conditions affected by mine drainage there is a constant difference in the water level in both layers b the water table drops as a result of mine drainage at different rates and with time the difference in the water levels in both layers increases c the reliability of the calculation of the radius of influence significantly depends on data from piezometers in group b and c wherein in the case of piezometers in group c the calculation error increases in subsequent time discretizations discrepancies in the radius of influence of drainage determination on the basis of water level changes monitoring results in a multi layered aquifer have been shown on the basis of piezometers bo 20 and b fig 2 water level has been measured independently in those observation wells in ore bearing dolomites od and in rhoethian dolomites rt both of these piezometers belong to group c wherein the water level in ore bearing dolomites in piezometer bo 20 dropped more slowly than in rhoethian dolomites while a reverse effect was observed in piezometer b table 3 the values of the radius of influence were calculated using formula 18 the combination of four possible results of calculations is as follows od1 od2 14900 m od1 rt2 5100 m od2 rt1 4600 m rt1 rt2 3500 m the obtained results have demonstrated that in the case of an aquifer consisting of rock layers with a similar lithological structure limestones and dolomites the values of the radius of influence of drainage calculated on the basis of data from two piezometers differs greatly depending on the selected data pair the radius of influence of drainage is in the range between 3 5 and 14 9 km 4 3 faults faults have a major impact on the conditions of groundwater flow depending on the discharge range in relation to the thickness of the aquifer on the fault line a reduction of the effective hydraulic cross section occurs fig 10 which consequently hampers the flow of water in this layer in a direction perpendicular to the dislocation a fault can radically reduce or even terminate the flow of water in a direction perpendicular to its orientation if its discharge range is close to or higher than the thickness of the aquifer such dislocations divide the aquifer into separate hydrostructures with different hydraulic properties in natural conditions the hydrogeological functions of a fault are usually unrevealed because the shape of the piezometric surface of the groundwater table depends mainly on the layout of local areas of an aquifer recharge and drainage long term development of hydrodynamic equilibrium in geological terms causes the equalisation of hydrodynamic pressure on both sides of the fault irrespectively of its discharge range only the distortion of this natural hydrodynamic field as a result of intensive pumping of water from the aquifer e g due to mine drainage reveals the role of the dislocation as a hydrogeological barrier an easy way to initially evaluate the hydrological role of a fault is to project the adjacent edges of the fault onto a vertical plane and to create on this basis a graph of the degree of reduction of the aquifer on the fault plane depending on the level of geological examination this graph can be created using a series of geological sections through the fault fig 10 or using a geological map with indicated discharge ranges of the faults an analysis of the charts of the degree of reduction of the aquifer along fault planes carried out at the olkusz zinc and lead ore mining department revealed that the groundwater flow in conditions affected by mine drainage is significantly obstructed by hydrogeological barriers in the form of dislocations along which the relation of the length of hydraulic contact mk to the thickness of the aquifer m is lower than approx 0 5 motyka 1988 examples of charts of the reduction degree of an aquifer on fault planes for faults of various discharge rates have been shown in fig 11 fault with a small discharge rate ii fault with a large discharge rate a chart of the reduction of effective cross section in a fault zone b contours map c groundwater table along the cross section line faults with discharge rates higher than the half of the thickness of triassic rock aquifers in the conditions of intensive drainage from the workings of the zn pb ore mines in the olkusz area represent the locations of discontinuity of the depression curve such dislocations may cause the disruption of the groundwater table continuity and reduce possibilities of propagation of the depression cone in a perpendicular direction to their orientation as a result faults of high drop significantly affect the shape of the cone of depression fig 4 5 conclusions the available classic definitions of the radius of influence are not very useful in practice especially in the case of mine drainage in actual field conditions the cone of depression does not have any sharp edges and often extends to areas that are insufficiently examined in geological and hydrogeological terms therefore requires a different approach which can be based on the empirical formulas method the hydrogeological analogy method the numerical modelling method methods based on the groundwater monitoring results unfortunately the determination of the radius of influence can be further complicated or even prevented by heterogeneities of various sizes in the drained aquifer as presented at the example of porphyry laccolith in zalas sw poland moreover depending on the implemented definition of the radius of influence cone of depression and the implemented method of its determination the results of calculations may significantly differ from each other despite the same initial conditions therefore given the availability of an extensive and reliable database of monitoring results the most recommended method of the determination of the radius of influence of drainage is the numerical modelling method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

2953,the determination of the radius of influence for mining excavation drainage is of major significance in mining both for practical and legal reasons this paper describes various definitions of the radius of influence cone of depression and discusses different methods of its determination with the consideration of their advantages and disadvantages it demonstrates specific examples of practical problems related to determination of the radius of influence resulting from the heterogeneity of the internal hydraulic network in porphyries aquifers made of dolomites and limestone and the presence of faults which affect the form of the water table in the mine drainage influence area keywords mine drainage radius of influence cone of depression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the exploitation of mineral deposits below the natural water table level requires drainage of the rock masses which results in the drawdown of the water table this entails transformation of the natural water conditions in the mine drainage influence area according to legal regulations this represents environmental damage which has to be eliminated or financially compensated for the mining industry this consequently represents a serious economic problem and is therefore one of the major issues of mining hydrogeology both at the stage of mine design as well as its operation the aspect of the determination of the radius of influence is both theoretical as well as practical the purpose of the theoretical considerations is an attempt to find the most reliable method of the radius of influence determination the practical aspect amounts to determination of the legal responsibility extent for damages resulting from mine drainage the consequence of drainage of mining excavations is a lowering of the water table and inevitably the permanent disappearance of springs drying of surface watercourses or reduction of their efficiency drainage of wetlands gradual drying of ponds and lakes and lowering or disappearance of water in wells e g younger et al 2002 wolkersdorfer 2006 these phenomena occur not only within the depression cone in hosted rocks but also in other aquifers that have various types of hydraulic connections to them however the radius of influence and the extent of legal responsibility resulting from the drainage of mining excavations overlap only partially in many cases the problems with determining the extent of mining drainage in practice begin with the selection of its definition from among various ones that can be found in the hydrogeological literature the mathematical definition of the radius of influence was first formulated by dupuit 1863 in his classic work as the upper limit of integration in a differential equation the solution of which is a formula of the water inflow to a well in the conditions of the steady flow of groundwater this theoretical concept has been since included in various versions in hydrogeological guidebooks and dictionaries e g castany and margat 1977 fetter 2001 todd and mays 2005 poehls and smith 2009 hiscock and bense 2014 de marsily 2004 singhal and gupta 2010 this type of definition however is not very useful in hydrogeological practice the question of the definition of the radius of influence and the criteria of its determination has been widely and extensively analysed in recent time by bresciani et al 2020 they have pointed to the various versions of this definition present in hydrogeological literature and divided them into three groups on the basis of an explicit absolute or relative criteria and heuristic definitions the second practical problem is the choice of the most reliable method for determining the extent of mining drainage in works on this subject the most common mathematical methods ranging from simple empirical formulas to solutions for complex hydrogeological models bresciani et al 2020 louwyck et al 2022 frequently questions asked by mining specialists inspired the authors of this paper to present the practical possibilities of the determination of the radius of influence of mine drainage since the existing literature on the subject is quite deficient the specific character of an underground mine as well as an open pit comes from the fact that unlike in the case of a well the radius of influence of the drainage of its excavations usually covers different aquifers over an area of sometimes many hundred or even several thousand square kilometres e g in north east england younger 1993 1998 and in poland różkowski 1997 the paper has been divided into three related parts the first analyses and discusses the various definitions of the radius of influence which are divided on the basis of the above mentioned criteria by bresciani et al 2020 the second discusses the methods of the radius of influence determination wherein the numerical modelling methods have only been briefly mentioned and their advantages and disadvantages indicated in the last part the authors present examples of various geological heterogeneities which have a major impact on the precision of the radius of influence determination these include the heterogeneity of the hydraulic network the multi layered nature of the drained aquifer and the presence of faults the radius of influence must be analysed individually in every area due to differences in geological structure or groundwater recharge konikow and leake 2014 since there are many examples of the other types of heterogeneity there could be a material for a separate publication this paper concentrates on the problems of the radius of influence determination in aquifers directly drained by mining excavations a separate wide ranging issue is the propagation and the radius of influence of mine drainage from a drained aquifer onto other aquifers that remain in direct or in indirect hydraulic contact with thereof 2 radius of influence definitions 2 1 general definitions due to the drainage of rock masses the level of groundwater around the draining object e g well ormining excavation is lowered which creates a cone of depression also called a drawdown cone poehls and smith 2009 or a pumping cone fetter 2001 these are some of the definitions of cone of depression can be found in the literature a mathematical definition has been given by castany and margat 1977 who define it as an ideal surface created by the equal depression curve located at different distances from a well a similar definition has been also given by todd and mays 2005 who state that in three dimensions the drawdown curve describes a conic shape known as the cone of depression a very general definition of the cone of depression has been given by fetter 2001 who states that the pumping cone is the area around a discharging well where the hydraulic head groundwater table in the aquifer has been lowered by pumping it should be noted that the quoted author ignores the question of the shape of the depression cone a similar definition of the cone of depression has been given by macioszczyk 2002 who adds that it demonstrates cylindrical symmetry whilst hiscock and bense 2014 only state that during the pumping of water in the well the surrounding area experiences the formation of a cone of depression and the shape of the cone depends on the pumping rate and on the hydraulic properties of the aquifer bocheńska 2002 uses the term mine depression cone to define the zone of drawdown of the groundwater table caused by the drainage of aquifers by the mine she also adds that the cone of depression may develop in several aquifers if they remain in constant hydraulic contact the drainage of rock masses through a well or mining excavation creates an area of the discharge of groundwater capture zone into this object it can be defined in two ways grubb 1993 defines the capture zone as the area of an aquifer in which all water will be removed by a pumping well or wells within a certain time period this definition underlines the development of the capture zone in time leap 1999 chapt 1 fig 1 34 defines the capture zone as the area around a well or well field from which water will move to the discharge point the capture zone has been similarly defined by rogoż 2004 although he identifies it with the radius of influence the boundary of the capture zone partially corresponds with the line of the radius of influence but it is defined by geological boundaries such as faults hydraulic contacts between aquifers as well as drainage divides of groundwater the area of the capture zone is therefore usually much bigger than the area defined by the radius of influence 2 2 quantitative definitions of the radius of influence from the perspective of mining practice the radius of influence of the pumped intake is of fundamental importance and the mine is considered a special case of such an intake important is also the area of the capture zone which generally overlaps with the radius of influence of the water intake but the steady state conditions usually go far beyond the radius of influence and depend on the overall flow conditions of the aquifer a wide ranging quantitative analysis of the radius of influence definition and of the criteria of its determination has been carried out by bresciani et al 2020 they have pointed to the multiplicity of various definitions which according to their character can be divided into three groups explicit relative and heuristic the first two criteria refer to the radius of influence in steady state conditions and the last to transient conditions e g theis equation for the radius of influence 2 2 1 explicit criterion definitions based on the explicit criterion originate from the classic solution of the differential equation by dupuit 1863 for the purpose of the well s water inflow calculation the flat radial schema in a homogeneous and isotropic rock formation on the basis of darcy s formula the upper limit of integration for the solution of this equation for the distance of from the well is according to dupuit op cit le rayon du massif filtrant l and for the water table height y it is the natural water table height h i e for l and for y h original diagrams from dupuit s paper fig 65 unconfined aquifer and fig 69 confined aquifer suggest that the term le rayon du massif filtrant is analogous with the term radius of influence these diagrams also demonstrate that the radius of influence is the distance from the well to the location where the value of depression equals zero in this case the value of the radius of influence is strictly defined this definition is widely accepted within the hydrogeological community e g de wiest 1965 castany and margat 1977 pazdro and kozerski 1990 kruseman and de ridder 1994 fetter 2001 de marsily 2004 todd and mays 2005 poehls and smith 2009 singhal and gupta 2010 şen 2015 it must be noted that castany and margat 1977 define the radius of influence as the distance from the well to the location where the depression is zero the absolute explicit criterion or is practically negligible thus it is partially a definition based on the relative criterion 2 2 2 relative criterion a transitional definition between the radius of influence i e the absolute and relative criterion is given by schwartz and zhang 2004 according to whom the radius of influence r is the distance from a pumped well to the edge of the cone of depression p 238 the edge of the cone of depression has not been clearly defined but we can assume that it corresponds to the location where the value of depression is zero kerkis 1967 believes that in real life conditions the cone of depression does not have any clear boundaries he therefore proposes the term theoretical radius of influence which represents the distance from the centre of an intake to the location where the drawdown of the water level or piezometric pressure has been independently assumed as insignificant p 318 the radius of influence is similarly defined by bocheńska 2002 who defines it as the distance from the point of the biggest drawdown of the piezometric surface usually at the location of the groundwater drainage to the location where this drawdown practically disappears p 111 similarly according to kashef 1986 the radius of influence is the distance from the well to the location where the drawdown is almost negligible p 283 and dragoni 1998 who defines the radius of influence as the distance beyond which the drawdown is so small that it cannot be detected moreover according to mikołajków 2012 it is the maximum distance at which the water table drawdown caused by the exploitation of the well can still be registered p 349 the above definitions of the radius of influence are difficult to apply in practice because they can be very subjective and produce major variations in the determined value of this radius for identical conditions of pumping water from an intake bearing this in mind certain boundary values of depression have been proposed which define the distance from the intake that corresponds to the radius of influence bresciani et al 2020 propose the implementation of an α coefficient defined as 1 α s r s where sr drawdown at the radius of influence at any given distance s drawdown at the well the α coefficient can achieve values in the range of 0 α 1 wherein α 0 implies that drawdown sr 0 thus the radius of influence is determined on the basis of the absolute criterion van poolen 1964 recommends the implementation of the coefficient value of α 0 01 i e for a drawdown of 1 in the well sw which simultaneously determines the value of the radius of influence for a specific depression curve wilk et al 1990 have implemented a single constant value of boundary drawdown sr 1 m in relation to the average level measured over multiple years which is independent from the depression in the well mine this value determines the value of the radius of influence but in the conditions of natural fluctuation of the water level in fissure and karst fissure aquifers at the order of several dozen or even tens of metres thus it is difficult to use this criterion for the determination of the radius of influence in practice it should be noted however that legget and hatheway 1988 p 166 have observed the drawdown of the original groundwater table by 0 3 m which is much less than 1 m suggested by many sources on the periphery of an area covered by the radius of influence of intensive drainage at a distance of 19 km from the pumping point 2 2 3 heuristic definition according to bresciani et al 2020 the number of heuristic definitions have been also proposed which are based on an approximation of the drawdown response in this approach the drawdown is assumed to be exactly equal zero beyond some distance which increases with time r f t it should be noted that the heuristic definitions does not requires the choice of a threshold criterion however it does not mean that they are less arbitrary than the criterion based methods since they are still based on the choice of an approximate response model or of a special characteristic of the response 3 methods of determining the radius of influence the radius of mine drainage influence is determined at the mine project stage and during its operation the cost of exploitation of a deposit must also take into consideration the effect of drainage of excavations on the water environment at the stage of exploitation and actual drainage it is necessary to determine the actual radius of drainage influence in the context of the occurrence of hydrogeological mining damage and any related repair costs 3 1 stage of prediction the following are available at the stage of prediction of size of the radius of influence empirical formulas hydrogeological analogy methods numerical modelling methods 3 1 1 empirical formulas empirical formulas used for the radius of influence calculations in steady state conditions can be divided into two groups those which do not include infiltration and those which include infiltration the first includes the sichardt and kusakin formulas rogoż 2004 soni et al 2014 2 s i c h a r d t f o r m u l a r 3000 s k 3 k u s a k i n f o r m u l a r 575 s kh where r radius of the cone of depression m s drawdown in well m k hydraulic conductivity m s h static height of the water table m the kerkis formula kerkis 1967 and the surow and kazański formula rogoż 2004 are examples of formulae which take into consideration the recharge of the drained layer through the infiltration of precipitation 4 k e r k i s f o r m u l a r 0 34 q w 5 s u r o w k a z a n s k i f o r m u l a r k w h 2 h 2 where q estimated inflow of water

of depression changes in time a modified theis 1938 formula reduced to a simple form after an appropriate transformation bresciani et al 2020 is most commonly used while the weber and kozeny formulas rogoż 2004 are used less frequently 6 theis formula r c tt s 7 weber formula r 3 10 k h t μ 8 kozeny formula r 12 t μ qk π where c numerical coefficient t transmissivity m2 d t time d s specific yield unconfined aquifer or storage coefficient confined aquifer k hydraulic conductivity m d h static height of the water table m μ specific yield q estimated inflow of water into well m3 d empirical formulas have the advantage of being simple and easy to use however these formulas are applicable only to homogeneous and isotropic conditions which is their disadvantage they are generally used for the assessment of the radius of influence of drainage during the pumping of water from a well which diameter is negligible in relation to the size of the radius of influence the application of these formulae for the assessment of the radius of influence requires their modification by taking into account the equivalent mine radius ro which size may be similar to the calculated value of the radius of influence the modified radius of influence of drainage ro is calculated from the following formula 9 r 0 r 0 r the equivalent mine radius equals soni et al 2014 yihdego 2017 1 1 in the quoted paper the formula for the equivalent mine radius re formula 6 p 4 has been written erroneously r e f π 10 r 0 f π where f mine area among the presented formulae the sichardt and kusakin formulas are the least recommended practical experience has shown that the radius of influence of mine drainage calculated using these formulas is greatly underrated in comparison to the one observed during the drainage of mining excavations the kerkis and surow kazanski formulas assume the relationship between the radius of influence and the amount of precipitation infiltration for this reason these formulas are applicable to the conditions of unconfined aquifers i e in mining practice to open mines or to those underground mines where mining excavations are located below permeable formations in the case of simple geological structures the results of the calculation of the radius of influence using these formulas are close to actual values one of the features of formulae for transient conditions is the continuous increase of the radius of influence in time and therefore the predicted value within an unspecified time discretization will be momentarily equal to the actual value this is insufficient for prediction purposes of the effect of drainage at the designed mine on the water environment with different time discretization one of the advantages of these formulae is the possibility to estimate the radius of influence trend development in the theis formula the value of the radius of influence depends on hydrogeological properties of the drained aquifer and the c coefficient it is a constant value for different variants of the theis formula different values of the c constant have been proposed without any clear justification thus using the heuristic criterion bresciani et al 2020 according to information quoted by these authors the following values of the c constant are proposed 1 5 bear 1979 2 van poolen 1964 vela and mckinley 1970 lee 1982 2 83 hurst 1968 and 4 jones 1962 according to rogoż 2004 the values of the c constant should be in the range of 1 5 3 5 he recommends the implementation of a higher value for the calculation of the predicted radius of a water intake mining drainage influence but does not specify this value the weber formula can be converted into the theis formula and in that case the value of the c constant will be approx 9 5 the use of specific yield in this formula indicates that it is applicable to unconfined aquifers a similar observation applies to the kozeny formula which apart from the specific yield also includes the discharge inflow to mine which differentiates it from the other formulas for transient conditions however at the prognosis stage the predicted constant value of the water inflow to the mine is problematic since this value is very variable in actual conditions 3 1 2 hydrogeological analogy methods this method is based on the assumption that hydrogeological conditions in the vicinity of the mine for which the value of the radius of influence is being predicted are identical as in an active mine and differences in the radius of influence values are a consequence of different values of water inflow to the existing mine from those predicted for the designed mine kerkis 1967 11 r r 1 q q 1 12 r r 0 2 r 1 2 q q 1 where r q projected radius of influence and the projected water inflow to the planned mine r1 q1 radius of influence and groundwater inflow to the existing mine r0 equivalent radius of the planned mine formula 11 can be used to predict the radius of influence of a planned mine that is located close enough to an active mine to assume the similarity of hydrogeological conditions for both mines when deepening an existing mine e g the opening of a new mining level in an open pit formula 12 can be used in this case an equivalent radius ro is included in the formula for the mining development stage at this level if this is a cut which creates access to a new mining level or an initial mining phase at this level the equivalent radius is so small that formula 11 can be applied 3 1 3 numerical modelling method the numerical modelling method has a significant advantage over the empirical formulae as well as the hydrogeological analogies methods spitz and moreno 1996 kresic 2006 anderson et al 2015 zdechlik 2016 despite limitations resulting from an inevitable schematization of the geological structure hydrogeological conditions and especially conditions of recharge and drainage of the analysed groundwater bodies these methods enable one to consider the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the structural layers of the analysed groundwater body including aquifers as well as impermeable beds the most important fact in the context of the radius of influence determination is that this method takes into consideration all elements of the geological structure which influence the formation of areas of lower hydrodynamic pressure around the draining object this generally refers to non continuous displacements faults stratum pinch out zones or facial changes generally the boussinesq s formula cushman roisin and beckers 2011 is used as a base in these methods while the modelling assumptions are dependent on the adopted approach if the radius of influence is determined by the depression s 0 then an absolute criterion is used while when s a e g s 1 m is used to define the radius of influence a subjective criterion is adopted additionally via the identification calibration of the model depending on the degree of identification of the geological structure and hydrogeological conditions a high level of reliability of this model and thus very high precision of the performed calculations can be achieved the radius of influence of mine drainage determined using this method is therefore the most precise the precision of the numerical modelling method essentially depends however on the level of input data reliability and this requirement is often difficult to achieve in practice the identification of the geological structure and hydrogeological conditions in the outermost areas of the depression cone is often insufficient especially in cases when the cone of depression covers a large area additionally in order to determine the depression cone using this method knowledge of the original layout of the hydrodynamic field is necessary the above mentioned problems with obtaining a sufficient base of reliable data have led wolkersdorfer 2008 to state that a complicated numerical model based on a small number of unreliable data can be as unreliable as empirical formulas 3 2 stage of mine operation and actual mine drainage methods of determination of the radius of influence of mine drainage used during the prediction stage of the environmental effects of mining operations can also be used during the stage of mine operation nevertheless empirical formulae and hydrogeological analogy methods can only be used when changes in the water environment around the mine caused by the drainage of its excavations are not being monitored in such cases the results of numerical modelling methods if used for the determination of the radius of influence of drainage at the prediction stage also cannot be verified and the conceptual model cannot be corrected at this stage of mine operation analytical methods can be used but the main method of determination of the radius of influence is to analyse the results of water table changes in the drained rock masses attempts have also been made to determine the radius of influence using satellite technology zawadzki et al 2016 the possibilities of this method which is based on the condition of soil and vegetation on the terrain surface analyses are limited and according to the quoted authors it might only be useful to analyse results of the water environment changes around the drained mine in terms of the radius of influence of mine drainage 3 2 1 analytical methods theoretically for aquifers with the same permeability drawdown size and water supply to the well mine and the same mine geometry equivalent radius r0 the radius of influence for an unconfined aquifer is smaller than in a confined aquifer nevertheless only some mines have a drainage pattern that corresponds to the unconfined aquifer model most of them are compatible with the unconfined confined aquifer model due to the necessity to drain the rock mass to the level of the exploited deposit the method of groundwater dynamics formulas are rarely used in practice louwyck et al 2022 presented formulas that allow to calculate the radius of influence they are the result of solving mathematical equations for various physical models of aquifers all these models apply to homogeneous and isotropic centres which do not correspond to the actual conditions of mining drainage therefore the authors chose the simplest of them as an illustration of these methods i e the transformation of the dupuit s equation due to radius of influence from the dupuit s equation if the amount of the water inflow q into the mine is known it is possible to calculate the radius of influence r understood as the equivalent radius formula 9 following an appropriate transformation of the dupuit formula for water inflow into a complete well in unconfined and confined aquifers unconfined aquifer 13 q π k h 2 h 2 ln r r therefore 14 lnr π k h 2 h 2 q l n r confined aquifer 15 q 2 π k m s ln r r therefore 16 lnr 2 π k m s q l n r where h initial saturated thickness of an unconfined aquifer h thickness of partially drained aquifer m thickness of aquifer k hydraulic conductivity s drawdown in well m r radius of influence r radius of well when formulas 14 and 16 used in mining practice r is substituted by r0 and r by r0 according to the formula 9 the results of the radius of influence calculations with use of this method are slightly more reliable than the results obtained using empirical formulae but are affected by the same errors they are generally applicable to steady state conditions which in the case of mines and are only possible after several or 10 20 years after the beginning of the excavations drainage even in conditions which can be assumed as a quasi steady state the amount of inflow of water into a mine changes depending on the conditions of recharge which in turn depends on the amount of precipitation this raises the question whether minimum averages or maybe average inflow values for a given time period should be used in formulas 14 and 16 the other components of these formulas such as the height of the initial water table and the height of the water table drawdown as a result of drainage as well as filtration coefficients should also be averaged which would lead to the analysis of the drained rock masses as a homogeneous and isotropic formation consequently the result of these calculations is a line indicating the drainage radius of influence in the shape of a circle thus the radius of influence calculated in this way is the same in all directions and because of the operation of averaging of the components of formulas 13 15 it may differ significantly from the actual radius of influence of drainage 3 2 2 monitoring of the water environment monitoring of the water environment which includes surface and groundwater is the main method of the determination of the radius of influence and its changes in time and in different directions the results of monitoring provide a basis for the determination of the radius of influence that most closely resembles its actual geometry however the correct identification of the geological structure is of major importance here as is the quality of monitoring i e the area of terrain covered by monitoring the density of monitoring points and the frequency of observations in practice for economic reasons only the area of the planned mining of deposits and its surroundings are more precisely analysed at the cost of the outermost areas covered by the radius of influence of mine drainage therefore only more or less precise identification of its actual geometry is possible the monitoring of changes in the groundwater level is of key importance to the determination of the cone of depression geometry a clear opinion on this issue has been given by cassan 1994 who believes that the radius of influence can only be determined experimentally i e through the monitoring of changes in the level of the groundwater table near the drainage point because observation points piezometers can be installed in any given number in selected locations at different distances from the drainage point and in all aquifers that may be affected by the drainage nevertheless a necessary condition for the precise determination of the radius of influence on the basis of monitoring results is the knowledge of the initial natural condition of the groundwater level and its seasonal fluctuations during a period before the beginning of drainage in the analysed aquifer according to bieniewski 1978 the precise determination of the radius of influence requires observations of natural changes of the groundwater table level to be frequent and long lasting in order to differentiate seasonal fluctuations caused by natural factors from those caused by artificial drainage the area covered by the cone of depression can be divided into three vaguely delimited zones evident probable and uncertain fig 1 they are defined subjectively on the basis of intuition and past experience i e using the heuristic criterion and with the consideration of the amplitude of fluctuation of the groundwater level the width of vague transitions between the individual zones depends on the quality of monitoring tests this mainly applies to the density of the monitoring network and the coverage of the whole area of the depression cone and its surrounding area by this network as well as to the frequency of measurements in practice for economic reasons the piezometer network is more densely provided in the close vicinity to the mine and is very sparse in locations distant from the mine whereas only individual piezometers if any are installed on the periphery of the depression cone the frequency of measurement of the groundwater level in piezometers depends on the implemented methodology the application of appropriate recorders enables continuous measurement of the water level in a piezometer while the use of traditional measuring methods which require personal presence on the site greatly reduces their frequency the knowledge of long term patterns of groundwater level fluctuations depending on the amount of precipitation in the period before the beginning of the mine drainage facilitates the division of the area of the cone of depression into the proposed zones fig 1 the absence of such data basically enables the determination of only the first zone boundaries where the influence of mine drainage is evident in this situation the remaining area of the cone of depression outside of this zone should be classified as a zone in which the influence of drainage is uncertain a zone in which this influence is probable is therefore absent in identical weather conditions expressed as the amount of precipitation the amplitude of fluctuation of water level depends mainly on the water capacity of an aquifer which is measured by coefficients of open porosity and specific yield recession under the same amount of precipitation the lowest amplitude of fluctuation was recorded for porous aquifers while the highest amplitude was recorded for fissure and karst fissure aquifers this was demonstrated by the changes of the groundwater level in different types of aquifers in the olkusz zn pb district sw poland following catastrophic rainfall which affected southern poland in july 1997 according to adamczyk and motyka 2000 in quaternary sands porous aquifer the water level rose by about 1 5 m in jurassic limestones karst fissures aquifer by about 10 m in triassic carbonates porous karst fissures aquifer by between 2 6 and 23 m and in palaeozoic carbonates karst fissures aquifer by about 40 m for years with an average precipitation the amplitudes of the water level fluctuations were much lower but in fissure and karst fissure aquifers they were still of the order of several metres this complicates very significantly the determination of the size of depression at any given time in an area affected by mine drainage and greatly affects the precision of the determined radius of influence 3 2 3 practical examples the value of the drawdown of groundwater level measured at various distances from the drained mine represents a basis for analysis of the depression curve for the purpose of determination of the radius of influence using simple methods the least complicated analytical method is calculation of the radius of influence on the basis of measurement of depression values s1 and s2 in two different points located at the distances of r1 and r2 from the mine following appropriate transformation of the dupuit s formulas we achieve a formula for an unconfined aquifer kerkis 1967 18 lgr s 1 2 h s 1 l g r 2 s 2 2 h s 2 l g r 1 s 1 s 2 2 h s 1 s 2 and for a confined aquifer kerkis 1967 polak et al 2015 2 2 the authors have erroneously written formula 19 in the following way lgr s 1 l g x 2 s 2 l g x 1 s s s 1 19 lgr s 1 l g r 2 s 2 l g r 1 s 1 s 2 the analytical method is based on the assumption that the depression curve is a logarithmic function that is compatible with the dupuit s equation applicable to a homogeneous and isotropic formation in this case the calculation of the radius of influence only requires two random points located at different distances from the mine in which the value of depression has been measured in practice an actual rock formation is far from ideal as a result of the presence of heterogeneities inside the drained aquifer as well as geological discontinuities this can be observed for example in porphyry laccolith from zalas near cracow in which the development of the cone of depression was strictly related to the heterogeneity of the internal hydraulic structure in three piezometers which were used to measure the water table level along a line running in the ns direction fig 6 and were located at distances of 50 5 m 89 6 m and 670 m from the pumping well the values of depression of about 0 56 m 0 48 m and 2 6 m respectively were recorded the value of the radius of influence calculated using formula 19 on the basis of data from the first two piezometers was 2800 m on the basis of the first and third piezometer 25 m and on the basis of the second and third piezometer 57 m cases such as the one of the laccolith from zalas although spectacular are very rare in a mining practice a different example of the use of formula 18 for the calculation of the radius of influence is the olkusz zinc ore and lead ore mine located about 35 km to the nw of cracow the excavations of this mine have caused the drainage of carbonate triassic rocks three piezometers on the basis of conditions recorded in february of 1971 were selected for the calculation of the radius of influence of the cone of depression bo 2 b and bż 4 situated to the south of the mine fig 2 the distances of the piezometers from the reference point representing the mine were as follows the first 375 m the second 3300 m and the third 4030 m while depression in these points was measured at 96 m 18 5 m and 5 5 m respectively the values of the radius of influence r measured on the basis of the data pairs from these piezometers were as follows piezometers bo 2 and b radius r 5540 m bo 2 and bż 4 radius r 1980 m and b and bż 4 radius r 4380 m in this case the radius of influence of the cone measured on the basis of the second pair of piezometers was significantly smaller than the one calculated on the basis of the two other pairs the presented examples of application of the analytical method consisting of the calculation of the radius of influence using formulas 17 or 18 on the basis of two monitoring points in which the value of depression was determined for the same time discretization have demonstrated that this method is highly unreliable it can possibly be used in the case of homogeneous aquifers and simple geological structures in this case the cone of depression develops around the mine and can be projected for any cross section with sufficient precision by a curve generated from the dupuit s equation such an object may have for example a form of sand or gravel excavation with a relatively small radius of influence of drainage the radius of influence is determined on the basis of monitoring results using the graphical method which uses the logarithmic relation between the value of depression and the distance from a given drainage point sr f lg r in an s vs lg r axis system a straight line can be drawn through a set of points which the point of intersection with the r axis s 0 defines the radius of influence of drainage r fig 3 the advantage of this method is its simplicity and given a sufficient number of observation points located at different distances from the mine the possibility of the determination of the radius of influence in different directions fig 3 the graphical method also has its shortcomings resulting mainly from the presence of various geological factors such as for example the heterogeneity of an aquifer faults stratum pinch out zones recharge from the river or hydraulic contacts between different aquifers within the radius of influence of drainage additionally a mine that is in a development stage increases its dimensions therefore the distance to the various observation points decreases with time usually in order to determine the distance of a given piezometer from the mine a reference point that represents the middle of the mine is selected on the basis of a criterion such as the rate of water inflow to its various regions the substitution of the mine area with a reference point can be a source of error in the distance determination of a piezometer from the mine which becomes bigger when the piezometer is closer to the mining excavations with water inflows interpretation of the set of points in the s f lg r coordinate system in terms of the determination of the radius of influence can be performed using regression analysis which provides a degree of impartiality to such an interpretation in the event of a large spread of a set of points a subset of points can be subjectively selected which will visually be most favourably arranged along a straight line this then represents the use of the graphical method in its pure form but it has the disadvantage of being subjective i e the radius of influence of drainage can achieve different values which due to the logarithmic scale can differ significantly from one other depending on the selection of the sub set of points for interpretation and the route of the straight line through the selected sub set of points alternatively a statistical regression analysis method can be used for this purpose as was done for the point sets shown in fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 the determination of the radius of influence on the basis of the depression measurement across the entire set of piezometers provides as a result a single average value of the radius of influence which assumes the analysed aquifer to be a homogeneous and isotropic formation with a sufficient number of piezometers the graphical method or the regression analysis can be used to define the radius of influence of drainage for different sectors fig 3 which could reveal the irregular shape of the cone of depression an example of the above can be found in the interpretation of the monitoring results in the area of the zn pb olkusz mine based on data from 1971 the following values of the radius of influence have been achieved for individual sectors sector nr 9800 m er 11000 m sr 5500 m all piezometers r 4800 m almost double values of the radius of influence in relation to sector s were recorded for sectors n and e the lowest value of the radius of influence was recorded for the entire set of piezometers i e with the assumption that the triassic aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic the most developed form of the graphical method of the radius of influence determination is an interpretation of the depression contour map it is created on the basis of the comparison of contour maps for the natural conditions and for the drawdown within a specified time discretization this map can then constitute a basis for determination of the radius of influence in any direction an example of this is a depression contour map of the area surrounding the bolesław and olkusz zn pb ore mines near olkusz sw poland based on data from 1967 fig 4 due to the overlapping influence of the drainage of both mines examples of the radius of influence of the drainage of the olkusz mine were determined in the n e se and sw directions fig 5 the following results for the individual directions were recorded nr 1900 m er 6650 m ser 6700 m swr 4200 m the comparison of the values of radius of influence recorded for the sectors and their analysis as the result of the interpretation of the depression contour map has revealed certain shortcomings of the graphical method an average of the values of the radius of influence in the se and sw directions for the depression contour map gives the value of 5450 m for the s direction which is almost the same as for the set of piezometers in the s sector 5500 m simultaneously much higher values were recorded for the sets of piezometers in the n and e sectors in comparison to these directions selected from the depression contour map which was developed on the basis of data recorded for a period preceding the data set used for the sectors method by approximately 4 years during this time the radius of influence may have increased significantly this statement is justified in the e direction because in 1970 farming wells in settlements located at a distance of 10 km in the s and se directions experienced a water shortage that was related to the drainage of the olkusz mine excavations such large differences in the radius of influence recorded using these two methods cannot be explained in this way in the n direction there is a fault with a high discharge range at a distance of about 2 km from the olkusz mine which reduces the possibility of propagation of the depression cone in the northern direction resulting in the observed differences the graphical method based on sets of depression values in individual sectors does not allow for the consideration of various geological discontinuities such as fault zones a depression contour map can also include such discontinuities in a wider scope therefore the obtained values of the radius of influence are much more reliable 4 radius of influence of mine drainage geological factors the shape of the cone of depression around a mine and therefore the radius of influence of mine drainage is greatly affected by geological factors in the case of small mining facilities and small area drainage heterogeneities of the hydraulic network in a drained aquifer are a decisive factor when the radius of influence of drainage is in a range of several or over a dozen kilometres the shape of the cone of depression is determined by elements of the geological structure such as tectonics or hydraulic contacts of the drained aquifer with other aquifers on the basis of many years of professional experience mainly in the olkusz zn pb district the authors have given examples of the influence of selected geological factors on the shape of radius of influence of mine drainage in some cases the boundaries of the funnel may be rivers konikow and leake 2014 but in the olkusz ore mining region the groundwater level in the area of the depression cone is below the bottom of the watercourses so they do not have a significant influence on its shape 4 1 internal heterogeneities of aquifer the drainage of a homogeneous isotropic aquifer causes the creation of a cone of depression around the well in the shape of a circle of a specific radius if an aquifer is heterogeneous and anisotropic the radius of influence may have different dimensions in different directions the shape of the cone of depression in this case is determined by the hydraulic properties of the aquifer osiensky et al 2000 hiscock and bense 2014 one example of the effect of internal heterogeneities of the hydraulic network on the development of the cone of depression is demonstrated by the results of a pumping test in a lithologically homogeneous porphyry intrusion in zalas near cracow s poland the porphyry intrusion has the form of a laccolith that has pushed in between the layers of lower and upper carboniferous strata dżułyński 1955 the lower carboniferous stratum there is represented by shales with insets of sandstones limestones and breccias the upper carboniferous stratum is represented by a complex of shales and sandstones with insets of conglomerates and stony coals in the upper permian and lower triassic strata the roof of the porphyry laccolith has been eroded a large section of it is covered by random middle and upper jurassic formations fig 6 the middle jurassic formations are represented in the lower part by sands and sandstones and in the upper part by sandy limestones the upper jurassic stratum has a lithologically dual structure in the lower part it consists of marls and in the upper part of limestone slabs and rocks palaeozoic and mesozoic formations are covered by quaternary sediments moraine clays fluvioglacial sands loess and locally by saprolite clays faults of the main orientations of ene wsw and auxiliary orientations of nnw sse are present in the area of the intrusion fig 6 the discharge ranges of the faults reach 50 m porphyry is excavated in the quarry for use as a construction material hydrogeological properties of porphyry laccolith were determined on the basis of the pumping test results consisting of a system pumping well and five observation wells fig 6 pumping at the rate of 200 m3 day was performed for 32 days the results of the pumping and their interpretation were presented by bogacz et al 1984 the depression in the pumping well after several hours reached 58 m and remained at this level until the end of pumping while in the observation wells p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 23 the depression ranged between 0 7 and 0 9 m depression in piezometer p 20 on the 11th day of pumping was recorded at 2 6 m and then the water level dropped below the bottom of the piezometer at the same time the value of depression in the other four piezometers was recorded between 0 48 m and 0 67 m table 1 around the 20th day of pumping there were reports of a significant fall of the water level in farming wells collecting water from the porphyry laccolith which rendered them unusable the determination of the value of the radius of influence based on results of the presented pumping test using current methods is practically impossible one example is the graphical method which is based on the relation between the depression and the logarithm of the distance from the pumping well fig 7 the radius of influence could be determined in the ns direction on the basis of depression in piezometers p 2 and p 3 after 11 days of pumping it would equal about 340 m and at the end of pumping on the 32nd day about 560 m the value of depression in piezometer p 20 which on the 11th day of the pumping test stood at 2 6 m undermines these results the value of depression in the ne sw direction on the other hand irrespective of distance is very close both on the 11th day of pumping and at its completion on the 32nd day the graphical method cannot be implemented in this case because the radius of influence would probably reach the boundaries of the porphyry laccolith the course of the drawdown of the water table in the porphyry laccolith during the analysed pumping test presents interpretation difficulties because of mainly two reasons 1 significantly greater depression recorded in piezometer p 20 located at 670 m from the pumping well in comparison to other piezometers located in its vicinity 2 uniform drawdown of the water table in piezometers p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 23 fig 7 the problem of different values of depression in piezometer p 20 than in other piezometers has been explained by bogacz et al 1984 as resulting from the dual layer structure of the laccolith related to variable density of fractures consequently these layers have very different hydrogeological properties especially in terms of transmissivity and specific yield fig 8 tab 1 the upper zone which forms a kind of crust on the main laccolith is covered by a dense network of thermal fractures peripheral joints and also partly weathered fractures the second internal zone which includes only conical and radial joints is characterised by a more sparse network of fractures the aperture of which probably decreases with the depth of the fractures a pumping well of the depth of 70 m collected water from both zones while piezometers p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 23 of the depth of approx 15 m filtrated the upper zone and the observation well of the depth of approx 20 m in the lower zone fig 8 which is indicated by significantly lower transmissivity and specific yield than in the other piezometers tab 1 the pumping of water caused faster dewatering of fractures in the lower zone than in the upper resulting in the different rates of the groundwater table drawdown in both zones the porphyry laccolith in zalas is a relatively small geological formation in the conditions of the limited water capacity of the thermal fracture network table 1 and poor recharge from the jurassic and carboniferous aquifers the system of fractures in the laccolith was rapidly drained during the pumping process this resulted in a uniform drawdown of the water table across the entire laccolith 4 2 aquifer with a heterogeneous lithological structure examples of drainage in an aquifer made up of several layers of a similar lithological type are frequently seen in mining practice theoretically changes in the water table level in each layer should be monitored and the radius of influence should be determined for each of them for various reasons mainly economic this kind of monitoring is unfeasible it is assumed therefore that the drained rock formation is a single theoretically homogeneous aquifer this assumption may generate problems in the determination of the boundaries of the cone of depression as illustrated on the example of a triassic aquifer in the olkusz area which is drained by the excavations of zinc and lead ore mines the triassic aquifer is built up of lower and middle triassic dolomites and limestones which in the years 1946 2022 was drained from the workings of the underground zn pb ore mine carbonate triassic rocks create an aquifer of the porous karst fissure type in dolomites and karst fissure type in limestones motyka 1998 zuber and motyka 1998 fractures and caverns have a small specific volume of the order of 0 005 but high conductivity of the order of n 10 4 m s in the case of fractures and n 10 1 m s in the case of caverns motyka and szuwarzyński 1994 motyka 1998 these components of the hydraulic network in carbonate rocks are therefore a conductive element pore space has a much higher specific volume of the order of 0 02 in limestone and 0 1 in dolomites with low conductivity of the order of 10 10 m s in limestones and n 10 8 m s in dolomites it is also important that the mean value of specific yield of the pore space in limestones is 0 0006 and in dolomites is in the order of 0 03 table 2 and represents a conductive element in those rocks the mean geometrical values of filtration coefficients for diplopora and ore bearing dolomites determined on the basis of the pumping tests results are of the order of n 10 4 m s and are higher by one order of magnitude than those for the olkusz and gogolin limestones and by two orders of magnitude than those for rhoethian dolomites table 2 the mean geometrical value of the filtration coefficient for the entire triassic carbonate rock mass equals 6 5 10 5 m s motyka and wilk 1976 the values of the storage coefficient determined on the basis of pumping tests in observation wells and interpretation of the water table level changes in the triassic aquifer resulting from mine drainage wilk and motyka 1980 are approximately 0 03 in terms of hydrogeological properties the triassic aquifer locally has a triple structure its upper part consists of diplopora and ore bearing dolomites the middle part consists of olkusz and gogolin limestones and the lower of rhoethian dolomites however due to the heterogeneity and anisotropy of carbonate rocks in the scale of a single cross section measuring point the relationship between the hydrogeological properties of these three layers may differ this is reflected by the changes in the water table level resulting from mine drainage in separate layers of the triassic aquifer some of the piezometers were established to register water table levels simultaneously in different layers of this aquifer in the same measuring point these layers were usually ore bearing dolomites and rhoethian dolomites three types of reactions of the water table in those piezometers can be identified fig 9 in natural conditions and in conditions affected by mine drainage there is practically the same water level in both layers a in natural conditions and in conditions affected by mine drainage there is a constant difference in the water level in both layers b the water table drops as a result of mine drainage at different rates and with time the difference in the water levels in both layers increases c the reliability of the calculation of the radius of influence significantly depends on data from piezometers in group b and c wherein in the case of piezometers in group c the calculation error increases in subsequent time discretizations discrepancies in the radius of influence of drainage determination on the basis of water level changes monitoring results in a multi layered aquifer have been shown on the basis of piezometers bo 20 and b fig 2 water level has been measured independently in those observation wells in ore bearing dolomites od and in rhoethian dolomites rt both of these piezometers belong to group c wherein the water level in ore bearing dolomites in piezometer bo 20 dropped more slowly than in rhoethian dolomites while a reverse effect was observed in piezometer b table 3 the values of the radius of influence were calculated using formula 18 the combination of four possible results of calculations is as follows od1 od2 14900 m od1 rt2 5100 m od2 rt1 4600 m rt1 rt2 3500 m the obtained results have demonstrated that in the case of an aquifer consisting of rock layers with a similar lithological structure limestones and dolomites the values of the radius of influence of drainage calculated on the basis of data from two piezometers differs greatly depending on the selected data pair the radius of influence of drainage is in the range between 3 5 and 14 9 km 4 3 faults faults have a major impact on the conditions of groundwater flow depending on the discharge range in relation to the thickness of the aquifer on the fault line a reduction of the effective hydraulic cross section occurs fig 10 which consequently hampers the flow of water in this layer in a direction perpendicular to the dislocation a fault can radically reduce or even terminate the flow of water in a direction perpendicular to its orientation if its discharge range is close to or higher than the thickness of the aquifer such dislocations divide the aquifer into separate hydrostructures with different hydraulic properties in natural conditions the hydrogeological functions of a fault are usually unrevealed because the shape of the piezometric surface of the groundwater table depends mainly on the layout of local areas of an aquifer recharge and drainage long term development of hydrodynamic equilibrium in geological terms causes the equalisation of hydrodynamic pressure on both sides of the fault irrespectively of its discharge range only the distortion of this natural hydrodynamic field as a result of intensive pumping of water from the aquifer e g due to mine drainage reveals the role of the dislocation as a hydrogeological barrier an easy way to initially evaluate the hydrological role of a fault is to project the adjacent edges of the fault onto a vertical plane and to create on this basis a graph of the degree of reduction of the aquifer on the fault plane depending on the level of geological examination this graph can be created using a series of geological sections through the fault fig 10 or using a geological map with indicated discharge ranges of the faults an analysis of the charts of the degree of reduction of the aquifer along fault planes carried out at the olkusz zinc and lead ore mining department revealed that the groundwater flow in conditions affected by mine drainage is significantly obstructed by hydrogeological barriers in the form of dislocations along which the relation of the length of hydraulic contact mk to the thickness of the aquifer m is lower than approx 0 5 motyka 1988 examples of charts of the reduction degree of an aquifer on fault planes for faults of various discharge rates have been shown in fig 11 fault with a small discharge rate ii fault with a large discharge rate a chart of the reduction of effective cross section in a fault zone b contours map c groundwater table along the cross section line faults with discharge rates higher than the half of the thickness of triassic rock aquifers in the conditions of intensive drainage from the workings of the zn pb ore mines in the olkusz area represent the locations of discontinuity of the depression curve such dislocations may cause the disruption of the groundwater table continuity and reduce possibilities of propagation of the depression cone in a perpendicular direction to their orientation as a result faults of high drop significantly affect the shape of the cone of depression fig 4 5 conclusions the available classic definitions of the radius of influence are not very useful in practice especially in the case of mine drainage in actual field conditions the cone of depression does not have any sharp edges and often extends to areas that are insufficiently examined in geological and hydrogeological terms therefore requires a different approach which can be based on the empirical formulas method the hydrogeological analogy method the numerical modelling method methods based on the groundwater monitoring results unfortunately the determination of the radius of influence can be further complicated or even prevented by heterogeneities of various sizes in the drained aquifer as presented at the example of porphyry laccolith in zalas sw poland moreover depending on the implemented definition of the radius of influence cone of depression and the implemented method of its determination the results of calculations may significantly differ from each other despite the same initial conditions therefore given the availability of an extensive and reliable database of monitoring results the most recommended method of the determination of the radius of influence of drainage is the numerical modelling method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

2954,flood severity in cities along the yangtze river is vulnerable to multiple influencing factors such as intense rainfall higher river water level and pump operation this study evaluates the joint impact of rainfall and river water level on urban flooding in wuhan city firstly the variation characteristics of rainfall in wuhan and water level at hankou of the middle yangtze river were analyzed by the mann kendall test high water levels and heavy rainfall mostly occurred in june to july and the rainstorm and lowest water levels presented increasing trends during this period meanwhile a strong positive dependence was found between rainfall and water level implying that the probability of flooding cannot be correctly estimated by only considering the influence of a single factor secondly a joint risk probability was estimated using the optimal copula the joint risk probability was always larger than the exceedance probability of water level or rainfall which highlighted that ignoring the interaction between different flood drivers can lead to the underestimation of flood hazards a comparison of the joint risk probabilities during different periods of 2005 2020 and 1990 2004 shows that extreme events of heavy rainstorm and higher water level have occurred frequently in recent years with the joint risk of urban flood increasing significantly finally flood inundation processes under different combinations of rainfall and water level were simulated using the calibrated model of swmm with and without working pumps being considered the flood volume and flood duration would increase by about 1 7 3 7 and 0 8 1 3 respectively with the water level increasing from 21 7 m to 28 0 m and would reduce by approximately 71 3 71 9 and 58 2 58 5 with the rainfall return period decreasing from 100 yr to 5 yr therefore urban inundation was mainly caused by heavy rainfall moreover the efficient effect of pumping on the urban drainage decreased gradually with the increasing rainfall therefore the results can be used to provide the support for the design of water resource projects and the disaster mitigation measures of urban flooding keywords rainfall river water level pump operation joint impact copula urban flooding data availability l have shared the link to my data at the manuscript 1 introduction flood is the most frequent natural disaster in the world leading to serious casualties and economic losses which accounted for 49 of the total disaster events and 44 of the deaths in 2019 cred 2020 wang et al 2021 in the cities such as wuhan and nanjing along the yangtze river yr the ground elevation of most cities is below the flood stage a key strategy of urban flood control is to construct strong levees along the river banks to prevent cities from flooding moreover a large amount of rainfall that falls in an urban area is normally collected by the urban drainage system and then drains to the yr through pumps and sluice gates when the river water level is higher than the outlet level of the urban drainage system during a flood season the drainage gates need to be closed hsu et al 2013 there is no doubt that pump stations play an important role in urban flood drainage systems and the discharge capacity of pumps in operation is directly related to the backwater effect and upstream overflowing if the pumps are unable to properly perform the drainage function severe urban flood disasters would occur yazdi et al 2016 yang et al 2019 consequently for the cities along the yr in china urban flood severity is ruled by the interaction of multiple influencing factors such as intense rainfall high water level and modes of pump operation lian et al 2013 since floods are influenced by a combination of multiple variables it is imperative to evaluate the joint risk of extreme events by an effective multivariate probabilistic approach and to simulate the combined effect of multiple variables by using an urban storm water model copula has been widely used to quantify the dependence structure of two random variables and the marginal distributions allow for different types of probability distribution functions sadegh et al 2018 in recent years copula has emerged as an effective tool to describe and analyze the dependence structure of multiple variables associated with floods reddy and ganguli 2012 lian et al 2013 sraj et al 2015 papaioannou et al 2016 moftakhari et al 2017 liu et al 2019 luo et al 2021 for instance xie et al 2012 analyzed the joint probability distribution of rainstorm and water level in a river network area using the gumbel hougard copula zellou and rahali 2019 studied the joint risk probabilities of extreme rainfall and extreme tide level in the bouregreg estuary of morocco using five copulas jane et al 2020 investigated the joint probability of rainfall ocean side water level and groundwater level in miami dade county of south florida using two elliptical copulas and three archimedean copulas all these studies confirmed that the fact that the method of univariate probability analysis cannot provide accurately the assessment of flood risks if flood events are derived by interrelated random variables an issue to mention here within the previous studies is that most researchers focus more on the joint risk probability of rainfall and tide level in coastal areas and the joint risk probability of urban rainfall and water level in a large river has been rarely addressed in the literature meanwhile flood characteristics have changed over recent years under the impacts of global climate change and human activities however the joint risks of rainfall and river water level during different periods using effective multivariate probabilistic approaches are still poorly clarified once the joint risk probability of multiple flood drivers is evaluated based on the copula function the hydrologic or hydrodynamic models are often used to simulate the compound flood risk of these variables lian et al 2013 analyzed the joint probability of rainfall and tidal level using five copulas and developed a hydrodynamic model for the complex river network to simulate the combined effects of rainfalls and tidal levels on flood severity luo et al 2016 developed a concentration model at a drainage area scale using scs coupled with mike11 to analyze the influence of storms and flood levels of the outer river on urban drainage tanim and goharian 2021 employed a compound flood model using hydrologic model coupled with the hydrodynamic model to simulate urban flooding under the interaction between rainfall runoff and storm surge and adjusted the integrated modeling outputs based on the multivariate gaussian copula ming et al 2022 applied copula functions to estimate the joint probability of heavy rainfall extreme river flow and storm surge which are then simulated using a 2d high performance hydrodynamic model to produce probabilistic inundation maps therefore it is necessary to establish a model to simulate the combined effect of rainfall and river water level on urban flooding here urban rainwater can be drained to the river through pumping and higher water levels can induce an extra flood risk by reducing the capacity of urban drainage the impact of water level on urban inundation can be illustrated by calculating the pumping capacity corresponding to a specified water level zellou and rahali 2019 it is necessary to consider the dynamic influence of river water level on pumping capacity in order to assess the effect of water level on urban waterlogging drainage regarding the use of pump stations previous studies have focused more on the optimal operation of pump stations hsu et al 2013 yazdi et al 2016 yang et al 2019 however the influence of river water level on pump operation is not explicitly considered in previous studies and there also exists a lack of knowledge about the joint impact of water level and rainfall on urban flooding the main purposes of this study are i to investigate the variation characteristics of rainfall in wuhan and river water level at the hydrometric station of hankou in the middle yangtze river myr in order to reveal the strength of dependence and evolution trend ii to identify an appropriate copula model using the goodness of fit criterion further to assess the joint risk probability of rainfall and river water level during different periods by the optimal copula iii to simulate the urban inundation under different combinations of rainfall and river water level using the calibrated model of swmm with two kinds of pump operation conditions namely with and without working pumps in order to estimate the joint impact of rainfall river water level and pumping mode on urban waterlogging in particular the discharge capacity of pumps corresponding to a specified water level was calculated according to the pump characteristic curve additionally the hierarchical partition based on the spatial information method was proposed for the subcatchment generation in swmm and the simulated results using the proposed method and the tyson polygon method were compared to evaluate the performance of the proposed method the study would provide scientific basis and guidance for decision making of flood risk management 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area wuhan situated on the jianghan plain is the capital city in hubei province of central china which is a river crossed land created by the hanjiang river joining the yangtze river this city is located in 113 41 115 05 e and 29 58 31 22 n with an area of 8569 km2 and its administrative divisions include 13 districts such as the districts of jianghan wuchang and qingshan wuhan is known as the city with one hundred lakes and the surface area of 166 lakes is approximately 867 km2 duan and niu 2018 wuhan has a humid subtropical climate with the average annual temperature of 15 8 17 5 c and the average annual precipitation of 1150 1450 mm rainfall is mainly concentrated in flood seasons qingshan district with a drainage area of 13 km2 was selected for modeling urban waterlogging in this study fig 1 which adjoins the yangtze river to the north luojia port to the west east lake port and wufeng lake to the east and youyi avenue to the south 2 2 datasets in this study these measured data were collected covering daily rainfall in wuhan city and daily water level at the hydrometric station of hankou in the myr during the flood seasons from 1990 to 2020 the water level data were obtained from the bureau of hydrology changjiang water resources commission and the rainfall data were acquired from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn monthly rainfall in wuhan and the average water level at hankou of the myr during the flood seasons may to october from 1990 to 2020 are shown in fig 2 the flood frequency analysis is usually performed using the annual maxima am method when the length of record data is short the most common alternative to am is the peaks over threshold pot durocher et al 2018 moreover the use of am series may ignore the second or the third peak flood within a year and this problem is obviated in the pot sarhadi and modarres 2011 in this study based on pot method the 24 hour rainstorm standard 50 0 mm was considered as the threshold level to select the rainfall data and then select the water level data which corresponding to these rainfall data in order to analyse the bivariate flood frequency of rainfall and water level there are three pump stations in the study area namely gangxi i gangxi ii and luojialu ii fig 1 the luojialu ii pump station is equipped with seven pumps with a total design discharge capacity of 55 0 m3 s and only a few study streets are located in the drainage area of the luojialu ii pump station the gangxi i pump station is equipped with four pumps with a total design discharge capacity of 23 86 m3 s and a small front pool which are usually used as a supplementation for the gangxi ii pump station the gangxi ii pump station is equipped with six pumps with a total design discharge capacity of 53 82 m3 s hence this station was mainly analyzed in this study due to limited data availability the discharge characteristic curve of a pump was obtained by fitting the data which defines the pump capacity curve corresponding to different water levels the water level in the myr and the corresponding discharge capacity of the luojialu ii pump station at the maximum design and minimum head were obtained from the design report of the luojialu pump station and the design characteristic curve of the station was fitted using these three datapoints fig 3 a the vertical single stage oblique flow pumps are used in the luojialu ii pump station and the gangxi ii pump station and meanwhile the two pump stations are very close to each other fig 1 therefore the characteristic curve of the gangxi pump station could be obtained by using the similarity ratio according to the design characteristic curve of the luojialu ii pump station combining with the design capacity of the gangxi and luojialu pump stations the characteristic curve of the gangxi ii pump station is shown in fig 3b 3 methodology the mann kendall test kendall 1938 mann 1945 was introduced to analyze the variation characteristics of rainfall and river water level spearman s rho spearman 2010 and kendall s tau helsel and hirsch 2002 were presented to analyze the dependence between rainfall and river water level the methodology based on the bivariate copula model was introduced to estimate the joint risk probability of rainfall and river water level 3 1 mann kendall test the mann kendall trend test is usually used to estimate the significance of monotonic trends with non normally distributed data and it is resistant to the effect of outliers in the mann kendall trend test the statistic parameter z 0 is obtained if the time series exhibits an increasing trend whereases the statistic parameter z 0 shows a decreasing trend in the bilateral trend test the time series shows a significant trend at the confidence level of α if the statistic parameter z z α 2 wang et al 2021 in the mann kendall abrupt change test the statistic parameter ufk 0 means that a time series of variable exhibits an increasing trend and ufk 0 shows that the time series presents a decreasing trend the abrupt change time is the corresponding time of ufk and ubk curves intersecting between the boundary lines wang et al 2019 3 2 joint risk probability multivariate copula analysis toolbox mvcat was used in this study which includes 26 different copula families the equations of 26 different copula families are available in table 1 of sadegh et al 2017 the copula parameters and the underlying uncertainties are inferred using the markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation within a bayesian framework the parameters of the marginal distributions are estimated through a maximum likelihood algorithm sadegh et al 2017 based on the akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliff efficiency nse the performances of different copulas were compared to find the best fit copula function schwarz 1978 akaike 1998 aho et al 2014 the detailed calculation methods of

k is the number of parameters of the statistical model n is the number of samples pei is the empirical frequency pi is the theoretical frequency p ei is the average value of empirical frequency the aic and bic avoid the problem of over conditioning by considering the dependence of parameters a better model fit is associated with the lower aic bic and rmse values and the higher nse value in which rmse 0 and nse 1 specially a perfect model fit was obtained when rmse 0 and nse 1 sadegh et al 2017 luo et al 2021 the risk probability of flood events is usually associated with a certain exceedance probability lian et al 2013 zellou and rahali 2019 for the bivariate case the risk probability can be characterized in three ways i joint risk probability ii encounter risk probability and iii conditional risk probability accordingly the bivariate risk probability for a copula based flood event can be expressed by reddy and ganguli 2012 joint risk probability 5 p r h p r r p h h 1 f c r h encounter risk probability 6 p r h p r r p h h 1 f r r f h h f c r h conditional risk probability when the river water level h h the risk probability of rainfall r r is calculated by 7 p r r h h 1 f r

r and h are the prespecified threshold values of rainfall and river water level respectively fc r h is the joint probability of rainfall and river water level f r r and f h h are the marginal distributions of rainfall and river water level respectively lian et al 2013 3 3 joint impact modeling 3 3 1 model improvement 1 subcatchment division the storm water management model swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model designed by the usepa united states environmental protection agency which is widely used for planning analysis and design for stormwater management rossman 2015 guan et al 2015 chen et al 2018 tanim and goharian 2021 subcatchments are hydrologic units in swmm and 20 parameters are associated with six different physical processes for each subcatchment such as area width slope imperviousness and depression storage depth behrouz et al 2020 consequently the partitioning level of subcatchment is vital for flood simulations of urban rainstorm there are three popular methods of subcatchment division namely the tyson polygon method bhattacharjya and chaurasia 2013 the natural artificial boundary method jain et al 2016 and the land use method warsta et al 2017 each of the three methods has its advantages and disadvantages wu et al 2020 the natural artificial boundary method can consider the physical laws of runoff but ignore the land use types and topographic changes the land use method requires detailed underlying surface information and cannot take into account the spatial distribution of pipe networks tyson polygon method cannot consider the distributions of land use and pipes but the operation is relatively simple which is suitable for data scarce or relatively large study areas ultra high precision dem data cannot be obtained in practice for a more accurate delineation of subcatchments this study proposes the hierarchical partition based on the spatial information hpbsi method to subdivide subcatchments which can consider the effects of land use pipe distribution and urban roads on the confluence process the steps of the subcatchment division method are presented as follows i the first step is to conduct the first level catchment division considering the effects of administrative regions and the flow direction of drainage pipelines firstly it is necessary to delineate the catchment areas according to the flow direction of outlets and drainage pipelines then to further subdivide the first level catchment areas with the subordinate administration region of a study area as the boundary ii the second step is to delineate the second level catchment based on the locations of drainage conduits and urban roads the urban rainwater generally converges along the urban roads in addition the drainage pipes and stormwater inlets are usually distributed along the urban roads the rainwater can be intercepted by stormwater inlets into the drainage pipe networks and can finally converge into the river through outlets hence the second level subcatchment areas are divided using the pipe network road networks as the boundary firstly the drainage pipelines should be used as the boundary to delineate the subcatchment areas based on the first level catchment areas secondly the second level subcatchment areas are further subdivided using the urban roads as the boundary iii the third step is to conduct the three level catchment division based on the residential commercial green park and other plots which are the basic units of land allocated by the urban planning administration department according to specific uses firstly according to building surface contours obtained from high resolution images aerial photographs and field survey the subcatchment areas are delineated using each residential unit market green space and park as the boundary based on the second level subcatchment areas drainage pipes and stormwater inlets in residential and commercial areas are usually distributed along the roads secondly for large residential and commercial areas the three level catchment areas are further subdivided according to the internal roads finally the relationship between the upstream and downstream of adjacent catchment units is determined depending on the flow direction of pipeline drainage 2 stormwater inlets detailed information about the geometric properties of drainage networks is often unavailable or incomplete which is a challenge for high precision simulations of urban waterlogging behrouz et al 2020 additionally drainage pipes and stormwater inlets are usually distributed along the urban roads the stormwater inlets data in a large study area is difficult to obtain owing to the difficulty in actual measurements in order to make the stormwater inlet data as close as possible to the real situation this study proposes a method to calculate the data of stormwater inlets the parameters of stormwater inlets that need to be determined are maximum depth and invert channel or manhole bottom elevation according to the spatial layout and flow direction of drainage pipes other unknown stormwater inlets can be determined based on the data of a few known stormwater inlets and elevations in a study area the specific calculation procedures are presented as follows i the drainage pipes are laid down along the drainage direction according to a certain design slope the magnitude of design slope can be obtained from the code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering gb 50014 2006 mohurd et al 2016 shao and liu 2018 invert elevation of the node can be calculated according to the length of drainage pipe the design slope corresponding to pipe diameters and the known invert elevation of the upstream node the formula is written as 9 h nj h ni l ij s ij where h nj and h ni represent the invert elevations of node nj and upstream node ni respectively n represents the node i and j are the node numbers l ij is the drainage pipe length connecting the nodes nj and ni s ij is the minimum slope corresponding to the length l ij ii the ground surface height of each node is obtained by analyzing the 1 1000 digital elevation model dem data of the study area the maximum depth can be calculated by the distance from the ground surface height to the invert elevation of the node and the maximum depth should meet the national code gb 50014 2006 the maximum depth of each node is checked according to the flow direction of drainage pipes and the slope of the pipeline is adjusted for the node where the maximum depth doesn t meet the design specification specially the slope of urban road is used as the slope of pipeline in the area with large topographic relief all the nodes data meet the specification mohurd et al 2016 3 ponding depth when the flow at a junction exceeds the capacity of the system to transport it further downstream the excess water volume is stored atop the junction in a pond fashion which can be reintroduced into the drainage system as the capacity permits rossman 2015 ponding water is equivalent to a cone based on the generation mechanism of node ponding and then the ponding depth at a node is approximated by 10 v 1 3 π d s 2 d where v is the ponding volume at a node d is the ponding depth s is the average slope 3 3 2 model implementations a case study was conducted for the qingshan district located in wuhan city china fig 1 subcatchments were delineated by the hpbsi method and the study domain in swmm consisted of 705 subcatchments 800 nodes and 805 link elements fig 4 a the tyson polygon method is one of the most widespread methods to divide subcatchment areas in order to assess the performance of the proposed subcatchment division method another model scenario was created where the subcatchments in the study domain were delineated using the tyson polygon method fig 4b a comparison of these model scenarios shows the inconsistent division results the hpbsi method identified the subcatchments that can consider the influence of administrative areas building boundaries and drainage pipelines on the confluence process while the tyson polygon method can only consider the distribution of stormwater inlets swmm offers three choices such as the green ampt method the horton method and the scs curve number cn method for modeling of infiltration in this study the horton method was selected to compute the infiltration process because it was more suitable for calculating the infiltration volume in an urban area and required few input parameters li et al 2014 rossman 2015 swmm allows the option of choosing one of the flow routing methods of steady flow kinematic wave and dynamic wave the flow in the stormwater pipe network is usually simulated using the dynamic wave option because of its ability to account for channel storage backwater effect entrance exit loss flow reversal and pressurized flow rossman 2015 eckart et al 2018 the main parameters in swmm are determined by the measurements including area width slope and percent impervious area of subcatchment invert elevation and maximum depth at junction length and the maximum depth of conduit other parameters i e depression storage infiltration parameters manning s roughness etc are determined according to the swmm manual rossman 2015 3 3 3 design rainstorm and river water level scenarios before start analyzing the joint impact of multiple flood relevant variables it is necessary to consider different combination scenarios of rainfall and river water level according to the study of mohurd et al 2016 and the report of wuhan natural resources and planning bureau 2013 the 24 hour rainfalls with the return periods of 5 yr 10 yr 20 yr 50 yr and 100 yr were used as model inputs to study the inundation response with the details shown in table 1 the dependence of river water level and rainfall is considered to design river water level scenarios according to the co occurrence events of river water level and rainfall during the flood seasons from 1990 to 2020 fig 5 the lowest and the highest water levels corresponding to a 24 hour rainfall of the 5 yr or above return period are 21 7 m and 28 0 m respectively therefore the design water level should be within this interval the water level for flood protection and the water level for flood warning at hankou of the myr are 25 0 m and 27 3 m respectively thus 21 7 m 25 0 m 27 3 m and 28 0 m were selected as the design water levels for the frequency of 71 22 5 and 2 moreover the design water level can be determined by the frequency analysis of water level data selected based on pot ghodsi et al 2016 with the results shown in table 1 4 results 4 1 variation characteristics of rainfall and river water level 4 1 1 dependence between rainfall and river water level to more accurately assess the flood risk probability it is necessary to investigate the dependence between multiple flood driving factors and thus the inter dependency was evaluated of rainfall and river water level using different methods fig 6 a and b respectively present the visual and qualitative illustration of the dependence between daily rainfall and water level at hankou during the flood seasons from 1990 to 2020 apparently one inflection point and two different change stages were detected coincidentally in daily rainfall and water level during the flood seasons namely increasing from 1 may to the end of july and then decreasing from the end of july to 31 october fig 6a the results show a strong dependence relationship between rainfall and river water level moreover high water levels and heavy rainfall mainly occurred from the middle of june to the end of july and especially the highest water level and intense rainfall occurred in early july meaning that the risk of flood occurrence would be highest during this period the statistical dependence of rainfall and river water level was further analyzed using different correlation coefficients covering spearman s rho and kendall s tau with the results shown in fig 6b it can be found that the correlation coefficients between daily rainfall and river water level were greater than zero especially for max rf co wl maximum 24 h rainfall and corresponding water level and aver rf aver wl average 24 h rainfall and average 24 h water level whose correlation coefficients passed the 1 significance test implying that the rainfall at wuhan exhibited a significant positive correlation with the water level at hankou in particular the correlation between maximum 24 h rainfall and maximum 24 h water level max rf max wl was the lowest but still significant at the 0 2 level as discussed above it should be noted that during the period of heavy rainfall in wuhan higher water levels occurred at hankou meanwhile a strong positive dependence was found between rainfall and river water level which clearly indicated that the occurrence probability of urban flooding cannot be correctly estimated by only considering the single effect of rainfall or river water level therefore it is necessary to evaluate the joint impact of rainfall and river water level on urban flooding 4 1 2 change trends of rainfall and river water level the change trends of rainfall and river water level during the period 1990 2020 were analyzed using the mann kendall trend test with the results shown in fig 7 when taking the significance level α 0 10 0 05 and 0 01 zα 2 1 64 1 96 and 2 58 were then obtained respectively the rainfall during the flood seasons presented a slightly decreasing trend while the increasing trends were found in rainfall days maximum daily rainfall and rainstorm during the flood seasons with the increasing degree being more pronounced in rainfall days the decreasing trends were discovered in the highest lowest and average water levels and the number of days exceeding the water level for flood protection in which the 1 and 10 significant trends were observed in lowest and average water levels respectively and the decreasing trend was much smaller in highest water level from fig 7b it is easy to know that the monthly rainfall and rainstorm during the flood seasons exhibited increasing trends except for the rainfall in may and july and the rainstorm in may and september the decreasing trends were discovered in monthly average highest and lowest water levels during the flood seasons except for the lowest water levels in june and july and the highest water levels in may in which the 1 and 5 significant trends were observed for the lowest and average water levels in october respectively it is quite obvious that high water levels and heavy rainfall occurred from june to july and the rainstorm and lowest water levels presented increasing trends during this period indicating that the risk of urban flooding in wuhan was increasing the abrupt changes of rainfall and river water level during the flood seasons were analyzed using the mann kendall abrupt change test method with the results shown in fig 8 it can be observed from fig 8a that during the periods of 1994 2012 and 2018 2020 ufk 0 except 1999 2000 indicated the annual rainfall presented decreasing trends during the periods of 1990 1993 and 2013 2017 ufk 0 except 1992 showed the annual rainfall experienced increasing trends the ufk and ubk curves of rainfall intersected in 1993 1998 2004 2012 and 2015 between the boundary lines implying that the rainfall in flood seasons had abrupt changes in 1993 1998 2004 2012 and 2015 similarly it can be noted from fig 8b that during the period 1990 2005 ufk 0 except 1992 indicated the annual water level exhibited an increasing trend during the period 2006 2020 ufk 0 showed the annual water level experienced a decreasing trend the ufk and ubk curves of river water level intersected in 2005 between the boundary lines which indicated that the river water level in flood seasons had an abrupt change in 2005 4 2 analysis of joint risk probability 4 2 1 joint risk probability of long term series as stated above the probability of urban flooding in wuhan cannot be correctly estimated by only considering a single effect of rainfall or river water level in the myr this study focuses on the joint risk probability of rainfall and river water level using 26 bivariate copula models with mvcat toolbox the risk probability represents the probability that extreme events occur that is the probability of variables exceeding a certain threshold such as heavy rainfall or higher water level the raftery copula was selected as the best function to describe the dependence structure between the rainfall and corresponding river water level during the flood seasons in wuhan from 1990 to 2020 based on all goodness of fit criteria aic bic nse and rmse table 2 shows the risk probabilities of rainfall and water level under different combined conditions according to this table the joint risk probability p r h and encounter risk probability p r h presented decreasing trends with the increasing rainfall or water level furthermore the increasing trend and decreasing trend were observed in the conditional risk probabilities p h h r r p h r and p r r h h p r h respectively with the increasing rainfall or decreasing water level it should also be noted that the conditional probability p r h was always larger than the exceedance probability of rainfall indicating that river water level poses an additional risk of urban flooding meanwhile the conditional probability p h r was always larger than the exceedance probability of river water level illustrating that rainfall brings an extra risk of urban flooding under the lower water level scenarios the conditional risk probability p h r was greater than p r h however with the increasing water level the conditional risk probability p r h increased whereas p h r decreased and even p r h finally was greater than p h r it is obvious that the condition probabilities were significantly influenced by water level and a higher water level was usually accompanied by the event of heavy rainfall moreover the encounter risk probability was always less than the exceedance probability of river water level or rainfall indicating that the simultaneous occurrence probability of heavy rainfall and higher water level was very low nevertheless the joint risk probability was always larger than the exceedance probability of river water level or rainfall meaning that neglecting the interaction between flood drivers can lead to an underestimation of flood risk 4 2 2 comparison of joint risk probability during different periods the characteristics of urban flooding have changed over recent years under the impacts of global climate change and human activities from the above mentioned analysis it can be seen that abrupt changes of rainfall occurred in 1993 1998 2004 2012 and 2015 and an abrupt change of river water level occurred during the 2005 flood season an adjacent mutation point of two variables was selected to divide the time series of rainfall water level during the flood seasons from 1990 to 2020 into two periods of 1990 2004 and 2005 2020 the joint risk probabilities of rainfall and river water level during two periods were analyzed using 26 bivariate copula families to assess the change of urban flood risk in wuhan depending on all goodness of fit criteria aic bic nse and rmse the raftery copula is the best fit copula to describe the dependence between rainfall and corresponding water level during the period 1990 2004 sub 1 whereas the clayton copula is chosen as the best fit copula for the period 2005 2020 sub 2 as presented in fig 9 a when the water level exceeded the water level for flood protection 25 0 m and the rainfall equaled or exceeded 100 0 mm the joint risk probability of the second time series sub 2 2005 2020 was greater than that of the first time series sub 1 1990 2004 and the increasing rate of a joint risk probability in sub 2 relative to sub 1 increased with the increasing water level especially for heavy rainstorm 100 0 mm and higher water levels 27 3 m the minimum increasing rate of a joint risk probability was approximately 11 8 this clearly shows that the joint risk of heavy rainstorm and higher water levels has increased significantly in recent years which has increased the risk of urban flooding in wuhan and put forward a higher requirement for flood control and drainage it can be observed from fig 9b that the encounter risk probability of sub 2 was always greater than that of sub 1 with the rainfall of 100 0 mm or above and the difference value of the encounter risk probability between sub 2 and sub 1 increased with the decreasing water level meanwhile it is also notable that the difference value of the joint risk probability and encounter risk probability between sub 2 and sub 1 increased at beginning but then decreased with the increasing rainfall a similar kind of trend can be seen from fig 9c which shows that the conditional risk probability p r h of sub 2 was always greater than that of sub 1 for the rainfall of 80 0 mm or above and the difference value of the conditional risk probability between sub 2 and sub 1 increased with the increasing water level subsequently it can be seen from fig 9d that the conditional risk probability p h r of sub 2 was greater than that of sub 1 with the water level above 27 0 m and the difference value of the conditional risk probability between sub 2 and sub 1 increased with the increasing rainfall however for the river water level below 25 0 m and the rainfall below 80 0 mm it is notable that the joint risk probability encounter risk probability and conditional risk probabilities of sub 1 were greater than the corresponding values of sub 2 and the difference value of the joint risk probability between sub 2 and sub 1 reduced with the increasing water level or rainfall meanwhile under the heavy rainstorm and higher water level scenarios the increasing rates of the encounter risk probability and conditional risk probabilities in sub 2 relative to sub 1 increased with the increasing rainfall and water level in which the minimum increasing rate of risk probability was about 1 6 from the above analysis it appears that heavy rainstorm and higher water level events have occurred more frequently in recent years which has increased the pressure of flood control and drainage in wuhan 4 3 simulations of the joint impact of rainfall and river water level on urban flooding 4 3 1 verification of urban flooding model the accumulative rainfall in wuhan from june 30 to july 7 2016 exceeded the maximum weekly rainfall in the situ meteorological records causing severe urban waterlogging therefore two rainstorm events that occurred on 30 june 3 july 2016 and 5 7 july 2016 were used to calibrate and verify the model here due to data limitations only the daily rainfall datapoints of the two rainstorm events were obtained according to the hourly rainfall distribution of 24 hour rainstorms in wuhan city wuhan natural resources and planning bureau 2013 hourly rainfall hydrographs during the two rainstorm events were obtained with the hydrographs of two rainstorms shown in fig 10 here due to limited data availability the calibration and verification processes mainly focused on the inundation degrees at typical nodes fig 1 chen et al 2018 including crossroad of heping avenue and yuanlin road n1 crossroad of heping avenue and sangong road n2 lüda street n3 crossroad of heping avenue and jianshe 3rd road n4 bridge opening on jianshe 5th road n5 yangang road n6 and jianshe 9th road n7 according to the statistics of flood duration and flood depth the inundation degree was classified in three classes including high moderate and low wuhan natural resources and planning bureau 2013 the simulated results were compared with the recorded inundation degrees as shown in table 3 two model scenarios were constructed covering scenario 1 with the subcatchment delineation using the hpbsi method and scenario 2 with the subcatchment divided by the tyson polygon method from table 3 it can be seen that the maximum inundation depths were reproduced accurately by scenario 1 and the results basically agree well with the recorded inundation degrees whereas the simulated maximum inundation depths of 75 typical nodes from scenario 2 were consistent in general the inundation degrees under two scenarios were very close to the recorded data but the results from scenario 1 were more accurate than the results from scenario 2 thus scenario 1 in this study was used to simulate the urban waterlogging under different combinations of rainfall and water level 4 3 2 joint impact of rainfall and river water level for cities along the river the flood risk assessment should reflect all risk information derived from multiple variables including rainfall river water level drainage etc and their joint impact may affect the inundation degree in the study area therefore it is important to simulate the combined effect of multiple variables using the urban flood inundation model in this study the flood volume and duration under different combinations of rainfall and water level were simulated to evaluate the joint impact of rainfall water level and pumping on urban waterlogging using the swmm with two kinds of operation conditions namely with and without working pumps to compare the difference in flood volume or flood duration between different water levels the water level of 21 7 m was considered as the baseline scenario with the results shown in fig 11 according to the simulations using the swmm it was obtained that the flood volume and flood duration increased by about 1 7 3 7 and 0 8 1 3 respectively when the water level increased from 21 7 m to 28 0 m the rainfall return period of 100 yr was considered as the baseline scenario to compare the difference in flood volume or flood duration between the different rainfall return periods with the results shown in fig 12 as presented in fig 12 the flood volume and flood duration significantly reduced by about 71 3 71 9 and 58 2 58 5 respectively as the rainfall return period decreased from 100 yr to 5 yr from the above analysis it appears that the waterlogging in the study area was caused mainly by intense rainfall and the increase of rainfall and water level had an obviously adverse effect on urban waterlogging the reduction rate of flood volume or flood duration in fig 13 was measured as the percentage of the difference in flood volume or flood duration between pump operations with and without working it could be seen from fig 13 that the reduction rates of flood volume and flood duration significantly decreased from 66 2 66 8 and 31 9 32 4 to 52 2 53 9 and 28 0 28 9 respectively with the rainfall return period increased from 5 yr to 100 yr implying that the effect of pumping on waterlogging drainage became smaller with the increasing rainfall return period meanwhile the flood volume and flood duration would increase by approximately 52 2 66 8 and 28 0 32 4 respectively when the pump station stopped operation as the river water level exceeding the pump stop level indicating that the pump stations play an important role in urban flood drainage systems besides the difference in the reduction rate of flood volume or flood duration between different return periods was large when the rainfall return period was lower than 20 yr however the difference was becoming smaller for the return period 20 yr it is clear from the above analysis that working pumps can efficiently reduce the flood risk with the 20 yr rainfall return period 5 discussion the results of this study show that during the period of heavy rainfall in wuhan high water levels occurred at hankou of the myr and a strong positive dependence was found between rainfall and water level moreover the conditional probabilities were always larger than the exceedance probability of rainfall or water level illustrating that water level or rainfall posed an additional risk of urban flooding it is well known that the individual variable of rainfall or water level may not itself be extreme but a large exceedance can lead to urban flooding when these variables are combined liu et al 2018 the outcome of the above analysis confirmed that flood risk assessment in cities along the yangtze river needs to consider the interaction between rainfall and river water level the previous studies have shown that ignoring the interaction between flood drivers can lead to underestimation of the flood risks lian et al 2013 sraj et al 2015 liu et al 2018 this result has also been found in this study that is the joint flood risk probability was always larger than the exceedance probability of water level or rainfall which corresponds to the results of liu et al 2009 and xie etal 2012 rainfall and river water level during the flood seasons had an abrupt change in 2004 and 2005 respectively and the analysis of the measurements confirmed that flood characteristics had changed over the past years the joint encounter and conditional risk probabilities of heavy rainstorm and higher water levels during the period of 2005 2020 were greater than that of 1990 2004 this can be explained by the maximum rainfall has increased and the extreme events of heavy rainstorm and higher water level have occurred frequently in recent years an approach with the subcatchment delineation of hierarchical partition based on the spatial information is proposed which can consider the influence of administrative area building boundary and drainage pipeline on the confluence process the verification process using the data on 30 june 7 july 2016 showed that although there were some minor differences between the simulated results and recorded data and inundation degrees were still accurately simulated thus the simulations were suitable which has proved to be a valuable method for constructing the urban flooding model in data poor regions the flood volume and flood duration increased with the increasing water level fig 11 similar findings have been revealed by luo et al 2016 who found that the adverse influence of the flood level on drainage was greater with the rising of flood level of the outer river the urban flooding was mainly caused by heavy rainfall and the reason is that rainstorm is intense and rapidly developing event which falls in flood prone areas few hours would cause flooding while river water level needs considerable time to increase which have enough time for deploy response zellou and rahali 2019 it should be noted that the pump stations play an important role in urban flood drainage systems but the efficient effect of pumping on the urban drainage decreased gradually with the increasing rainfall therefore it is inadvisable to reduce urban waterlogging simply by increasing pumping capacity the results are similar to the observation of lian et al 2013 as discussed above the design of flood defense facilities and urban drainage systems should take into account the joint impact of rainfall and river water level the risk of urban flooding was changing with climate change hence sustainable and adaptive emergency management measures should be formulated to reduce the probability of flood disasters the results can be useful for the design of water resource projects such as flood embankments and urban drainage systems and provide scientific basis for developing flood mitigation measures and risk assessment in addition the methodology of this study could be used in other cities along the yangtze river such as chongqing and nanjing that are also affected by rainfall and river water level moreover a flood risk management model needs to be established by combining the risk probability and simulations of urban flooding in the future study 6 conclusions the variation characteristics of rainfall in wuhan and river water level at hankou during the flood seasons were analyzed in this study and the joint risk probabilities during different periods were calculated using the optimal copula moreover the calibrated swmm was adopted to simulate the joint impact of rainfall river water level and pumping on urban waterlogging the main conclusions are drawn from this study i high water levels and heavy rainfall mostly occurred in june and july and the rainstorm and lowest water levels presented increasing trends during this period which resulted in an increase in the risk of urban flooding in wuhan meanwhile a strong positive dependence was found between rainfall and water level this highlighted that the probability of flooding cannot be correctly estimated by only considering the single effect of rainfall or water level in wuhan ii the joint risk probability was always larger than the exceedance probability of water level or rainfall which confirmed that the neglect of the interaction between flood drivers can lead to underestimation of the flood risks furthermore for heavy rainstorm and higher water level scenarios the joint risk probability in 2005 2020 was greater than that in 1990 2004 in which the minimum increasing rate was approximately 11 8 indicating that the joint risk increased significantly heavy rainstorm and higher water level events occurred more frequently in recent years which put forward a higher requirement for flood control and urban drainage in wuhan iii the hierarchical partition based on the spatial information method was proposed for the subcatchment generation in swmm which can improve the accuracy of the model to a certain degree by comparing it with the tyson polygon method the flood volume and flood duration would increase by about 1 7 3 7 and 0 8 1 3 respectively with the increasing water level from 21 7 m to 28 0 m and would decrease by approximately 71 3 71 9 and 58 2 58 5 with the rainfall return period decreasing from 100 yr to 5 yr and therefore the biggest threat might be caused by heavy rainfall besides the efficient effect of pumping on urban drainage gradually decreased with the increase of rainfall return period this study improves our understanding of the joint impact of rainfall and river water level on urban flooding the results can be used to provide the support for the design of water resource projects and the disaster mitigation measures of urban flooding credit authorship contribution statement xiaojie wang conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft

2954,flood severity in cities along the yangtze river is vulnerable to multiple influencing factors such as intense rainfall higher river water level and pump operation this study evaluates the joint impact of rainfall and river water level on urban flooding in wuhan city firstly the variation characteristics of rainfall in wuhan and water level at hankou of the middle yangtze river were analyzed by the mann kendall test high water levels and heavy rainfall mostly occurred in june to july and the rainstorm and lowest water levels presented increasing trends during this period meanwhile a strong positive dependence was found between rainfall and water level implying that the probability of flooding cannot be correctly estimated by only considering the influence of a single factor secondly a joint risk probability was estimated using the optimal copula the joint risk probability was always larger than the exceedance probability of water level or rainfall which highlighted that ignoring the interaction between different flood drivers can lead to the underestimation of flood hazards a comparison of the joint risk probabilities during different periods of 2005 2020 and 1990 2004 shows that extreme events of heavy rainstorm and higher water level have occurred frequently in recent years with the joint risk of urban flood increasing significantly finally flood inundation processes under different combinations of rainfall and water level were simulated using the calibrated model of swmm with and without working pumps being considered the flood volume and flood duration would increase by about 1 7 3 7 and 0 8 1 3 respectively with the water level increasing from 21 7 m to 28 0 m and would reduce by approximately 71 3 71 9 and 58 2 58 5 with the rainfall return period decreasing from 100 yr to 5 yr therefore urban inundation was mainly caused by heavy rainfall moreover the efficient effect of pumping on the urban drainage decreased gradually with the increasing rainfall therefore the results can be used to provide the support for the design of water resource projects and the disaster mitigation measures of urban flooding keywords rainfall river water level pump operation joint impact copula urban flooding data availability l have shared the link to my data at the manuscript 1 introduction flood is the most frequent natural disaster in the world leading to serious casualties and economic losses which accounted for 49 of the total disaster events and 44 of the deaths in 2019 cred 2020 wang et al 2021 in the cities such as wuhan and nanjing along the yangtze river yr the ground elevation of most cities is below the flood stage a key strategy of urban flood control is to construct strong levees along the river banks to prevent cities from flooding moreover a large amount of rainfall that falls in an urban area is normally collected by the urban drainage system and then drains to the yr through pumps and sluice gates when the river water level is higher than the outlet level of the urban drainage system during a flood season the drainage gates need to be closed hsu et al 2013 there is no doubt that pump stations play an important role in urban flood drainage systems and the discharge capacity of pumps in operation is directly related to the backwater effect and upstream overflowing if the pumps are unable to properly perform the drainage function severe urban flood disasters would occur yazdi et al 2016 yang et al 2019 consequently for the cities along the yr in china urban flood severity is ruled by the interaction of multiple influencing factors such as intense rainfall high water level and modes of pump operation lian et al 2013 since floods are influenced by a combination of multiple variables it is imperative to evaluate the joint risk of extreme events by an effective multivariate probabilistic approach and to simulate the combined effect of multiple variables by using an urban storm water model copula has been widely used to quantify the dependence structure of two random variables and the marginal distributions allow for different types of probability distribution functions sadegh et al 2018 in recent years copula has emerged as an effective tool to describe and analyze the dependence structure of multiple variables associated with floods reddy and ganguli 2012 lian et al 2013 sraj et al 2015 papaioannou et al 2016 moftakhari et al 2017 liu et al 2019 luo et al 2021 for instance xie et al 2012 analyzed the joint probability distribution of rainstorm and water level in a river network area using the gumbel hougard copula zellou and rahali 2019 studied the joint risk probabilities of extreme rainfall and extreme tide level in the bouregreg estuary of morocco using five copulas jane et al 2020 investigated the joint probability of rainfall ocean side water level and groundwater level in miami dade county of south florida using two elliptical copulas and three archimedean copulas all these studies confirmed that the fact that the method of univariate probability analysis cannot provide accurately the assessment of flood risks if flood events are derived by interrelated random variables an issue to mention here within the previous studies is that most researchers focus more on the joint risk probability of rainfall and tide level in coastal areas and the joint risk probability of urban rainfall and water level in a large river has been rarely addressed in the literature meanwhile flood characteristics have changed over recent years under the impacts of global climate change and human activities however the joint risks of rainfall and river water level during different periods using effective multivariate probabilistic approaches are still poorly clarified once the joint risk probability of multiple flood drivers is evaluated based on the copula function the hydrologic or hydrodynamic models are often used to simulate the compound flood risk of these variables lian et al 2013 analyzed the joint probability of rainfall and tidal level using five copulas and developed a hydrodynamic model for the complex river network to simulate the combined effects of rainfalls and tidal levels on flood severity luo et al 2016 developed a concentration model at a drainage area scale using scs coupled with mike11 to analyze the influence of storms and flood levels of the outer river on urban drainage tanim and goharian 2021 employed a compound flood model using hydrologic model coupled with the hydrodynamic model to simulate urban flooding under the interaction between rainfall runoff and storm surge and adjusted the integrated modeling outputs based on the multivariate gaussian copula ming et al 2022 applied copula functions to estimate the joint probability of heavy rainfall extreme river flow and storm surge which are then simulated using a 2d high performance hydrodynamic model to produce probabilistic inundation maps therefore it is necessary to establish a model to simulate the combined effect of rainfall and river water level on urban flooding here urban rainwater can be drained to the river through pumping and higher water levels can induce an extra flood risk by reducing the capacity of urban drainage the impact of water level on urban inundation can be illustrated by calculating the pumping capacity corresponding to a specified water level zellou and rahali 2019 it is necessary to consider the dynamic influence of river water level on pumping capacity in order to assess the effect of water level on urban waterlogging drainage regarding the use of pump stations previous studies have focused more on the optimal operation of pump stations hsu et al 2013 yazdi et al 2016 yang et al 2019 however the influence of river water level on pump operation is not explicitly considered in previous studies and there also exists a lack of knowledge about the joint impact of water level and rainfall on urban flooding the main purposes of this study are i to investigate the variation characteristics of rainfall in wuhan and river water level at the hydrometric station of hankou in the middle yangtze river myr in order to reveal the strength of dependence and evolution trend ii to identify an appropriate copula model using the goodness of fit criterion further to assess the joint risk probability of rainfall and river water level during different periods by the optimal copula iii to simulate the urban inundation under different combinations of rainfall and river water level using the calibrated model of swmm with two kinds of pump operation conditions namely with and without working pumps in order to estimate the joint impact of rainfall river water level and pumping mode on urban waterlogging in particular the discharge capacity of pumps corresponding to a specified water level was calculated according to the pump characteristic curve additionally the hierarchical partition based on the spatial information method was proposed for the subcatchment generation in swmm and the simulated results using the proposed method and the tyson polygon method were compared to evaluate the performance of the proposed method the study would provide scientific basis and guidance for decision making of flood risk management 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area wuhan situated on the jianghan plain is the capital city in hubei province of central china which is a river crossed land created by the hanjiang river joining the yangtze river this city is located in 113 41 115 05 e and 29 58 31 22 n with an area of 8569 km2 and its administrative divisions include 13 districts such as the districts of jianghan wuchang and qingshan wuhan is known as the city with one hundred lakes and the surface area of 166 lakes is approximately 867 km2 duan and niu 2018 wuhan has a humid subtropical climate with the average annual temperature of 15 8 17 5 c and the average annual precipitation of 1150 1450 mm rainfall is mainly concentrated in flood seasons qingshan district with a drainage area of 13 km2 was selected for modeling urban waterlogging in this study fig 1 which adjoins the yangtze river to the north luojia port to the west east lake port and wufeng lake to the east and youyi avenue to the south 2 2 datasets in this study these measured data were collected covering daily rainfall in wuhan city and daily water level at the hydrometric station of hankou in the myr during the flood seasons from 1990 to 2020 the water level data were obtained from the bureau of hydrology changjiang water resources commission and the rainfall data were acquired from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn monthly rainfall in wuhan and the average water level at hankou of the myr during the flood seasons may to october from 1990 to 2020 are shown in fig 2 the flood frequency analysis is usually performed using the annual maxima am method when the length of record data is short the most common alternative to am is the peaks over threshold pot durocher et al 2018 moreover the use of am series may ignore the second or the third peak flood within a year and this problem is obviated in the pot sarhadi and modarres 2011 in this study based on pot method the 24 hour rainstorm standard 50 0 mm was considered as the threshold level to select the rainfall data and then select the water level data which corresponding to these rainfall data in order to analyse the bivariate flood frequency of rainfall and water level there are three pump stations in the study area namely gangxi i gangxi ii and luojialu ii fig 1 the luojialu ii pump station is equipped with seven pumps with a total design discharge capacity of 55 0 m3 s and only a few study streets are located in the drainage area of the luojialu ii pump station the gangxi i pump station is equipped with four pumps with a total design discharge capacity of 23 86 m3 s and a small front pool which are usually used as a supplementation for the gangxi ii pump station the gangxi ii pump station is equipped with six pumps with a total design discharge capacity of 53 82 m3 s hence this station was mainly analyzed in this study due to limited data availability the discharge characteristic curve of a pump was obtained by fitting the data which defines the pump capacity curve corresponding to different water levels the water level in the myr and the corresponding discharge capacity of the luojialu ii pump station at the maximum design and minimum head were obtained from the design report of the luojialu pump station and the design characteristic curve of the station was fitted using these three datapoints fig 3 a the vertical single stage oblique flow pumps are used in the luojialu ii pump station and the gangxi ii pump station and meanwhile the two pump stations are very close to each other fig 1 therefore the characteristic curve of the gangxi pump station could be obtained by using the similarity ratio according to the design characteristic curve of the luojialu ii pump station combining with the design capacity of the gangxi and luojialu pump stations the characteristic curve of the gangxi ii pump station is shown in fig 3b 3 methodology the mann kendall test kendall 1938 mann 1945 was introduced to analyze the variation characteristics of rainfall and river water level spearman s rho spearman 2010 and kendall s tau helsel and hirsch 2002 were presented to analyze the dependence between rainfall and river water level the methodology based on the bivariate copula model was introduced to estimate the joint risk probability of rainfall and river water level 3 1 mann kendall test the mann kendall trend test is usually used to estimate the significance of monotonic trends with non normally distributed data and it is resistant to the effect of outliers in the mann kendall trend test the statistic parameter z 0 is obtained if the time series exhibits an increasing trend whereases the statistic parameter z 0 shows a decreasing trend in the bilateral trend test the time series shows a significant trend at the confidence level of α if the statistic parameter z z α 2 wang et al 2021 in the mann kendall abrupt change test the statistic parameter ufk 0 means that a time series of variable exhibits an increasing trend and ufk 0 shows that the time series presents a decreasing trend the abrupt change time is the corresponding time of ufk and ubk curves intersecting between the boundary lines wang et al 2019 3 2 joint risk probability multivariate copula analysis toolbox mvcat was used in this study which includes 26 different copula families the equations of 26 different copula families are available in table 1 of sadegh et al 2017 the copula parameters and the underlying uncertainties are inferred using the markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation within a bayesian framework the parameters of the marginal distributions are estimated through a maximum likelihood algorithm sadegh et al 2017 based on the akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliff efficiency nse the performances of different copulas were compared to find the best fit copula function schwarz 1978 akaike 1998 aho et al 2014 the detailed calculation methods of goodness of fit criterion are defined as follows 1 aic 2 k n ln 1 n i 1 n p ei p i 2 2 bic k ln n n ln 1 n i 1 n p ei p i 2 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n p ei p i 2 4 nse 1 i 1 n p ei p i 2 i 1 n p ei p ei 2 where k is the number of parameters of the statistical model n is the number of samples pei is the empirical frequency pi is the theoretical frequency p ei is the average value of empirical frequency the aic and bic avoid the problem of over conditioning by considering the dependence of parameters a better model fit is associated with the lower aic bic and rmse values and the higher nse value in which rmse 0 and nse 1 specially a perfect model fit was obtained when rmse 0 and nse 1 sadegh et al 2017 luo et al 2021 the risk probability of flood events is usually associated with a certain exceedance probability lian et al 2013 zellou and rahali 2019 for the bivariate case the risk probability can be characterized in three ways i joint risk probability ii encounter risk probability and iii conditional risk probability accordingly the bivariate risk probability for a copula based flood event can be expressed by reddy and ganguli 2012 joint risk probability 5 p r h p r r p h h 1 f c r h encounter risk probability 6 p r h p r r p h h 1 f r r f h h f c r h conditional risk probability when the river water level h h the risk probability of rainfall r r is calculated by 7 p r r h h 1 f r

r and h are the prespecified threshold values of rainfall and river water level respectively fc r h is the joint probability of rainfall and river water level f r r and f h h are the marginal distributions of rainfall and river water level respectively lian et al 2013 3 3 joint impact modeling 3 3 1 model improvement 1 subcatchment division the storm water management model swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model designed by the usepa united states environmental protection agency which is widely used for planning analysis and design for stormwater management rossman 2015 guan et al 2015 chen et al 2018 tanim and goharian 2021 subcatchments are hydrologic units in swmm and 20 parameters are associated with six different physical processes for each subcatchment such as area width slope imperviousness and depression storage depth behrouz et al 2020 consequently the partitioning level of subcatchment is vital for flood simulations of urban rainstorm there are three popular methods of subcatchment division namely the tyson polygon method bhattacharjya and chaurasia 2013 the natural artificial boundary method jain et al 2016 and the land use method warsta et al 2017 each of the three methods has its advantages and disadvantages wu et al 2020 the natural artificial boundary method can consider the physical laws of runoff but ignore the land use types and topographic changes the land use method requires detailed underlying surface information and cannot take into account the spatial distribution of pipe networks tyson polygon method cannot consider the distributions of land use and pipes but the operation is relatively simple which is suitable for data scarce or relatively large study areas ultra high precision dem data cannot be obtained in practice for a more accurate delineation of subcatchments this study proposes the hierarchical partition based on the spatial information hpbsi method to subdivide subcatchments which can consider the effects of land use pipe distribution and urban roads on the confluence process the steps of the subcatchment division method are presented as follows i the first step is to conduct the first level catchment division considering the effects of administrative regions and the flow direction of drainage pipelines firstly it is necessary to delineate the catchment areas according to the flow direction of outlets and drainage pipelines then to further subdivide the first level catchment areas with the subordinate administration region of a study area as the boundary ii the second step is to delineate the second level catchment based on the locations of drainage conduits and urban roads the urban rainwater generally converges along the urban roads in addition the drainage pipes and stormwater inlets are usually distributed along the urban roads the rainwater can be intercepted by stormwater inlets into the drainage pipe networks and can finally converge into the river through outlets hence the second level subcatchment areas are divided using the pipe network road networks as the boundary firstly the drainage pipelines should be used as the boundary to delineate the subcatchment areas based on the first level catchment areas secondly the second level subcatchment areas are further subdivided using the urban roads as the boundary iii the third step is to conduct the three level catchment division based on the residential commercial green park and other plots which are the basic units of land allocated by the urban planning administration department according to specific uses firstly according to building surface contours obtained from high resolution images aerial photographs and field survey the subcatchment areas are delineated using each residential unit market green space and park as the boundary based on the second level subcatchment areas drainage pipes and stormwater inlets in residential and commercial areas are usually distributed along the roads secondly for large residential and commercial areas the three level catchment areas are further subdivided according to the internal roads finally the relationship between the upstream and downstream of adjacent catchment units is determined depending on the flow direction of pipeline drainage 2 stormwater inlets detailed information about the geometric properties of drainage networks is often unavailable or incomplete which is a challenge for high precision simulations of urban waterlogging behrouz et al 2020 additionally drainage pipes and stormwater inlets are usually distributed along the urban roads the stormwater inlets data in a large study area is difficult to obtain owing to the difficulty in actual measurements in order to make the stormwater inlet data as close as possible to the real situation this study proposes a method to calculate the data of stormwater inlets the parameters of stormwater inlets that need to be determined are maximum depth and invert channel or manhole bottom elevation according to the spatial layout and flow direction of drainage pipes other unknown stormwater inlets can be determined based on the data of a few known stormwater inlets and elevations in a study area the specific calculation procedures are presented as follows i the drainage pipes are laid down along the drainage direction according to a certain design slope the magnitude of design slope can be obtained from the code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering gb 50014 2006 mohurd et al 2016 shao and liu 2018 invert elevation of the node can be calculated according to the length of drainage pipe the design slope corresponding to pipe diameters and the known invert elevation of the upstream node the formula is written as 9 h nj h ni l ij s ij where h nj and h ni represent the invert elevations of node nj and upstream node ni respectively n represents the node i and j are the node numbers l ij is the drainage pipe length connecting the nodes nj and ni s ij is the minimum slope corresponding to the length l ij ii the ground surface height of each node is obtained by analyzing the 1 1000 digital elevation model dem data of the study area the maximum depth can be calculated by the distance from the ground surface height to the invert elevation of the node and the maximum depth should meet the national code gb 50014 2006 the maximum depth of each node is checked according to the flow direction of drainage pipes and the slope of the pipeline is adjusted for the node where the maximum depth doesn t meet the design specification specially the slope of urban road is used as the slope of pipeline in the area with large topographic relief all the nodes data meet the specification mohurd et al 2016 3 ponding depth when the flow at a junction exceeds the capacity of the system to transport it further downstream the excess water volume is stored atop the junction in a pond fashion which can be reintroduced into the drainage system as the capacity permits rossman 2015 ponding water is equivalent to a cone based on the generation mechanism of node ponding and then the ponding depth at a node is approximated by 10 v 1 3 π d s 2 d where v is the ponding volume at a node d is the ponding depth s is the average slope 3 3 2 model implementations a case study was conducted for the qingshan district located in wuhan city china fig 1 subcatchments were delineated by the hpbsi method and the study domain in swmm consisted of 705 subcatchments 800 nodes and 805 link elements fig 4 a the tyson polygon method is one of the most widespread methods to divide subcatchment areas in order to assess the performance of the proposed subcatchment division method another model scenario was created where the subcatchments in the study domain were delineated using the tyson polygon method fig 4b a comparison of these model scenarios shows the inconsistent division results the hpbsi method identified the subcatchments that can consider the influence of administrative areas building boundaries and drainage pipelines on the confluence process while the tyson polygon method can only consider the distribution of stormwater inlets swmm offers three choices such as the green ampt method the horton method and the scs curve number cn method for modeling of infiltration in this study the horton method was selected to compute the infiltration process because it was more suitable for calculating the infiltration volume in an urban area and required few input parameters li et al 2014 rossman 2015 swmm allows the option of choosing one of the flow routing methods of steady flow kinematic wave and dynamic wave the flow in the stormwater pipe network is usually simulated using the dynamic wave option because of its ability to account for channel storage backwater effect entrance exit loss flow reversal and pressurized flow rossman 2015 eckart et al 2018 the main parameters in swmm are determined by the measurements including area width slope and percent impervious area of subcatchment invert elevation and maximum depth at junction length and the maximum depth of conduit other parameters i e depression storage infiltration parameters manning s roughness etc are determined according to the swmm manual rossman 2015 3 3 3 design rainstorm and river water level scenarios before start analyzing the joint impact of multiple flood relevant variables it is necessary to consider different combination scenarios of rainfall and river water level according to the study of mohurd et al 2016 and the report of wuhan natural resources and planning bureau 2013 the 24 hour rainfalls with the return periods of 5 yr 10 yr 20 yr 50 yr and 100 yr were used as model inputs to study the inundation response with the details shown in table 1 the dependence of river water level and rainfall is considered to design river water level scenarios according to the co occurrence events of river water level and rainfall during the flood seasons from 1990 to 2020 fig 5 the lowest and the highest water levels corresponding to a 24 hour rainfall of the 5 yr or above return period are 21 7 m and 28 0 m respectively therefore the design water level should be within this interval the water level for flood protection and the water level for flood warning at hankou of the myr are 25 0 m and 27 3 m respectively thus 21 7 m 25 0 m 27 3 m and 28 0 m were selected as the design water levels for the frequency of 71 22 5 and 2 moreover the design water level can be determined by the frequency analysis of water level data selected based on pot ghodsi et al 2016 with the results shown in table 1 4 results 4 1 variation characteristics of rainfall and river water level 4 1 1 dependence between rainfall and river water level to more accurately assess the flood risk probability it is necessary to investigate the dependence between multiple flood driving factors and thus the inter dependency was evaluated of rainfall and river water level using different methods fig 6 a and b respectively present the visual and qualitative illustration of the dependence between daily rainfall and water level at hankou during the flood seasons from 1990 to 2020 apparently one inflection point and two different change stages were detected coincidentally in daily rainfall and water level during the flood seasons namely increasing from 1 may to the end of july and then decreasing from the end of july to 31 october fig 6a the results show a strong dependence relationship between rainfall and river water level moreover high water levels and heavy rainfall mainly occurred from the middle of june to the end of july and especially the highest water level and intense rainfall occurred in early july meaning that the risk of flood occurrence would be highest during this period the statistical dependence of rainfall and river water level was further analyzed using different correlation coefficients covering spearman s rho and kendall s tau with the results shown in fig 6b it can be found that the correlation coefficients between daily rainfall and river water level were greater than zero especially for max rf co wl maximum 24 h rainfall and corresponding water level and aver rf aver wl average 24 h rainfall and average 24 h water level whose correlation coefficients passed the 1 significance test implying that the rainfall at wuhan exhibited a significant positive correlation with the water level at hankou in particular the correlation between maximum 24 h rainfall and maximum 24 h water level max rf max wl was the lowest but still significant at the 0 2 level as discussed above it should be noted that during the period of heavy rainfall in wuhan higher water levels occurred at hankou meanwhile a strong positive dependence was found between rainfall and river water level which clearly indicated that the occurrence probability of urban flooding cannot be correctly estimated by only considering the single effect of rainfall or river water level therefore it is necessary to evaluate the joint impact of rainfall and river water level on urban flooding 4 1 2 change trends of rainfall and river water level the change trends of rainfall and river water level during the period 1990 2020 were analyzed using the mann kendall trend test with the results shown in fig 7 when taking the significance level α 0 10 0 05 and 0 01 zα 2 1 64 1 96 and 2 58 were then obtained respectively the rainfall during the flood seasons presented a slightly decreasing trend while the increasing trends were found in rainfall days maximum daily rainfall and rainstorm during the flood seasons with the increasing degree being more pronounced in rainfall days the decreasing trends were discovered in the highest lowest and average water levels and the number of days exceeding the water level for flood protection in which the 1 and 10 significant trends were observed in lowest and average water levels respectively and the decreasing trend was much smaller in highest water level from fig 7b it is easy to know that the monthly rainfall and rainstorm during the flood seasons exhibited increasing trends except for the rainfall in may and july and the rainstorm in may and september the decreasing trends were discovered in monthly average highest and lowest water levels during the flood seasons except for the lowest water levels in june and july and the highest water levels in may in which the 1 and 5 significant trends were observed for the lowest and average water levels in october respectively it is quite obvious that high water levels and heavy rainfall occurred from june to july and the rainstorm and lowest water levels presented increasing trends during this period indicating that the risk of urban flooding in wuhan was increasing the abrupt changes of rainfall and river water level during the flood seasons were analyzed using the mann kendall abrupt change test method with the results shown in fig 8 it can be observed from fig 8a that during the periods of 1994 2012 and 2018 2020 ufk 0 except 1999 2000 indicated the annual rainfall presented decreasing trends during the periods of 1990 1993 and 2013 2017 ufk 0 except 1992 showed the annual rainfall experienced increasing trends the ufk and ubk curves of rainfall intersected in 1993 1998 2004 2012 and 2015 between the boundary lines implying that the rainfall in flood seasons had abrupt changes in 1993 1998 2004 2012 and 2015 similarly it can be noted from fig 8b that during the period 1990 2005 ufk 0 except 1992 indicated the annual water level exhibited an increasing trend during the period 2006 2020 ufk 0 showed the annual water level experienced a decreasing trend the ufk and ubk curves of river water level intersected in 2005 between the boundary lines which indicated that the river water level in flood seasons had an abrupt change in 2005 4 2 analysis of joint risk probability 4 2 1 joint risk probability of long term series as stated above the probability of urban flooding in wuhan cannot be correctly estimated by only considering a single effect of rainfall or river water level in the myr this study focuses on the joint risk probability of rainfall and river water level using 26 bivariate copula models with mvcat toolbox the risk probability represents the probability that extreme events occur that is the probability of variables exceeding a certain threshold such as heavy rainfall or higher water level the raftery copula was selected as the best function to describe the dependence structure between the rainfall and corresponding river water level during the flood seasons in wuhan from 1990 to 2020 based on all goodness of fit criteria aic bic nse and rmse table 2 shows the risk probabilities of rainfall and water level under different combined conditions according to this table the joint risk probability p r h and encounter risk probability p r h presented decreasing trends with the increasing rainfall or water level furthermore the increasing trend and decreasing trend were observed in the conditional risk probabilities p h h r r p h r and p r r h h p r h respectively with the increasing rainfall or decreasing water level it should also be noted that the conditional probability p r h was always larger than the exceedance probability of rainfall indicating that river water level poses an additional risk of urban flooding meanwhile the conditional probability p h r was always larger than the exceedance probability of river water level illustrating that rainfall brings an extra risk of urban flooding under the lower water level scenarios the conditional risk probability p h r was greater than p r h however with the increasing water level the conditional risk probability p r h increased whereas p h r decreased and even p r h finally was greater than p h r it is obvious that the condition probabilities were significantly influenced by water level and a higher water level was usually accompanied by the event of heavy rainfall moreover the encounter risk probability was always less than the exceedance probability of river water level or rainfall indicating that the simultaneous occurrence probability of heavy rainfall and higher water level was very low nevertheless the joint risk probability was always larger than the exceedance probability of river water level or rainfall meaning that neglecting the interaction between flood drivers can lead to an underestimation of flood risk 4 2 2 comparison of joint risk probability during different periods the characteristics of urban flooding have changed over recent years under the impacts of global climate change and human activities from the above mentioned analysis it can be seen that abrupt changes of rainfall occurred in 1993 1998 2004 2012 and 2015 and an abrupt change of river water level occurred during the 2005 flood season an adjacent mutation point of two variables was selected to divide the time series of rainfall water level during the flood seasons from 1990 to 2020 into two periods of 1990 2004 and 2005 2020 the joint risk probabilities of rainfall and river water level during two periods were analyzed using 26 bivariate copula families to assess the change of urban flood risk in wuhan depending on all goodness of fit criteria aic bic nse and rmse the raftery copula is the best fit copula to describe the dependence between rainfall and corresponding water level during the period 1990 2004 sub 1 whereas the clayton copula is chosen as the best fit copula for the period 2005 2020 sub 2 as presented in fig 9 a when the water level exceeded the water level for flood protection 25 0 m and the rainfall equaled or exceeded 100 0 mm the joint risk probability of the second time series sub 2 2005 2020 was greater than that of the first time series sub 1 1990 2004 and the increasing rate of a joint risk probability in sub 2 relative to sub 1 increased with the increasing water level especially for heavy rainstorm 100 0 mm and higher water levels 27 3 m the minimum increasing rate of a joint risk probability was approximately 11 8 this clearly shows that the joint risk of heavy rainstorm and higher water levels has increased significantly in recent years which has increased the risk of urban flooding in wuhan and put forward a higher requirement for flood control and drainage it can be observed from fig 9b that the encounter risk probability of sub 2 was always greater than that of sub 1 with the rainfall of 100 0 mm or above and the difference value of the encounter risk probability between sub 2 and sub 1 increased with the decreasing water level meanwhile it is also notable that the difference value of the joint risk probability and encounter risk probability between sub 2 and sub 1 increased at beginning but then decreased with the increasing rainfall a similar kind of trend can be seen from fig 9c which shows that the conditional risk probability p r h of sub 2 was always greater than that of sub 1 for the rainfall of 80 0 mm or above and the difference value of the conditional risk probability between sub 2 and sub 1 increased with the increasing water level subsequently it can be seen from fig 9d that the conditional risk probability p h r of sub 2 was greater than that of sub 1 with the water level above 27 0 m and the difference value of the conditional risk probability between sub 2 and sub 1 increased with the increasing rainfall however for the river water level below 25 0 m and the rainfall below 80 0 mm it is notable that the joint risk probability encounter risk probability and conditional risk probabilities of sub 1 were greater than the corresponding values of sub 2 and the difference value of the joint risk probability between sub 2 and sub 1 reduced with the increasing water level or rainfall meanwhile under the heavy rainstorm and higher water level scenarios the increasing rates of the encounter risk probability and conditional risk probabilities in sub 2 relative to sub 1 increased with the increasing rainfall and water level in which the minimum increasing rate of risk probability was about 1 6 from the above analysis it appears that heavy rainstorm and higher water level events have occurred more frequently in recent years which has increased the pressure of flood control and drainage in wuhan 4 3 simulations of the joint impact of rainfall and river water level on urban flooding 4 3 1 verification of urban flooding model the accumulative rainfall in wuhan from june 30 to july 7 2016 exceeded the maximum weekly rainfall in the situ meteorological records causing severe urban waterlogging therefore two rainstorm events that occurred on 30 june 3 july 2016 and 5 7 july 2016 were used to calibrate and verify the model here due to data limitations only the daily rainfall datapoints of the two rainstorm events were obtained according to the hourly rainfall distribution of 24 hour rainstorms in wuhan city wuhan natural resources and planning bureau 2013 hourly rainfall hydrographs during the two rainstorm events were obtained with the hydrographs of two rainstorms shown in fig 10 here due to limited data availability the calibration and verification processes mainly focused on the inundation degrees at typical nodes fig 1 chen et al 2018 including crossroad of heping avenue and yuanlin road n1 crossroad of heping avenue and sangong road n2 lüda street n3 crossroad of heping avenue and jianshe 3rd road n4 bridge opening on jianshe 5th road n5 yangang road n6 and jianshe 9th road n7 according to the statistics of flood duration and flood depth the inundation degree was classified in three classes including high moderate and low wuhan natural resources and planning bureau 2013 the simulated results were compared with the recorded inundation degrees as shown in table 3 two model scenarios were constructed covering scenario 1 with the subcatchment delineation using the hpbsi method and scenario 2 with the subcatchment divided by the tyson polygon method from table 3 it can be seen that the maximum inundation depths were reproduced accurately by scenario 1 and the results basically agree well with the recorded inundation degrees whereas the simulated maximum inundation depths of 75 typical nodes from scenario 2 were consistent in general the inundation degrees under two scenarios were very close to the recorded data but the results from scenario 1 were more accurate than the results from scenario 2 thus scenario 1 in this study was used to simulate the urban waterlogging under different combinations of rainfall and water level 4 3 2 joint impact of rainfall and river water level for cities along the river the flood risk assessment should reflect all risk information derived from multiple variables including rainfall river water level drainage etc and their joint impact may affect the inundation degree in the study area therefore it is important to simulate the combined effect of multiple variables using the urban flood inundation model in this study the flood volume and duration under different combinations of rainfall and water level were simulated to evaluate the joint impact of rainfall water level and pumping on urban waterlogging using the swmm with two kinds of operation conditions namely with and without working pumps to compare the difference in flood volume or flood duration between different water levels the water level of 21 7 m was considered as the baseline scenario with the results shown in fig 11 according to the simulations using the swmm it was obtained that the flood volume and flood duration increased by about 1 7 3 7 and 0 8 1 3 respectively when the water level increased from 21 7 m to 28 0 m the rainfall return period of 100 yr was considered as the baseline scenario to compare the difference in flood volume or flood duration between the different rainfall return periods with the results shown in fig 12 as presented in fig 12 the flood volume and flood duration significantly reduced by about 71 3 71 9 and 58 2 58 5 respectively as the rainfall return period decreased from 100 yr to 5 yr from the above analysis it appears that the waterlogging in the study area was caused mainly by intense rainfall and the increase of rainfall and water level had an obviously adverse effect on urban waterlogging the reduction rate of flood volume or flood duration in fig 13 was measured as the percentage of the difference in flood volume or flood duration between pump operations with and without working it could be seen from fig 13 that the reduction rates of flood volume and flood duration significantly decreased from 66 2 66 8 and 31 9 32 4 to 52 2 53 9 and 28 0 28 9 respectively with the rainfall return period increased from 5 yr to 100 yr implying that the effect of pumping on waterlogging drainage became smaller with the increasing rainfall return period meanwhile the flood volume and flood duration would increase by approximately 52 2 66 8 and 28 0 32 4 respectively when the pump station stopped operation as the river water level exceeding the pump stop level indicating that the pump stations play an important role in urban flood drainage systems besides the difference in the reduction rate of flood volume or flood duration between different return periods was large when the rainfall return period was lower than 20 yr however the difference was becoming smaller for the return period 20 yr it is clear from the above analysis that working pumps can efficiently reduce the flood risk with the 20 yr rainfall return period 5 discussion the results of this study show that during the period of heavy rainfall in wuhan high water levels occurred at hankou of the myr and a strong positive dependence was found between rainfall and water level moreover the conditional probabilities were always larger than the exceedance probability of rainfall or water level illustrating that water level or rainfall posed an additional risk of urban flooding it is well known that the individual variable of rainfall or water level may not itself be extreme but a large exceedance can lead to urban flooding when these variables are combined liu et al 2018 the outcome of the above analysis confirmed that flood risk assessment in cities along the yangtze river needs to consider the interaction between rainfall and river water level the previous studies have shown that ignoring the interaction between flood drivers can lead to underestimation of the flood risks lian et al 2013 sraj et al 2015 liu et al 2018 this result has also been found in this study that is the joint flood risk probability was always larger than the exceedance probability of water level or rainfall which corresponds to the results of liu et al 2009 and xie etal 2012 rainfall and river water level during the flood seasons had an abrupt change in 2004 and 2005 respectively and the analysis of the measurements confirmed that flood characteristics had changed over the past years the joint encounter and conditional risk probabilities of heavy rainstorm and higher water levels during the period of 2005 2020 were greater than that of 1990 2004 this can be explained by the maximum rainfall has increased and the extreme events of heavy rainstorm and higher water level have occurred frequently in recent years an approach with the subcatchment delineation of hierarchical partition based on the spatial information is proposed which can consider the influence of administrative area building boundary and drainage pipeline on the confluence process the verification process using the data on 30 june 7 july 2016 showed that although there were some minor differences between the simulated results and recorded data and inundation degrees were still accurately simulated thus the simulations were suitable which has proved to be a valuable method for constructing the urban flooding model in data poor regions the flood volume and flood duration increased with the increasing water level fig 11 similar findings have been revealed by luo et al 2016 who found that the adverse influence of the flood level on drainage was greater with the rising of flood level of the outer river the urban flooding was mainly caused by heavy rainfall and the reason is that rainstorm is intense and rapidly developing event which falls in flood prone areas few hours would cause flooding while river water level needs considerable time to increase which have enough time for deploy response zellou and rahali 2019 it should be noted that the pump stations play an important role in urban flood drainage systems but the efficient effect of pumping on the urban drainage decreased gradually with the increasing rainfall therefore it is inadvisable to reduce urban waterlogging simply by increasing pumping capacity the results are similar to the observation of lian et al 2013 as discussed above the design of flood defense facilities and urban drainage systems should take into account the joint impact of rainfall and river water level the risk of urban flooding was changing with climate change hence sustainable and adaptive emergency management measures should be formulated to reduce the probability of flood disasters the results can be useful for the design of water resource projects such as flood embankments and urban drainage systems and provide scientific basis for developing flood mitigation measures and risk assessment in addition the methodology of this study could be used in other cities along the yangtze river such as chongqing and nanjing that are also affected by rainfall and river water level moreover a flood risk management model needs to be established by combining the risk probability and simulations of urban flooding in the future study 6 conclusions the variation characteristics of rainfall in wuhan and river water level at hankou during the flood seasons were analyzed in this study and the joint risk probabilities during different periods were calculated using the optimal copula moreover the calibrated swmm was adopted to simulate the joint impact of rainfall river water level and pumping on urban waterlogging the main conclusions are drawn from this study i high water levels and heavy rainfall mostly occurred in june and july and the rainstorm and lowest water levels presented increasing trends during this period which resulted in an increase in the risk of urban flooding in wuhan meanwhile a strong positive dependence was found between rainfall and water level this highlighted that the probability of flooding cannot be correctly estimated by only considering the single effect of rainfall or water level in wuhan ii the joint risk probability was always larger than the exceedance probability of water level or rainfall which confirmed that the neglect of the interaction between flood drivers can lead to underestimation of the flood risks furthermore for heavy rainstorm and higher water level scenarios the joint risk probability in 2005 2020 was greater than that in 1990 2004 in which the minimum increasing rate was approximately 11 8 indicating that the joint risk increased significantly heavy rainstorm and higher water level events occurred more frequently in recent years which put forward a higher requirement for flood control and urban drainage in wuhan iii the hierarchical partition based on the spatial information method was proposed for the subcatchment generation in swmm which can improve the accuracy of the model to a certain degree by comparing it with the tyson polygon method the flood volume and flood duration would increase by about 1 7 3 7 and 0 8 1 3 respectively with the increasing water level from 21 7 m to 28 0 m and would decrease by approximately 71 3 71 9 and 58 2 58 5 with the rainfall return period decreasing from 100 yr to 5 yr and therefore the biggest threat might be caused by heavy rainfall besides the efficient effect of pumping on urban drainage gradually decreased with the increase of rainfall return period this study improves our understanding of the joint impact of rainfall and river water level on urban flooding the results can be used to provide the support for the design of water resource projects and the disaster mitigation measures of urban flooding credit authorship contribution statement xiaojie wang conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft
