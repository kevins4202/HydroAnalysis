8325,study region lake ziway sub basin central rift valley basin ethiopia study focus this study evaluated the applicability of the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp and the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex africa datasets for climate change impact assessment it also evaluated the hydrologic impact of climate change in the sub basin the hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat was forced with the climate datasets to simulate the reference and future period streamflows under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the seasonality and volumetric deviations of the average annual streamflows simulated using the climate models were used as criteria for selecting members of the ensemble new hydrological insights for the region all the climate models in the bias corrected nex gddp datasets failed to satisfy the criteria the ensemble average annual streamflows simulated using the cordex africa dataset are expected to increase towards the end of the century under both the climate scenarios however the ensemble average dry season streamflows are projected to decrease during the mid and end periods of the century the expected decreases in streamflows during the dry and pre wet seasons along with excessive abstractions of water from lake ziway would exacerbate water scarcity in the basin approaches need to be developed to capture the increase in water availability during the wet season to alleviate water scarcity during the dry season keywords climate change swat model lake ziway central rift valley basin cmip5 1 introduction the economy and livelihood of 80 population of ethiopia are strongly dependent on rainfed dominated agriculture dile et al 2013 hanjra et al 2009 the rainfed dominated farming systems are greatly influenced by climate variability in the region the drought events over the past few decades have shown the vulnerability of the country to global climate changes which is expected to exacerbate climate variability in this region although climate change is a worldwide concern its impact on hydrologic systems is affecting the agricultural sector at the regional level the anticipated increase in global and regional temperatures due to climate change is expected to increase the rate of evapotranspiration and alter precipitation patterns contributing to changes in drought and flood characteristics frederick and major 1997 lindner et al 2010 rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns as projected by climate models are expected to impact the hydrologic systems of the developing countries such as ethiopia in ethiopia the water resources of the central rift valley basin are already adversely affected by the recent human activities and climate variability musie et al 2020 the decrease in the volume of the terminal lake abiyata to about 50 of its original capacity in the past few decades is evidence of anthropogenic and climate change impacts getnet et al 2014 therefore for the sustainable management of scarce water resources it is essential to quantify the impact of future climate changes on hydrologic responses of important water bodies analysis of the impact of climate change on water resources involves hydrologic models and projected future climate variables such as precipitation and temperature from the global climate models gcms however the coarse spatial resolution approximately 100 250 km of the gcm models make them inadequate for regional studies teutschbein and seibert 2012 dynamic and statistical downscaling techniques have been used to extract high resolution regional or watershed scale climate variables from larger scale gcm outputs regional climate models rcms dynamically downscale gcm outputs to generate higher spatial resolution 25 50 km climate variables by incorporating local topographical and physical factors which make the rcm models suitable for regional hydrologic impact studies graham et al 2007 although a number of rcms have been used globally dynamic downscaling studies using rcms are few in the region of east africa endris et al 2013 an ensemble of historical and future climate projections generated by the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex is available from the world climate research program giorgi et al 2009 cordex africa http cordex org domains region 5 africa provides regionally downscaled climate data for the continent at a spatial resolution of 0 44 0 44 future projections of precipitation and temperature have been previously investigated using the cordex africa datasets dosio et al 2015 endris et al 2016 2013 nikulin et al 2012 for example simulation of east african climatology was performed by osima et al 2018 using a 25 member cordex africa rcm ensemble they showed that the warming rate of the greater horn of africa is faster than the global mean and the projected change in precipitation across the region is mostly uncertain the rainfall over the central and northern parts of ethiopia is also projected to decrease substantially both during the dry and wet periods similarly hydrologic impacts of climate changes have been evaluated using the cordex africa rcms aich et al 2016 jin et al 2018 mbaye et al 2015 oguntunde et al 2017 but most studies have been conducted on basins having larger areas even though rcms can capture local climate features which can be influenced by factors such as topography the accuracy of the precipitation estimated by rcms remains uncertain endris et al 2016 significant biases in precipitation and temperature simulated by rcms make their applicability for hydrologic studies complicated teutschbein and seibert 2012 statistical downscaling methods are being used to overcome the issue of spatial resolution and bias in climate projections for climate change impact studies at the regional and local scales recently nasa has provided a high resolution statistically downscaled and bias corrected dataset known as nasa earth exchange nex global daily downscaled projections gddp the nex gddp dataset is provided to conduct climate change impact assessment at the regional and local scales and to understand patterns of projected future climate at the watershed city and town level thrasher et al 2012 studies have been conducted to evaluate historical and future projections of climate datasets ahmadalipour et al 2017 bokhari et al 2018 chen et al 2017 raghavan et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 for example bao and wen 2017 evaluated the near and long term climate projection of china using nex gddp and concluded that this high resolution dataset has enormous potential for modern climate change impact studies jain et al 2019 also evaluated the 1975 2005 daily data of nex gddp using the india meteorological department observations and compared the dataset with cmip5 and cordex data over india they also supported the use of nex gddp datasets for regional scale climate change impact studies these studies make the nex gddp datasets a promising input for climate change impact studies in developing countries such as ethiopia where the required data for bias correction are scarcely available however it is worthwhile to note that to the best of our knowledge we are not aware of any study that has been conducted to evaluate the hydrologic impacts of climate change at the watershed scale using this dataset therefore the first objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the climate models from the cordex africa rcms and the nex gddp dataset for assessing the impact of projected climate changes on streamflows at the watershed scale the second objective was to study the impact of climate change on water resources of the lake ziway sub basin ethiopia using the soil and water assessment tool swat model 2 study area two watersheds meki and ketar of the central rift valley basin of ethiopia were considered for this study fig 1 shows the lake ziway sub basin of the central rift valley including the hydro meteorological stations and two upstream feeder rivers meki and ketar lake ziway sub basin is located between 38 12 36 e to 39 24 36 e longitude and 7 22 12 n to 8 28 12 n latitude about 165 km to the south of the capital addis ababa the meki watershed on the western side of lake ziway covers an area of about 2224 km2 a large portion of this watershed is found on the flat terrain of the rift floor the ketar watershed with a large part in the eastern mountains covers an area of about 3282 km2 the elevation of this watershed varies between 1700 m 4200 m above sea level the two opposite facing upstream watersheds are the primary sources of water for the only freshwater lake ziway among the central rift valley lakes abstractions for irrigation and domestic water supplies fish farming and the downstream demands for livestock and environmental flow to the terminal lake abiyata depend on the availability of water in lake ziway the mean annual rainfall of the basin varies from 700 mm year at the rift floor to 1200 mm year in the eastern and western mountains with an average amount of about 900 mm year over the entire basin the daily average temperature varies from 16 c to 21 c respectively at the top of the two opposite facing highlands and in the rift floor around the lake getnet et al 2014 the actual annual evapotranspiration varies from 650 mm year to 900 mm year between the low and high altitudes over the entire basin ayenew 2003 the amount of water lost annually from lake ziway due to evaporation is estimated to be about 1800 mm year vallet coulomb et al 2001 3 materials and methods 3 1 data observed meteorological data obtained from the national meteorological agency of ethiopia from nine stations located in the basin fig 1 were used for swat model calibration and validation and bias correction of the cordex africa climate projection outputs the shuttle radar topographic mission 30 m resolution digital elevation model downloaded from https earthexplorer usgs gov was used to delineate the watershed and to extract terrain specific characteristics the required soil properties derived from the harmonized world soil database of the food and agriculture organization digital soil map were downloaded from http www fao org data en land use data were reclassified from the land cover information derived from the satellite images using erdas imagine 2016 mean monthly streamflows of the two rivers meki and ketar in the basin provided by the ministry of water resources of ethiopia were used to calibrate and validate the swat model 3 2 climate change data and bias correction the rcms utilized in this study were the cordex africa runs downscaled from eight gcms of the climate model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 the latest version of the regional climate model developed by the swedish ross centre regional atmospheric model rca4 was selected for this study samuelsson et al 2011 rca4 is designed with an improved physical and energy flux parametrizations as compared to the previous versions such as rca3 strandberg et al 2015 its modified radiation scheme takes into account the absorption and equivalent concentration of carbon dioxide and also based on the recommendation of the land use information a quadrilled land surface scheme is employed with one to three key tiles tamoffo et al 2019 the spatial resolution of the cordex africa domain rca4 simulations is 0 44 0 44 approximately 50 km 50 km the simulations cover the period from 1951 to 2100 which is divided into a historical period from 1951 to 2005 and future projection from 2006 to 2100 details of the rca4 simulations used and evaluated in this study are given in table 1 climate model data for hydrologic modeling cmhyd was used to extract and bias correct the rca4 model outputs and provide climate data for the swat model rathjens et al 2016 precipitation and temperature data were bias corrected using the distribution mapping method available in the cmhyd software temperature and precipitation data measured at the nine gauging stations in the sub basin were used for the bias correction of the rca4 climate data the nex gddp dataset evaluated in this study is a high resolution 0 25 0 25 bias corrected and statistically downscaled daily data available for the entire globe since june 2015 thrasher et al 2012 datasets of 21 models under cmip5 were generated by downscaling coarser resolution gcms bias corrected spatial disaggregation bcsd method thrasher et al 2012 2013 wood et al 2004 2002 was applied to correct the bias using the gridded global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd of the terrestrial hydrology research group at the princeton university sheffield et al 2006 the bcsd method compares the historical period 1950 2005 gcm simulations with the gmfd data based on quantile mapping the obtained correlations are then used to bias correct future projections 2006 2099 bilinear interpolation technique and scaling factors are used to further disaggregate the bias corrected coarse resolution gcms to a 0 25 0 25 resolution mandapaka and lo 2018 more details about nex gddp and the bcsd method used to generate the datasets are provided in thrasher et al 2012 the future projections of the nex gddp datasets are available for two representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 meinshausen et al 2011 the rcp 4 5 corresponds to intermediate emissions and a low stabilization scenario where the radiative forcing is 4 5 w m2 at the end of the 21st century the rcp 8 5 represents a high end emission scenario with the radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 above the pre industrial level by the year 2100 due to an increase in greenhouse gases stocker et al 2013 historical and future projections for the eight selected out of the available 21 models in the nex gddp dataset same models as the cordex africa rca4 models were extracted for this study from https cds nccs nasa gov nex gddp 3 3 model evaluation and selection the evaluation of climate change datasets for watershed or regional scale hydrologic impact studies includes a mixture of both subjective and objective components the choice of criteria and threshold values are subjective while the analysis of performance criteria remains objective liersch et al 2018 the climate variables from the cordex africa rca4 models and nex gddp datasets were first compared to the reference meteorological observations the reference 1985 2005 and future period 2040 2059 and 2080 2099 streamflows were then simulated for all the climate datasets using the swat model and compared to the streamflows simulated using the observed meteorological data hydrologic evaluation of the climate datasets was based on performance indicators used in similar studies in which the main objective was to study the impact of climate change on hydrology elshamy et al 2012 liersch et al 2018 the percentage bias pbias coefficient of determination r2 correlation coefficient correl standard deviation sd and the normalized sd of discrepancies sdd were used to compare the reference period average annual streamflows simulated using the climate datasets against the streamflows simulated using the observed meteorological data 1 p b i a s i 1 n q s i m i q r e f i 100 i 1 n q r e f i 2 r 2 1 i 1 n q s i m i q r e f i 1 n q r e f i q r e f 2 3 s d d s d q s i m i q r e f i s d q r e f where qsimi is the streamflow simulated using the climate datasets and qrefi is the streamflow simulated using the observed meteorological data the possibility of unexpected future estimations of climate variables is very high when a climate model requires bias correction therefore in addition to the reference period changes in pbias of the streamflows simulated for the future period as compared to the reference period streamflows were also used as a criterion for evaluating the selected models future performance it is important to note that the values of the thresholds used for the requirements mentioned above are entirely subjective and dependent on the simulation outputs of the models in addition to the evaluation and comparison of the impacts of the cordex africa rcms and nex gddp climate projections on future streamflows threshold values were used to further categorize and select the climate models from both datasets since the main objective of this study was to assess the impact of climate change on water resources of the study area climate models that can satisfy the following criteria liersch et al 2018 were selected and the ensemble average was used for further analysis the reference period average annual streamflow simulated by a model must satisfy the seasonality requirement with r2 0 70 if a model fails to fulfill this it is assumed as inferior the volumetric deviation of the reference period average annual streamflow simulated by a model must not exceed a pbias of 25 the volumetric change in the average annual streamflow simulated by a model for the near future period rcp8 5 compared to the reference period should not exceed 30 climate models meeting the above criteria were assumed to be suitable as members of the ensemble for the analysis of the impact of climate change on hydrology an ensemble mean of streamflows and other water balance components simulated using the selected climate models were used to assess the projected impacts of climate change on the water resources of the lake ziway sub basin 3 4 hydrological modelling 3 4 1 swat model setup an arcgis interface arc swat 2012 model developed by the united states department of agriculture was used for hydrologic modeling swat is a physically based semi distributed and continuous simulation hydrologic model arnold et al 1998 which can be used to evaluate the impacts of different land management practices and climate changes on water quantity and quality the model can be applied to study large complex watersheds neitsch et al 2011 in the swat model a basin is divided into several sub basins which are further sub divided into hydrologic response units hrus a water balance equation is used to simulate the hydrologic cycle and to predict hydrologic responses in each hru monthly streamflow data of meki and ketar rivers for the period from 1980 to 1993 were used to evaluate the model performance for both watersheds the first two years were taken as the warm up period of the model to minimize the effect of parameter values provided by the users on the output neupane et al 2015 3 4 2 swat calibration and validation the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup was used to calibrate the swat model and to identify the sensitive parameters swat cup is an auto calibration and uncertainty analysis tool with four built in analysis algorithms abbaspour et al 2007 the commonly used algorithm the parallel sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 was selected for this study based on the availability of continuous observed streamflow data the periods from 1982 to 1986 and from 1987 to 1991 respectively were used for model calibration and validation of the meki watershed similarly the period from 1985 to 1989 was taken as calibration and from 1991 to 1993 as the validation period for the ketar watershed nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the ratio of mean square error to the standard deviation of the measured data rsr eqs 4 6 were used to assess the hydrologic performance of the swat model 4 n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 o i o 2 5 p b i a s i 1 n o i s i 100

the climate variables from the meteorological data and the historical simulations of the climate models for the reference period 1985 2005 the near future 2040 2059 period streamflow was simulated using the climate models from the cordex africa rca4 rcms and nex gddp datasets to evaluate how the climate models perform in the near future the calibrated swat model was also run using the climate variables from the selected climate models to assess the impact of climate change on the hydrologic responses of the near future 2040 2059 and end of the century 2080 2099 periods 4 results 4 1 hydrologic model calibration and validation the semi distributed swat hydrologic model was calibrated and validated for the two streamflow gauges meki and ketar river gauging stations in the lake ziway sub basin as shown in fig 2 the model was able to simulate monthly streamflows with the goodness of fit values of nse 0 75 pbias 7 6 and rsr 0 50 for the calibration and nse 0 70 pbias 0 08 and rsr 0 55 for the validation periods respectively for the meki watershed fig 3 shows that the model was able to simulate streamflows from the ketar watershed with higher values of goodness of fit parameters nse 0 83 pbias 7 1 and rsr 0 41 for the calibration and nse 0 75 pbias 5 02 and rsr 0 50 for the validation periods similarly desta and lemma 2017 have also evaluated the hydrological applicability of the swat model in the same sub basin and found that the model was able to simulate streamflows which are in a very good and satisfactory to very good agreement with the observed discharges in ketar and meki watersheds respectively the swat cup was applied to perform a global sensitivity analysis of the parameters used for the calibration of the swat model the results showed that cn2 hru slp esco rchrg dp alpha bnk sol awc epco revapmn and biomix were sensitive parameters for the calibration of streamflows table 2 the overall calibration and validation analysis of the swat model in both watersheds showed that the model could be applied for further study of climate change impact assessments 4 2 climate model performance 4 2 1 precipitation performance the daily precipitation simulations of the climate models from the cordex africa rcms and nex gddp datasets were averaged over the basin area and their performances were evaluated using statistical parameters the average number of days per year with precipitation higher than 1 mm ndays 1 mm average and maximum daily rainfalls during the reference period avg and max respectively and standard deviation sd were the parameters used for the evaluation table 3 shows the absolute values and differences from the meteorological observations of these parameters all of the cordex africa rcms bias corrected using the meteorological observation and the nex gddp datasets except canesm2 underestimated number of rainy days although the differences in values to the gauge observation were considerably small almost all the cordex africa rcms underestimated average daily precipitation however for the same period all nex gddp datasets showed overestimation all the climate model datasets from both the sources overestimated maximum daily rainfalls and standard deviations as compared to the observed data the models performed almost similarly as far as standard deviation was concerned however the values of the average maximum daily precipitation of the cordex africa rcms were higher than the nex gddp datasets the regional climate models such as gfdl esm2m rca4 and ipsl cm5a mr rca4 resulted in extremely high values of the average maximum daily precipitation the box plots in fig 4 show the distribution of the wet season and annual rainfall estimated by the climate models and the observed meteorological data for the reference period the deviations of the average yearly and wet season precipitations simulated by the rcms and nex gddp datasets compared to the meteorological data are also shown almost all the nex gddp datasets resulted in high variability of both the wet season and annual average precipitation however the variability is more for models ipsl cm5a mr gfdl esm2m and noresm1 m on the other hand the variabilities of miroc5 rca4 and csiro mk3 6 0 rca4 are relatively high among the rcms the deviations of the average wet season precipitations simulated by all the rcms were less than 5 except gfdl esm2m rca4 similarly the average annual rainfall simulated by only two rcms ipsl cm5a mr rca4 and gfdl esm2m rca4 deviated by more than 5 from the meteorological data two rcms differed from the average annual precipitation and six rcms from the wet season average rainfalls by a value of less than 2 however among the nex gddp datasets only the gfdl esm2m model deviated by less than 10 both for the average wet season and annual precipitations except for noresm1 m which also varied by less than 10 for the wet season all the remaining models deviated by more than 10 for both the seasonal and annual precipitations the ipsl cm5a mr model varied by 27 3 and 42 6 for the average yearly and wet season precipitations respectively 4 2 2 performance of average monthly streamflow hydrologic evaluations of the climate models were performed in ketar and meki watersheds of the lake ziway sub basin analysis results from the ketar watershed are presented in fig 5 to 10 and those of the meki watershed are attached as a supplementary document the performance of the rcms and nex gddp datasets in simulating average monthly streamflows varied quite considerably for both the watersheds figs 5 and s1 show the comparison of the reference period streamflow hydrographs simulated by the member models of both the rcms and nex gddp datasets statistical performance indicators were used to compare the streamflow simulated using observed meteorological data to the streamflows simulated using the climate models all the streamflow simulations using nex gddp datasets overestimated the average annual streamflows with high positive pbias values figs 5 and s1 in both the watersheds ipsl cm5a mr shows the most substantial deviations with pbias of 151 3 and 209 9 for the ketar and meki watersheds respectively however all the rcms resulted in reasonable streamflow simulations with small positive and negative pbias all the models deviated by less than 15 for the meki watershed and csiro mk3 6 0 rca4 ipsl cm5a mr rca4 and gfdl esm2m rca4 varied by more than 15 for the ketar watershed all the rcms were able to represent seasonal streamflow patterns for both watersheds with r2 values greater than 0 70 the seasonal streamflow representations of nex gddp datasets for the ketar watershed were also good with r2 higher than the assumed threshold value except for the gfdl esm2m model the streamflows simulated using all the nex gddp datasets were inadequate with minimal r2 for the meki watershed however the representations of most of the rcms were adequate for the ketar watershed it is important to note that although the seasonal representation of models such as ipsl cm5a mr r2 0 85 is adequate in the case of ketar watershed the deviation of streamflows simulated by the model is very high it shows that the values of a single statistical parameter might lead to a wrong conclusion hence a combination of parameters is required to be assessed figs 6 and s2 show the taylor diagrams taylor 2001 of the average monthly streamflows of the ketar and meki watersheds respectively it helps in visualizing climate models performances in a single plot the three indicators used to identify outliers are the standard deviation sd the normalized standard deviations of discrepancies sdd and correlation coefficients between the streamflows simulated using observed data and climate model projections the reference streamflow simulated using observed meteorological data is represented by points 1 0 and 0 0 on the x axis and y axis respectively it shows that the values of the correlation coefficient and sd of a model that performs as good as the reference dataset are expected to be closer to 1 0 however the sdd of the model is required to be nearly zero from fig 6 it can be observed that almost all the rcms have lower sd than the reference dataset and the sds of only three of the rcms deviate more than 0 50 from the standardized reference dataset for the ketar watershed however all the nex gddp datasets have higher sd than the reference and except canesm2 all are outliers of the 0 50 line of sdd for the meki watershed almost all the rcms performed well with higher correlation coefficient and deviations of sds from the standardized reference dataset by less than 0 50 fig s2 however all the nex gddp datasets are far outliers of the 0 50 value sdd line with a lower correlation coefficient less than 0 8 4 3 climate model ensemble the performances of the streamflow simulations of the rcms and nex gddp datasets were evaluated using r2 pbias and rate of volumetric changes as summarized in table 4 figs 7 and s3 also show the changes in average monthly streamflows between the reference period and the mid century 2040 2059 projections under the rcp 8 5 climate models that can satisfy these criteria on both the watersheds are assumed to be qualified members of the ensemble the standard set to assess the models ability to represent the seasonality of the streamflow r2 0 70 was achieved by all the models except the gfdl esm2m nex gddp for the ketar watershed however only the rcms were able to satisfy this criterion in the case of the meki watershed the volumetric deviation criterion i e pbias 25 was well represented by six out of eight rcms for the ketar and all the rcms for the meki watersheds all the nex gddp datasets failed to meet this criterion for both the watersheds therefore only six rcms out of the sixteen models passed the requirements set for the evaluation of the reference period streamflow simulation however the mpi esm lr rca4 was also omitted from the selection because it projected a considerable change in future average annual streamflow for the ketar watershed as shown on the selection column of table 4 only five rcms fulfilled all the performance criteria and got selected as a member of the ensemble the ensemble consists of canesm2 rca4 cnrm cm5 rca4 ipsl cm5a mr rca4 miroc5 rca4 and noresm1 m rca4 from the rcms 4 4 climate change impact analysis 4 4 1 changes in projected temperature and precipitation the average monthly mean temperature and precipitation projected by the selected climate models for the historical near future and end of the century periods were compared to the base period observed data as shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively under both the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios all the selected climate models agree on the rise of temperature over the sub basin during the mid and end period of the century the canesm2 and ipsl cm5a mr models projected higher temperatures than the other rcms the lake ziway sub basin is expected to have higher temperature rises in the dry from december to march and wet from june to september seasons than the pre wet and post wet seasons in terms of the projected precipitation all the models agree on the decrease in precipitation during the mid of the century under both the rcps cnrm cm5 model projects the driest condition for all the months with the wet season delayed by almost one month similarly during the end of the century precipitation is projected to decrease but with some exceptional very high rainfall events the canesm2 and miroc5 models project relatively heavier average monthly precipitation during the pre wet season months march and may noresm1 m model projects higher mean monthly precipitation 290 mm in june under both the scenarios and lower precipitation during the other seasons similarly the ipsl cm5a mr model projects the highest mean monthly precipitation nearly 300 mm in august under the rcp 8 5 4 4 2 climate change impacts on streamflow climate change and human induced factors can affect various components of a water balance that result in changes in streamflow of a river hence changes in streamflow are expected in both the watersheds following the change in climate under the two rcp scenarios the selected models in the previous section were used with the calibrated swat model to simulate the projected streamflows during the mid and end of the century the hydrologic impacts of the changes in climate were assessed in both ketar and meki watersheds separately figs 10 and s4 show the ensemble average monthly streamflows and the rate of changes in the annual and seasonal ensemble average streamflows between the reference and the future periods under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for both the watersheds an increase in streamflow is projected to be maximal during the wet season under both the rcp scenarios however the decrease in streamflow is projected to be maximal during the dry season under rcp 4 5 and pre wet season under rcp 8 5 the expected reduction in the amount of streamflow during both the dry and pre wet seasons can affect the management of the scarcely available water resource in the basin the average annual streamflow is expected to increase by 62 0 and 26 3 under rcp 4 5 and 74 2 and 51 4 under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century for the ketar and meki watersheds respectively for the ketar watershed the reference and mid of the century periods are expected to have similar timing to peak flow under both the rcp scenarios however it is likely to shift ahead under rcp 4 5 and be delayed under rcp 8 5 by a few days for the meki watershed under rcp 4 5 it is expected to be similar during the mid of the century and shift ahead by almost one month during the end of the century under rcp 8 5 the mid and end of the century peaks are expected to move forward by a few days the increase in average monthly streamflow and shifting of the timing to peak during the future periods is due to the changes in precipitation and temperature the intra annual variations in the average monthly streamflow between the reference period and future projections were also analyzed using the box whisker plots shown in figs 11 and s5 under both rcp scenarios the 75 percentile and the median flows of ketar watershed are projected to increase in july and august during the mid of the century however the streamflows are projected to decrease in april and may at the end of the century the flows are expected to increase in the pre wet season months february to may and the 25 percentile flows are also likely to increase in the wet season months june to september under both the climate scenarios the variations in streamflow are projected to be maximal in june and august under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for the meki watershed insignificant changes in streamflow are expected during the mid of the century under both the climate scenarios however the projected streamflows during the end of the century are expected to increase in the wet season with high variations in june and september under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively 4 4 3 climate change impacts on water balance components the impacts of climate change on different water balance components were also analyzed using the simulated average monthly streamflow for the two climate change scenarios variations in the average annual precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff and water yield between the reference and future period projections were estimated for both the watersheds as shown in figs 12 and s6 for the ketar watershed the ensemble average shows a marginal decrease in the average annual precipitation by 6 9 and 9 4 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively towards the mid of the century however it was estimated to increase by 6 4 under rcp 4 5 and decrease by 3 5 under rcp 8 5 towards the end of the century marginal decreases in evapotranspiration are also expected during the mid and end of the century 9 7 and 9 2 respectively under rcp 4 5 and 12 3 and 12 7 respectively rcp 8 5 although the average annual precipitations show a marginal decrease towards the mid of the century under both the rcps due to reductions in evapotranspiration surface runoff is estimated to increase marginally by 12 6 and 12 7 respectively similarly water yield is also estimated to increase by 10 6 and 10 3 respectively both components of the water balance are also expected to be affected considerably following the change in climate towards the end of the century surface runoff is estimated to increase by 67 3 and 50 4 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively when the water yield is expected to increase by 63 4 and 45 1 respectively in the case of the meki watershed the average annual precipitation is estimated to decrease significantly under both climate change scenarios under rcp 4 5 it is expected to reduce by 42 5 and 32 8 towards the mid and end of the century respectively under rcp 8 5 the rate of decrease is estimated to be 42 1 and 25 6 during the middle and end of the century respectively similarly under both the rcps significant decreases in evapotranspiration is also projected in the future during the mid of the century et is expected to decrease by 42 8 and 43 3 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively it is also simulated to reduce towards the end of the century by 41 3 and 37 2 respectively following the decrease in precipitation under both the rcps marginal and significant reduction in surface runoff are also projected towards the end and mid of the century respectively however marginal decrease under rcp 4 5 and increase under rcp 8 5 in water yield are estimated during the middle of the century while it is expected to increase towards the end of the century by 28 2 and 53 1 respectively the estimated increasing pattern of the surface runoff and water yield while the average annual precipitations were decreasing is attributed to the projected heavy daily precipitation events by some of the ensemble model members fig 9 as shown in figs 10 and s4 the projected ensemble average annual streamflows are expected to have high peak discharges the heavier precipitation events resulted in higher surface runoff while the rate of evapotranspiration decreased following the decrease in average annual precipitation 5 discussions climate variability and over exploitations of water following the increase in human activities have considerably impacted the scarcely available water resources in the central rift valley basin the reductions of the outflow from lake ziway through bulbula river and the continuous decline in the level of the downstream terminal lake abiyata are the apparent symptoms of the natural and human induced impacts getnet et al 2014 climate change is also expected to affect the planning and management of water resources in this area the assessment of climate change impacts on water resources involves downscaling of gcms bias correction of the simulated climate variables and application of a hydrologic model observed meteorological data are required to get the best out of the bias correction of the projected climate variables unavailability of long period observations has a significant impact on climate change studies in data sparse regions of countries such as ethiopia the idea behind the provision of the high resolution statistically downscaled and bias corrected nex gddp dataset is to facilitate climate change impact assessments at regional scales such as small watersheds and cities thrasher et al 2012 in this study we selected sixteen climate models from the nex gddp datasets and cordex africa rcms to evaluate their applicability for climate change impact assessment in the lake ziway sub basin the precipitation and hydrologic performances of the models were compared to the reference data the rcms were bias corrected using the meteorological data observed in the basin while the bias corrected nex gddp datasets were used directly to evaluate their applicability in the regions where there is no observed meteorological data in hydrologic modeling and assessment of global change impacts on water resources using models such as swat the accuracy of precipitation estimations plays an important role musie et al 2019 sorooshian et al 2011 the statistical performances of the average daily precipitation of the climate models showed that out of 16 models 15 underestimated the numbers of rainy days and all the models considerably overestimated maximum daily rainfalls the performance of the nex gddp datasets is better than the rcms bias corrected using the observed reference data liersch et al 2018 also evaluated the impact of bias correction on the daily precipitation performances of earth system models esms and rcms in the upper blue nile they found that bias correction was partially successful by improving the number of rainy days but not the daily precipitation maxima however bias correction was not successful in improving both the number of rainy days and the maximum precipitations of the rcms in our study although the bias correction was unable to improve the average daily precipitation performances of the rcms the seasonal and annual precipitation performances showed significant improvement only two models out of eight marginally deviated by more than 5 from the observed seasonal and annual average precipitation however despite the better daily precipitation performance of the climate models from the nex gddp datasets their seasonal and yearly precipitation performances were unsatisfactory the seasonal and annual precipitation showed high variability and all the models considerably deviated from the reference data by more than 10 it shows that better precipitation performance at a daily time scale may not guarantee the same for the seasonal or yearly average precipitation performance the unsatisfactory precipitation performance of the nex gddp datasets might be attributed to the areal accuracy of the gmfd data used for bias correction of the models the seasonal and annual precipitation performances of the nex gddp datasets also propagated to the hydrological simulations on both the watersheds the average monthly streamflow simulated using all the eight models resulted in significant volumetric deviations although the seasonality representations of the models were suitable for the ketar watershed the same result was not obtained for the relatively flat terrain meki watershed the hydrologic performance gets worst for the streamflow projections simulated for the future period under rcp 8 5 as a result not a single model from the nex gddp datasets was able to satisfy the criteria set for the selection of the climate model according to raghavan et al 2018 the nex gddp datasets evaluated over southeast asia were able to capture only the monthly scale observed statistics but not the daily level they also suggested in depth scrutiny before using the daily scale data for impact studies therefore the poor hydrologic performance of our research is also attributed to the poor precipitation performances of the datasets used for the swat modeling the volumetric deviations and seasonality of the average monthly streamflow simulated using most of the rcms were within the acceptable range in both watersheds for the meki watershed only one out of the eight models failed to satisfy the criterion set for the rate of volumetric change of the streamflow projected for the near future while only three models were unable to meet all the standards for the ketar watershed and hence could not be selected as the members of the ensemble although the daily precipitation performances of the rcms overestimated maximum precipitations and underestimated the number of rainy days the fewer variabilities and deviations of the annual and seasonal rainfalls resulted in streamflows which were in agreement with the simulations using observed data teutschbein and seibert 2012 evaluated different bias correction methods of rcms for the assessment of the hydrologic impact of climate change they concluded that hydrological simulations using bias corrected rcms are in good agreement with the observed values than the simulations driven with uncorrected rcms the better hydrologic performance of the rcms in our study was also related to the bias correction of the models using the observed meteorological data because of the limited climate change impact study downscaling approaches and difference of climate models used in the region validation with other studies is difficult gadissa et al 2019 showed an estimated decrease in streamflow in the central rift valley basin during the period 2040 2070 to be 26 9 and 15 8 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively the ensemble annual average streamflow in our study during the mid century is also estimated to decrease under both the rcp scenarios in the meki watershed however the flow is expected to increase during the end of the century under both scenarios the projected streamflow for the higher elevation ketar watershed is estimated to increase during both the mid and end of the century under the two rcps although the wet season average streamflow is estimated to increase in both watershed the projected dry season streamflow is expected to decrease under both the climate scenarios and during both the mid and end periods of the century the simulated decrease in streamflow during the dry season is expected to significantly escalate the conflict related to the use of the scarcely available water resource in the basin 6 conclusions climate change impact is expected to be one of the critical challenges for the management of the scarcely available water resources in the central rift valley basin in this study we evaluated the applicability of the nex gddp datasets and cordex africa regional climate models for climate impact studies in the basin two climate change scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were considered for the mid and end periods of the century we also selected climate models based on the criteria set for hydrologic evaluations of the reference period and future projected streamflows the ultimate goal of our research was to study the impacts of climate change on the water resources of lake ziway sub basin using an ensemble average of the selected climate models the following is a summary of our findings 1 the overall performance of the climate models from the high resolution nex gddp datasets in our study was unsatisfactory the seasonality and volumetric deviations of the average annual streamflow simulated using these models were not within the acceptable limits of the criteria used for the evaluation therefore these datasets need a deep inspection for further use in climate change impact studies in countries such as ethiopia 2 the majority of the rcms bias corrected using the observed meteorological data were able to fulfill the criteria set for the hydrological evaluation of the climate models in both the watersheds it shows that the rcms from cordex africa have the potential to be used for climate change impact studies at the regional and watershed scales in countries with varying topography such as ethiopia better results from these models can be achieved using the right method and observed climate data for bias correction 3 the ensemble average annual streamflow of the sub basin is expected to increase during the end of the century following the projected increase in the wet season average streamflow under both the rcps however it will decrease in the meki watershed and increase in the ketar watershed during the mid of the century therefore minimal changes in the average annual streamflows in lake ziway sub basin is expected during the mid period of the century because of the increasing and decreasing trends in streamflows from the two rivers 4 the ensemble average dry season from october to january streamflow of the basin is projected to have a decreasing trend during both the mid and end periods of the century under both the climate scenarios the pre wet season streamflow is also expected to decrease during the mid of the century under both the rcps the decrease in streamflow is also likely to have a considerable impact on the scarcely available water in the system 5 finally we note that the climate model evaluation results of this study can be used for climate impact studies in other regions of ethiopia having similar topographic and climate characteristics we also recommend further studies of the optimal allocation and planning of the water resources of lake ziway taking into consideration projected changes in streamflow following the impacts of climate changes to support decision makers declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

8325,study region lake ziway sub basin central rift valley basin ethiopia study focus this study evaluated the applicability of the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp and the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex africa datasets for climate change impact assessment it also evaluated the hydrologic impact of climate change in the sub basin the hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat was forced with the climate datasets to simulate the reference and future period streamflows under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the seasonality and volumetric deviations of the average annual streamflows simulated using the climate models were used as criteria for selecting members of the ensemble new hydrological insights for the region all the climate models in the bias corrected nex gddp datasets failed to satisfy the criteria the ensemble average annual streamflows simulated using the cordex africa dataset are expected to increase towards the end of the century under both the climate scenarios however the ensemble average dry season streamflows are projected to decrease during the mid and end periods of the century the expected decreases in streamflows during the dry and pre wet seasons along with excessive abstractions of water from lake ziway would exacerbate water scarcity in the basin approaches need to be developed to capture the increase in water availability during the wet season to alleviate water scarcity during the dry season keywords climate change swat model lake ziway central rift valley basin cmip5 1 introduction the economy and livelihood of 80 population of ethiopia are strongly dependent on rainfed dominated agriculture dile et al 2013 hanjra et al 2009 the rainfed dominated farming systems are greatly influenced by climate variability in the region the drought events over the past few decades have shown the vulnerability of the country to global climate changes which is expected to exacerbate climate variability in this region although climate change is a worldwide concern its impact on hydrologic systems is affecting the agricultural sector at the regional level the anticipated increase in global and regional temperatures due to climate change is expected to increase the rate of evapotranspiration and alter precipitation patterns contributing to changes in drought and flood characteristics frederick and major 1997 lindner et al 2010 rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns as projected by climate models are expected to impact the hydrologic systems of the developing countries such as ethiopia in ethiopia the water resources of the central rift valley basin are already adversely affected by the recent human activities and climate variability musie et al 2020 the decrease in the volume of the terminal lake abiyata to about 50 of its original capacity in the past few decades is evidence of anthropogenic and climate change impacts getnet et al 2014 therefore for the sustainable management of scarce water resources it is essential to quantify the impact of future climate changes on hydrologic responses of important water bodies analysis of the impact of climate change on water resources involves hydrologic models and projected future climate variables such as precipitation and temperature from the global climate models gcms however the coarse spatial resolution approximately 100 250 km of the gcm models make them inadequate for regional studies teutschbein and seibert 2012 dynamic and statistical downscaling techniques have been used to extract high resolution regional or watershed scale climate variables from larger scale gcm outputs regional climate models rcms dynamically downscale gcm outputs to generate higher spatial resolution 25 50 km climate variables by incorporating local topographical and physical factors which make the rcm models suitable for regional hydrologic impact studies graham et al 2007 although a number of rcms have been used globally dynamic downscaling studies using rcms are few in the region of east africa endris et al 2013 an ensemble of historical and future climate projections generated by the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex is available from the world climate research program giorgi et al 2009 cordex africa http cordex org domains region 5 africa provides regionally downscaled climate data for the continent at a spatial resolution of 0 44 0 44 future projections of precipitation and temperature have been previously investigated using the cordex africa datasets dosio et al 2015 endris et al 2016 2013 nikulin et al 2012 for example simulation of east african climatology was performed by osima et al 2018 using a 25 member cordex africa rcm ensemble they showed that the warming rate of the greater horn of africa is faster than the global mean and the projected change in precipitation across the region is mostly uncertain the rainfall over the central and northern parts of ethiopia is also projected to decrease substantially both during the dry and wet periods similarly hydrologic impacts of climate changes have been evaluated using the cordex africa rcms aich et al 2016 jin et al 2018 mbaye et al 2015 oguntunde et al 2017 but most studies have been conducted on basins having larger areas even though rcms can capture local climate features which can be influenced by factors such as topography the accuracy of the precipitation estimated by rcms remains uncertain endris et al 2016 significant biases in precipitation and temperature simulated by rcms make their applicability for hydrologic studies complicated teutschbein and seibert 2012 statistical downscaling methods are being used to overcome the issue of spatial resolution and bias in climate projections for climate change impact studies at the regional and local scales recently nasa has provided a high resolution statistically downscaled and bias corrected dataset known as nasa earth exchange nex global daily downscaled projections gddp the nex gddp dataset is provided to conduct climate change impact assessment at the regional and local scales and to understand patterns of projected future climate at the watershed city and town level thrasher et al 2012 studies have been conducted to evaluate historical and future projections of climate datasets ahmadalipour et al 2017 bokhari et al 2018 chen et al 2017 raghavan et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 for example bao and wen 2017 evaluated the near and long term climate projection of china using nex gddp and concluded that this high resolution dataset has enormous potential for modern climate change impact studies jain et al 2019 also evaluated the 1975 2005 daily data of nex gddp using the india meteorological department observations and compared the dataset with cmip5 and cordex data over india they also supported the use of nex gddp datasets for regional scale climate change impact studies these studies make the nex gddp datasets a promising input for climate change impact studies in developing countries such as ethiopia where the required data for bias correction are scarcely available however it is worthwhile to note that to the best of our knowledge we are not aware of any study that has been conducted to evaluate the hydrologic impacts of climate change at the watershed scale using this dataset therefore the first objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the climate models from the cordex africa rcms and the nex gddp dataset for assessing the impact of projected climate changes on streamflows at the watershed scale the second objective was to study the impact of climate change on water resources of the lake ziway sub basin ethiopia using the soil and water assessment tool swat model 2 study area two watersheds meki and ketar of the central rift valley basin of ethiopia were considered for this study fig 1 shows the lake ziway sub basin of the central rift valley including the hydro meteorological stations and two upstream feeder rivers meki and ketar lake ziway sub basin is located between 38 12 36 e to 39 24 36 e longitude and 7 22 12 n to 8 28 12 n latitude about 165 km to the south of the capital addis ababa the meki watershed on the western side of lake ziway covers an area of about 2224 km2 a large portion of this watershed is found on the flat terrain of the rift floor the ketar watershed with a large part in the eastern mountains covers an area of about 3282 km2 the elevation of this watershed varies between 1700 m 4200 m above sea level the two opposite facing upstream watersheds are the primary sources of water for the only freshwater lake ziway among the central rift valley lakes abstractions for irrigation and domestic water supplies fish farming and the downstream demands for livestock and environmental flow to the terminal lake abiyata depend on the availability of water in lake ziway the mean annual rainfall of the basin varies from 700 mm year at the rift floor to 1200 mm year in the eastern and western mountains with an average amount of about 900 mm year over the entire basin the daily average temperature varies from 16 c to 21 c respectively at the top of the two opposite facing highlands and in the rift floor around the lake getnet et al 2014 the actual annual evapotranspiration varies from 650 mm year to 900 mm year between the low and high altitudes over the entire basin ayenew 2003 the amount of water lost annually from lake ziway due to evaporation is estimated to be about 1800 mm year vallet coulomb et al 2001 3 materials and methods 3 1 data observed meteorological data obtained from the national meteorological agency of ethiopia from nine stations located in the basin fig 1 were used for swat model calibration and validation and bias correction of the cordex africa climate projection outputs the shuttle radar topographic mission 30 m resolution digital elevation model downloaded from https earthexplorer usgs gov was used to delineate the watershed and to extract terrain specific characteristics the required soil properties derived from the harmonized world soil database of the food and agriculture organization digital soil map were downloaded from http www fao org data en land use data were reclassified from the land cover information derived from the satellite images using erdas imagine 2016 mean monthly streamflows of the two rivers meki and ketar in the basin provided by the ministry of water resources of ethiopia were used to calibrate and validate the swat model 3 2 climate change data and bias correction the rcms utilized in this study were the cordex africa runs downscaled from eight gcms of the climate model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 the latest version of the regional climate model developed by the swedish ross centre regional atmospheric model rca4 was selected for this study samuelsson et al 2011 rca4 is designed with an improved physical and energy flux parametrizations as compared to the previous versions such as rca3 strandberg et al 2015 its modified radiation scheme takes into account the absorption and equivalent concentration of carbon dioxide and also based on the recommendation of the land use information a quadrilled land surface scheme is employed with one to three key tiles tamoffo et al 2019 the spatial resolution of the cordex africa domain rca4 simulations is 0 44 0 44 approximately 50 km 50 km the simulations cover the period from 1951 to 2100 which is divided into a historical period from 1951 to 2005 and future projection from 2006 to 2100 details of the rca4 simulations used and evaluated in this study are given in table 1 climate model data for hydrologic modeling cmhyd was used to extract and bias correct the rca4 model outputs and provide climate data for the swat model rathjens et al 2016 precipitation and temperature data were bias corrected using the distribution mapping method available in the cmhyd software temperature and precipitation data measured at the nine gauging stations in the sub basin were used for the bias correction of the rca4 climate data the nex gddp dataset evaluated in this study is a high resolution 0 25 0 25 bias corrected and statistically downscaled daily data available for the entire globe since june 2015 thrasher et al 2012 datasets of 21 models under cmip5 were generated by downscaling coarser resolution gcms bias corrected spatial disaggregation bcsd method thrasher et al 2012 2013 wood et al 2004 2002 was applied to correct the bias using the gridded global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd of the terrestrial hydrology research group at the princeton university sheffield et al 2006 the bcsd method compares the historical period 1950 2005 gcm simulations with the gmfd data based on quantile mapping the obtained correlations are then used to bias correct future projections 2006 2099 bilinear interpolation technique and scaling factors are used to further disaggregate the bias corrected coarse resolution gcms to a 0 25 0 25 resolution mandapaka and lo 2018 more details about nex gddp and the bcsd method used to generate the datasets are provided in thrasher et al 2012 the future projections of the nex gddp datasets are available for two representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 meinshausen et al 2011 the rcp 4 5 corresponds to intermediate emissions and a low stabilization scenario where the radiative forcing is 4 5 w m2 at the end of the 21st century the rcp 8 5 represents a high end emission scenario with the radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 above the pre industrial level by the year 2100 due to an increase in greenhouse gases stocker et al 2013 historical and future projections for the eight selected out of the available 21 models in the nex gddp dataset same models as the cordex africa rca4 models were extracted for this study from https cds nccs nasa gov nex gddp 3 3 model evaluation and selection the evaluation of climate change datasets for watershed or regional scale hydrologic impact studies includes a mixture of both subjective and objective components the choice of criteria and threshold values are subjective while the analysis of performance criteria remains objective liersch et al 2018 the climate variables from the cordex africa rca4 models and nex gddp datasets were first compared to the reference meteorological observations the reference 1985 2005 and future period 2040 2059 and 2080 2099 streamflows were then simulated for all the climate datasets using the swat model and compared to the streamflows simulated using the observed meteorological data hydrologic evaluation of the climate datasets was based on performance indicators used in similar studies in which the main objective was to study the impact of climate change on hydrology elshamy et al 2012 liersch et al 2018 the percentage bias pbias coefficient of determination r2 correlation coefficient correl standard deviation sd and the normalized sd of discrepancies sdd were used to compare the reference period average annual streamflows simulated using the climate datasets against the streamflows simulated using the observed meteorological data 1 p b i a s i 1 n q s i m i q r e f i 100 i 1 n q r e f i 2 r 2 1 i 1 n q s i m i q r e f i 1 n q r e f i q r e f 2 3 s d d s d q s i m i q r e f i s d q r e f where qsimi is the streamflow simulated using the climate datasets and qrefi is the streamflow simulated using the observed meteorological data the possibility of unexpected future estimations of climate variables is very high when a climate model requires bias correction therefore in addition to the reference period changes in pbias of the streamflows simulated for the future period as compared to the reference period streamflows were also used as a criterion for evaluating the selected models future performance it is important to note that the values of the thresholds used for the requirements mentioned above are entirely subjective and dependent on the simulation outputs of the models in addition to the evaluation and comparison of the impacts of the cordex africa rcms and nex gddp climate projections on future streamflows threshold values were used to further categorize and select the climate models from both datasets since the main objective of this study was to assess the impact of climate change on water resources of the study area climate models that can satisfy the following criteria liersch et al 2018 were selected and the ensemble average was used for further analysis the reference period average annual streamflow simulated by a model must satisfy the seasonality requirement with r2 0 70 if a model fails to fulfill this it is assumed as inferior the volumetric deviation of the reference period average annual streamflow simulated by a model must not exceed a pbias of 25 the volumetric change in the average annual streamflow simulated by a model for the near future period rcp8 5 compared to the reference period should not exceed 30 climate models meeting the above criteria were assumed to be suitable as members of the ensemble for the analysis of the impact of climate change on hydrology an ensemble mean of streamflows and other water balance components simulated using the selected climate models were used to assess the projected impacts of climate change on the water resources of the lake ziway sub basin 3 4 hydrological modelling 3 4 1 swat model setup an arcgis interface arc swat 2012 model developed by the united states department of agriculture was used for hydrologic modeling swat is a physically based semi distributed and continuous simulation hydrologic model arnold et al 1998 which can be used to evaluate the impacts of different land management practices and climate changes on water quantity and quality the model can be applied to study large complex watersheds neitsch et al 2011 in the swat model a basin is divided into several sub basins which are further sub divided into hydrologic response units hrus a water balance equation is used to simulate the hydrologic cycle and to predict hydrologic responses in each hru monthly streamflow data of meki and ketar rivers for the period from 1980 to 1993 were used to evaluate the model performance for both watersheds the first two years were taken as the warm up period of the model to minimize the effect of parameter values provided by the users on the output neupane et al 2015 3 4 2 swat calibration and validation the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup was used to calibrate the swat model and to identify the sensitive parameters swat cup is an auto calibration and uncertainty analysis tool with four built in analysis algorithms abbaspour et al 2007 the commonly used algorithm the parallel sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 was selected for this study based on the availability of continuous observed streamflow data the periods from 1982 to 1986 and from 1987 to 1991 respectively were used for model calibration and validation of the meki watershed similarly the period from 1985 to 1989 was taken as calibration and from 1991 to 1993 as the validation period for the ketar watershed nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the ratio of mean square error to the standard deviation of the measured data rsr eqs 4 6 were used to assess the hydrologic performance of the swat model 4 n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 o i o 2 5 p b i a s i 1 n o i s i 100

the climate variables from the meteorological data and the historical simulations of the climate models for the reference period 1985 2005 the near future 2040 2059 period streamflow was simulated using the climate models from the cordex africa rca4 rcms and nex gddp datasets to evaluate how the climate models perform in the near future the calibrated swat model was also run using the climate variables from the selected climate models to assess the impact of climate change on the hydrologic responses of the near future 2040 2059 and end of the century 2080 2099 periods 4 results 4 1 hydrologic model calibration and validation the semi distributed swat hydrologic model was calibrated and validated for the two streamflow gauges meki and ketar river gauging stations in the lake ziway sub basin as shown in fig 2 the model was able to simulate monthly streamflows with the goodness of fit values of nse 0 75 pbias 7 6 and rsr 0 50 for the calibration and nse 0 70 pbias 0 08 and rsr 0 55 for the validation periods respectively for the meki watershed fig 3 shows that the model was able to simulate streamflows from the ketar watershed with higher values of goodness of fit parameters nse 0 83 pbias 7 1 and rsr 0 41 for the calibration and nse 0 75 pbias 5 02 and rsr 0 50 for the validation periods similarly desta and lemma 2017 have also evaluated the hydrological applicability of the swat model in the same sub basin and found that the model was able to simulate streamflows which are in a very good and satisfactory to very good agreement with the observed discharges in ketar and meki watersheds respectively the swat cup was applied to perform a global sensitivity analysis of the parameters used for the calibration of the swat model the results showed that cn2 hru slp esco rchrg dp alpha bnk sol awc epco revapmn and biomix were sensitive parameters for the calibration of streamflows table 2 the overall calibration and validation analysis of the swat model in both watersheds showed that the model could be applied for further study of climate change impact assessments 4 2 climate model performance 4 2 1 precipitation performance the daily precipitation simulations of the climate models from the cordex africa rcms and nex gddp datasets were averaged over the basin area and their performances were evaluated using statistical parameters the average number of days per year with precipitation higher than 1 mm ndays 1 mm average and maximum daily rainfalls during the reference period avg and max respectively and standard deviation sd were the parameters used for the evaluation table 3 shows the absolute values and differences from the meteorological observations of these parameters all of the cordex africa rcms bias corrected using the meteorological observation and the nex gddp datasets except canesm2 underestimated number of rainy days although the differences in values to the gauge observation were considerably small almost all the cordex africa rcms underestimated average daily precipitation however for the same period all nex gddp datasets showed overestimation all the climate model datasets from both the sources overestimated maximum daily rainfalls and standard deviations as compared to the observed data the models performed almost similarly as far as standard deviation was concerned however the values of the average maximum daily precipitation of the cordex africa rcms were higher than the nex gddp datasets the regional climate models such as gfdl esm2m rca4 and ipsl cm5a mr rca4 resulted in extremely high values of the average maximum daily precipitation the box plots in fig 4 show the distribution of the wet season and annual rainfall estimated by the climate models and the observed meteorological data for the reference period the deviations of the average yearly and wet season precipitations simulated by the rcms and nex gddp datasets compared to the meteorological data are also shown almost all the nex gddp datasets resulted in high variability of both the wet season and annual average precipitation however the variability is more for models ipsl cm5a mr gfdl esm2m and noresm1 m on the other hand the variabilities of miroc5 rca4 and csiro mk3 6 0 rca4 are relatively high among the rcms the deviations of the average wet season precipitations simulated by all the rcms were less than 5 except gfdl esm2m rca4 similarly the average annual rainfall simulated by only two rcms ipsl cm5a mr rca4 and gfdl esm2m rca4 deviated by more than 5 from the meteorological data two rcms differed from the average annual precipitation and six rcms from the wet season average rainfalls by a value of less than 2 however among the nex gddp datasets only the gfdl esm2m model deviated by less than 10 both for the average wet season and annual precipitations except for noresm1 m which also varied by less than 10 for the wet season all the remaining models deviated by more than 10 for both the seasonal and annual precipitations the ipsl cm5a mr model varied by 27 3 and 42 6 for the average yearly and wet season precipitations respectively 4 2 2 performance of average monthly streamflow hydrologic evaluations of the climate models were performed in ketar and meki watersheds of the lake ziway sub basin analysis results from the ketar watershed are presented in fig 5 to 10 and those of the meki watershed are attached as a supplementary document the performance of the rcms and nex gddp datasets in simulating average monthly streamflows varied quite considerably for both the watersheds figs 5 and s1 show the comparison of the reference period streamflow hydrographs simulated by the member models of both the rcms and nex gddp datasets statistical performance indicators were used to compare the streamflow simulated using observed meteorological data to the streamflows simulated using the climate models all the streamflow simulations using nex gddp datasets overestimated the average annual streamflows with high positive pbias values figs 5 and s1 in both the watersheds ipsl cm5a mr shows the most substantial deviations with pbias of 151 3 and 209 9 for the ketar and meki watersheds respectively however all the rcms resulted in reasonable streamflow simulations with small positive and negative pbias all the models deviated by less than 15 for the meki watershed and csiro mk3 6 0 rca4 ipsl cm5a mr rca4 and gfdl esm2m rca4 varied by more than 15 for the ketar watershed all the rcms were able to represent seasonal streamflow patterns for both watersheds with r2 values greater than 0 70 the seasonal streamflow representations of nex gddp datasets for the ketar watershed were also good with r2 higher than the assumed threshold value except for the gfdl esm2m model the streamflows simulated using all the nex gddp datasets were inadequate with minimal r2 for the meki watershed however the representations of most of the rcms were adequate for the ketar watershed it is important to note that although the seasonal representation of models such as ipsl cm5a mr r2 0 85 is adequate in the case of ketar watershed the deviation of streamflows simulated by the model is very high it shows that the values of a single statistical parameter might lead to a wrong conclusion hence a combination of parameters is required to be assessed figs 6 and s2 show the taylor diagrams taylor 2001 of the average monthly streamflows of the ketar and meki watersheds respectively it helps in visualizing climate models performances in a single plot the three indicators used to identify outliers are the standard deviation sd the normalized standard deviations of discrepancies sdd and correlation coefficients between the streamflows simulated using observed data and climate model projections the reference streamflow simulated using observed meteorological data is represented by points 1 0 and 0 0 on the x axis and y axis respectively it shows that the values of the correlation coefficient and sd of a model that performs as good as the reference dataset are expected to be closer to 1 0 however the sdd of the model is required to be nearly zero from fig 6 it can be observed that almost all the rcms have lower sd than the reference dataset and the sds of only three of the rcms deviate more than 0 50 from the standardized reference dataset for the ketar watershed however all the nex gddp datasets have higher sd than the reference and except canesm2 all are outliers of the 0 50 line of sdd for the meki watershed almost all the rcms performed well with higher correlation coefficient and deviations of sds from the standardized reference dataset by less than 0 50 fig s2 however all the nex gddp datasets are far outliers of the 0 50 value sdd line with a lower correlation coefficient less than 0 8 4 3 climate model ensemble the performances of the streamflow simulations of the rcms and nex gddp datasets were evaluated using r2 pbias and rate of volumetric changes as summarized in table 4 figs 7 and s3 also show the changes in average monthly streamflows between the reference period and the mid century 2040 2059 projections under the rcp 8 5 climate models that can satisfy these criteria on both the watersheds are assumed to be qualified members of the ensemble the standard set to assess the models ability to represent the seasonality of the streamflow r2 0 70 was achieved by all the models except the gfdl esm2m nex gddp for the ketar watershed however only the rcms were able to satisfy this criterion in the case of the meki watershed the volumetric deviation criterion i e pbias 25 was well represented by six out of eight rcms for the ketar and all the rcms for the meki watersheds all the nex gddp datasets failed to meet this criterion for both the watersheds therefore only six rcms out of the sixteen models passed the requirements set for the evaluation of the reference period streamflow simulation however the mpi esm lr rca4 was also omitted from the selection because it projected a considerable change in future average annual streamflow for the ketar watershed as shown on the selection column of table 4 only five rcms fulfilled all the performance criteria and got selected as a member of the ensemble the ensemble consists of canesm2 rca4 cnrm cm5 rca4 ipsl cm5a mr rca4 miroc5 rca4 and noresm1 m rca4 from the rcms 4 4 climate change impact analysis 4 4 1 changes in projected temperature and precipitation the average monthly mean temperature and precipitation projected by the selected climate models for the historical near future and end of the century periods were compared to the base period observed data as shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively under both the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios all the selected climate models agree on the rise of temperature over the sub basin during the mid and end period of the century the canesm2 and ipsl cm5a mr models projected higher temperatures than the other rcms the lake ziway sub basin is expected to have higher temperature rises in the dry from december to march and wet from june to september seasons than the pre wet and post wet seasons in terms of the projected precipitation all the models agree on the decrease in precipitation during the mid of the century under both the rcps cnrm cm5 model projects the driest condition for all the months with the wet season delayed by almost one month similarly during the end of the century precipitation is projected to decrease but with some exceptional very high rainfall events the canesm2 and miroc5 models project relatively heavier average monthly precipitation during the pre wet season months march and may noresm1 m model projects higher mean monthly precipitation 290 mm in june under both the scenarios and lower precipitation during the other seasons similarly the ipsl cm5a mr model projects the highest mean monthly precipitation nearly 300 mm in august under the rcp 8 5 4 4 2 climate change impacts on streamflow climate change and human induced factors can affect various components of a water balance that result in changes in streamflow of a river hence changes in streamflow are expected in both the watersheds following the change in climate under the two rcp scenarios the selected models in the previous section were used with the calibrated swat model to simulate the projected streamflows during the mid and end of the century the hydrologic impacts of the changes in climate were assessed in both ketar and meki watersheds separately figs 10 and s4 show the ensemble average monthly streamflows and the rate of changes in the annual and seasonal ensemble average streamflows between the reference and the future periods under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for both the watersheds an increase in streamflow is projected to be maximal during the wet season under both the rcp scenarios however the decrease in streamflow is projected to be maximal during the dry season under rcp 4 5 and pre wet season under rcp 8 5 the expected reduction in the amount of streamflow during both the dry and pre wet seasons can affect the management of the scarcely available water resource in the basin the average annual streamflow is expected to increase by 62 0 and 26 3 under rcp 4 5 and 74 2 and 51 4 under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century for the ketar and meki watersheds respectively for the ketar watershed the reference and mid of the century periods are expected to have similar timing to peak flow under both the rcp scenarios however it is likely to shift ahead under rcp 4 5 and be delayed under rcp 8 5 by a few days for the meki watershed under rcp 4 5 it is expected to be similar during the mid of the century and shift ahead by almost one month during the end of the century under rcp 8 5 the mid and end of the century peaks are expected to move forward by a few days the increase in average monthly streamflow and shifting of the timing to peak during the future periods is due to the changes in precipitation and temperature the intra annual variations in the average monthly streamflow between the reference period and future projections were also analyzed using the box whisker plots shown in figs 11 and s5 under both rcp scenarios the 75 percentile and the median flows of ketar watershed are projected to increase in july and august during the mid of the century however the streamflows are projected to decrease in april and may at the end of the century the flows are expected to increase in the pre wet season months february to may and the 25 percentile flows are also likely to increase in the wet season months june to september under both the climate scenarios the variations in streamflow are projected to be maximal in june and august under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for the meki watershed insignificant changes in streamflow are expected during the mid of the century under both the climate scenarios however the projected streamflows during the end of the century are expected to increase in the wet season with high variations in june and september under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively 4 4 3 climate change impacts on water balance components the impacts of climate change on different water balance components were also analyzed using the simulated average monthly streamflow for the two climate change scenarios variations in the average annual precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff and water yield between the reference and future period projections were estimated for both the watersheds as shown in figs 12 and s6 for the ketar watershed the ensemble average shows a marginal decrease in the average annual precipitation by 6 9 and 9 4 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively towards the mid of the century however it was estimated to increase by 6 4 under rcp 4 5 and decrease by 3 5 under rcp 8 5 towards the end of the century marginal decreases in evapotranspiration are also expected during the mid and end of the century 9 7 and 9 2 respectively under rcp 4 5 and 12 3 and 12 7 respectively rcp 8 5 although the average annual precipitations show a marginal decrease towards the mid of the century under both the rcps due to reductions in evapotranspiration surface runoff is estimated to increase marginally by 12 6 and 12 7 respectively similarly water yield is also estimated to increase by 10 6 and 10 3 respectively both components of the water balance are also expected to be affected considerably following the change in climate towards the end of the century surface runoff is estimated to increase by 67 3 and 50 4 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively when the water yield is expected to increase by 63 4 and 45 1 respectively in the case of the meki watershed the average annual precipitation is estimated to decrease significantly under both climate change scenarios under rcp 4 5 it is expected to reduce by 42 5 and 32 8 towards the mid and end of the century respectively under rcp 8 5 the rate of decrease is estimated to be 42 1 and 25 6 during the middle and end of the century respectively similarly under both the rcps significant decreases in evapotranspiration is also projected in the future during the mid of the century et is expected to decrease by 42 8 and 43 3 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively it is also simulated to reduce towards the end of the century by 41 3 and 37 2 respectively following the decrease in precipitation under both the rcps marginal and significant reduction in surface runoff are also projected towards the end and mid of the century respectively however marginal decrease under rcp 4 5 and increase under rcp 8 5 in water yield are estimated during the middle of the century while it is expected to increase towards the end of the century by 28 2 and 53 1 respectively the estimated increasing pattern of the surface runoff and water yield while the average annual precipitations were decreasing is attributed to the projected heavy daily precipitation events by some of the ensemble model members fig 9 as shown in figs 10 and s4 the projected ensemble average annual streamflows are expected to have high peak discharges the heavier precipitation events resulted in higher surface runoff while the rate of evapotranspiration decreased following the decrease in average annual precipitation 5 discussions climate variability and over exploitations of water following the increase in human activities have considerably impacted the scarcely available water resources in the central rift valley basin the reductions of the outflow from lake ziway through bulbula river and the continuous decline in the level of the downstream terminal lake abiyata are the apparent symptoms of the natural and human induced impacts getnet et al 2014 climate change is also expected to affect the planning and management of water resources in this area the assessment of climate change impacts on water resources involves downscaling of gcms bias correction of the simulated climate variables and application of a hydrologic model observed meteorological data are required to get the best out of the bias correction of the projected climate variables unavailability of long period observations has a significant impact on climate change studies in data sparse regions of countries such as ethiopia the idea behind the provision of the high resolution statistically downscaled and bias corrected nex gddp dataset is to facilitate climate change impact assessments at regional scales such as small watersheds and cities thrasher et al 2012 in this study we selected sixteen climate models from the nex gddp datasets and cordex africa rcms to evaluate their applicability for climate change impact assessment in the lake ziway sub basin the precipitation and hydrologic performances of the models were compared to the reference data the rcms were bias corrected using the meteorological data observed in the basin while the bias corrected nex gddp datasets were used directly to evaluate their applicability in the regions where there is no observed meteorological data in hydrologic modeling and assessment of global change impacts on water resources using models such as swat the accuracy of precipitation estimations plays an important role musie et al 2019 sorooshian et al 2011 the statistical performances of the average daily precipitation of the climate models showed that out of 16 models 15 underestimated the numbers of rainy days and all the models considerably overestimated maximum daily rainfalls the performance of the nex gddp datasets is better than the rcms bias corrected using the observed reference data liersch et al 2018 also evaluated the impact of bias correction on the daily precipitation performances of earth system models esms and rcms in the upper blue nile they found that bias correction was partially successful by improving the number of rainy days but not the daily precipitation maxima however bias correction was not successful in improving both the number of rainy days and the maximum precipitations of the rcms in our study although the bias correction was unable to improve the average daily precipitation performances of the rcms the seasonal and annual precipitation performances showed significant improvement only two models out of eight marginally deviated by more than 5 from the observed seasonal and annual average precipitation however despite the better daily precipitation performance of the climate models from the nex gddp datasets their seasonal and yearly precipitation performances were unsatisfactory the seasonal and annual precipitation showed high variability and all the models considerably deviated from the reference data by more than 10 it shows that better precipitation performance at a daily time scale may not guarantee the same for the seasonal or yearly average precipitation performance the unsatisfactory precipitation performance of the nex gddp datasets might be attributed to the areal accuracy of the gmfd data used for bias correction of the models the seasonal and annual precipitation performances of the nex gddp datasets also propagated to the hydrological simulations on both the watersheds the average monthly streamflow simulated using all the eight models resulted in significant volumetric deviations although the seasonality representations of the models were suitable for the ketar watershed the same result was not obtained for the relatively flat terrain meki watershed the hydrologic performance gets worst for the streamflow projections simulated for the future period under rcp 8 5 as a result not a single model from the nex gddp datasets was able to satisfy the criteria set for the selection of the climate model according to raghavan et al 2018 the nex gddp datasets evaluated over southeast asia were able to capture only the monthly scale observed statistics but not the daily level they also suggested in depth scrutiny before using the daily scale data for impact studies therefore the poor hydrologic performance of our research is also attributed to the poor precipitation performances of the datasets used for the swat modeling the volumetric deviations and seasonality of the average monthly streamflow simulated using most of the rcms were within the acceptable range in both watersheds for the meki watershed only one out of the eight models failed to satisfy the criterion set for the rate of volumetric change of the streamflow projected for the near future while only three models were unable to meet all the standards for the ketar watershed and hence could not be selected as the members of the ensemble although the daily precipitation performances of the rcms overestimated maximum precipitations and underestimated the number of rainy days the fewer variabilities and deviations of the annual and seasonal rainfalls resulted in streamflows which were in agreement with the simulations using observed data teutschbein and seibert 2012 evaluated different bias correction methods of rcms for the assessment of the hydrologic impact of climate change they concluded that hydrological simulations using bias corrected rcms are in good agreement with the observed values than the simulations driven with uncorrected rcms the better hydrologic performance of the rcms in our study was also related to the bias correction of the models using the observed meteorological data because of the limited climate change impact study downscaling approaches and difference of climate models used in the region validation with other studies is difficult gadissa et al 2019 showed an estimated decrease in streamflow in the central rift valley basin during the period 2040 2070 to be 26 9 and 15 8 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively the ensemble annual average streamflow in our study during the mid century is also estimated to decrease under both the rcp scenarios in the meki watershed however the flow is expected to increase during the end of the century under both scenarios the projected streamflow for the higher elevation ketar watershed is estimated to increase during both the mid and end of the century under the two rcps although the wet season average streamflow is estimated to increase in both watershed the projected dry season streamflow is expected to decrease under both the climate scenarios and during both the mid and end periods of the century the simulated decrease in streamflow during the dry season is expected to significantly escalate the conflict related to the use of the scarcely available water resource in the basin 6 conclusions climate change impact is expected to be one of the critical challenges for the management of the scarcely available water resources in the central rift valley basin in this study we evaluated the applicability of the nex gddp datasets and cordex africa regional climate models for climate impact studies in the basin two climate change scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were considered for the mid and end periods of the century we also selected climate models based on the criteria set for hydrologic evaluations of the reference period and future projected streamflows the ultimate goal of our research was to study the impacts of climate change on the water resources of lake ziway sub basin using an ensemble average of the selected climate models the following is a summary of our findings 1 the overall performance of the climate models from the high resolution nex gddp datasets in our study was unsatisfactory the seasonality and volumetric deviations of the average annual streamflow simulated using these models were not within the acceptable limits of the criteria used for the evaluation therefore these datasets need a deep inspection for further use in climate change impact studies in countries such as ethiopia 2 the majority of the rcms bias corrected using the observed meteorological data were able to fulfill the criteria set for the hydrological evaluation of the climate models in both the watersheds it shows that the rcms from cordex africa have the potential to be used for climate change impact studies at the regional and watershed scales in countries with varying topography such as ethiopia better results from these models can be achieved using the right method and observed climate data for bias correction 3 the ensemble average annual streamflow of the sub basin is expected to increase during the end of the century following the projected increase in the wet season average streamflow under both the rcps however it will decrease in the meki watershed and increase in the ketar watershed during the mid of the century therefore minimal changes in the average annual streamflows in lake ziway sub basin is expected during the mid period of the century because of the increasing and decreasing trends in streamflows from the two rivers 4 the ensemble average dry season from october to january streamflow of the basin is projected to have a decreasing trend during both the mid and end periods of the century under both the climate scenarios the pre wet season streamflow is also expected to decrease during the mid of the century under both the rcps the decrease in streamflow is also likely to have a considerable impact on the scarcely available water in the system 5 finally we note that the climate model evaluation results of this study can be used for climate impact studies in other regions of ethiopia having similar topographic and climate characteristics we also recommend further studies of the optimal allocation and planning of the water resources of lake ziway taking into consideration projected changes in streamflow following the impacts of climate changes to support decision makers declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

8326,study region the off stream artificial bar lake built in 2015 to store the flood flows of the bar river for domestic and industrial needs and with the objective to intentionally recharge the aquifer is situated in the razavi khorasan province iran study focus we present a methodology based on the combination of a modflow groundwater flow model for estimating seepage rates and an optimization model for the management and operation of an artificial reservoir considering surface groundwater interactions for satisfying 12 mm3 year of water demand we simulated the reliable amount of water that can be supplied from the reservoir considering reservoir seepage maximizing water supply yields subject to the water supply reliability requirements and the additional intentional volume of groundwater recharge new hydrological insights for the region our results demonstrate the reliability of conjunctive use of surface and ground water in water scarce areas by exploiting reservoir infrastructures with relevant leakage losses also for creating additional aquifer storage in such systems man induced changes of lake stages can significantly affect the volume of water that seeps through the lakebed the aquifer under managed aquifer recharge operations may then provide the resource not satisfied by the reservoir release fulfilling 100 reliability of water supply the conjunctive use of surface and ground water by improving water security may open new sustainability views for leaking reservoirs even if they were not initially designed for increasing aquifer recharge in many areas worldwide keywords conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater reservoir management optimization model surface water groundwater interactions groundwater flow numerical modelling modflow managed aquifer recharge water resources management 1 introduction in water scarce arid areas optimizing the use of different sources of water is beneficial to the various user sectors and for ecosystem s conservation to this regard conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources the coordinated use of these water resources over time and space as two components of a single system fao 1995 blomquist et al 2001 may be considered a relevant solution to optimize the water demand supply balance for achieving sustainable water resource management scanlon et al 2016 song et al 2020 iwanaga et al 2020 in the case of surface water reservoirs part of the stored surface water may be released and then infiltrated in managed aquifer recharge schemes for aquifer replenishment downstream of the reservoir dillon et al 2019 zammouri and feki 2005 however some reservoirs as in the case of off stream reservoirs may show large seepage rate generating de facto aquifer recharge and the potential for taking advantages of the additional underground storage this amount of recharged water may complement the water released from the reservoir to meet the water demand request in such cases optimal management of water demand requires considering reservoir system operations taking into account the aquifer recharge rate few works in literature address the optimization of combined operational management of reservoir with large amount of seepage loss and groundwater to satisfy water demand managing the reservoir interactions with the aquifer and the uncertain inflow to the reservoir at the same is an actual challenge therefore appropriate methodologies and models well accounting for the reservoir groundwater interactions are needed ghobadi et al 2005 feinstein 2012 dogrul et al 2016 song et al 2020 in order to provide an operational framework and to fully demonstrate the concept of conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater to this aim optimization techniques are powerful tools for managing and operating complex water resources systems labadie 2004 jothiprakash et al 2011 ahmad et al 2014 at the same time groundwater flow numerical modelling provides reliable approaches for estimating surface groundwater interactions genereux and bandopadhyay 2001 hunt et al 2003 mylopoulos et al 2007 yihdego and becht 2013 el zehairy et al 2017 and cannata et al 2018 the combined use of optimization tools and numerical models may allow to optimize release from the reservoir including the surface water groundwater component to evaluate infiltration through the lake bed for managing a reservoir with high amount of seepage the model simulating surface water groundwater interactions may then be embedded into the optimization model in real cases however embedding numerical models directly into the optimization model is complex and causing high computational cost joodavi et al 2017 razavi et al 2012 castelletti et al 2012 therefore regression models and artificial neural networks may be used as a surrogate for the computationally expensive embedded method pan et al 2016 chen et al 2017 2018 in this paper we present a methodology based on the combination of numerical groundwater flow simulations and reservoir operation optimization models we developed an optimization model for the management of the off stream bar reservoir operation iran including lakebed seepage and random inflow to the reservoir in order to satisfy water demand for a total amount of 12 mm3 year for drinking and industrial purposes in this method the reliability of releases from the reservoir is also considered 2 materials and methods three major steps were undertaken to complete the study fig 1 i detailed hydrogeological characterization of the study area ii the development of a numerical groundwater flow model and iii the development and application of an optimization model for the management of the bar reservoir operation including the seepage from bar reservoir to the underlying alluvial aquifer the calibrated groundwater flow model run for 2017 2018 period was used to obtain a leakage function that was then embedded to the reservoir mass balance equation in the optimization model as the proposed optimization model is nonlinear and nonconvex a genetic algorithm ga is used to solve this optimization model the optimization model was then run for 66 years on monthly basis to derive optimal water supply considering the reservoir release and groundwater withdrawal 2 1 study area the off stream artificial bar lake is situated in the razavi khorasan province in iran about 23 km north west of neishaboor city fig 2 the reservoir was built in 2015 to store the flood flows of the bar river for water supply for domestic and industrial needs and with the secondary objective to intentionally recharge the aquifer abpooy consulting engineers company 2019 the advantage of the off stream design of the bar artificial reservoir is that it prevents the problem of storage loss due to sedimentation associated with in stream surface water storage pan et al 2016 the scheme includes a reservoir area created by two dams located on an alluvial unconfined aquifer a water intake weir a waterway that connects the water intake to the reservoir and spillways and other outlets fig 2 average annual flow of the river at the water intake weir is about 20 mm3 while the capacity of the reservoir is about 23 5 mm3 and the maximum reservoir area is about 2 km2 daily historical records for the river flow and climatic data e g precipitation pan evaporation and air temperature are available for the area from 1953 to 2018 the mean annual temperature evaporation and precipitation at the bar reservoir are 12 8 c 1370 mm and 233 mm respectively for this period abpooy consulting engineers company 2019 table 1 presents average monthly rainfall data for the period 1953 2018 fig 3 shows the monthly aggregated inflow and precipitation data fig 4 shows statistics of 66 year monthly inflow time series from 1953 to 2018 because of the semiarid climate of the study area river flows available for diversion to the reservoir vary seasonally and annually maximum monthly river discharge occurs between march and june peaking in april ranging from 0 to 28 4 mm3 month in different years fig 4a b these months anyway show also the largest variability in discharge values fig 4c droughts and extended periods of low flows fig 4d caused serious water shortages in the basin forcing the local water management authority to build the bar reservoir and to develop a plan for installing groundwater pumping facilities this conjunctive water use strategy requires coordination between reservoir releases and groundwater withdrawals in order to minimize the slacks in water supply especially in dry periods 2 2 hydrogeological setting and conceptual model thirty two boreholes permeability tests hydrogeological information and geophysical investigations provide information on aquifer lithology thickness and hydraulic conductivities based on such data the groundwater flow system of the study area can be conceptualized as a one layer unconfined alluvial aquifer whose thickness ranges from 1 to 100 m fig 5 the unconfined aquifer was formed in a buried valley and it is composed mainly of fine medium and coarse sand and a little clay and loam in the central area of the valley beneath the lake qt1 in fig 2 apart from the central area of the reservoir the percentage of clay in the aquifer material qt1 increased and the sediments are composed of loam with some sandy clay clay and argillaceous material the hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer range from 0 1 m day in the south western area of the lake up to 8 m day beneath the lake the aquifer is bounded by impervious marl and conglomerate layers mm and ploc in fig 5 in the north eastern area of the lake whereas the conglomerate layers in the south western area are moderately weathered and semi permeable groundwater level data are available from 26 observation wells located around the lake fig 6 the main groundwater flow direction is from north east to south west as said the reservoir bed is covered by silt with a fraction of clay materials but still sufficiently permeable to hydraulically link the reservoir to the alluvial aquifer the data show the variability of the lake stage affects the groundwater flow system by causing a general groundwater head increase in the system fig 7 at high stages the lake induces seepage into the groundwater system causing the water table to rise hence the water level of the reservoir is always higher than the water table fig 7 in the surround and it is unlikely that groundwater discharges into the lake because of the spatio temporal lakebed seepage pattern a function of water level in the reservoir and hydraulic properties of the lakebed and the aquifer materials optimal management of the reservoir considering water demand requires taking into account the aquifer recharge rate 2 3 groundwater flow simulation model setup and calibration we analyzed the lake aquifer interactions implementing a groundwater flow numerical model by means of the freewat software rossetto et al 2015 de filippis et al 2017 foglia et al 2018 using the modflow 2005 code harbaugh 2005 freewat is a free and open source platform qgis integrated for planning and management of ground and surface water resources freewat provides tools for archiving analyzing and processing the groundwater data and information e g sensor and field data on groundwater levels and hydrochemical data criollo et al 2019 cannata et al 2018 along with post processing tools for visualization and analysis of the model results modflow is one of the widest used model in the world for numerical simulation of groundwater flow in aquifers it solves the groundwater flow equation in three dimensions using a finite difference scheme the freewat software has been applied at several case studies details may be found in i e de filippis et al 2020 perdikaki et al 2020 data for a 328 day period 14 february 2017 to 7 january 2018 including inflow to the reservoir precipitation evaporation water level in the reservoir and groundwater levels were used the reservoir was almost empty at the beginning of the investigated period in this condition the unsaturated zone is 15 m thick the active modelling domain includes 669 cells with a resolution of 75 75 m fig 8 and it covers an area of 3 76 km2 as far as boundary conditions the marl outcrops on the north eastern side of the lake was considered as no flow boundary in order to represent the interactions of the modelling domain with the external area a specified head boundary was assigned along the other boundaries of the active domain the specified head data was obtained from the observation wells located around the lake fig 8 no flow boundary was also set at the bottom of the aquifer water exchange between the lake reservoir and the aquifer was simulated using the modflow river riv package this package requires information on head stage the elevation of the lake bottom the vertical hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the lake bed material as well as the areal extension of the lake bed from these data a conductance value is obtained as many of the above mentioned information are not easy to gather via experimental means the optimum value of the conductance was estimated during the calibration process the simulation covers the period between 14 february 2017 to 7 january 2018 divided in 328 daily transient stress periods the groundwater flow model calibration was accomplished using a combined trial and error and automated parameter estimation using the pest code doherty 2016 approach la vigna et al 2016 groundwater head levels in 26 observation wells were used as calibration targets model input parameters in particular hydraulic conductivity specific yield and the conductance of the lake bed material were varied within reasonable data based ranges to produce the best fit between simulated and observed hydraulic heads in the aquifer the calibrated distribution of hydraulic conductivity is presented in fig 9 while the time series of observed vs simulated values is shown in fig 10 a at selected observation wells and the scatter diagram in fig 10b final root mean square error rmse was 1 2 m moreover the nashe sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ns which can be used to compare individual simulated to observed hydrographs was 0 97 for the calibrated groundwater flow model ns ranges from to 1 values close to 1 indicate a good fit anderson et al 2015 considering the number of head measurements and the reservoir water budget analysis hard data and the geological and hydrologic information at the site analysis soft knowledge the model performance and the calibration result are acceptable for the objective of this study 2 4 reservoir management model the optimization model is developed for optimal operation of the reservoir the optimal operation objective is to minimize the value z of a mathematical objective function eq 1 that expresses the differences between optimal release from the reservoir r t and total demand during time period t t d t subject to constraints on availability of water and other inputs 1 min z t 1 t t d t r t 2 2 4 1 constraints mass balance equation based on conservation of mass throughout the system the mass balance in the reservoir from one time step to another time step is given by the continuity equation the continuity equation eq 2 is stated as 2 s t s t 1 i t p t e t l s t 1 r t s p i l l t where s t final storage at the time t i t inflow during the time t p t precipitation over the lake

t t d t this constraint is given by 3 0 r t t d t water supply releases reliability constraints these are defined in order to take into account water shortage periods that is periods during which optimal release is not satisfied due to the uncertainty associated with available reservoir inflow streamflow diversion the water supply reliability constraint is defined as follows 4 α t ψ 5 α t number of periodstsuch thatoptimal r t s t 1 i t p t e t l s t 1 o r s t s max n where α t is supply reliability n is the total number of time steps and ψ is the reliability level which is chosen by decision makers 2 4 2 storage constraints the reservoir storage in any month should not be more than the capacity of the reservoir and should not be less than the desired target storage mathematically this constraint is given as 6 s min s t s max where s max capacity of the reservoir in million cubic meters mm3 in order to evaluate monthly water supply reliability with respect to optimal release in medium term operation 66 years of data including monthly reservoir inflow precipitation and evaporation data and main characteristics of bar reservoir were used the input parameters and data for the reservoir management model have been derived from a technical report drafted by the abpooy consulting engineers company 2019 the total demand in different months of a year is given in table 2 minimum and maximum storage were set to 0 and 23 5 mm3 respectively and the initial storage volume was set to 6 mm3 the total demand for each month was considered constant in all years during the analyzed period the reliability in each month was then defined as the number of periods the reservoir release satisfies the optimal release the reliability level was set to 85 in each month this value was decided by the decision makers abpooy consulting engineers company 2019 2 5 optimization using genetic algorithm ga in the present study all the optimization processes are performed using a ga model in the matlab environment matlab and statistics toolbox release 2016 numerous applications of gas can be found in water resources planning and management literature e g wu et al 2007 guan et al 2008 dariane and momtahen 2009 joodavi et al 2015 sepahvand et al 2019 adeyeri et al 2020 in order to find the optimal solution to the problem eq 1 first the constrained model is transformed to an unconstrained problem using penalty functions in this method constrains of the model are embedded into the objective function in order to penalize the solutions that violate the constraints infeasible solutions the decision variables for the management model are represented by coded structures in the ga model the real coding is used due to its suitability for constrained optimization michalewicz 1994 wardlaw and sharif 1999 each solution is identified as a chromosome that consists of 12 genes for monthly optimal releases moreover a combination of the tournament selection and the truncation operators is used as selection operator and the arithmetic crossover is chosen for the crossover process moreover the gaussian mutation the most common mutation operator nicklow et al 2010 is applied to the ga model the population size crossover and mutation probabilities are set equal to 1000 0 80 and 0 03 respectively these values were chosen following a trial and error process 3 results and discussion the analyses performed provided the total seepage volume from the reservoir to the aquifer for the simulated period the simulated seepage calculated by the modflow model was 5 77 mcm for the entire period value close to the one estimated from the lake s volumetric budget for the same period 5 5 mcm abpooy consulting engineers company 2019 the groundwater flow calibrated model results were used for predicting daily seepage from the reservoir into the aquifer leakage loss as a function of water levels in the reservoir the derived polynomial function is shown in fig 11 after the value of 1335 the water level in the reservoir causes a nearly linear increase of the seepage rate then the leakage function l st 1 in eq 2 was embedded to the reservoir mass balance equation in the optimization model table 2 shows optimal water releases for bar reservoir obtained by the optimization model along with monthly cumulated seepage and monthly demand the water supply reliability with regard to optimal release is always equal or above 0 85 guaranteeing the required supply for which the reservoir was designed fig 12 displays monthly storage volume and lakebed seepage related to the optimal water releases for the whole 66 year time series in relation to the average annual water balance fig 13 52 of inflow to the reservoir is seepage water that can be stored in the aquifer while 40 of the inflow can be released from the reservoir the water balance is slightly negative because of the reservoir storage changes which is allowed in the medium term operations zhang and ponnambalam 2006 moreover our results show that the distance between the demand and optimal release could be largely supplied by recovering via pumping wells the additional recharge of the aquifer provided by the seepage in only three months july august and september the demand is not fully satisfied for a small volume by the monthly water availability provided by the joint surface and groundwater scheme the missing amount about 0 5 mm3 table 2 may be withdrawn from the local aquifer without causing groundwater quantity and quality degradation in fact in the other months recharge seepage is greater than pumping being the total estimated seepage calculated by the optimization model 7 26 mm3 while the needed groundwater withdrawal all in all is worth 6 3 mm3 this analysis suggests that the risk of failure of managed aquifer recharge facilities is a very relevant step in design of water infrastructures and it should be well addressed at initial stage of planning rodríguez escales et al 2018 finally fig 14 shows the long term monthly average reservoir allocation and groundwater pumping needs to fulfil water demand in conjunctive use operation fig 14 also shows the predicted monthly seepage a time delay is predicted between the maximum diverted inflow and maximum expected seepage this delay in recharge makes groundwater a reliable and slowly depleting resource while the available surface water in the reservoir is diminishing at a faster rate 4 conclusions we presented a methodology based on modelling solutions for optimizing the bar off stream man made reservoir operations considering seepage losses to the aquifer to ensure that water demand is satisfied and all planned reservoir objectives are met in our analysis the integration of well known methods such as numerical groundwater flow modelling and optimization models provided information on the reliability of the supply of a pre defined optimal release and also on the monthly volume of additional intentional groundwater recharge based on our calculations the water demand may then be satisfied by the reservoir release in conjunction with groundwater withdrawal of the increased recharge in only three months the whole water infrastructure surface water reservoir and managed aquifer recharge is not theoretically able to fulfill the demand considering the on time recharged volume in that case the missing part of the demand will have to be covered by the volume previously recharged exploiting the water banking capacity in the aquifer of a managed aquifer recharge scheme the modelling method proposed in this study can be adapted to any artificial lake system to enhance its operation planning and management as it can provide accurate assessment of the effects of operational releases on lakebed seepage with this paper we aim at pointing out the importance for potential conjunctive use of surface and ground water in water scarce areas by exploiting reservoir infrastructures where the leakage losses are relevant also for creating additional aquifer storage in such systems man induced changes of lake stages mainly dependent on temporally variable balance between inflow and regulated outflow can significantly affect the volume of water that seeps through the basin floor the infiltrated water constitutes an additional storage volume reliable for coping with the demand or for water banking purposes the aquifer under managed aquifer recharge operations may then provide the resource not satisfied by the reservoir release hence fulfilling 100 reliability of water supply finally the potential conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater by improving water security may open new sustainability views for leaking reservoirs even if they were not initially designed for increasing

8326,study region the off stream artificial bar lake built in 2015 to store the flood flows of the bar river for domestic and industrial needs and with the objective to intentionally recharge the aquifer is situated in the razavi khorasan province iran study focus we present a methodology based on the combination of a modflow groundwater flow model for estimating seepage rates and an optimization model for the management and operation of an artificial reservoir considering surface groundwater interactions for satisfying 12 mm3 year of water demand we simulated the reliable amount of water that can be supplied from the reservoir considering reservoir seepage maximizing water supply yields subject to the water supply reliability requirements and the additional intentional volume of groundwater recharge new hydrological insights for the region our results demonstrate the reliability of conjunctive use of surface and ground water in water scarce areas by exploiting reservoir infrastructures with relevant leakage losses also for creating additional aquifer storage in such systems man induced changes of lake stages can significantly affect the volume of water that seeps through the lakebed the aquifer under managed aquifer recharge operations may then provide the resource not satisfied by the reservoir release fulfilling 100 reliability of water supply the conjunctive use of surface and ground water by improving water security may open new sustainability views for leaking reservoirs even if they were not initially designed for increasing aquifer recharge in many areas worldwide keywords conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater reservoir management optimization model surface water groundwater interactions groundwater flow numerical modelling modflow managed aquifer recharge water resources management 1 introduction in water scarce arid areas optimizing the use of different sources of water is beneficial to the various user sectors and for ecosystem s conservation to this regard conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources the coordinated use of these water resources over time and space as two components of a single system fao 1995 blomquist et al 2001 may be considered a relevant solution to optimize the water demand supply balance for achieving sustainable water resource management scanlon et al 2016 song et al 2020 iwanaga et al 2020 in the case of surface water reservoirs part of the stored surface water may be released and then infiltrated in managed aquifer recharge schemes for aquifer replenishment downstream of the reservoir dillon et al 2019 zammouri and feki 2005 however some reservoirs as in the case of off stream reservoirs may show large seepage rate generating de facto aquifer recharge and the potential for taking advantages of the additional underground storage this amount of recharged water may complement the water released from the reservoir to meet the water demand request in such cases optimal management of water demand requires considering reservoir system operations taking into account the aquifer recharge rate few works in literature address the optimization of combined operational management of reservoir with large amount of seepage loss and groundwater to satisfy water demand managing the reservoir interactions with the aquifer and the uncertain inflow to the reservoir at the same is an actual challenge therefore appropriate methodologies and models well accounting for the reservoir groundwater interactions are needed ghobadi et al 2005 feinstein 2012 dogrul et al 2016 song et al 2020 in order to provide an operational framework and to fully demonstrate the concept of conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater to this aim optimization techniques are powerful tools for managing and operating complex water resources systems labadie 2004 jothiprakash et al 2011 ahmad et al 2014 at the same time groundwater flow numerical modelling provides reliable approaches for estimating surface groundwater interactions genereux and bandopadhyay 2001 hunt et al 2003 mylopoulos et al 2007 yihdego and becht 2013 el zehairy et al 2017 and cannata et al 2018 the combined use of optimization tools and numerical models may allow to optimize release from the reservoir including the surface water groundwater component to evaluate infiltration through the lake bed for managing a reservoir with high amount of seepage the model simulating surface water groundwater interactions may then be embedded into the optimization model in real cases however embedding numerical models directly into the optimization model is complex and causing high computational cost joodavi et al 2017 razavi et al 2012 castelletti et al 2012 therefore regression models and artificial neural networks may be used as a surrogate for the computationally expensive embedded method pan et al 2016 chen et al 2017 2018 in this paper we present a methodology based on the combination of numerical groundwater flow simulations and reservoir operation optimization models we developed an optimization model for the management of the off stream bar reservoir operation iran including lakebed seepage and random inflow to the reservoir in order to satisfy water demand for a total amount of 12 mm3 year for drinking and industrial purposes in this method the reliability of releases from the reservoir is also considered 2 materials and methods three major steps were undertaken to complete the study fig 1 i detailed hydrogeological characterization of the study area ii the development of a numerical groundwater flow model and iii the development and application of an optimization model for the management of the bar reservoir operation including the seepage from bar reservoir to the underlying alluvial aquifer the calibrated groundwater flow model run for 2017 2018 period was used to obtain a leakage function that was then embedded to the reservoir mass balance equation in the optimization model as the proposed optimization model is nonlinear and nonconvex a genetic algorithm ga is used to solve this optimization model the optimization model was then run for 66 years on monthly basis to derive optimal water supply considering the reservoir release and groundwater withdrawal 2 1 study area the off stream artificial bar lake is situated in the razavi khorasan province in iran about 23 km north west of neishaboor city fig 2 the reservoir was built in 2015 to store the flood flows of the bar river for water supply for domestic and industrial needs and with the secondary objective to intentionally recharge the aquifer abpooy consulting engineers company 2019 the advantage of the off stream design of the bar artificial reservoir is that it prevents the problem of storage loss due to sedimentation associated with in stream surface water storage pan et al 2016 the scheme includes a reservoir area created by two dams located on an alluvial unconfined aquifer a water intake weir a waterway that connects the water intake to the reservoir and spillways and other outlets fig 2 average annual flow of the river at the water intake weir is about 20 mm3 while the capacity of the reservoir is about 23 5 mm3 and the maximum reservoir area is about 2 km2 daily historical records for the river flow and climatic data e g precipitation pan evaporation and air temperature are available for the area from 1953 to 2018 the mean annual temperature evaporation and precipitation at the bar reservoir are 12 8 c 1370 mm and 233 mm respectively for this period abpooy consulting engineers company 2019 table 1 presents average monthly rainfall data for the period 1953 2018 fig 3 shows the monthly aggregated inflow and precipitation data fig 4 shows statistics of 66 year monthly inflow time series from 1953 to 2018 because of the semiarid climate of the study area river flows available for diversion to the reservoir vary seasonally and annually maximum monthly river discharge occurs between march and june peaking in april ranging from 0 to 28 4 mm3 month in different years fig 4a b these months anyway show also the largest variability in discharge values fig 4c droughts and extended periods of low flows fig 4d caused serious water shortages in the basin forcing the local water management authority to build the bar reservoir and to develop a plan for installing groundwater pumping facilities this conjunctive water use strategy requires coordination between reservoir releases and groundwater withdrawals in order to minimize the slacks in water supply especially in dry periods 2 2 hydrogeological setting and conceptual model thirty two boreholes permeability tests hydrogeological information and geophysical investigations provide information on aquifer lithology thickness and hydraulic conductivities based on such data the groundwater flow system of the study area can be conceptualized as a one layer unconfined alluvial aquifer whose thickness ranges from 1 to 100 m fig 5 the unconfined aquifer was formed in a buried valley and it is composed mainly of fine medium and coarse sand and a little clay and loam in the central area of the valley beneath the lake qt1 in fig 2 apart from the central area of the reservoir the percentage of clay in the aquifer material qt1 increased and the sediments are composed of loam with some sandy clay clay and argillaceous material the hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer range from 0 1 m day in the south western area of the lake up to 8 m day beneath the lake the aquifer is bounded by impervious marl and conglomerate layers mm and ploc in fig 5 in the north eastern area of the lake whereas the conglomerate layers in the south western area are moderately weathered and semi permeable groundwater level data are available from 26 observation wells located around the lake fig 6 the main groundwater flow direction is from north east to south west as said the reservoir bed is covered by silt with a fraction of clay materials but still sufficiently permeable to hydraulically link the reservoir to the alluvial aquifer the data show the variability of the lake stage affects the groundwater flow system by causing a general groundwater head increase in the system fig 7 at high stages the lake induces seepage into the groundwater system causing the water table to rise hence the water level of the reservoir is always higher than the water table fig 7 in the surround and it is unlikely that groundwater discharges into the lake because of the spatio temporal lakebed seepage pattern a function of water level in the reservoir and hydraulic properties of the lakebed and the aquifer materials optimal management of the reservoir considering water demand requires taking into account the aquifer recharge rate 2 3 groundwater flow simulation model setup and calibration we analyzed the lake aquifer interactions implementing a groundwater flow numerical model by means of the freewat software rossetto et al 2015 de filippis et al 2017 foglia et al 2018 using the modflow 2005 code harbaugh 2005 freewat is a free and open source platform qgis integrated for planning and management of ground and surface water resources freewat provides tools for archiving analyzing and processing the groundwater data and information e g sensor and field data on groundwater levels and hydrochemical data criollo et al 2019 cannata et al 2018 along with post processing tools for visualization and analysis of the model results modflow is one of the widest used model in the world for numerical simulation of groundwater flow in aquifers it solves the groundwater flow equation in three dimensions using a finite difference scheme the freewat software has been applied at several case studies details may be found in i e de filippis et al 2020 perdikaki et al 2020 data for a 328 day period 14 february 2017 to 7 january 2018 including inflow to the reservoir precipitation evaporation water level in the reservoir and groundwater levels were used the reservoir was almost empty at the beginning of the investigated period in this condition the unsaturated zone is 15 m thick the active modelling domain includes 669 cells with a resolution of 75 75 m fig 8 and it covers an area of 3 76 km2 as far as boundary conditions the marl outcrops on the north eastern side of the lake was considered as no flow boundary in order to represent the interactions of the modelling domain with the external area a specified head boundary was assigned along the other boundaries of the active domain the specified head data was obtained from the observation wells located around the lake fig 8 no flow boundary was also set at the bottom of the aquifer water exchange between the lake reservoir and the aquifer was simulated using the modflow river riv package this package requires information on head stage the elevation of the lake bottom the vertical hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the lake bed material as well as the areal extension of the lake bed from these data a conductance value is obtained as many of the above mentioned information are not easy to gather via experimental means the optimum value of the conductance was estimated during the calibration process the simulation covers the period between 14 february 2017 to 7 january 2018 divided in 328 daily transient stress periods the groundwater flow model calibration was accomplished using a combined trial and error and automated parameter estimation using the pest code doherty 2016 approach la vigna et al 2016 groundwater head levels in 26 observation wells were used as calibration targets model input parameters in particular hydraulic conductivity specific yield and the conductance of the lake bed material were varied within reasonable data based ranges to produce the best fit between simulated and observed hydraulic heads in the aquifer the calibrated distribution of hydraulic conductivity is presented in fig 9 while the time series of observed vs simulated values is shown in fig 10 a at selected observation wells and the scatter diagram in fig 10b final root mean square error rmse was 1 2 m moreover the nashe sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ns which can be used to compare individual simulated to observed hydrographs was 0 97 for the calibrated groundwater flow model ns ranges from to 1 values close to 1 indicate a good fit anderson et al 2015 considering the number of head measurements and the reservoir water budget analysis hard data and the geological and hydrologic information at the site analysis soft knowledge the model performance and the calibration result are acceptable for the objective of this study 2 4 reservoir management model the optimization model is developed for optimal operation of the reservoir the optimal operation objective is to minimize the value z of a mathematical objective function eq 1 that expresses the differences between optimal release from the reservoir r t and total demand during time period t t d t subject to constraints on availability of water and other inputs 1 min z t 1 t t d t r t 2 2 4 1 constraints mass balance equation based on conservation of mass throughout the system the mass balance in the reservoir from one time step to another time step is given by the continuity equation the continuity equation eq 2 is stated as 2 s t s t 1 i t p t e t l s t 1 r t s p i l l t where s t final storage at the time t i t inflow during the time t p t precipitation over the lake during the time t e t evaporation loss in the reservoir during time t l s t 1 leakage loss in the reservoir during time t as a function of s t 1 leakage function obtained from the calibrated groundwater flow model and s p i l l t surplus from the reservoir during time t release constraints the optimal release from the reservoir r t should be less than or equal to the total demand at time t t d t this constraint is given by 3 0 r t t d t water supply releases reliability constraints these are defined in order to take into account water shortage periods that is periods during which optimal release is not satisfied due to the uncertainty associated with available reservoir inflow streamflow diversion the water supply reliability constraint is defined as follows 4 α t ψ 5 α t number of periodstsuch thatoptimal r t s t 1 i t p t e t l s t 1 o r s t s max n where α t is supply reliability n is the total number of time steps and ψ is the reliability level which is chosen by decision makers 2 4 2 storage constraints the reservoir storage in any month should not be more than the capacity of the reservoir and should not be less than the desired target storage mathematically this constraint is given as 6 s min s t s max where s max capacity of the reservoir in million cubic meters mm3 in order to evaluate monthly water supply reliability with respect to optimal release in medium term operation 66 years of data including monthly reservoir inflow precipitation and evaporation data and main characteristics of bar reservoir were used the input parameters and data for the reservoir management model have been derived from a technical report drafted by the abpooy consulting engineers company 2019 the total demand in different months of a year is given in table 2 minimum and maximum storage were set to 0 and 23 5 mm3 respectively and the initial storage volume was set to 6 mm3 the total demand for each month was considered constant in all years during the analyzed period the reliability in each month was then defined as the number of periods the reservoir release satisfies the optimal release the reliability level was set to 85 in each month this value was decided by the decision makers abpooy consulting engineers company 2019 2 5 optimization using genetic algorithm ga in the present study all the optimization processes are performed using a ga model in the matlab environment matlab and statistics toolbox release 2016 numerous applications of gas can be found in water resources planning and management literature e g wu et al 2007 guan et al 2008 dariane and momtahen 2009 joodavi et al 2015 sepahvand et al 2019 adeyeri et al 2020 in order to find the optimal solution to the problem eq 1 first the constrained model is transformed to an unconstrained problem using penalty functions in this method constrains of the model are embedded into the objective function in order to penalize the solutions that violate the constraints infeasible solutions the decision variables for the management model are represented by coded structures in the ga model the real coding is used due to its suitability for constrained optimization michalewicz 1994 wardlaw and sharif 1999 each solution is identified as a chromosome that consists of 12 genes for monthly optimal releases moreover a combination of the tournament selection and the truncation operators is used as selection operator and the arithmetic crossover is chosen for the crossover process moreover the gaussian mutation the most common mutation operator nicklow et al 2010 is applied to the ga model the population size crossover and mutation probabilities are set equal to 1000 0 80 and 0 03 respectively these values were chosen following a trial and error process 3 results and discussion the analyses performed provided the total seepage volume from the reservoir to the aquifer for the simulated period the simulated seepage calculated by the modflow model was 5 77 mcm for the entire period value close to the one estimated from the lake s volumetric budget for the same period 5 5 mcm abpooy consulting engineers company 2019 the groundwater flow calibrated model results were used for predicting daily seepage from the reservoir into the aquifer leakage loss as a function of water levels in the reservoir the derived polynomial function is shown in fig 11 after the value of 1335 the water level in the reservoir causes a nearly linear increase of the seepage rate then the leakage function l st 1 in eq 2 was embedded to the reservoir mass balance equation in the optimization model table 2 shows optimal water releases for bar reservoir obtained by the optimization model along with monthly cumulated seepage and monthly demand the water supply reliability with regard to optimal release is always equal or above 0 85 guaranteeing the required supply for which the reservoir was designed fig 12 displays monthly storage volume and lakebed seepage related to the optimal water releases for the whole 66 year time series in relation to the average annual water balance fig 13 52 of inflow to the reservoir is seepage water that can be stored in the aquifer while 40 of the inflow can be released from the reservoir the water balance is slightly negative because of the reservoir storage changes which is allowed in the medium term operations zhang and ponnambalam 2006 moreover our results show that the distance between the demand and optimal release could be largely supplied by recovering via pumping wells the additional recharge of the aquifer provided by the seepage in only three months july august and september the demand is not fully satisfied for a small volume by the monthly water availability provided by the joint surface and groundwater scheme the missing amount about 0 5 mm3 table 2 may be withdrawn from the local aquifer without causing groundwater quantity and quality degradation in fact in the other months recharge seepage is greater than pumping being the total estimated seepage calculated by the optimization model 7 26 mm3 while the needed groundwater withdrawal all in all is worth 6 3 mm3 this analysis suggests that the risk of failure of managed aquifer recharge facilities is a very relevant step in design of water infrastructures and it should be well addressed at initial stage of planning rodríguez escales et al 2018 finally fig 14 shows the long term monthly average reservoir allocation and groundwater pumping needs to fulfil water demand in conjunctive use operation fig 14 also shows the predicted monthly seepage a time delay is predicted between the maximum diverted inflow and maximum expected seepage this delay in recharge makes groundwater a reliable and slowly depleting resource while the available surface water in the reservoir is diminishing at a faster rate 4 conclusions we presented a methodology based on modelling solutions for optimizing the bar off stream man made reservoir operations considering seepage losses to the aquifer to ensure that water demand is satisfied and all planned reservoir objectives are met in our analysis the integration of well known methods such as numerical groundwater flow modelling and optimization models provided information on the reliability of the supply of a pre defined optimal release and also on the monthly volume of additional intentional groundwater recharge based on our calculations the water demand may then be satisfied by the reservoir release in conjunction with groundwater withdrawal of the increased recharge in only three months the whole water infrastructure surface water reservoir and managed aquifer recharge is not theoretically able to fulfill the demand considering the on time recharged volume in that case the missing part of the demand will have to be covered by the volume previously recharged exploiting the water banking capacity in the aquifer of a managed aquifer recharge scheme the modelling method proposed in this study can be adapted to any artificial lake system to enhance its operation planning and management as it can provide accurate assessment of the effects of operational releases on lakebed seepage with this paper we aim at pointing out the importance for potential conjunctive use of surface and ground water in water scarce areas by exploiting reservoir infrastructures where the leakage losses are relevant also for creating additional aquifer storage in such systems man induced changes of lake stages mainly dependent on temporally variable balance between inflow and regulated outflow can significantly affect the volume of water that seeps through the basin floor the infiltrated water constitutes an additional storage volume reliable for coping with the demand or for water banking purposes the aquifer under managed aquifer recharge operations may then provide the resource not satisfied by the reservoir release hence fulfilling 100 reliability of water supply finally the potential conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater by improving water security may open new sustainability views for leaking reservoirs even if they were not initially designed for increasing

8327,study region malawi study focus the adoption of the united nations sustainable development goal 6 in 2016 has triggered countries across the globe to assess and improve management and use of water resources monitoring of these resources is becoming increasingly important and the management of transboundary water resources in particular groundwater aquifers required to meet sdg target 6 5 2 is lagging behind it is vital to assess and manage these resources in a sustainable manner within an integrated water resource management approach transboundary aquifer assessments have largely focused on the regional scale which is not sufficient for countries to manage their transboundary aquifers effectively this paper focuses on results of a national transboundary aquifer unit assessment in malawi as a case study to support the countries plans for achieving sustainable development goal 6 5 2 new hydrological insights for the region we have identified 38 new transboundary aquifer units shared between malawi and its neighbours these results can form the basis for future transboundary aquifer management between malawi and its neighbouring countries we also highlight the current limitations of transboundary aquifer assessments and management that should be addressed to achieve sdg 6 5 2 these include institutional mechanisms limited cross border data sharing limited groundwater monitoring and a need to revisit the wording of the transboundary focused sdg target and its indicators keywords transboundary aquifer groundwater sustainable development goals africa

resource management and furthermore identifies that transboundary cooperation can play an important role in this un water 2015 transboundary aquifer s tba s have long been known to store and transmit large volumes of groundwater from one country or state to another it is important to identify those groundwater aquifers that may be transboundary in order to manage them effectively in conjunction with surface water within an iwrm framework tba assessments internationally have been largely focused on the regional scale ilec et al 2016 rivera and candela 2018 there are exceptions such as the milk river formation between canada and the united states pétré et al 2016 2015 the guarani aquifer system and the ramotswa and stampriet aquifer systems de los cobos 2018 nijsten et al 2018a b the main driving force for international tba assessments is the unesco ihp united nations educational scientific and cultural organization international hydrological programme through the internationally shared aquifer resources management isarm initiative and the international groundwater resources assessment centre igrac igrac publishes a transboundary aquifers of the world map with all known tbas displayed based on the most recent inventory results from projects globally this compilation of international data constitutes a valuable starting point for governments a large proportion of tba s

sets and financial resources that are not always available to regions with low economic income as is the case for a large proportion of africa fraser et al 2018 advocates for countries to conduct a full national border based assessment of transboundary aquifers at both local and national scale in order to more directly apply transboundary associated sustainable integrated water resource management iwrm within malawi a landlocked country in the south eastern region of africa there was a need to identify tba units to support the government with water resource management while setting goals to achieve sdg 6 5 2 malawi as a case study could be representative of other countries with similar financial circumstances or hydrogeology characteristics with less than 1 400m3 year of available total renewable water resources per person fraser et al 2018 malawi is also one of the most water stressed countries in the world more so than botswana and namibia countries that contain large areas of desert within them with its growing population of 2 9 per year climate change and land degradation the total available renewable water resources will decline further government of malawi 2018 by identifying all potential transboundary aquifer units that cross malawi s international borders shared with zambia tanzania and mozambique management strategies can be employed to target vulnerable areas and populations the understanding of malawi s groundwater resources is still within its infancy although aquifer delineation has been conducted and productivity is well understood specific characteristics including aquifer thickness depth to water table recharge and discharge zones connectivity to surface waters groundwater flow direction groundwater contamination natural groundwater quality etc are either not reported or poorly understood to an appropriate level for sustainable management this makes the challenge of identification and descriptions of transboundary aquifers even more challenging moving forward on national based transboundary aquifer assessments our work in evaluating the significance of local transboundary groundwater seeks to account for the expected discontinuous nature of the basement complex arising from the complex comprising of multiple lithologies and will consider the differences between the weathered and fractured zones within the basement complex to evaluate the significance of transboundary groundwater exchange fraser et al 2018 finally a discussion of limitations to transboundary aquifer assessments both within the developing world context and internationally is presented we highlight multiple challenges that must be addressed moving forward to achieve more reliable and detailed tba assessments the aims within the paper are thus to present the results of a national border based assessment of malawi s transboundary aquifer units describe the identified transboundary aquifer units shared between malawi and its neighbours alongside data gaps that will require addressing to move forward present a discussion of methodology limitations identifying issues such as cross border data harmonization and mapping consistency discuss the implication of these results within the sdg agenda 2 methodology the approach used for this study was to collect and synthesise all available literature and data relating to the transboundary aquifers shared between malawi and its neighbours and to then create an initial interpretation of the tba s along the entire malawian national border that can provide a foundation for future more directed work it is the first of its kind to assess transboundary aquifers across all of a countries international borders at one scale using the same method geological and hydrogeological maps have been used alongside literature and raw data in order to build a coherent picture of malawi s transboundary aquifer situation building on the previous regional tba assessment igrac 2015 through the twap this study aims to provide a more detailed review of transboundary aquifers as a starting point for national scale and localised management it is important to note this interpretation only accounts for land based aquifers and thus the potential transboundary aquifer units that reside partly under lake malawi have not been identified due to the lack of geological or hydrogeological data underneath lake malawi fig 1 has been developed to underline the process of national border based transboundary aquifer assessments within an overall framework for assessing transboundary aquifers within a single country for multi scale management this study represents stage 1 of the process with future research and work needed to complete stages 2 and 3 2 1 geological and hydrogeological correlation the common hydrogeological principle that aquifers are defined by lithology changes was adopted to interpret which aquifer units within malawi crossed its international borders malawian geological maps 1 250 000 scale geological survey of malawi 1970 and hydrogeological maps 1 250 000 scale government of malawi 1987 were georeferenced in qgis and aligned with mozambique hydrogeological maps 1 1 000000 scale ferro and bouman 1987a and b zambia geological and productivity maps 1 1 000 000 scale geological survey department of zambia 1975 deltares and aurecon 2016 and finally tanzanian geological maps 1 125 000 scale geological survey of tanzania 1953 correlated geological lithological units between malawi mozambique zambia and tanzania are provided in supplementary material 1 cross border geological harmonization although effective has some limitations and multiple assumptions were made in order to interpret the geological and hydrogeological data different methods of naming geological formations caused confusion and different scales of available data meant interpolation was required at some points although this methodology provides a starting point for resource limited countries to initially assess their tba s if tba assessments are to improve and assist in the achievement of sdg 6 significant investment will have to be made in order to minimise the assumptions and limitations in future analysis to conduct the geological and hydrogeological harmonization effectively multiple assumptions were needed and refining of these assumptions with further data would naturally allow for updated interpretation the assumptions are a water bearing geological unit as identified by any country if transboundary is assumed to also be water bearing in the neighbouring country and potential for cross border flow of groundwater where possible the basement complex has been subdivided into different lithologies however due to limited data in zambia this was not always possible where not possible weathered fractured basement units are separated in malawi and assumed to continue into zambia mineral composition of different basement complex units means they weather differently thus creating different aquifers properties 2 2 transboundary aquifer delineation known water bearing units were identified and those that crossed malawi s international border were assigned details of lithology average yield and productivity where aquifer units crossed malawi s border and matching geology and hydrogeology conditions within the neighbouring country existed this was deemed to be a transboundary aquifer unit hydrogeological characteristics of each aquifer were then identified including lithology surface area extent productivity potential surface water connections water quality and finally groundwater flow direction using piezometric surface maps 2 3 data gaps data gaps were noted upon identification and description of the transboundary aquifers in many of the sparsely populated areas of malawi and its neighbours literature on groundwater quality and availability was limited a lack of monitoring boreholes throughout malawi and its neighbouring countries makes it difficult to establish if groundwater levels along the borders are depleting advancements in mapping and geological and hydrogeological understanding in malawi may allow re interpretation in support of sdg6 3 results results indicate that there is a total of 38 transboundary aquifer units shared between malawi and its neighbours figs 1 and 2 26 of these tba s are with mozambique 2 with mozambique and zambia 4 with zambia 3 with zambia and tanzania and finally 3 with tanzania malawi shares most of its transboundary aquifers with mozambique and the least with zambia the aquifers hydrogeology ranges in productivity and the large majority of malawi is covered in low yielding basement aquifers there are however multiple smaller high yielding aquifers formed from alluvial and karroo deposits that form productive and important local water sources 3 1 geological and hydrogeological correlation the geology and hydrogeology of malawi and its neighbouring countries has been previously described fraser et al 2018 smith carrington and chilton 1983 upton et al 2016 the tba s range in lithology s encompassing weathered basement complex fractured basement complex the karoo sediments the karoo basalts and quaternary alluvial deposits fig 2 as expected the large majority of malawi s aquifers are transboundary due to the small size of the landlocked nature of malawi a gap within central malawi can be seen in fig 3 where there have been no identified tba s as many of the aquifers within this area are small and localized and the little is known of the hydrogeology under lake malawi 3 2 transboundary aquifer unit descriptions the identified transboundary aquifers are summarized in table 1 separated by aquifer type and assigned a unique tba number each aquifer type is described as follows 3 2 1 unconsolidated aquifers the unconsolidated aquifers are composed of alluvial and colluvium lithologies there are a total of 3 alluvial transboundary aquifers and 5 colluvial aquifers that extend across malawi s borders fig 2c often lying unconformably on top of other lithologies these aquifers are the youngest within malawi the unconsolidated transboundary aquifers of malawi are widespread across the country most reside in the south of malawi shared with mozambique and there is 1 colluvium aquifer shared in the central region with zambia and another 2 in the north these aquifers tend to be small compared to larger basement aquifers but are the most highly productive quaternary alluvial deposits are composed of clays silts sands and gravels deposited in the floor of the east african rift system ears rift valley and along river plains un 1989 the lithology of the deposits is highly variable heterogeneous and anisotropic the composition changes considerably over short distances due to the nature of their deposition from outwash fans floor plains and river channels mkandawire 2002 the mineral assemblages of these alluvium suggest that they are derived from the precambrian basement complex primarily from the gneiss habgood 1963 the presence of clays meant that good yields with high water quality is only present within the gravel beds of the units where permeability was good habgood 1963 and artesian water pressures may exist in places due confinement below clay layers the depth of saturation within these aquifers varies seasonally the water table depth is typically between 5 and 10 m below ground chavula et al 2012 and thickness can range from 40 to 150 m un 1989 smith carrington and chilton 1983 the transmissivity ranges from 50 to 300 m2 day hydraulic conductivity for sands and gravels is between 10 20 m day specific yield ranges between 3 10 smith carrington and chilton 1983 the alluvial deposits are recharged through rainfall which is spatially variable depending on location some additional recharge also comes from seepage of riverbeds that are permeable kelly et al 2019b these aquifers are unconfined when colluvium do not cover them lying on alluvial deposits and weathered basement colluvium is also found these are superficial deposits of residual soils formed by soil creep these are commonly thin deposits but are quite extensive across malawi hydraulic conductivity for the poorly sorted clayley and colluvial sands ranges between 1 5 m day with specific yield ranging between 3 10 smith carrington and chilton 1983 3 2 2 karoo sequence within the western portion of the shire river basin in the southwest of the valley a small section of transboundary karoo sequence rocks exist there are a total of 8 aquifers here composed of a combination of both basalts and sedimentary units fig 2d many of these aquifers are localised they lie unconformably on crystalline basement and are fault bound on the malawi side of the border due to the influence of the east african rift system ferro and bouman 1987a in the north there is 1 other transboundary karoo sedimentary aquifer shared with tanzania the karoo stormberg volcanics represent the upper part of the karoo sequence they encompass a series of microporphyritic to glomeroporphyritic tholeiitic basaltic lava flows dill 2007 often interbedded with bands of sandstone habgood 1963 permeable and porous layers exist between consecutive lava flows interbedded with layers of sandstone and tuff un 1989 the flows are often vesiculated towards the top of top and in filled with calcite and quartz habgood 1963 within the centre of the karoo weathered basalts the unit is impermeable however because of interstitial spaces at contacts between flow there are zones where permeability is very high this is due to vesicular cavities providing a flow path for the water habgood 1964 furthermore jointing and faulting of the lava flows has resulted in fracturing that increases permeability further groundwater movement through the basalts is fairly rapid as illustrated through the high quality and low mineralization of the water with yields above 1 1 l s habgood 1964 these may form moderate productivity local aquifers the karoo sedimentary rocks can be subdivided into three distinct units the basal beds composed of conglomerates and sandstones a sequence of sandstones mudstones shales and coal seams in the middle and grits arkose sandstones shales mudstones and marls in the upper section the upper successions tend to be cemented by calcite and the primary porosity is low permeable horizons are related to secondary fracturing the karoo sediments are thought to have an estimated thickness of 500 m bradford 1973 un 1989 the karoo sedimentary rock outcrops tend to be relatively small and not vastly abundant despite this the units tend to exhibit high permeability and tends to be highly fractured the rocks of the karoo are generally well cemented with low porosity and intergranular permeability groundwater storage and flow occurs largely in fractures in the rocks groundwater levels are typically 20 m 30 m below ground surface un 1989 these rocks may form a low to moderate productivity local aquifer the groundwater quality of the karoo sediments tends to be highly variable depending on location and depth ranging from freshwater to extremely saline water within the south of malawi the karoo aquifers tend to be either dominated by calcium carbonate or sodium chloride influenced water types 3 2 3 fractured basement complex there are 13 unique sub sets of fractured basement complex transboundary aquifers identified within this study they extend across the entire of malawi predominantly in the center of the country along the border shared with zambia and along the southeast border shared with mozambique fig 2a precambrian crystalline basement rocks are gneiss and granulite with some metamorphic schists quartzites and marbles un 1989 the basement complex is intruded by dykes and other igneous lithologies un 1989 the large majority of malawi is underlain by these rock units that have undergone several deformation and metamorphic phases that has affected large areas of africa cannon et al 1969 due to their resistance to erosion they often form much of the elevated regions in malawi in the north and west of malawi the basement complex exists as lower grade metamorphic rocks those in the south were originally mudstone sandstone and conglomerates it is most likely that these rocks are from a sedimentary origin pre metamorphism bloomfield 1968 due to recrystallization during deformation the basement rocks have been rendered with both low primary porosity and permeability the fractured basement complex aquifers store groundwater in fractures secondary porosity associated with geologically weak zones easily disintegrated into individual blocks bounded by fractures and joints fraser et al 2018 these zones are associated with particular geological structures like folds faults and fractures displaying relatively high permeability along dikes intruding the basement complex aquifers can also develop in the fracture zone on the contact between the intrusive body and the adjacent rocks the un fractured parts of the dikes often form impermeable barriers ferro and bouman 1987a b it is probable that the basement complex aquifers provide baseflow for many of the country s surface watercourses and despite the semi confined nature of the surface clays recharge is most likely to come in the form of rainfall infiltration kelly et al 2019a b smith carrington and chilton 1983 conductivity borehole logging and analysis of boreholes tapping the basement complex aquifer suggests water quality layering within the units distinct layering with considerable lateral variation is evident suggesting that there may be more than one water type within some aquifers furthermore in some localized areas there is evidence of mixing of these different water types smith carrington and chilton 1983 these units tend to yield 0 5 0 8 l s from around 30 45 m depths this is often enough to supply local villages but not regional areas habgood 1964 the water acquired is of good quality with low salinity often these aquifer units are not reached when drilling due to being too deep resulting in high expense habgood 1964 kalin et al 2019 locally some parts of the aquifer units do tend to exhibit saline water this does not appear to be related to the rock composition and is more likely caused by evaporation and mineralization along fault zones rivett et al 2018 overall the units do tend to exhibit low mineralization regionally and this suggests that recharge is recent fractured basement complex lithology s are discontinuous resulting in local aquifers as opposed to large scale regional aquifers fraser et al 2018 although low yielding these aquifers are often an important local groundwater resource and therefore must be considered locally within the context of sustainable development goal 6 3 2 4 weathered basement complex there are 8 weathered basement complex aquifers shared between malawi and its neighbours these saprolitic units range in size from smaller more local scale aquifers in the very south and north of malawi to larger more regionally significant aquifers in the south east fig 2b formed of the same geological lithologies as the fractured basement aquifers the weathered aquifers differ in the type of secondary saprolitic porosity exhibited to store water the process of weather involves the breakdown of the bedrock through chemical and physical factors the occurrence of coarse grained or heterogeneous rocks as well as soluble marbles or the existence of contacts between rock types of different nature also facilitate weathering the weathered basement aquifers are best developed in topographical highs within malawi smith carrington and chilton 1983 it can be divided into 3 distinctive layers the laterite layer which is composed of mainly red clay or completely weathered silt the saprolite layer which is composed of quartzitic clayey sand or heavily weathered fine to coarse sand and medium weathered layer in which rock mass is separated into fragments or small blocks by groundwater infiltrating into joints of rock zauyah et al 2010 smith carrington and chilton 1983 the best yielding layer is the medium saprolite layer and it occurs between 15 30 m the aquifer thickness or the occurrence depth is very variable due to topographic conditions weathering is controlled by the rock type and structure slope regional climate lithology and mineral type the spacing between joints and the degree of rock mass spellman and stoudt 2013 smith carrington and chilton 1983 un 1989 as an example gneiss and granulites are coarse grained with quartz minerals weathering of these units provides a good water bearing capacity schist syenite and gabbro on the other hand exhibit clay minerals and poor water bearing capacities smith carrington and chilton 1983 weathered basement aquifer transmissivities are generally in the range of 5 to 35 m2 day with estimated hydraulic conductivities ranging from 0 01 to 1 m d the storage coefficient on the other hand has been assumed to range from 0 01 to 0 001 mkandawire 2004 these aquifers are under unconfined to confined conditions borehole yields are generally highest where the saturated thickness of the weathered zone is greatest and the parent bedrock coarsest chilton and smith carington 1984 in general the weathered basement aquifer produces low borehole yields chilton and smith carington 1984 3 3 data gaps although the basic hydrogeological characteristics of the transboundary aquifers are understood table 1 a number of data gaps have been highlighted throughout this study the lack of monitoring boreholes in place to monitor groundwater levels means that potential groundwater depletion within these aquifers is unknown this makes it difficult to determine whether a transboundary aquifer is under stress or at risk of abstraction becoming unsustainable there is also limited data available on the use of groundwater although it is well established that a large proportion of malawi s rural communities rely on groundwater as their primary drinking water source other uses of groundwater are poorly understood other vital information such as recharge and discharge zones of these transboundary aquifers are inadequately investigated this will pose problems if malawi and a neighbouring country were to want to foster an agreement over one of their shared aquifers as international recharge and discharge can play an important role in the conceptualisation of a transboundary aquifer and will direct the appropriate legal frameworks required to direct the aquifer agreement within malawi some studies have been done looking at the hydraulic connections that exist between groundwater and surface water however these are still in their infancy and still require further attention furthermore evidence of groundwater contamination within these aquifers is only viable for those aquifers that have been tested the assumption that no record of contamination means no contamination should not be taken within malawi there is also a north south divide on the amount of research and field investigations done to assess and understand groundwater resources the center and south of malawi is more densely populated than the north and this has contributed to the majority of research funding being directed in these areas the shire river valley and its related river basins aquifers and catchments are also an important water and energy supply in the region that has subsequently led to a focus on this area for research the lack of data in the north of malawi in relation to the south has resulted in a diminished understanding of the water resources in the north which contributes to the shortage of transboundary understanding 4 discussion the results of this study indicate that there are many more small scale transboundary aquifers in malawi and likely across africa than previously thought this is important as current management structures in place within these countries often do not facilitate local scale transboundary management studies of this scale are also hindered by multiple limitations data availability is a major issue in many countries and this case study is not exempt as previously discussed alongside this the detail of geological and hydrogeological maps that require harmonization across the border at this scale is much more complex resulting in increased difficulty in interpretation of aquifer units additionally mapping consistence and different approaches to lithology delineation complicates harmonization further the importance of transboundary water management has been recognised within the sustainable development goal agenda target 6 5 2 specifically refers to transboundary water by 2030 implement integrated water resources management at all levels including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate un water 2015 the nature of integrated water resource management demands both surface and groundwater to be considered in a holistic management approach un water 2017b historically the management of surface water has received comparatively more attention than groundwater eckstein and sindico 2014 this could be due to the simplicity in determining whether a lake or river crosses a political boundary and the complexity of detailed study of hydrogeological units and groundwater flow it is important to identify those groundwater aquifers that may be transboundary in order to manage them effectively in conjunction with surface water within an iwrm framework it can be argued the current sdg agenda for transboundary groundwater management is premature this study alone shows that transboundary aquifers are still not understood at an effective level of detail for local management and national agreements the expectation on countries to not only investigate identify and establish a formal agreement over the use and management of these aquifers by 2030 appear to be a stretched target especially given that only 6 formal agreements are currently in place over transboundary aquifers rivera and candela 2018 there is an inherent risk the sdg agenda will rush the transboundary aquifer identification process up and detail is missed if detailed transboundary aquifer assessments like the one in this study are not undertaken generalized regional assessments will be relied upon that may not be fit for purpose a key objective of the sdg s is leave no one behind and therefore the localization of the policy and management of resources in line with sdg s must be a corner stone of national implementation strategy united national committee for development policy uncdp 2018 relying on generalized regional groundwater assessments will lead to poor or miss management of the groundwater that are highly important at the local level transboundary aquifer assessments are also still restricted by data limitations lack of cross bored data sharing harmonizing cross border hydrogeological data and limited groundwater monitoring practices fraser et al 2018 additionally developing countries are faced with financial and capacity limitations that require national prioritisation under the sdg s which further inhibits tba agreement development the wording of sdg target 6 5 2 leaves potential for gaps in the interpretation the target calls for transboundary cooperation within integrated water resource management at all levels as appropriate however the indicator for the target only measures the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational agreement mccracken and meyer 2018 firstly groundwater aquifers do not necessarily follow surface water river basins and therefore the target has failed to identify this key differential fraser et al 2018 primarily focusing on the surface river basin level diminishes the importance of local cooperation of groundwater use by a substantial percentage of the population base there is no guidance over what constitutes the need for transboundary cooperation within the sdg agenda and if there was it would likely focus on reactive measures than proactive as integrated water resource management promotes reactive measures to water conflict instead of focusing on preventative approaches jarvis 2010 furthermore some aquifers or indeed large areas of aquifers may not require an agreement over their use and management due to lack of usage or low dependency rates fraser et al 2018 the sgd 6 5 target indicator calls for the percentage of a basin under an operational agreement to be calculated the term operational requires any arrangement to include regular exchange of data regular formal communication between parties a joint management plan and a joint body or mechanism to oversee the arrangement un water 2017a in mccracken and meyer 2018 operational agreements of this manner and at this scale will require strong governance and institutions to implement them aligning the sgd s indicators with already in place institutional mechanisms will speed up this process however there are relatively few institutional mechanisms designed to manage transboundary groundwater resources often these tools generally exist at the sub national level linton and brooks 2011 feitelson 2003 in ganoulis and fried 2018 in order to be effective cooperation needs to happen at all scales unesco 2016 most examples of transboundary institutional mechanisms come in the form of joint bodies commissions committees created for river basin based cooperation case studies include 1 the international commission on the scheldt river that was set up to strengthen transboundary cooperation over the quality of the scheldt river basin district that runs through france brussels and the netherlands machard de gramont et al 2001 2 the nile basin initiative that brings member states residing within the basin together for consultation and coordination of sustainable management and development of shared water within the basin un and unesco 2018 3 the okavango river basin water commission that established the okavango delta management plan through engaging with stakeholders such as communities of the delta users of the resource governments and management institutions un and unesco 2018 4 the orange senqu river commission formed following signing the agreement for the establishment of the orange senqu river commission between botswana lesotho namibia and south africa established to promote equitable and sustainable development of the resources of the orange senqu river basin including groundwater by proxy unesco ihp 2016 5 the north south ministerial council that was formed as a response to the belfast agreement fostered between northern ireland and the republic of ireland that encourages cross border cooperation between the two nations including over shared water recourses fraser et al 2020 a common factor that is evident is that most institutional mechanisms that deal with transboundary groundwater governance are at the river basin level and have been initially driven by the desire for surface water management with groundwater included as an addition it is also often unclear within these mandates whether or not groundwater within the basin limits but not hydraulically connected to the surface waters are included unesco ihp 2016 specific examples of effective institutional governance mechanisms dealing with just groundwater have developed as a consequence of international scale projects such as the governance for groundwater resources in transboundary aquifers ggreta project developing tools such as multi country cooperation mechanisms mccm a dedicated instrument to deal with transboundary groundwater management that can be nested within another institution in ggreta s case within the orange senqu river commission unesco ihp 2016 similarly the ramotswa and shire conwat project both utilize joint strategic action plans to identify and prioritize investment and actions that can be implemented for transboundary groundwater management with their respective regions sadc gmi 2016 iwmi 2019 more pertinent to the malawi case study the southern african development community sadc has been progressive with its stance on transboundary water cooperation through its water division by developing a regional water strategy that provides a strategic framework for sustainable use protection and control of both national and transboundary water resources within the region and the implementation of the revised protocol for shared watercourses 2000 that aims to foster close cooperation between member states over their shared water resources sadc 2003 most recently the sadc groundwater management institute a not for profit based in south africa representing all sadc member states was established to promote sustainable groundwater management within the region build national and regional institutional capacity lead national and regional coordination and improve knowledge management a large part of its work is transboundary focused sadc gmi 2016 iwmi 2019 93 2 of malawi s territorial area and 86 1 of its population republic of malawi ministry of agriculture irrigation and water development moaiwd 2014 resides within the zambezi river basin and is party to the zamcom agreement an agreement that sets out to foster cooperation from riparian states over the transboundary management of the surface water and groundwater within the basin sadc dw zambezi river authority 2008 moving forward an option for this commission may be to set up a hydrogeological working group that can represent transboundary groundwater issues at the international level an effective working example of this is the orasecom hydrological group within the commission nijsten et al 2018a b although almost all of their transboundary aquifers reside within this transboundary basin malawi is yet to accede the zamcom agreement into policy zamcom 2019 it must do so in order to move forward with transboundary cooperation at the binational level these institutional frameworks discussed must be underpinned by local scale mechanisms local stakeholder involvement and local scale governance mechanisms are vital as those involved are often closest to the problem at hand and most impacted by poor resourse management moench et al 2012 the most common local scale water governance mechanism is community based management cbm whaley et al 2019 the cbm model is based on the concept of the local community managing their own water resources often through the maintenance of water points such as hand pumped boreholes cbm was initially intended to provide a sense of ownership through local participation through water point committees benito et al 2010 and account for decentralized governmental systems in many areas of africa truselove et al 2019 however research has suggested that the burden and services contained within cmb cannot be sustained long term and that there is an issue of meeting the sdg s and sustainable financing for maintenance under a cbm approach truselove et al 2019 2020 community based management is also rarely seen at the formal transboundary level any transboundary cooperation is often informal and thus unrecorded and rendered ineffectual for the sdg mandate as previously noted many of malawi s transboundary aquifers are localised and therefore generalised policies at international basin level are not appropriate in these cases national policy that supports local level iwrm management strategies would be more effective moving forward it may also be practical to identify particular vulnerable areas of transboundary aquifers that require management rather than choosing to manage an entire aquifer sdg 6 5 2 will require a formal agreement and it is vital these recognise local dependence and vulnerabilities without the approach presented here generalised transboundary agreements will likely hinder local level development progress 5 conclusions and the way forward the adoption of the sustainable development goals has driven forward the importance of localisation of policy planning and management and for goal 6 the need for sustainable and integrated transboundary aquifer management this paper presents an approach to transboundary aquifer assessment at local level that supports malawi as a case study and other countries to assess their border for transboundary aquifers shared with neighbours it relies on the use of detailed geological and hydrogeological data alongside literature and groundwater studies in malawi 38 transboundary aquifers of local to national importance were identified as being shared between malawi and its neighbouring countries an increase from the previous 3 identified demonstrating the complexity lost in regional scale assessments these aquifers vary in lithology productivity and extent across the country but all are locally important for water access to rural populations local agriculture and sustainable water resources the assessment took into account the discontinuous nature of the basement complex arising from the complex comprising of multiple lithologies and the differences between the weathered and fractured zones within the basement complex these results form the basis for future transboundary aquifer studies and discussions around management and agreement between malawi and its neighbouring countries to set targets to achieve sdg 6 moving forward it will be important to ensure that local level transboundary aquifer assessments inform sdg 6 5 2 it will also be essential to ensure that specific vulnerable areas or ecosystems or populations using these aquifers are identified monitored and managed effectively this could be in the form of zoning or potentially geospatial gis hotspot analysis it will also be important to consider that large scale aquifers likely have smaller areas of concern that require management and that these are likely to reside close to the border and have a community level impact engaging these stakeholders and building capacity in these areas will be essential for local scale management credit authorship contribution statement christina m fraser conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology project administration

8327,study region malawi study focus the adoption of the united nations sustainable development goal 6 in 2016 has triggered countries across the globe to assess and improve management and use of water resources monitoring of these resources is becoming increasingly important and the management of transboundary water resources in particular groundwater aquifers required to meet sdg target 6 5 2 is lagging behind it is vital to assess and manage these resources in a sustainable manner within an integrated water resource management approach transboundary aquifer assessments have largely focused on the regional scale which is not sufficient for countries to manage their transboundary aquifers effectively this paper focuses on results of a national transboundary aquifer unit assessment in malawi as a case study to support the countries plans for achieving sustainable development goal 6 5 2 new hydrological insights for the region we have identified 38 new transboundary aquifer units shared between malawi and its neighbours these results can form the basis for future transboundary aquifer management between malawi and its neighbouring countries we also highlight the current limitations of transboundary aquifer assessments and management that should be addressed to achieve sdg 6 5 2 these include institutional mechanisms limited cross border data sharing limited groundwater monitoring and a need to revisit the wording of the transboundary focused sdg target and its indicators keywords transboundary aquifer groundwater sustainable development goals africa

main driving force for international tba assessments is the unesco ihp united nations educational scientific and cultural organization international hydrological programme through the internationally shared aquifer resources management isarm initiative and the international groundwater resources assessment centre igrac igrac publishes a transboundary aquifers of the world map with all known tbas displayed based on the most recent inventory results from projects globally this compilation of international data constitutes a valuable starting point for governments a large proportion of tba s within africa were identified through the global environment facility transboundary waters assessment program gef twap regional assessments ilec et al 2016 the aim of the gef twap was to provide the first global scale assessment of transboundary waters gef twap regional assessments were carried out by an appropriate representative from each country then collected and streamlined by the project it is estimated that 40 of the world s population relies on transboundary groundwater as their primary drinking supply management however of tba s is still within its infancy both at a national and international level out of 678 tba s identified worldwide only 6 have an agreement governing their use and management rivera and candela 2018 within africa the gef twap identified 80 tba s of this 80 only 1 tba has an agreement governing the use of it transboundary management is important in africa as 75 of the continent relies solely on groundwater as its primary water supply for agriculture irrigation and drinking altchenko and villholth 2013 in order to manage these resources properly sufficient transboundary aquifer assessments must be carried out these often require substantial data sets and financial resources that are not always available to regions with low economic income as is the case for a large proportion of africa fraser et al 2018 advocates for countries to conduct a full national border based assessment of transboundary aquifers at both local and national scale in order to more directly apply transboundary associated sustainable integrated water resource management iwrm within malawi a landlocked country in the south eastern region of africa there was a need to identify tba units to support the government with water resource management while setting goals to achieve sdg 6 5 2 malawi as a case study could be representative of other countries with similar financial circumstances or hydrogeology characteristics with less than 1 400m3 year of available total renewable water resources per person fraser et al 2018 malawi is also one of the most water stressed countries in the world more so than botswana and namibia countries that contain large areas of desert within them with its growing population of 2 9 per year climate change and land degradation the total available renewable water resources will decline further government of malawi 2018 by identifying all potential transboundary aquifer units that cross malawi s international borders shared with zambia tanzania and mozambique management strategies can be employed to target vulnerable areas and populations the understanding of malawi s groundwater resources is still within its infancy although aquifer delineation has been conducted and productivity is well understood specific characteristics including aquifer thickness depth to water table recharge and discharge zones connectivity to surface waters groundwater flow direction groundwater contamination natural groundwater quality etc are either not reported or poorly understood to an appropriate level for sustainable management this makes the challenge of identification and descriptions of transboundary aquifers even more challenging moving forward on national based transboundary aquifer assessments our work in evaluating the significance of local transboundary groundwater seeks to account for the expected discontinuous nature of the basement complex arising from the complex comprising of multiple lithologies and will consider the differences between the weathered and fractured zones within the basement complex to evaluate the significance of transboundary groundwater exchange fraser et al 2018 finally a discussion of limitations to transboundary aquifer assessments both within the developing world context and internationally is presented we highlight multiple challenges that must be addressed moving forward to achieve more reliable and detailed tba assessments the aims within the paper are thus to present the results of a national border based assessment of malawi s transboundary aquifer units describe the identified transboundary aquifer units shared between malawi and its neighbours alongside data gaps that will require addressing to move forward present a discussion of methodology limitations identifying issues such as cross border data harmonization and mapping consistency discuss the implication of these results within the sdg agenda 2 methodology the approach used for this study was to collect and synthesise all available literature and data relating to the transboundary aquifers shared between malawi and its neighbours and to then create an initial interpretation of the tba s along the entire malawian national border that can provide a foundation for future more directed work it is the first of its kind to assess transboundary aquifers across all of a countries international borders at one scale using the same method geological and hydrogeological maps have been used alongside literature and raw data in order to build a coherent picture of malawi s transboundary aquifer situation building on the previous regional tba assessment igrac 2015 through the twap this study aims to provide a more detailed review of transboundary aquifers as a starting point for national scale and localised management it is important to note this interpretation only accounts for land based aquifers and thus the potential transboundary aquifer units that reside partly under lake malawi have not been identified due to the lack of geological or hydrogeological data underneath lake malawi fig 1 has been developed to underline the process of national border based transboundary aquifer assessments within an overall framework for assessing transboundary aquifers within a single country for multi scale management this study represents stage 1 of the process with future research and work needed to complete stages 2 and 3 2 1 geological and hydrogeological correlation the common hydrogeological principle that aquifers are defined by lithology changes was adopted to interpret which aquifer units within malawi crossed its international borders malawian geological maps 1 250 000 scale geological survey of malawi 1970 and hydrogeological maps 1 250 000 scale government of malawi 1987 were georeferenced in qgis and aligned with mozambique hydrogeological maps 1 1 000000 scale ferro and bouman 1987a and b zambia geological and productivity maps 1 1 000 000 scale geological survey department of zambia 1975 deltares and aurecon 2016 and finally tanzanian geological maps 1 125 000 scale geological survey of tanzania 1953 correlated geological lithological units between malawi mozambique zambia and tanzania are provided in supplementary material 1 cross border geological harmonization although effective has some limitations and multiple assumptions were made in order to interpret the geological and hydrogeological data different methods of naming geological formations caused confusion and different scales of available data meant interpolation was required at some points although this methodology provides a starting point for resource limited countries to initially assess their tba s if tba assessments are to improve and assist in the achievement of sdg 6 significant investment will have to be made in order to minimise the assumptions and limitations in future analysis to conduct the geological and hydrogeological harmonization effectively multiple assumptions were needed and refining of these assumptions with further data would naturally allow for updated interpretation the assumptions are a water bearing geological unit as identified by any country if transboundary is assumed to also be water bearing in the neighbouring country and potential for cross border flow of groundwater where possible the basement complex has been subdivided into different lithologies however due to limited data in zambia this was not always possible where not possible weathered fractured basement units are separated in malawi and assumed to continue into zambia mineral composition of different basement complex units means they weather differently thus creating different aquifers properties 2 2 transboundary aquifer delineation known water bearing units were identified and those that crossed malawi s international border were assigned details of lithology average yield and productivity where aquifer units crossed malawi s border and matching geology and hydrogeology conditions within the neighbouring country existed this was deemed to be a transboundary aquifer unit hydrogeological characteristics of each aquifer were then identified including lithology surface area extent productivity potential surface water connections water quality and finally groundwater flow direction using piezometric surface maps 2 3 data gaps data gaps were noted upon identification and description of the transboundary aquifers in many of the sparsely populated areas of malawi and its neighbours literature on groundwater quality and availability was limited a lack of monitoring boreholes throughout malawi and its neighbouring countries makes it difficult to establish if groundwater levels along the borders are depleting advancements in mapping and geological and hydrogeological understanding in malawi may allow re interpretation in support of sdg6 3 results results indicate that there is a total of 38 transboundary aquifer units shared between malawi and its neighbours figs 1 and 2 26 of these tba s are with mozambique 2 with mozambique and zambia 4 with zambia 3 with zambia and tanzania and finally 3 with tanzania malawi shares most of its transboundary aquifers with mozambique and the least with zambia the aquifers hydrogeology ranges in productivity and the large majority of malawi is covered in low yielding basement aquifers there are however multiple smaller high yielding aquifers formed from alluvial and karroo deposits that form productive and important local water sources 3 1 geological and hydrogeological correlation the geology and hydrogeology of malawi and its neighbouring countries has been previously described fraser et al 2018 smith carrington and chilton 1983 upton et al 2016 the tba s range in lithology s encompassing weathered basement complex fractured basement complex the karoo sediments the karoo basalts and quaternary alluvial deposits fig 2 as expected the large majority of malawi s aquifers are transboundary due to the small size of the landlocked nature of malawi a gap within central malawi can be seen in fig 3 where there have been no identified tba s as many of the aquifers within this area are small and localized and the little is known of the hydrogeology under lake malawi 3 2 transboundary aquifer unit descriptions the identified transboundary aquifers are summarized in table 1 separated by aquifer type and assigned a unique tba number each aquifer type is described as follows 3 2 1 unconsolidated aquifers the unconsolidated aquifers are composed of alluvial and colluvium lithologies there are a total of 3 alluvial transboundary aquifers and 5 colluvial aquifers that extend across malawi s borders fig 2c often lying unconformably on top of other lithologies these aquifers are the youngest within malawi the unconsolidated transboundary aquifers of malawi are widespread across the country most reside in the south of malawi shared with mozambique and there is 1 colluvium aquifer shared in the central region with zambia and another 2 in the north these aquifers tend to be small compared to larger basement aquifers but are the most highly productive quaternary alluvial deposits are composed of clays silts sands and gravels deposited in the floor of the east african rift system ears rift valley and along river plains un 1989 the lithology of the deposits is highly variable heterogeneous and anisotropic the composition changes considerably over short distances due to the nature of their deposition from outwash fans floor plains and river channels mkandawire 2002 the mineral assemblages of these alluvium suggest that they are derived from the precambrian basement complex primarily from the gneiss habgood 1963 the presence of clays meant that good yields with high water quality is only present within the gravel beds of the units where permeability was good habgood 1963 and artesian water pressures may exist in places due confinement below clay layers the depth of saturation within these aquifers varies seasonally the water table depth is typically between 5 and 10 m below ground chavula et al 2012 and thickness can range from 40 to 150 m un 1989 smith carrington and chilton 1983 the transmissivity ranges from 50 to 300 m2 day hydraulic conductivity for sands and gravels is between 10 20 m day specific yield ranges between 3 10 smith carrington and chilton 1983 the alluvial deposits are recharged through rainfall which is spatially variable depending on location some additional recharge also comes from seepage of riverbeds that are permeable kelly et al 2019b these aquifers are unconfined when colluvium do not cover them lying on alluvial deposits and weathered basement colluvium is also found these are superficial deposits of residual soils formed by soil creep these are commonly thin deposits but are quite extensive across malawi hydraulic conductivity for the poorly sorted clayley and colluvial sands ranges between 1 5 m day with specific yield ranging between 3 10 smith carrington and chilton 1983 3 2 2 karoo sequence within the western portion of the shire river basin in the southwest of the valley a small section of transboundary karoo sequence rocks exist there are a total of 8 aquifers here composed of a combination of both basalts and sedimentary units fig 2d many of these aquifers are localised they lie unconformably on crystalline basement and are fault bound on the malawi side of the border due to the influence of the east african rift system ferro and bouman 1987a in the north there is 1 other transboundary karoo sedimentary aquifer shared with tanzania the karoo stormberg volcanics represent the upper part of the karoo sequence they encompass a series of microporphyritic to glomeroporphyritic tholeiitic basaltic lava flows dill 2007 often interbedded with bands of sandstone habgood 1963 permeable and porous layers exist between consecutive lava flows interbedded with layers of sandstone and tuff un 1989 the flows are often vesiculated towards the top of top and in filled with calcite and quartz habgood 1963 within the centre of the karoo weathered basalts the unit is impermeable however because of interstitial spaces at contacts between flow there are zones where permeability is very high this is due to vesicular cavities providing a flow path for the water habgood 1964 furthermore jointing and faulting of the lava flows has resulted in fracturing that increases permeability further groundwater movement through the basalts is fairly rapid as illustrated through the high quality and low mineralization of the water with yields above 1 1 l s habgood 1964 these may form moderate productivity local aquifers the karoo sedimentary rocks can be subdivided into three distinct units the basal beds composed of conglomerates and sandstones a sequence of sandstones mudstones shales and coal seams in the middle and grits arkose sandstones shales mudstones and marls in the upper section the upper successions tend to be cemented by calcite and the primary porosity is low permeable horizons are related to secondary fracturing the karoo sediments are thought to have an estimated thickness of 500 m bradford 1973 un 1989 the karoo sedimentary rock outcrops tend to be relatively small and not vastly abundant despite this the units tend to exhibit high permeability and tends to be highly fractured the rocks of the karoo are generally well cemented with low porosity and intergranular permeability groundwater storage and flow occurs largely in fractures in the rocks groundwater levels are typically 20 m 30 m below ground surface un 1989 these rocks may form a low to moderate productivity local aquifer the groundwater quality of the karoo sediments tends to be highly variable depending on location and depth ranging from freshwater to extremely saline water within the south of malawi the karoo aquifers tend to be either dominated by calcium carbonate or sodium chloride influenced water types 3 2 3 fractured basement complex there are 13 unique sub sets of fractured basement complex transboundary aquifers identified within this study they extend across the entire of malawi predominantly in the center of the country along the border shared with zambia and along the southeast border shared with mozambique fig 2a precambrian crystalline basement rocks are gneiss and granulite with some metamorphic schists quartzites and marbles un 1989 the basement complex is intruded by dykes and other igneous lithologies un 1989 the large majority of malawi is underlain by these rock units that have undergone several deformation and metamorphic phases that has affected large areas of africa cannon et al 1969 due to their resistance to erosion they often form much of the elevated regions in malawi in the north and west of malawi the basement complex exists as lower grade metamorphic rocks those in the south were originally mudstone sandstone and conglomerates it is most likely that these rocks are from a sedimentary origin pre metamorphism bloomfield 1968 due to recrystallization during deformation the basement rocks have been rendered with both low primary porosity and permeability the fractured basement complex aquifers store groundwater in fractures secondary porosity associated with geologically weak zones easily disintegrated into individual blocks bounded by fractures and joints fraser et al 2018 these zones are associated with particular geological structures like folds faults and fractures displaying relatively high permeability along dikes intruding the basement complex aquifers can also develop in the fracture zone on the contact between the intrusive body and the adjacent rocks the un fractured parts of the dikes often form impermeable barriers ferro and bouman 1987a b it is probable that the basement complex aquifers provide baseflow for many of the country s surface watercourses and despite the semi confined nature of the surface clays recharge is most likely to come in the form of rainfall infiltration kelly et al 2019a b smith carrington and chilton 1983 conductivity borehole logging and analysis of boreholes tapping the basement complex aquifer suggests water quality layering within the units distinct layering with considerable lateral variation is evident suggesting that there may be more than one water type within some aquifers furthermore in some localized areas there is evidence of mixing of these different water types smith carrington and chilton 1983 these units tend to yield 0 5 0 8 l s from around 30 45 m depths this is often enough to supply local villages but not regional areas habgood 1964 the water acquired is of good quality with low salinity often these aquifer units are not reached when drilling due to being too deep resulting in high expense habgood 1964 kalin et al 2019 locally some parts of the aquifer units do tend to exhibit saline water this does not appear to be related to the rock composition and is more likely caused by evaporation and mineralization along fault zones rivett et al 2018 overall the units do tend to exhibit low mineralization regionally and this suggests that recharge is recent fractured basement complex lithology s are discontinuous resulting in local aquifers as opposed to large scale regional aquifers fraser et al 2018 although low yielding these aquifers are often an important local groundwater resource and therefore must be considered locally within the context of sustainable development goal 6 3 2 4 weathered basement complex there are 8 weathered basement complex aquifers shared between malawi and its neighbours these saprolitic units range in size from smaller more local scale aquifers in the very south and north of malawi to larger more regionally significant aquifers in the south east fig 2b formed of the same geological lithologies as the fractured basement aquifers the weathered aquifers differ in the type of secondary saprolitic porosity exhibited to store water the process of weather involves the breakdown of the bedrock through chemical and physical factors the occurrence of coarse grained or heterogeneous rocks as well as soluble marbles or the existence of contacts between rock types of different nature also facilitate weathering the weathered basement aquifers are best developed in topographical highs within malawi smith carrington and chilton 1983 it can be divided into 3 distinctive layers the laterite layer which is composed of mainly red clay or completely weathered silt the saprolite layer which is composed of quartzitic clayey sand or heavily weathered fine to coarse sand and medium weathered layer in which rock mass is separated into fragments or small blocks by groundwater infiltrating into joints of rock zauyah et al 2010 smith carrington and chilton 1983 the best yielding layer is the medium saprolite layer and it occurs between 15 30 m the aquifer thickness or the occurrence depth is very variable due to topographic conditions weathering is controlled by the rock type and structure slope regional climate lithology and mineral type the spacing between joints and the degree of rock mass spellman and stoudt 2013 smith carrington and chilton 1983 un 1989 as an example gneiss and granulites are coarse grained with quartz minerals weathering of these units provides a good water bearing capacity schist syenite and gabbro on the other hand exhibit clay minerals and poor water bearing capacities smith carrington and chilton 1983 weathered basement aquifer transmissivities are generally in the range of 5 to 35 m2 day with estimated hydraulic conductivities ranging from 0 01 to 1 m d the storage coefficient on the other hand has been assumed to range from 0 01 to 0 001 mkandawire 2004 these aquifers are under unconfined to confined conditions borehole yields are generally highest where the saturated thickness of the weathered zone is greatest and the parent bedrock coarsest chilton and smith carington 1984 in general the weathered basement aquifer produces low borehole yields chilton and smith carington 1984 3 3 data gaps although the basic hydrogeological characteristics of the transboundary aquifers are understood table 1 a number of data gaps have been highlighted throughout this study the lack of monitoring boreholes in place to monitor groundwater levels means that potential groundwater depletion within these aquifers is unknown this makes it difficult to determine whether a transboundary aquifer is under stress or at risk of abstraction becoming unsustainable there is also limited data available on the use of groundwater although it is well established that a large proportion of malawi s rural communities rely on groundwater as their primary drinking water source other uses of groundwater are poorly understood other vital information such as recharge and discharge zones of these transboundary aquifers are inadequately investigated this will pose problems if malawi and a neighbouring country were to want to foster an agreement over one of their shared aquifers as international recharge and discharge can play an important role in the conceptualisation of a transboundary aquifer and will direct the appropriate legal frameworks required to direct the aquifer agreement within malawi some studies have been done looking at the hydraulic connections that exist between groundwater and surface water however these are still in their infancy and still require further attention furthermore evidence of groundwater contamination within these aquifers is only viable for those aquifers that have been tested the assumption that no record of contamination means no contamination should not be taken within malawi there is also a north south divide on the amount of research and field investigations done to assess and understand groundwater resources the center and south of malawi is more densely populated than the north and this has contributed to the majority of research funding being directed in these areas the shire river valley and its related river basins aquifers and catchments are also an important water and energy supply in the region that has subsequently led to a focus on this area for research the lack of data in the north of malawi in relation to the south has resulted in a diminished understanding of the water resources in the north which contributes to the shortage of transboundary understanding 4 discussion the results of this study indicate that there are many more small scale transboundary aquifers in malawi and likely across africa than previously thought this is important as current management structures in place within these countries often do not facilitate local scale transboundary management studies of this scale are also hindered by multiple limitations data availability is a major issue in many countries and this case study is not exempt as previously discussed alongside this the detail of geological and hydrogeological maps that require harmonization across the border at this scale is much more complex resulting in increased difficulty in interpretation of aquifer units additionally mapping consistence and different approaches to lithology delineation complicates harmonization further the importance of transboundary water management has been recognised within the sustainable development goal agenda target 6 5 2 specifically refers to transboundary water by 2030 implement integrated water resources management at all levels including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate un water 2015 the nature of integrated water resource management demands both surface and groundwater to be considered in a holistic management approach un water 2017b historically the management of surface water has received comparatively more attention than groundwater eckstein and sindico 2014 this could be due to the simplicity in determining whether a lake or river crosses a political boundary and the complexity of detailed study of hydrogeological units and groundwater flow it is important to identify those groundwater aquifers that may be transboundary in order to manage them effectively in conjunction with surface water within an iwrm framework it can be argued the current sdg agenda for transboundary groundwater management is premature this study alone shows that transboundary aquifers are still not understood at an effective level of detail for local management and national agreements the expectation on countries to not only investigate identify and establish a formal agreement over the use and management of these aquifers by 2030 appear to be a stretched target especially given that only 6 formal agreements are currently in place over transboundary aquifers rivera and candela 2018 there is an inherent risk the sdg agenda will rush the transboundary aquifer identification process up and detail is missed if detailed transboundary aquifer assessments like the one in this study are not undertaken generalized regional assessments will be relied upon that may not be fit for purpose a key objective of the sdg s is leave no one behind and therefore the localization of the policy and management of resources in line with sdg s must be a corner stone of national implementation strategy united national committee for development policy uncdp 2018 relying on generalized regional groundwater assessments will lead to poor or miss management of the groundwater that are highly important at the local level transboundary aquifer assessments are also still restricted by data limitations lack of cross bored data sharing harmonizing cross border hydrogeological data and limited groundwater monitoring practices fraser et al 2018 additionally developing countries are faced with financial and capacity limitations that require national prioritisation under the sdg s which further inhibits tba agreement development the wording of sdg target 6 5 2 leaves potential for gaps in the interpretation the target calls for transboundary cooperation within integrated water resource management at all levels as appropriate however the indicator for the target only measures the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational agreement mccracken and meyer 2018 firstly groundwater aquifers do not necessarily follow surface water river basins and therefore the target has failed to identify this key differential fraser et al 2018 primarily focusing on the surface river basin level diminishes the importance of local cooperation of groundwater use by a substantial percentage of the population base there is no guidance over what constitutes the need for transboundary cooperation within the sdg agenda and if there was it would likely focus on reactive measures than proactive as integrated water resource management promotes reactive measures to water conflict instead of focusing on preventative approaches jarvis 2010 furthermore some aquifers or indeed large areas of aquifers may not require an agreement over their use and management due to lack of usage or low dependency rates fraser et al 2018 the sgd 6 5 target indicator calls for the percentage of a basin under an operational agreement to be calculated the term operational requires any arrangement to include regular exchange of data regular formal communication between parties a joint management plan and a joint body or mechanism to oversee the arrangement un water 2017a in mccracken and meyer 2018 operational agreements of this manner and at this scale will require strong governance and institutions to implement them aligning the sgd s indicators with already in place institutional mechanisms will speed up this process however there are relatively few institutional mechanisms designed to manage transboundary groundwater resources often these tools generally exist at the sub national level linton and brooks 2011 feitelson 2003 in ganoulis and fried 2018 in order to be effective cooperation needs to happen at all scales unesco 2016 most examples of transboundary institutional mechanisms come in the form of joint bodies commissions committees created for river basin based cooperation case studies include 1 the international commission on the scheldt river that was set up to strengthen transboundary cooperation over the quality of the scheldt river basin district that runs through france brussels and the netherlands machard de gramont et al 2001 2 the nile basin initiative that brings member states residing within the basin together for consultation and coordination of sustainable management and development of shared water within the basin un and unesco 2018 3 the okavango river basin water commission that established the okavango delta management plan through engaging with stakeholders such as communities of the delta users of the resource governments and management institutions un and unesco 2018 4 the orange senqu river commission formed following signing the agreement for the establishment of the orange senqu river commission between botswana lesotho namibia and south africa established to promote equitable and sustainable development of the resources of the orange senqu river basin including groundwater by proxy unesco ihp 2016 5 the north south ministerial council that was formed as a response to the belfast agreement fostered between northern ireland and the republic of ireland that encourages cross border cooperation between the two nations including over shared water recourses fraser et al 2020 a common factor that is evident is that most institutional mechanisms that deal with transboundary groundwater governance are at the river basin level and have been initially driven by the desire for surface water management with groundwater included as an addition it is also often unclear within these mandates whether or not groundwater within the basin limits but not hydraulically connected to the surface waters are included unesco ihp 2016 specific examples of effective institutional governance mechanisms dealing with just groundwater have developed as a consequence of international scale projects such as the governance for groundwater resources in transboundary aquifers ggreta project developing tools such as multi country cooperation mechanisms mccm a dedicated instrument to deal with transboundary groundwater management that can be nested within another institution in ggreta s case within the orange senqu river commission unesco ihp 2016 similarly the ramotswa and shire conwat project both utilize joint strategic action plans to identify and prioritize investment and actions that can be implemented for transboundary groundwater management with their respective regions sadc gmi 2016 iwmi 2019 more pertinent to the malawi case study the southern african development community sadc has been progressive with its stance on transboundary water cooperation through its water division by developing a regional water strategy that provides a strategic framework for sustainable use protection and control of both national and transboundary water resources within the region and the implementation of the revised protocol for shared watercourses 2000 that aims to foster close cooperation between member states over their shared water resources sadc 2003 most recently the sadc groundwater management institute a not for profit based in south africa representing all sadc member states was established to promote sustainable groundwater management within the region build national and regional institutional capacity lead national and regional coordination and improve knowledge management a large part of its work is transboundary focused sadc gmi 2016 iwmi 2019 93 2 of malawi s territorial area and 86 1 of its population republic of malawi ministry of agriculture irrigation and water development moaiwd 2014 resides within the zambezi river basin and is party to the zamcom agreement an agreement that sets out to foster cooperation from riparian states over the transboundary management of the surface water and groundwater within the basin sadc dw zambezi river authority 2008 moving forward an option for this commission may be to set up a hydrogeological working group that can represent transboundary groundwater issues at the international level an effective working example of this is the orasecom hydrological group within the commission nijsten et al 2018a b although almost all of their transboundary aquifers reside within this transboundary basin malawi is yet to accede the zamcom agreement into policy zamcom 2019 it must do so in order to move forward with transboundary cooperation at the binational level these institutional frameworks discussed must be underpinned by local scale mechanisms local stakeholder involvement and local scale governance mechanisms are vital as those involved are often closest to the problem at hand and most impacted by poor resourse management moench et al 2012 the most common local scale water governance mechanism is community based management cbm whaley et al 2019 the cbm model is based on the concept of the local community managing their own water resources often through the maintenance of water points such as hand pumped boreholes cbm was initially intended to provide a sense of ownership through local participation through water point committees benito et al 2010 and account for decentralized governmental systems in many areas of africa truselove et al 2019 however research has suggested that the burden and services contained within cmb cannot be sustained long term and that there is an issue of meeting the sdg s and sustainable financing for maintenance under a cbm approach truselove et al 2019 2020 community based management is also rarely seen at the formal transboundary level any transboundary cooperation is often informal and thus unrecorded and rendered ineffectual for the sdg mandate as previously noted many of malawi s transboundary aquifers are localised and therefore generalised policies at international basin level are not appropriate in these cases national policy that supports local level iwrm management strategies would be more effective moving forward it may also be practical to identify particular vulnerable areas of transboundary aquifers that require management rather than choosing to manage an entire aquifer sdg 6 5 2 will require a formal agreement and it is vital these recognise local dependence and vulnerabilities without the approach presented here generalised transboundary agreements will likely hinder local level development progress 5 conclusions and the way forward the adoption of the sustainable development goals has driven forward the importance of localisation of policy planning and management and for goal 6 the need for sustainable and integrated transboundary aquifer management this paper presents an approach to transboundary aquifer assessment at local level that supports malawi as a case study and other countries to assess their border for transboundary aquifers shared with neighbours it relies on the use of detailed geological and hydrogeological data alongside literature and groundwater studies in malawi 38 transboundary aquifers of local to national importance were identified as being shared between malawi and its neighbouring countries an increase from the previous 3 identified demonstrating the complexity lost in regional scale assessments these aquifers vary in lithology productivity and extent across the country but all are locally important for water access to rural populations local agriculture and sustainable water resources the assessment took into account the discontinuous nature of the basement complex arising from the complex comprising of multiple lithologies and the differences between the weathered and fractured zones within the basement complex these results form the basis for future transboundary aquifer studies and discussions around management and agreement between malawi and its neighbouring countries to set targets to achieve sdg 6 moving forward it will be important to ensure that local level transboundary aquifer assessments inform sdg 6 5 2 it will also be essential to ensure that specific vulnerable areas or ecosystems or populations using these aquifers are identified monitored and managed effectively this could be in the form of zoning or potentially geospatial gis hotspot analysis it will also be important to consider that large scale aquifers likely have smaller areas of concern that require management and that these are likely to reside close to the border and have a community level impact engaging these stakeholders and building capacity in these areas will be essential for local scale management credit authorship contribution statement christina m fraser conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology project administration

erhardt and czado 2018 such multivariate drought indicators are known to capture onset and termination of droughts more realistically hao and aghakouchak 2013 shah and mishra 2020 however the application of multivariate drought indices for drought risk assessment in the indian region are rather limited e g mallya et al 2015 aadhar and mishra 2017 shah and mishra 2020 gupta et al 2020 on the other hand drought characteristics such as duration and severity influence drought resilience and preparedness tosunoğlu and onof 2017 some studies e g byun and wilhite 1999 spinoni et al 2014 consider them separately however a more rational approach to drought risk assessment is to compound both the variables while some studies jointly model drought duration and severity using bivariate distributions shiau and shen 2001 mishra et al 2009 a copula based approach accounts for the dependence between drought duration and severity shiaua modarres 2009 and allows their marginal distributions to belong to different families mishra and singh 2011 the copula based approach has been adopted for the probabilistic drought risk assessment in india in only a limited number of

drought risk assessment limit themselves to classifying regions based merely on average rainfall deviations gore et al 2010 or based on the frequency or trends of anomalous precipitation values naresh kumar et al 2012 pai et al 2011 guhathakurta et al 2017 relying only on the univariate indicator spi one exception is gupta et al 2020 who developed sdf curves for the entire indian region considering spei as the drought indicator however they did not consider deficiency in soil moisture that has significant implications on agriculture a country wide drought atlas can spatially represent drought characteristics for integrated drought monitoring and warning system in india further considering the interplay of multiple variables influencing onset propagation and termination of drought a multivariate indicator is imperative for probabilistic drought risk assessment in this country to this end in this study a country wide multivariate integrated drought atlas is presented the atlas is based on severity duration frequency relationships developed separately for each meteorological sub division in india and uses the multivariate standardized drought index msdi as opposed to the conventional univariate indicators such as spi and ssi further the application of such an atlas for assessment of risk and historical context of individual drought events is also illustrated to analyze the drought event of 2015 that is a recent one and had significant impact on agriculture life and property the effect of 2015 drought event was multi sectoral reservoir levels fell to the minimal values the times of india 2016 affecting about 330 million people bbc india 2016 and crop yields were anomalously low in many regions of india during this event along with anomalously low precipitation significant soil moisture deficits were also reported mishra et al 2019 regional scale investigations of the 2015 drought event include kulkarni et al 2016 who studied drought drivers in marathwada and mishra et al 2016 who analyzed precipitation deficit in the indo gangetic plains this paper complements and extends these studies by investigating the rarity and risk associated with the 2015 drought event for the entire indian region from a multivariate perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 data the study is conducted for 30 meteorological sub divisions of india fig 1 based on

nex nasa gov nex projects 1349 to check the agricultural impacts during the 2015 drought event in india 2 2 computation of drought indices fig 2 shows the schematic of the methodology followed the initial step in developing the drought sdf curves is the computation of the drought index to alleviate limitations of univariate indicators in characterizing complex drought conditions such as agricultural droughts which depend on multiple variables a non parametric multivariate index known as msdi hao and aghakouchak 2014 is computed since the major focus of the study is to monitor the impact of droughts on agricultural sector 1 month msdi is adopted rajsekhar et al 2015a ford and labosier 2014 the multivariate index msdi is computed using gringorten plotting position formula for the bivariate case gringorten 1963 the procedure for calculation of msdi is outlined as follows 1 let random variables r and w denote precipitation and soil moisture at 1 month time scale the joint probability distribution of r and w is given by 1 p r r w w p 2 if m k denote the count of occurrence of the pair r i w i for which r i r k and w i w k and n is the sample size the empirical joint probability can be derived using gringorten plotting position as 2 p r k w k m k 0 44 n 0 12 3 the multivariate index can be standardized by 3 m s d i φ 1 p φ is the standard normal distribution function instead of using actual values the empirical distributions use ranks of data thus the sample size should be sufficiently large 2 3 determination of drought properties duration and severity computation of msdi is followed by drought characterization the drought properties such as severity and duration is computed using the concept of theory of runs yevjevich 1967 a drought event is initiated when the index value falls below 0 8 and terminates when the index value is above 0 8 the threshold of 0 8 is adopted based on the previous drought studies hao and aghakouchak 2013 the consecutive number of months between drought initiation and termination is defined as drought duration and the cumulative of the drought index value for this period is the drought severity 4 s x i 1 d d r o u g h t i n d e x i where s x indicates the severity for a particular event x starting from i 1 to d run length for the drought index msdi 2 4 joint dependence between duration and severity the joint behavior of the drought properties is evaluated considering the multi attributable nature of droughts rajsekhar et al 2015a therefore marginal distributions for drought severity and duration are first fitted followed by the use of a copula function to model their dependence the most commonly used distribution to fit drought duration and severity are exponential and gamma log normal respectively shiau 2006 ganguli 2014 halwatura et al 2015 reddy and ganguli 2013 the akaike information criterion aic is used to select the distribution with the best fit for duration and severity the exponential log normal gamma and weibull distributions are tested the aic value indicates the relative measure of information lost in the system thus the marginal distribution with lowest aic is chosen for each of the 30 sub divisions for the two drought variables severity and duration copula functions capture the dependence of correlated drought variables more efficiently and hence provide better frequency estimates copulas are functions that connect multivariate probability distributions to their one dimensional marginal probability distributions nelsen 2006 5 f d s d s c f d d f s s where c is defined as copula with f d d and f s s representing the marginal cdf of the variables d and s respectively f d s d s is the cdf of bivariate distribution the clayton frank and gumbel hougaard copulas belong to the family known as archimedean copula the best fit copula for the present study is checked from above mentioned copulas the use of gumbel hougaard copula to model the joint dependence between drought severity and duration has been widely cited in the literature rajsekhar et al 2015b ganguli 2014 reddy and ganguli 2013 ganguli and reddy 2014 tosunoğlu and onof 2017 the bivariate dependence structure can be modelled using gumbel hougaard copula as nelsen 2006 6 c θ u v exp ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ c is the copula and u f d d and v f s s are the marginal cdfs of random variables d and s respectively and θ represents the copula parameter in multivariate distribution there exists a dependence between extreme values in the lower and upper tails the larger positive values of coefficient of upper tail dependence λ u denotes that extreme values in the upper tails of the multivariate distribution are strongly dependent ganguli and reddy 2012 the non parametric upper tail dependence coefficient using capéraá fougéres genest cfg estimator λ ˆ u c f g capéraà et al 1997 frahm et al 2005 is given by the following 7 λ ˆ u c f g 2 2 exp 1 n i 1 n l o g log 1 u i log 1 v i log 1 max u i v i 2 where u 1 v 1 u n v n is a random sample generated from copula either clayton frank or gumbel hougaard 500 bivariate random numbers from each copula is generated for computing the tail dependence coefficient this process is further repeated 25 different times to compute the mean of the cfg estimate this is compared with parametric tail dependence coefficients λ ˆ u computed using the dependence parameter table 3 to select the appropriate copula along with the drought duration and severity drought inter arrival time is also one of the drought characteristics obtained using the theory of runs in the present study for most of the meteorological sub divisions it is observed that the kendall s rank τ between duration inter arrival and severity inter arrival pairs is less than 0 2 indicating no association between them therefore the drought inter arrival time is not considered for joint modelling of drought characteristics 2 5 drought sdf curves and drought atlas shiau 2006 formulated the expressions to compute conditional probability plots for severity s given drought duration d exceeding certain threshold d 8 p s s d d f s s c f d d f s s 1 f d d similarly drought duration d conditioned on severity s exceeding a certain threshold s is expressed as 9 p d d s s f d d c f d d f s s 1 f s s the expression to compute the drought severity duration frequency relation has been successfully used to analyze the frequency of drought events however the application of this expression in an integrated multivariate framework model is a recent one the conditional return period expression for drought severity at a given duration is reddy and ganguli 2012 10 t s d s d n n 1 c s d d t s d s d is the conditional recurrence interval of s given d d n total number of drought events and n total length of drought index time series in years c s d d is the conditional distribution of copula and for gumbel hougaard it is expressed as reddy and ganguli 2012 11 c s d d θ u 1 exp log u θ log v θ 1 θ 1 log v log u θ 1 1 θ where θ is the joint dependence parameter and u f d d and v f s s are the marginal cdfs of d and s respectively thus for given recurrence interval or return periods such as 10 25 50 100 years the sdf curves are developed by solving c s d to provide the severity values for a particular duration the above methodology is individually applied to all the meteorological sub divisions of india the severity based drought atlas are developed for specific durations 3 6 12 months and return periods 50 and 100 years using the sdf curves in order to express the rarity of drought the probability of exceedance of severity of a drought for a given duration is computed using 12 p μ t where p is the probability of exceedance given as p p s s d d μ is the drought inter arrival time μ n n t is the conditional recurrence interval of s given d d 3 results and discussion 3 1 rationale for employing a multivariate drought index the pearson correlation coefficient between precipitation and soil moisture is positive for all the 30 meteorological sub divisions fig 1b emphasizing the need for multivariate drought analysis compound negative anomalies of precipitation and soil moisture leads to an adverse drought condition potentially impacting agriculture therefore in the scatter of standardized anomalies of precipitation versus soil moisture as shown in fig 3 a and b the observations lying in the third quadrant are critical from a multivariate drought perspective from fig 3a and b it is observed that several records of standardized anomalies of precipitation and soil moisture lie in this quadrant for both the sub divisions in particular for the 2015 event for both the sub divisions precipitation and soil moisture anomalies fall below zero and sometimes even below 1 indicating critical deficiencies in both precipitation and soil moisture similar observations are found for the other sub divisions too the marginal probabilities of the precipitation and soil moisture values for the months of august september and october for the period 1980 2015 derived using the univariate form of gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 and their joint probability derived using frank copula for the marathwada and eup sub division is shown in fig 3c and d respectively assuming the 20th percentile precipitation and soil moisture as the drought threshold different probability spaces are demarcated by l1 and l2 lines in the figure for the marathwada region the august 2015 record has a precipitation probability 0 2 and soil moisture probability 0 2 the above conditions of marginal probabilities of the drought variables which is of the univariate form denotes soil moisture drought only likewise for the eup region the august 2015 record has the precipitation and soil moisture probability 0 2 and 0 2 respectively denoting meteorological drought only however these two points in a bivariate probability space lies below the 0 2 contour line with a joint probability 0 1 representing drought conditions more realistically similar inferences can also be made for the september 2015 and october 2015 values also it may be noted that some records where precipitation and soil moisture probability are both greater than 0 2 neither meteorological nor agricultural drought might compound to induce a bivariate probability 0 2 thus leading to a drought condition which additionally increases the chances of detecting drought hao and aghakouchak 2013 hence the choice of msdi is justified in this study 3 2 joint modelling of drought duration and severity the summary of the drought statistics for marathwada and eup regions obtained after calculating msdi using monthly precipitation and soil moisture data for the period 1980 2015 is tabulated in table 1 the cdf plots of the different distributions used in the present study for fitting the drought duration and severity for marathwada and eup regions are shown in fig 4 a d respectively the performance of each of the distribution is evaluated using the criteria mse and aic the performance of different probability distributions for fitting them to the drought variables severity and duration for marathwada and eup regions are shown in table 2 exponential distribution is found to be the best fit distribution for both drought duration and severity for marathwada as well as eup sub division it is interesting to note that drought duration and severity were significantly correlated pearson correlation coefficient 0 95 for all the 30 meteorological sub divisions fig 5 therefore the joint modelling of these two variables is carried out using a copula function the parameters of the copula function are estimated using the maximum likelihood method the upper tail dependence coefficients calculated for different fitted copulas for the marathwada and eup regions are shown in table 3 the cfg estimate of the upper tail dependence coefficient for gumbel hougaard copula is found to be similar to that of the upper tail dependence coefficient calculated using the dependence parameter gumbel hougaard copula is observed to be the best fit copula for all the other meteorological sub divisions also based on the cfg estimator in the past a number of studies rajsekhar et al 2015b ganguli 2014 reddy and ganguli 2013 ganguli and reddy 2014 tosunoğlu and onof 2017 irrespective of their choice of the drought index the drought characteristics such as duration and severity were modelled jointly using the gumbel hougaard copula the conditional drought duration distribution for given drought severity at 50th 75th and 90th percentiles and the conditional drought severity distribution for given drought duration at 50th 75th and 90th percentiles are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively for the marathwada and eup regions the knowledge of conditional probability is useful to assess the properties of specific drought events for example the probability of occurrence of a drought event of duration less than 10 months for 90th percentile drought severity is 0 71 in marathwada whereas a similar drought condition in eup region may have a probability of 0 69 further the probability of a drought event having a severity value less than 10 for 90th percentile drought duration is around 0 62 in marathwada and a similar drought condition in eup region may have a probability of 0 6 3 3 multivariate drought sdf curves and drought atlas the copula based sdf curves are developed for the specific return periods of 10 25 50 and 100 years for their relevance in planning and management in general the sdf curves are multivariate tools that link severity and duration of droughts to the return period fig 7 a and b show the sdf curves derived for the marathwada and eup region respectively the sdf curves for the rest of the meteorological sub divisions is available upon request to the corresponding author the rate of increase of drought severity is small for shorter drought durations compared to that of longer drought durations for a specified duration and return period the drought severity magnitude can be calculated from these curves this information can be used to design structural measures such as construction of reservoirs or check dams that can improve drought resilience reddy and ganguli 2012 for example while designing an irrigation structure for 1 in 50 year return period in the region of marathwada to meet the agricultural water demand the design severity value of 10 1 should be considered for a drought condition of 6 month duration for a similar drought condition in eup a design severity of 10 3 should be taken in order to meet the water demands many of these water harvesting and conservation structures are commonly designed for return periods of 10 25 or 50 years short term or non structural measures such as crop management on the other hand may be based on more frequent droughts further a spatial comparison of these sdf curves for different regions help in identifying drought prone regions where mitigation measures are more important than in regions where such measures are not critically needed interestingly the convex nature of the sdf curves for the odisha sub division for return period 10 year from the present study is comparable with that of samantaray et al 2019 who used crop water stress as the drought index also for the western rajasthan sub division the msdi based sdf curves with convex nature is comparable with that of the spi based sdf curves developed by reddy and ganguli 2012 in a study by gupta et al 2020 the spei 10 based sdf relationships for the indian regions were derived where they observed constant rate of change of severity with the change in duration for the peninsular india except the western ghats whereas in the present study the msdi based sdf relationships show increase in the rate of drought severity with the increase in duration for all the regions in india this shows that the choice of drought variables is important while focusing on the specific drought type the drought atlas derived using the sdf curves for 1 3 and 6 months drought durations and 50 and 100 year return periods for all the meteorological sub divisions is shown in fig 8 the drought atlas for 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods with the drought duration of 1 10 months is available upon request to the corresponding author the categories of the severity are based on the jenk s natural break algorithm that maximizes the difference between the classes and minimizing the within class differences it is interesting to note that geographically neighboring regions show contrasting behavior for long term droughts for example west madhya pradesh shows large drought severity as compared to its surrounding sub divisions this is not unexpected considering diverse topographical features or large spatio temporal variations in rainfall patterns from one region to another in india regions of north interior karnataka west madhya pradesh maharashtra telangana bihar jharkhand gangetic west bengal kerala punjab chattisgarh and north east india are found to be having a higher severity compared to other sub divisions though counter intuitive fig 8 shows larger drought severity for regions of high rainfall such as kerala or north east india this is because the multivariate drought atlas developed in this study represents variability in rainfall and soil moisture with respect to the long term mean these maps are not merely indicative of regions of high or low rainfall since the msdi captures the concurrent deficit in rainfall and soil moisture with respect to a threshold the multivariate drought atlas shows that regions of high rainfall may be susceptible to larger variability in these drought variables as compared to their long term mean interestingly western rajasthan and marathwada which belong to the arid zone show lower drought severity values for the same return period and duration as compared to other sub divisions this is because the drought atlas is derived based on probabilistic frequency analysis of events and not necessarily using the magnitude of precipitation or soil moisture alone although these regions are known to be drier than the rest of the country their low variability of precipitation and soil moisture is reflected in the lower severity values the drought atlas presented in fig 8 guides the choice of design severity for a given duration and return period for water resources management it may be noted here that the drought atlas presented here complements the government of india s official manual for drought management department of agricultural cooperation 2016 which includes the assessment of primary and impact indicators for drought declaration it considers precipitation as the mandatory indicator for determination of drought trigger following which the impact indicators such as crop area sown ndvi or vegetation condition index deviations percent available soil moisture moisture adequacy index reservoir storage index groundwater drought index and streamflow drought index are further evaluated for drought declaration our framework presents an alternative for the situations where data on all these impact indicators may not be available further it also allows the evaluation of return period and rarity of drought events declared according to the manual for drought management or otherwise 3 4 rarity of the 2015 drought event the 2015 drought in india is a recent event and among the top ten most severe droughts table 4 in the climatological period of analysis 1980 2015 to assess the historical context of the impactful 2015 drought event in india its probability of exceedance is computed by considering the maximum severity and its associated duration for each meteorological sub division the country wide rarity map for the 2015 drought event is presented in fig 9 from fig 9a it can be seen that the sub divisions west uttar pradesh eup jharkhand marathwada telangana and north interior karnataka experienced a rare drought event in the year 2015 with the probability of exceedance less than 10 and return periods between 5 100 years the 2015 drought event in marathwada and eup were previously studied at regional scales and were primarily attributed to soil moisture and precipitation deficits respectively kulkarni et al 2016 concluded that the rainfall deficit in marathwada during this time was not unprecedented with the impacts being solely attributable to soil moisture deficits due to poor water management practices on the other hand the drought over eup was the consequence of severe deficiency in precipitation although the impacts were partly managed via soil moisture retention through irrigation mishra et al 2016 however the extremeness of individual drought events may be sensitive to the region choice of individual physiographical variables and selection of drought characteristics brunner et al 2019 probabilistic assessment based on the multivariate drought atlas prevents underestimation of drought risk as compared to univariate approaches hence we use the multivariate drought atlas to assess the spatial extent and rarity of the 2015 drought event in india eup and marathwada are both found to be experiencing an extreme drought probability of exceedance 0 005 as observed in fig 9a establishing the usefulness of the developed multivariate drought atlas in capturing rarity of individual drought events realistically further to understand the associated agricultural impacts and to validate the estimated risk of the event sub division wise averaged ndvi anomalies during drought conditions of 2015 are shown in fig 9b though not directly comparable the negative anomalies of ndvi are found to overall coincide with the regions that experienced rare drought according to the developed drought atlas thus improving the confidence in its use for probabilistic drought risk assessment 4 summary and conclusion in this study a country wide multivariate drought atlas is developed derived from copula based severity duration frequency relationships using a multivariate drought index that considers deficiency in both precipitation and soil moisture sdf curves are obtained for each of the 30 meteorological sub divisions in india considering the joint dependence between drought duration and severity the spatial extent and rarity of the 2015 drought event in india is assessed using these sdf curves and the developed drought atlas the following conclusions were drawn from the paper 1 the correlation between precipitation and soil moisture variables across the country imparts the necessity for multivariate drought analysis msdi is successful in identifying the drought events occurring due to deficiencies in either or both precipitation and soil moisture 2 drought characteristics such as severity and duration are found to be inter related for all the regions in the country to consider such dependence copula based sdf relationships are developed for all the meteorological sub divisions these sdf curves are a powerful tool for water resources management in drought prone regions 3 a first ever country wide drought atlas is developed based on the regional sdf relationships regions of central india such as north interior karnataka west madhya pradesh parts of maharashtra and telangana parts of east india such as bihar jharkhand chattisgarh and gangetic west bengal kerala in south west india punjab in north india and north east india are found to be severely affected by the variability in precipitation and soil moisture imparting them higher drought severity values 4 the impactful 2015 drought event is found to be deficient in terms of both precipitation and soil moisture for many parts of the country west uttar pradesh east uttar pradesh jharkhand marathwada telangana and north interior karnataka sub divisions experienced a rare drought return periods 5 100 years 5 the multivariate approach followed in this study presents a realistic estimate of risk of rare events such as the 2015 drought as opposed to that using univariate indicators 6 the spatial pattern of the rarity map tallies well with observed ndvi anomalies for the 2015 drought event highlighting the effectiveness of the developed drought atlas in agricultural impact assessment and mitigation of rare droughts funding the authors

application of multivariate drought indices for drought risk assessment in the indian region are rather limited e g mallya et al 2015 aadhar and mishra 2017 shah and mishra 2020 gupta et al 2020 on

consider them separately however a more rational approach to drought risk assessment is to compound both the variables while some studies jointly model drought duration and severity using bivariate

distributions to belong to different families mishra and singh 2011 the copula based approach has been adopted for the probabilistic drought risk assessment in india in only a limited number of

drought risk assessment limit themselves to classifying regions based merely on average rainfall deviations gore et al 2010 or based on the frequency or trends of anomalous precipitation values naresh kumar et al 2012 pai et al 2011 guhathakurta et al 2017 relying only on the univariate indicator spi one exception is gupta et al 2020 who developed sdf curves for the entire indian region considering spei as the drought indicator however they did not consider deficiency in soil moisture that has significant implications on agriculture a country wide drought atlas can spatially represent drought characteristics for integrated drought monitoring and warning system in india further considering the interplay of multiple variables influencing onset propagation and termination of drought a multivariate indicator is imperative for probabilistic drought risk assessment in this country to this end in this study a country wide multivariate integrated drought atlas is presented the atlas is based on severity duration frequency relationships developed separately for each meteorological sub division in india and uses the multivariate standardized drought index msdi as opposed to the conventional univariate indicators such as spi and ssi further the application of such an atlas for assessment of risk and historical context of individual drought events is also illustrated to analyze the drought event of 2015 that is a recent one and had significant impact on agriculture life and property the effect of 2015 drought event was multi sectoral reservoir levels fell to the minimal values the times of india 2016 affecting about 330 million people bbc india 2016 and crop yields were anomalously low in many regions of india during this event along with anomalously low precipitation significant soil moisture deficits were also reported mishra et al 2019 regional scale investigations of the 2015 drought event include kulkarni et al 2016 who studied drought drivers in marathwada and mishra et al 2016 who analyzed precipitation deficit in the indo gangetic plains this paper complements and extends these studies by investigating the rarity and risk associated with the 2015 drought event for the entire indian region from a multivariate perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 data the study is conducted for 30 meteorological sub divisions of india fig 1 based on

nex nasa gov nex projects 1349 to check the agricultural impacts during the 2015 drought event in india 2 2 computation of drought indices fig 2 shows the schematic of the methodology followed the initial step in developing the drought sdf curves is the computation of the drought index to alleviate limitations of univariate indicators in characterizing complex drought conditions such as agricultural droughts which depend on multiple variables a non parametric multivariate index known as msdi hao and aghakouchak 2014 is computed since the major focus of the study is to monitor the impact of droughts on agricultural sector 1 month msdi is adopted rajsekhar et al 2015a ford and labosier 2014 the multivariate index msdi is computed using gringorten plotting position formula for the bivariate case gringorten 1963 the procedure for calculation of msdi is outlined as follows 1 let random variables r and w denote precipitation and soil moisture at 1 month time scale the joint probability distribution of r and w is given by 1 p r r w w p 2 if m k denote the count of occurrence of the pair r i w i for which r i r k and w i w k and n is the sample size the empirical joint probability can be derived using gringorten plotting position as 2 p r k w k m k 0 44 n 0 12 3 the multivariate index can be standardized by 3 m s d i φ 1 p φ is the standard normal distribution function instead of using actual values the empirical distributions use ranks of data thus the sample size should be sufficiently large 2 3 determination of drought properties duration and severity computation of msdi is followed by drought characterization the drought properties such as severity and duration is computed using the concept of theory of runs yevjevich 1967 a drought event is initiated when the index value falls below 0 8 and terminates when the index value is above 0 8 the threshold of 0 8 is adopted based on the previous drought studies hao and aghakouchak 2013 the consecutive number of months between drought initiation and termination is defined as drought duration and the cumulative of the drought index value for this period is the drought severity 4 s x i 1 d d r o u g h t i n d e x i where s x indicates the severity for a particular event x starting from i 1 to d run length for the drought index msdi 2 4 joint dependence between duration and severity the joint behavior of the drought properties is evaluated considering the multi attributable nature of droughts rajsekhar et al 2015a therefore marginal distributions for drought severity and duration are first fitted followed by the use of a copula function to model their dependence the most commonly used distribution to fit drought duration and severity are exponential and gamma log normal respectively shiau 2006 ganguli 2014 halwatura et al 2015 reddy and ganguli 2013 the akaike information criterion aic is used to select the distribution with the best fit for duration and severity the exponential log normal gamma and weibull distributions are tested the aic value indicates the relative measure of information lost in the system thus the marginal distribution with lowest aic is chosen for each of the 30 sub divisions for the two drought variables severity and duration copula functions capture the dependence of correlated drought variables more efficiently and hence provide better frequency estimates copulas are functions that connect multivariate probability distributions to their one dimensional marginal probability distributions nelsen 2006 5 f d s d s c f d d f s s where c is defined as copula with f d d and f s s representing the marginal cdf of the variables d and s respectively f d s d s is the cdf of bivariate distribution the clayton frank and gumbel hougaard copulas belong to the family known as archimedean copula the best fit copula for the present study is checked from above mentioned copulas the use of gumbel hougaard copula to model the joint dependence between drought severity and duration has been widely cited in the literature rajsekhar et al 2015b ganguli 2014 reddy and ganguli 2013 ganguli and reddy 2014 tosunoğlu and onof 2017 the bivariate dependence structure can be modelled using gumbel hougaard copula as nelsen 2006 6 c θ u v exp ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ c is the copula and u f d d and v f s s are the marginal cdfs of random variables d and s respectively and θ represents the copula parameter in multivariate distribution there exists a dependence between extreme values in the lower and upper tails the larger positive values of coefficient of upper tail dependence λ u denotes that extreme values in the upper tails of the multivariate distribution are strongly dependent ganguli and reddy 2012 the non parametric upper tail dependence coefficient using capéraá fougéres genest cfg estimator λ ˆ u c f g capéraà et al 1997 frahm et al 2005 is given by the following 7 λ ˆ u c f g 2 2 exp 1 n i 1 n l o g log 1 u i log 1 v i log 1 max u i v i 2 where u 1 v 1 u n v n is a random sample generated from copula either clayton frank or gumbel hougaard 500 bivariate random numbers from each copula is generated for computing the tail dependence coefficient this process is further repeated 25 different times to compute the mean of the cfg estimate this is compared with parametric tail dependence coefficients λ ˆ u computed using the dependence parameter table 3 to select the appropriate copula along with the drought duration and severity drought inter arrival time is also one of the drought characteristics obtained using the theory of runs in the present study for most of the meteorological sub divisions it is observed that the kendall s rank τ between duration inter arrival and severity inter arrival pairs is less than 0 2 indicating no association between them therefore the drought inter arrival time is not considered for joint modelling of drought characteristics 2 5 drought sdf curves and drought atlas shiau 2006 formulated the expressions to compute conditional probability plots for severity s given drought duration d exceeding certain threshold d 8 p s s d d f s s c f d d f s s 1 f d d similarly drought duration d conditioned on severity s exceeding a certain threshold s is expressed as 9 p d d s s f d d c f d d f s s 1 f s s the expression to compute the drought severity duration frequency relation has been successfully used to analyze the frequency of drought events however the application of this expression in an integrated multivariate framework model is a recent one the conditional return period expression for drought severity at a given duration is reddy and ganguli 2012 10 t s d s d n n 1 c s d d t s d s d is the conditional recurrence interval of s given d d n total number of drought events and n total length of drought index time series in years c s d d is the conditional distribution of copula and for gumbel hougaard it is expressed as reddy and ganguli 2012 11 c s d d θ u 1 exp log u θ log v θ 1 θ 1 log v log u θ 1 1 θ where θ is the joint dependence parameter and u f d d and v f s s are the marginal cdfs of d and s respectively thus for given recurrence interval or return periods such as 10 25 50 100 years the sdf curves are developed by solving c s d to provide the severity values for a particular duration the above methodology is individually applied to all the meteorological sub divisions of india the severity based drought atlas are developed for specific durations 3 6 12 months and return periods 50 and 100 years using the sdf curves in order to express the rarity of drought the probability of exceedance of severity of a drought for a given duration is computed using 12 p μ t where p is the probability of exceedance given as p p s s d d μ is the drought inter arrival time μ n n t is the conditional recurrence interval of s given d d 3 results and discussion 3 1 rationale for employing a multivariate drought index the pearson correlation coefficient between precipitation and soil moisture is positive for all the 30 meteorological sub divisions fig 1b emphasizing the need for multivariate drought analysis compound negative anomalies of precipitation and soil moisture leads to an adverse drought condition potentially impacting agriculture therefore in the scatter of standardized anomalies of precipitation versus soil moisture as shown in fig 3 a and b the observations lying in the third quadrant are critical from a multivariate drought perspective from fig 3a and b it is observed that several records of standardized anomalies of precipitation and soil moisture lie in this quadrant for both the sub divisions in particular for the 2015 event for both the sub divisions precipitation and soil moisture anomalies fall below zero and sometimes even below 1 indicating critical deficiencies in both precipitation and soil moisture similar observations are found for the other sub divisions too the marginal probabilities of the precipitation and soil moisture values for the months of august september and october for the period 1980 2015 derived using the univariate form of gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 and their joint probability derived using frank copula for the marathwada and eup sub division is shown in fig 3c and d respectively assuming the 20th percentile precipitation and soil moisture as the drought threshold different probability spaces are demarcated by l1 and l2 lines in the figure for the marathwada region the august 2015 record has a precipitation probability 0 2 and soil moisture probability 0 2 the above conditions of marginal probabilities of the drought variables which is of the univariate form denotes soil moisture drought only likewise for the eup region the august 2015 record has the precipitation and soil moisture probability 0 2 and 0 2 respectively denoting meteorological drought only however these two points in a bivariate probability space lies below the 0 2 contour line with a joint probability 0 1 representing drought conditions more realistically similar inferences can also be made for the september 2015 and october 2015 values also it may be noted that some records where precipitation and soil moisture probability are both greater than 0 2 neither meteorological nor agricultural drought might compound to induce a bivariate probability 0 2 thus leading to a drought condition which additionally increases the chances of detecting drought hao and aghakouchak 2013 hence the choice of msdi is justified in this study 3 2 joint modelling of drought duration and severity the summary of the drought statistics for marathwada and eup regions obtained after calculating msdi using monthly precipitation and soil moisture data for the period 1980 2015 is tabulated in table 1 the cdf plots of the different distributions used in the present study for fitting the drought duration and severity for marathwada and eup regions are shown in fig 4 a d respectively the performance of each of the distribution is evaluated using the criteria mse and aic the performance of different probability distributions for fitting them to the drought variables severity and duration for marathwada and eup regions are shown in table 2 exponential distribution is found to be the best fit distribution for both drought duration and severity for marathwada as well as eup sub division it is interesting to note that drought duration and severity were significantly correlated pearson correlation coefficient 0 95 for all the 30 meteorological sub divisions fig 5 therefore the joint modelling of these two variables is carried out using a copula function the parameters of the copula function are estimated using the maximum likelihood method the upper tail dependence coefficients calculated for different fitted copulas for the marathwada and eup regions are shown in table 3 the cfg estimate of the upper tail dependence coefficient for gumbel hougaard copula is found to be similar to that of the upper tail dependence coefficient calculated using the dependence parameter gumbel hougaard copula is observed to be the best fit copula for all the other meteorological sub divisions also based on the cfg estimator in the past a number of studies rajsekhar et al 2015b ganguli 2014 reddy and ganguli 2013 ganguli and reddy 2014 tosunoğlu and onof 2017 irrespective of their choice of the drought index the drought characteristics such as duration and severity were modelled jointly using the gumbel hougaard copula the conditional drought duration distribution for given drought severity at 50th 75th and 90th percentiles and the conditional drought severity distribution for given drought duration at 50th 75th and 90th percentiles are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively for the marathwada and eup regions the knowledge of conditional probability is useful to assess the properties of specific drought events for example the probability of occurrence of a drought event of duration less than 10 months for 90th percentile drought severity is 0 71 in marathwada whereas a similar drought condition in eup region may have a probability of 0 69 further the probability of a drought event having a severity value less than 10 for 90th percentile drought duration is around 0 62 in marathwada and a similar drought condition in eup region may have a probability of 0 6 3 3 multivariate drought sdf curves and drought atlas the copula based sdf curves are developed for the specific return periods of 10 25 50 and 100 years for their relevance in planning and management in general the sdf curves are multivariate tools that link severity and duration of droughts to the return period fig 7 a and b show the sdf curves derived for the marathwada and eup region respectively the sdf curves for the rest of the meteorological sub divisions is available upon request to the corresponding author the rate of increase of drought severity is small for shorter drought durations compared to that of longer drought durations for a specified duration and return period the drought severity magnitude can be calculated from these curves this information can be used to design structural measures such as construction of reservoirs or check dams that can improve drought resilience reddy and ganguli 2012 for example while designing an irrigation structure for 1 in 50 year return period in the region of marathwada to meet the agricultural water demand the design severity value of 10 1 should be considered for a drought condition of 6 month duration for a similar drought condition in eup a design severity of 10 3 should be taken in order to meet the water demands many of these water harvesting and conservation structures are commonly designed for return periods of 10 25 or 50 years short term or non structural measures such as crop management on the other hand may be based on more frequent droughts further a spatial comparison of these sdf curves for different regions help in identifying drought prone regions where mitigation measures are more important than in regions where such measures are not critically needed interestingly the convex nature of the sdf curves for the odisha sub division for return period 10 year from the present study is comparable with that of samantaray et al 2019 who used crop water stress as the drought index also for the western rajasthan sub division the msdi based sdf curves with convex nature is comparable with that of the spi based sdf curves developed by reddy and ganguli 2012 in a study by gupta et al 2020 the spei 10 based sdf relationships for the indian regions were derived where they observed constant rate of change of severity with the change in duration for the peninsular india except the western ghats whereas in the present study the msdi based sdf relationships show increase in the rate of drought severity with the increase in duration for all the regions in india this shows that the choice of drought variables is important while focusing on the specific drought type the drought atlas derived using the sdf curves for 1 3 and 6 months drought durations and 50 and 100 year return periods for all the meteorological sub divisions is shown in fig 8 the drought atlas for 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods with the drought duration of 1 10 months is available upon request to the corresponding author the categories of the severity are based on the jenk s natural break algorithm that maximizes the difference between the classes and minimizing the within class differences it is interesting to note that geographically neighboring regions show contrasting behavior for long term droughts for example west madhya pradesh shows large drought severity as compared to its surrounding sub divisions this is not unexpected considering diverse topographical features or large spatio temporal variations in rainfall patterns from one region to another in india regions of north interior karnataka west madhya pradesh maharashtra telangana bihar jharkhand gangetic west bengal kerala punjab chattisgarh and north east india are found to be having a higher severity compared to other sub divisions though counter intuitive fig 8 shows larger drought severity for regions of high rainfall such as kerala or north east india this is because the multivariate drought atlas developed in this study represents variability in rainfall and soil moisture with respect to the long term mean these maps are not merely indicative of regions of high or low rainfall since the msdi captures the concurrent deficit in rainfall and soil moisture with respect to a threshold the multivariate drought atlas shows that regions of high rainfall may be susceptible to larger variability in these drought variables as compared to their long term mean interestingly western rajasthan and marathwada which belong to the arid zone show lower drought severity values for the same return period and duration as compared to other sub divisions this is because the drought atlas is derived based on probabilistic frequency analysis of events and not necessarily using the magnitude of precipitation or soil moisture alone although these regions are known to be drier than the rest of the country their low variability of precipitation and soil moisture is reflected in the lower severity values the drought atlas presented in fig 8 guides the choice of design severity for a given duration and return period for water resources management it may be noted here that the drought atlas presented here complements the government of india s official manual for drought management department of agricultural cooperation 2016 which includes the assessment of primary and impact indicators for drought declaration it considers precipitation as the mandatory indicator for determination of drought trigger following which the impact indicators such as crop area sown ndvi or vegetation condition index deviations percent available soil moisture moisture adequacy index reservoir storage index groundwater drought index and streamflow drought index are further evaluated for drought declaration our framework presents an alternative for the situations where data on all these impact indicators may not be available further it also allows the evaluation of return period and rarity of drought events declared according to the manual for drought management or otherwise 3 4 rarity of the 2015 drought event the 2015 drought in india is a recent event and among the top ten most severe droughts table 4 in the climatological period of analysis 1980 2015 to assess the historical context of the impactful 2015 drought event in india its probability of exceedance is computed by considering the maximum severity and its associated duration for each meteorological sub division the country wide rarity map for the 2015 drought event is presented in fig 9 from fig 9a it can be seen that the sub divisions west uttar pradesh eup jharkhand marathwada telangana and north interior karnataka experienced a rare drought event in the year 2015 with the probability of exceedance less than 10 and return periods between 5 100 years the 2015 drought event in marathwada and eup were previously studied at regional scales and were primarily attributed to soil moisture and precipitation deficits respectively kulkarni et al 2016 concluded that the rainfall deficit in marathwada during this time was not unprecedented with the impacts being solely attributable to soil moisture deficits due to poor water management practices on the other hand the drought over eup was the consequence of severe deficiency in precipitation although the impacts were partly managed via soil moisture retention through irrigation mishra et al 2016 however the extremeness of individual drought events may be sensitive to the region choice of individual physiographical variables and selection of drought characteristics brunner et al 2019 probabilistic assessment based on the multivariate drought atlas prevents underestimation of drought risk as compared to univariate approaches hence we use the multivariate drought atlas to assess the spatial extent and rarity of the 2015 drought event in india eup and marathwada are both found to be experiencing an extreme drought probability of exceedance 0 005 as observed in fig 9a establishing the usefulness of the developed multivariate drought atlas in capturing rarity of individual drought events realistically further to understand the associated agricultural impacts and to validate the estimated risk of the event sub division wise averaged ndvi anomalies during drought conditions of 2015 are shown in fig 9b though not directly comparable the negative anomalies of ndvi are found to overall coincide with the regions that experienced rare drought according to the developed drought atlas thus improving the confidence in its use for probabilistic drought risk assessment 4 summary and conclusion in this study a country wide multivariate drought atlas is developed derived from copula based severity duration frequency relationships using a multivariate drought index that considers deficiency in both precipitation and soil moisture sdf curves are obtained for each of the 30 meteorological sub divisions in india considering the joint dependence between drought duration and severity the spatial extent and rarity of the 2015 drought event in india is assessed using these sdf curves and the developed drought atlas the following conclusions were drawn from the paper 1 the correlation between precipitation and soil moisture variables across the country imparts the necessity for multivariate drought analysis msdi is successful in identifying the drought events occurring due to deficiencies in either or both precipitation and soil moisture 2 drought characteristics such as severity and duration are found to be inter related for all the regions in the country to consider such dependence copula based sdf relationships are developed for all the meteorological sub divisions these sdf curves are a powerful tool for water resources management in drought prone regions 3 a first ever country wide drought atlas is developed based on the regional sdf relationships regions of central india such as north interior karnataka west madhya pradesh parts of maharashtra and telangana parts of east india such as bihar jharkhand chattisgarh and gangetic west bengal kerala in south west india punjab in north india and north east india are found to be severely affected by the variability in precipitation and soil moisture imparting them higher drought severity values 4 the impactful 2015 drought event is found to be deficient in terms of both precipitation and soil moisture for many parts of the country west uttar pradesh east uttar pradesh jharkhand marathwada telangana and north interior karnataka sub divisions experienced a rare drought return periods 5 100 years 5 the multivariate approach followed in this study presents a realistic estimate of risk of rare events such as the 2015 drought as opposed to that using univariate indicators 6 the spatial pattern of the rarity map tallies well with observed ndvi anomalies for the 2015 drought event highlighting the effectiveness of the developed drought atlas in agricultural impact assessment and mitigation of rare droughts funding the authors

8329,study region big east river and black river watersheds in northern ontario canada as snow dominated data poor case studies study focus in this study seven lumped conceptual models were thoroughly compared in order to determine the best performing model for reproducing different components of the hydrograph including low and high flows in data poor catchments all models were calibrated using five various objective functions for reducing the effects of calibration process on models performance additionally the effects of precipitation an important factor particularly in data scarce regions were assessed by comparing two precipitation input scenarios 1 low density ground based gauge data and 2 the canadian precipitation analysis capa data the final goal of this study was to compare the effects of using either the degree day or snow17 snowmelt estimation methods on the accuracy of streamflow simulation new hydrological insights the results indicate that in general machbv is the best performing model at simulating daily streamflow in a data poor watershed and both sacsma and gr4j can provide competitive results additionally machbv and gr4j are superior to the other conceptual models regarding high flow simulation moreover it was found that incorporating the more complex snow17 snowmelt estimation method did not always enhance the performance of the hydrologic models finally the results also confirmed the reliability of the capa data as an alternative forcing precipitation in the case of low data availability keywords model inter comparison simple conceptual models data scarce regions canadian precipitation analysis capa snowmelt estimation canada 1 introduction possessing reliable hydrological models is an important issue for operational hydrology and water resources management donnelly makowecki and moore 1999 razavi and coulibaly 2017 and this is a unique challenge in data scarce regions adjei et al 2015 various types of rainfall runoff models from lumped empirical to fully distributed physically based ones have been designed with different mathematical representations of hydrological processes beven 2011 lü et al 2013 moradkhani and sorooshian 2008 empirical or data driven models are based on mathematical equations not specifically related to the physical processes of the watershed although these models have some advantages such as having higher performance efficiency they are only valid within the boundaries of the given data shrestha and solomatine 2009 in contrast physically based distributed models are better at representing spatial variability when characterizing the water cycle processes and can produce more reliable results moradkhani and sorooshian 2008 smith et al 2004 having parameters with physical interpretation and spatial variability is the main advantage of physically based distributed models however their proper estimation requires more computational cost and huge amount of data shrestha 2009 this poses a problem when the area of interest has low data availability gan et al 2006 grayson et al 2002 tegegne et al 2017b young 2002 conceptual lumped models are another group of hydrologic models which can provide a desirable alternative to empirical and physically based distributed models these models are commonly based on several interconnected conceptual elements representing different hydrologic components there are various conceptual hydrologic models with different structures and processes and the popularity of these models is due to their simplicity and low computational costs inter comparison of various models is one of the most convenient approaches for assessing the influence of model structure and aiding in the selection of the best performing model breuer et al 2009 garavaglia et al 2017 also through the comparison a multi model ensemble can be generated which can then be used for quantifying model structural uncertainty seiller et al 2012 various studies have been conducted using model inter comparison experiments in the field of streamflow simulation e g chiew et al 1993 das et al 2008 gan et al 1997 koch et al 2016 michaud and sorooshian 1994 shi et al 2011 suliman et al 2015 te linde et al 2008 tegegne et al 2017a vansteenkiste et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 however few of them focused on regions with low data availability refsgaard and knudsen 1996 compared a physically based distributed a lumped conceptual and a semi distributed hydrologic models for three data scarce regions in zimbabwe their results showed that although using the distributed model provided reliable results it did not outperformed simpler ones in term of streamflow simulation at the outlet the study by tegegne et al 2017b found that through the inter comparison of lumped conceptual models with a physically based semi distributed model in data poor catchments use of a more complex model could not be justified anshuman et al 2019 proposed considering conceptual over physically based models in the case of facing watersheds with low data availability in addition comparing a semi distributed and a lumped model by srivastava et al 2020 again showed the superiority of the lumped model for hydrological modeling in data limited basins although it can be argued that simple lumped conceptual hydrologic models could be the best choice for modeling rainfall runoff process in data scarce watersheds the need of comprehensive comparison of the performance of various lumped conceptual model structures is strongly felt on regions with limited data availability furthermore the applicability of a conceptual hydrologic model is highly related to how well its parameters are estimated sorooshian et al 1993 although using a multi objective calibration procedure provides valuable information about the parameter equifinality and uncertainty there are different studies ranging from flood forecasting e g han et al 2019 reggiani et al 2009 wijayarathne and coulibaly 2020 to climate change assessment e g ashofteh et al 2017 li et al 2014 where one optimal parameter set is utilized for streamflow simulation or forecasting various performance statistics have been developed to evaluate the performance of hydrological models and each of them can be considered as an objective function for estimating parameters lü et al 2013 wöhling et al 2013 therefore the selected objective function may affect the performance of the calibrated rainfall runoff model although reducing these effects on the model inter comparison process seems important for achieving more reliable results gan et al 1997 ouermi et al 2019 it has not received much attention in previous studies reliable and accurate historical forcing data has a considerable effect on the calibration process and the corresponding model performance te linde et al 2008 temperature can be accurately estimated using the low density measurements however accounting for the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation is challenging in data poor watersheds price et al 2014 consequently assessing the potential of utilizing other sources of precipitation data e g satellite or radar based data as input into a rainfall runoff model seems necessary in the case of limited ground based observation stations this has recently motivated research in data scarce regions to evaluate the influence of using other sources of precipitation e g climate forecast system reanalysis data dile and srinivasan 2014 fuka et al 2014 tropical rainfall measuring mission precipitation analysis adjei et al 2015 collischonn et al 2008 worqlul et al 2017 and north american regional reanalysis choi et al 2009 for models calibration their general finding is that the precipitation products provide valuable information for data scarce regions while their evaluation at local scale is required due to regional variability of their quality lakew et al 2020 sirisena et al 2018 in addition by removing possible random and systematic errors the application of a bias correction method can enhance the applicability of precipitation products at regional scale habib et al 2014 canada specific a canadian precipitation analysis capa data is a gridded precipitation product which is generated using various sources of precipitation such as observations radar data and forecasts mahfouf et al 2007 there are few studies evaluating capa in terms of hydrologic performance eum et al 2014 applied capa into the vic model for streamflow simulation of canadian mountainous catchments in the case study by gaborit et al 2017 a comparison was made between capa and ground based observations in terms of the accuracy of runoff predictions using two lumped models also boluwade et al 2018 assessed the reliability of capa as forcing of watflood hydrologic model in previous studies the accuracy of various precipitation products were evaluated while none have utilized them in a model inter comparison experiment for reducing the effects of forcing input on model performance also assessing precipitation products utilizing multiple hydrologic models lead to more robust results than their proxy evaluation using streamflow data and an auxiliary model fortin et al 2018 the main objective of this study is to evaluate various lumped conceptual models with different structures for continuous daily streamflow prediction in order to propose the most suitable one for operational hydrology in watersheds with low data availability by focusing on two data poor watersheds in northern ontario canada the performance of seven different lumped conceptual models are thoroughly compared using different statistics focusing on low and high flow conditions in the proposed inter comparison framework we utilized an ensemble of calibrated parameter sets for each hydrologic model derived from implementing different objective functions which reduces the effects of the calibration process on models performance also besides the low density gauge measurements we used capa precipitation data as an alternative forcing input in the model comparison process this helps us reach more robust conclusions about the direct ability of different hydrologic model structures for streamflow simulation in addition we have the opportunity to evaluate the reliability of using capa data as an alternative input forcing precipitation in the case of low available historical meteorological data in northern ontario moreover given that the regions of interest are snow dominated watersheds where the snowmelt freshet is the main cause of floods using a proper snowmelt estimation routine in model structure seems necessary for accurate streamflow simulation therefore as a side objective of this study a comparison is made between two popular temperature index methods the simple degree day samuel et al 2011 and the more complex snow17 anderson 2006 1973 to evaluate their potential for improving stream flow estimation in snow dominated basins with low data availability it is of note that there are lots of studies comparing temperature index with complex energy balance snowmelt models bowling et al 2003 debele et al 2010 essery et al 2013 troin et al 2015 while the comparison between different conceptual methods where the only required inputs are temperature and precipitation has not received much attention agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 2 methods 2 1 study area and data description the study regions are the big east river and the black river watersheds which have areas of 620 and 1522 km2 respectively both watersheds are located in the muskoka bracebridge areas of northern ontario canada fig 1 the terrain elevation of the big east river watershed ranges from 293 to 564 meter above sea level masl while the black river changes from 221 to 421 masl there are no major urban areas in either watersheds and with the exception of the southern part of the black river used for agriculture the dominant land cover of two basins are mixed forest vegetation there are only six environment and climate change canada ec meteorological stations with more than 10 years of reliable data and all are located near but not within the aforementioned watersheds boundaries fig 1 each watershed has one hydrometric station located at their outlets confirming the status of low data availability based on all available historical data the long term daily mean air temperature of the regions is around 5 c and the warmest and coldest months are february and july respectively the temperature is near or below freezing point from november to march indicating a need for modeling snow storage and snowmelt processes the highest discharge for both watersheds occurs during spring indicating the runoff is snowmelt dominated table 1 apart from ec meteorological stations the archive of canadian precipitation analysis capa produced by the meteorological service of canada mahfouf et al 2007 is another source of precipitation time series available for both study regions capa is a near real time gridded precipitation analysis based on the combination of observation and climate model data with a spatial and temporal resolution of 15 km and 6 hours respectively lespinas et al 2015 capa points i e center of each capa grid located inside or near both watersheds are illustrated in fig 1 capa provides better spatial coverage of both watersheds so considering it as an alternative forcing precipitation input may enhance the performance of hydrologic models in the case of limited data measurements consequently two different precipitation input scenarios will be evaluated in the first scenario the daily precipitation comes from interpolation of the available ec meteorological stations to the center of the watersheds using the inverse distance weighting american society of civil engineers 1996 method the second scenario involves using the thiessen polygon method thiessen 1911 to generate mean areal precipitation with the daily aggregated capa data the primary comparison of two scenarios shows that in general capa data underestimates the precipitation amount in comparison with ec fig 2 however capa specifically in black river watershed proposes more intense rainfall events in this study both aforementioned scenarios are separately used to calibrate the models parameters and the reliability of using capa data is evaluated based on the performance of the calibrated models 2 2 rainfall runoff models the seven structurally different conceptual hydrologic models compared in this study are 1 the sacramento soil moisture accounting sacsma burnash et al 1973 2 the mcmaster university hydrologiska byrans vattenbalansavdelning machbv samuel et al 2011 3 génie rural à 4 paramètres journaliers gr4j perrin et al 2003 4 the modified version of the soil moisture and accounting routing smarg liang 1992 and three different implementations of the hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms software scharffenberg 2016 these models are chosen mainly based on their structural diversity and performances in previous studies sacsma is widely used for operational flood forecasting in united states e g day 1985 seo et al 2003 vrugt et al 2006 and it was proven to perform well in canadian catchments agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 wijayarathne and coulibaly 2020 machbv is the modified version of hbv bergström 1976 which is specifically developed for enhancing streamflow estimation of ungauged basins samuel et al 2012 2011 smarg is another well known conceptual model with variable number of soil storage which is proven to provide better performance than its original version in humid and semi humid regions tan and o connor 1996 gr4j is a parsimonious hydrologic model with two conceptual storages and was successfully applied in canadian cold regions gaborit et al 2017 martel et al 2020 seiller et al 2012 moreover hec hms is a widely used platform all over the world which provides several different methods for developing structurally different models to simulate rainfall runoff process gyawali and watkins 2013 teng et al 2018 the main different characteristics of the structures of these seven models are summarized in table 2 these models possess distinct complexities and their number of parameters varies based on their corresponding number of hydrologic processes and descriptions a brief explanation of each model is provided in the following sections it is worthy of note that in all sacsma machbv smarg and gr4j the daily potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the simplified thornthwaite equation samuel et al 2011 thornthwaite 1948 by multiplying mean daily temperature by a t h o r n as the only parameter being determined through calibration process table 3 in addition the simple degree day dd snowmelt routine was added to these models for representing changes in the snowpack as well as discriminating snow and rainfall a brief explanation of the dd method is presented in section 3 3 2 2 1 sacramento soil moisture accounting sacsma the sacsma is a well known conceptual lumped hydrologic model which is used by the national weather service river forecast system nwsrfs for flood forecasting in this model the surface of the basin is divided into pervious and impervious areas the soil profile of the pervious portion is partitioned into the thin upper and thicker lower zones a total of five state variable reservoirs are used to determine the accumulation of tension and free water storages representing the water bound and not bound to the soil particles respectively caldwell et al 2015 razavi and coulibaly 2017 moreover the nash cascade method is implemented as the routing approach in this model as can be seen in table 3 the model possesses 17 parameters that must be specified by the user or through an automatic calibration 2 2 2 mcmaster university hydrologiska byrans vattenbalansavdelning machbv the machbv is a nonlinear variant of the conceptual hbv model bergström 1976 in this model a soil moisture routine accounts for fluctuations of the soil moisture storage of the basin a response function comprising upper and lower soil reservoirs is used for estimating the amount of runoff based on the recharge from soil moisture routine finally considering the modified routing routine proposed by samuel et al 2012 where the nonlinear storage discharge relationship is considered in the lower layer of deep soil the final streamflow is obtained these processes are controlled through 10 parameters shown in table 3 more detailed description of the machbv model can be found in samuel et al 2011 2012 2 2 3 the modified version of soil moisture and accounting routing smarg the smarg is a 10 parameter lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model following the structure of its earliest version i e smar o connell et al 1970 in this modification a single reservoir groundwater component is added for considering the effects of groundwater on total estimated discharge liang 1992 therefore it is more reliable in humid regions where the groundwater component contributes significantly in generating runoff tan and o connor 1996 this model uses a nonlinear water balance routine for simulating runoff generation process by visualizing the watershed as a stack of horizontal soil storage layers then the generated surface runoff is transferred through nash cascade of equal linear reservoirs model nash 1957 while the previously mentioned single linear reservoir is used for routing the groundwater discharge the brief descriptions of the model parameters and their initial ranges are provided in table 3 2 2 4 génie rural à 4 paramètres journaliers gr4j the gr4j is a daily conceptual rainfall runoff model developed based on the gr3j model edijanto et al 1999 with only four parameters needing to be calibrated table 3 this model consists of three subsequent steps first net precipitation and evapotranspiration is calculated afterward a portion of net rainfall goes to the one parameter x 1 production store where the actual evapotranspiration and percolation are determined then the remaining portion of net precipitation and percolation are used for determining discharge a unit hydrograph with time base of x 2 and a one parameter x 3 non linear routing store transfer 90 percent of the available water as slow flow while the other ten percent is considered as a fast flow and routed by a unit hydrograph with time base of 2 x 2 finally after applying the one parameter x 4 groundwater exchange component the total discharge is computed by adding the two aforementioned routed flows perrin et al 2003 2 2 5 lumped hec hms based models the hec hms software developed by the us army corps of engineers is designed for both continuous and event based simulation of the rainfall runoff process of dendritic watersheds scharffenberg 2016 it is a reliable platform for developing variants of lumped and semi distributed hydrologic models by allowing the user to choose from an assortment of methods which can model different components of hydrologic cycles i e surface canopy loss transform baseflow and routing processes the general structure of any continuous hydrologic model developed based on the hec hms framework is illustrated in fig 3 as can be seen the meteorological component including the snow rainfall discrimination and snowmelt module estimates the excess water that may contribute to runoff generation then the basin component consisting of the conceptual simulations of different physical phenomena determines the streamflow value at the outlet of the watershed in this study three lumped structurally different hydrologic models were developed using different combinations of the available baseflow and loss methods in the hec hms platform the first hec hms model called hec1 hereafter uses the deficit and constant loss method and the recession baseflow method while the other two models i e hec2 and hec3 use the soil moisture accounting loss method with the recession or linear reservoir baseflow methods respectively the parameters of the utilized approaches presented in table 4 show the total number of 7 15 and 17 parameters for hec1 hec2 and hec3 models respectively excluding the parameters of snowmelt routine it is worth mentioning that the only snowmelt method available in the hec hms software is the temperature index that is an extension of the degree day dd approach however unlike the dd approach where a constant snowmelt rate is used for each degree above a base temperature the melting rate in hec hms is determined as a function of an antecedent temperature index ati gyawali and watkins 2013 razmkhah et al 2016 as can be seen in table 4 due to the importance of ati melt rate atimr function on the accuracy of the snowmelt process 22 different scenarios are defined for the atimr curve proposed by usace khalida et al 2014 u s army corps of engineers 1991 and the best one is determined through the calibration process additionally all three hec hms based models use the monthly average pet option in their meteorology models the monthly average was calculated using the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 which is proved to be one of the most promising temperature based pet estimation method in cold regions almorox et al 2015 2 3 snowmelt routines as previously mentioned due to the significant effects of the snowmelt process on stream flows in both big east river and black river watersheds two different temperature index models requiring only temperature and precipitation data are selected both methods possess the same snow rainfall discrimination procedure where the upper t r and lower t s threshold temperatures are used as two calibrating parameters to distinguish between snow and rainfall samuel et al 2011 in addition in both models the amount of rain and snow are simply modified by multiplying by rain correction r c f and snow correction s c f factors respectively for snowmelt estimation the degree day dd method relies on a linear relationship between snowmelt and air temperature t if t is less than the melting temperature threshold t m the melt rate is calculated by multiplying difference between t and t m by degree day factor d d f the snow17 approach however considers some of the physical processes involved in snowmelt e g energy exchange between air and snow the effects of rain on snow the snowpack heat storage and deficit without needing additional input data agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 anderson 2006 during the non rain period the same concept as dd is used for melt rate calculation whereas the melt factor seasonally changes based on two parameters maximum m f m a x and minimum m f m i n melt factors additionally the melt during rain is determined by a simplified empirical energy balance equation shamir and georgakakos 2006 other parameters which should be calibrated for snow17 include the average wind function u a d j antecedent snow temperature index t i p m maximum negative melt factor n m f and the water holding capacity of the snow pack p l w h c detailed descriptions of both snow routing approaches can be found in the above cited references 2 4 optimization and evaluation processes the main purpose of the calibration of a rainfall runoff model is to select the best parameter values by minimizing the difference between observations and model streamflow predictions chiew et al 1993 however the choice of a proper objective function from a bunch of well known performance statistics is not a straightforward task in this study for decreasing the influence of choosing objective function on models inter comparison five criteria including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash volume error nve kling gupta efficiency kge modified nash volume error mnve and peak weighted root mean square error pwrmse were selected and considered as different single objective functions in order to find the best parameter set for each of the rainfall runoff models table 5 while the first three metrics are formulated to accurately simulate medium flows the latter two ones focus on providing more accurate high flow simulation all models are calibrated for the period from 2006 to 2011 with the year 2006 considered as warm up period the three year period 2012 to 2015 was used for the validation the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 was used to calibrate the parameters for each model in this study dds is a heuristic global single solution based search algorithm that was developed to calibrate complex hydrological models with a large number of parameters arsenault et al 2014 the main distinguishing feature of this method is the transition from global to local search by dynamically rescaling the dimension of the search space the ostrich calibration toolkit matott 2005 was used to run the dds optimization for each model it is of note that although there are two available automatic calibration algorithms in hec hms software they perform poorly in finding the optimized parameter sets especially when there are a relatively high number of parameters to be calibrated cunderlik and simonovic 2004 from the literature with the exception of dariane et al 2016 who developed an automatic calibration for the hec hms program based on genetic algorithm there are no studies that calibrate all parameters of a continuous hec hms model with snowmelt routine using auto optimization methods in this paper ostrich matlab hec hms and hec dssvue are linked together in order to apply the dds optimization algorithm to calibrate hec hms models fig 4 moreover in this study seven different evaluation metrics are used for assessing the performance of the calibrated models table 5 apart from standard n s e we utilized n s e calculated based on logarithmic n s e l and squared n s e s transformed stream flows for reflecting the accuracy of low and high flows respectively volume error v e assesses the long term performance of the model simulation and peak error p e evaluates the models ability in capturing peak flows also the transferability of a model in time is illustrated using the coefficient of transferability t m where the lower values show better model parameters transferability from calibration to validation period moreover for more specific evaluation of different models ability in reproducing high flows n s e is calculated and compared using the 90 percentile streamflow values n s e 90 we also utilize representative hydrographs and scatterplots as graphical tools for visually assessing the performance of different models 3 results 3 1 objective functions evaluation the combination of seven hydrologic models two different precipitation input scenarios and five various objective functions leads to 70 different calibrated models for each watershed evaluating the effect of considering different objective functions is the prime step before comparing various hydrologic models therefore a comparison is made between the performance of the calibrated models using the five performance criteria in table 5 as an objective function for both the big east river and black river watersheds in the validation period fig 5 the first thing that stands out from the comparison results in both basins is that neither of the objective functions has complete superiority in providing the most promising parameters set of all models based on the results it is shown that although the p w r m s e and m n v e statistics give more weights to high flow values using them as an objective function does not significantly improve the performance of the calibrated models regarding high flows additionally the models calibrated with those metrics pwrmse and mnve are the worst at modeling low flows leading to large variation in n s e l moreover as expected calibrated models utilizing n s e as an objective function perform well according to n s e based performance criteria i e n s e n s e s and n s e l however there are some concerns about their performance regarding volume and peak error related measurements especially in big east river watershed where both v e and p e uncertainty of n s e based calibrated models are relatively large in addition the comparison of n s e l measurements shows that using n v e for calibrating models outperform the other ones in low flow simulation in both watersheds the relative good performance of the k g e based calibrated models is noticeable in big east river while in black river watershed they are not the best ones by looking at all different performance criteria simultaneously it can be seen that using k g e and n v e provide good and reliable performance when considering different aspects of the hydrographs i e low high and peak flows however it is impossible to determine one objective function as the best one that can be used for calibrating all hydrologic models in both watersheds for better clarifying the effects of choosing objective function on model results table 6 exemplifies the validation performances of machbv and smarg hydrologic models being calibrated using n v e and k g e as objective functions in big east river using n v e provides better parameter estimation of machbv while k g e performs better for smarg the opposite is true in black river watershed where k g e and n v e are better objective functions for machbv and smarg respectively the use of n v e leads to the superiority of machbv in big east river while smarg perform better if both models are calibrated with k g e the same issue arise in black river where comparing k g e calibrated models shows the advantages of machbv over smarg however the same performances are achieved in the case of using n v e 3 2 model comparison the main goal of this study is to find the most promising conceptual hydrologic model in data poor watersheds by reducing the effects of the calibration process on models performance therefore two types of inter comparison are made between the seven aforementioned hydrologic models first we compared all calibrated models with each other consequently the twenty calibrated sets of parameters for each hydrologic model are considered to create the box plots of the evaluation performance metrics for the validation period fig 6 the most obvious conclusion derived from fig 6 is that in general the hec hms based models perform worst in comparison to the other hydrologic models this relatively poor performance is more significant when the low flows are the main concerns of the simulation moreover regarding high flows the machbv shows the best performance while the high capability of the gr4j model in high flows simulation cannot be ignored specifically in the big east river watershed where the p e criteria of the gr4j models is the best one by looking at all six performance statistics the machbv is the most consistent hydrologic model for both watersheds and can be considered the best rated one the performance of both the sacsma and gr4j models also provide reliable and valuable results whereas the hec based models do not the second type of model inter comparison is between the best calibrated set of parameters for each model using the ec precipitation input scenario we chose the best parameter set by comparing all the aforementioned performance statistics focusing on the validation period the set of parameters with the best rank and rational condition i e the values of different performance measurements are controlled manually and parameters set providing unreasonable predictions are ignored was determined as the best selected one the evaluated performance statistics of the final selected models in both calibration and validation periods and the relative comparison between them are presented in table 7 and fig 7 respectively what stands out in the results for the black river watershed is that in general machbv is the best rated model based on most of the criteria in both calibration and validation periods however the results are more complex for the big east river watershed where the gr4j model is the best performing one during the validation period while machbv sacsma and gr4j models perform competitively based on the calibration period results moreover regarding high flow based criteria machbv and gr4j respectively provide the best results in black river and big east river watersheds in addition as concluded in the previous comparison although hec2 and hec3 compared with hec1 relatively lead to more reliable results the three hec based models do not perform as well as the other four conceptual models in either watersheds for a better comparison of different model performance in simulating high flows scatter plots of the simulated and observed daily peak flows peak flows greater than 75 percentile are illustrated in fig 8 additionally for qualitative inspection fig 9 presents a representative portion of the simulated and observed hydrographs based on various hydrologic models with their best parameter sets presented in table 7 as was concluded previously machbv and gr4j show better performance in comparison to the other models regarding high flows in both watersheds however it is worthy of note that even the best hydrologic models possess a clear tendency to underestimate peak flows especially in the black river watershed this underestimation can likely be attributed to both the models structures as well as the quality of forcing input data the poor estimation of mean areal precipitation derived from low density meteorological stations can lead to systematic under overestimation of stream flows collischonn et al 2008 tegegne et al 2017b 3 3 the effect of forcing precipitation input capa versus ground based stations in the case of low density meteorological measurements utilizing other sources of data as forcing inputs into hydrologic models is necessary here in order to evaluate the reliability of canadian precipitation analysis capa data a comparison is made between the simulation results derived from the best optimal parameter set of all hydrologic models using the two predefined input scenarios the results as shown in fig 10 indicate that in general the capa based calibrated models performed approximately similar to the calibrated models based on ec data however the average transferability statistic implies that using capa data in comparison to ec provides more consistent performance for the models during the calibration and validation periods also by focusing on high flows it can be concluded that capa based calibrated models performed better specifically in the black river watershed where both n s e 90 and p e criteria of capa based calibrated models possess a noticeable superiority over ec based ones moreover the effects of using different precipitation scenarios on model performances are separately evaluated for various hydrologic models using the percentage of improvement in low medium and high flows these percentages are respectively defined as the percent increase in n s e l n s e and n s e s criteria when capa is used as forcing input in comparison to the ec scenario table 8 as can be seen the effects of using capa as an alternative forcing precipitation input is not consistent with different hydrologic model regarding high flows the results shows the advantage of using capa for almost all models in both big east river and black river watersheds where respectively the average of 18 and 12 percentage of performance improvement occurs based on n s e s criterion however the effects of implementing capa on low flow performance of different models do not follow the same trend in big east river watershed using capa leads to lower n s e l of machbv sacsma and smarg while the low flow performance improvement of hec hms based models is significantly high on the other hand in black river watershed except hec2 and hec3 where implementing ec and capa precipitation scenarios respectively results in better low flow simulation other models performances regarding low flows does not significantly changes when different input scenarios are used besides hec2 with 24 n s e based improvement the general performances of different models i e using nse measurement do not face significant changes in the case of using capa as forcing input 3 4 evaluation of snowmelt estimation methods degree day and snow17 models for assessing the effects of implementing a more complex snowmelt routine a comparison is made between the machbv and sacsma hydrologic models in conjunction with degree day dd and snow17 snowmelt estimation approaches four model structures stemming from the combination of two aforementioned hydrologic models and snow modules are calibrated using two predefined input scenarios and five aforementioned objective functions in both watersheds in order to facilitate the evaluation the percentages of model improvement in medium and high flows were used the former one is defined as a percent increase in n s e when the snow17 model is implemented in comparison to dd method while the latter one is based on n s e s criteria for focusing on high flows specifically positive values of model improvement shows the advantage of using the snow17 method fig 11 presents the model improvements in both calibration and validation periods using all calibrated models for each watershed for the sacsma in both watersheds during both periods the median is more than zero indicating enhancement of the model performance in the case of adapting the snow17 model however the positive effect of using the snow17 model combined with the machbv model structure cannot be concluded for instance although the model improvements during the calibration period in the big east river watershed are almost positive especially regarding high flows opposite results are obtained in the validation period where the high flow model improvement median is around 30 percent moreover in order to complete the assessment a comparison has been made between the best optimal parameter set of each model structure table 5 in line with the previous comparison the results indicate that coupling the sacsma and snow17 provides better results especially in high flows where the maximum of approximately 25 improvement occurs however the dd approach seems to be more appropriate to be used in conjunction with the machbv model structure especially in the big east river watershed in addition the performance of the models regarding the whole hydrographs i e model improvement based on nse varies between 2 and 8 depicting no specific enhancement of general models performance in the case of implementing more complex snowmelt models table 9 4 discussion assessing the effects of different objective functions on model performances indicate that in general using k g e and n v e as an objective function can provide more reliable estimation of different models parameters n v e is a combination of n s e and v e table 5 and its best value gives both the lowest difference between computed and observed flows and small volume error lindström 1997 samuel et al 2011 k g e also consider three measures correlation bias and variability simultaneously and provide more consistent results than n s e especially in basins where the variability of the observed flow is high buzacott et al 2019 gupta et al 2009 such as big east river watershed where the streamflow coefficient of variation is 1 21 compared with 1 05 in black river however the two aforementioned criteria do not always lead to the best optimal parameter sets for different hydrologic models in both watersheds and will affect the performance of various models in different manners fig 5 and table 6 this proves the necessity of considering multiple objective functions in model inter comparison process in order to find more robust and comprehensive conclusions inter comparison of different conceptual hydrologic models suggests that machbv is the most consistent model providing reliable low medium and high flow estimation in both basins this conclusion is in line with the original purpose of developing machbv which was to simulate stream flows of ungauged watersheds in ontario samuel et al 2011 2012 also the parsimonious gr4j model with the lowest complexity possess competitive performances in both watersheds especially regarding high flow simulation figs 8 and 9 besides the proven capability of gr4j model structure in daily streamflow simulation wijayarathne and coulibaly 2020 this advantage may be due to the remarkable ability of gr4j to compensate the problem of having poor precipitation input the parameters of gr4j model i e x 1 x 2 and x 3 can be relatively distorted through the calibration process in order to provide good results even with limited input data andréassian et al 2001 drogue and khediri 2016 simonneaux et al 2008 this ability is also demonstrated where along with machbv gr4j possesses the lowest changes of performance in comparison to other models when capa is used as another source of precipitation table 8 on the other hand compared with other conceptual models the hec hms based ones have relatively poor performances in both watersheds which is more significant in low flow simulation with hec1 and hec2 the possible reason of their poor performance which is more pronounced than hec3 is the low capability of the recession method in accurately estimating base flow in addition this may be due to the use of the fixed monthly estimated pet for hec hms based models compared with other models where the daily pet is determined during the calibration process therefore evaluating the effects of using an external pet estimation model linked and calibrated with hec hms on the accuracy of streamflow simulation is recommended evaluating the effects of capa as another source of precipitation for both watersheds indicate that the effect of using different input scenarios is not similar for different hydrologic models and considering it in model comparison process is required for possessing robust conclusions as previously stated changing rainfall has the least effect on machbv and gr4j models table 8 proving their suitability for study regions with low data availability also the reliability of capa as another source of precipitation for both watersheds is confirmed by comparing the performance of different hydrologic models capa based calibrated models yield better high flow estimation than using sparse ground based measurements for model calibration fig 10 and table 8 this is more obvious in black river watershed and can be justifiable by the fact that ec based input scenario underestimates severe daily rainfall events in the black river watershed fig 2 in line with previous studies the results of this study show that using reliable spatially distributed data can provides more accurate mean areal precipitation estimates and affect the performances of the lumped hydrologic models in data poor regions collischonn et al 2008 martel et al 2020 however more comprehensive evaluation of data with high spatial resolution and the effects of its spatial heterogeneity on hydrologic model performances required the application of a distributed or semi distributed hydrologic models mazzoleni et al 2019 snowmelt module is an important part of any hydrologic model in snow dominated watersheds therefore this study compared degree day dd and more complex snow17 methods relying on temperature and precipitation as the only inputs in conjunction with two hydrologic models i e machbv and sacsma in general in line with agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 the results indicate the competitive performance of dd in both watersheds which may be related to the land use characteristics of the regions which are forested regarding high flows the snow17 performs better than dd in black river watershed while in big east river this superiority is less noticeable and diminishes from calibration to validation periods this may be attributed to the steeper topography of the big east river watershed and not dividing it into different elevation zones agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 anderson 2006 another possible reason for this outcome is the lack of long term historical data in data scarce regions the higher degrees of freedom of snow17 method compared with ddm can lead to parameter overfitting when the length of the calibration period is not long enough due to low data availability 5 summary and conclusions inter comparison of various conceptual hydrologic models for continuous daily streamflow simulation in watersheds with low data availability is the main goal of this study consequently the performance of seven lumped conceptual rainfall runoff models with different structures i e sacsma machbv smarg gr4j and three hec hms based models were compared in two data poor and snow dominated watersheds big east river and black river located in northern ontario canada all models were calibrated using five different criteria i e n s e k g e n v e m n v e and p w r m s e and two different input scenarios in order to relax the influence of calibration process on the models results the comparison results suggest that although the sacsma and gr4j hydrologic models possess competitive performances machbv shows the best results in simulating the daily stream flows for both watersheds also the gr4j model shows the highest accuracy for high flow prediction in both watersheds the results also indicate that the hec hms based models provide lower performance especially for low flows from inter comparing the different structures of the hec hms models using the soil moisture accounting and linear reservoir approaches are preferred to deficit and constant loss and recession methods for continuous daily streamflow simulation moreover alongside model comparison the evaluation of the effects of using different objective functions shows that k g e and n v e are the most consistent criteria leading to reliable parameter estimation with reasonable performance regarding different parts of the hydrograph while comparing different model structures require considering the effects of objective function selection furthermore the comparison between gauged and capa based calibrated models in both watersheds indicates the high potential of capa data as a good alternative in the case of low data availability capa not only provides the same level of performance in general but also leads to better results than ground based data regarding high flows in addition due to the importance of accurate snowmelt estimation in snow dominated watersheds we compared the performance of the machbv and sacsma hydrologic models in conjunction with degree day method dd and more complex snow17 snowmelt estimation methods in both watersheds in general incorporation of snow17 does not significantly improve the performance of either hydrologic models by focusing on high flows however the results show that implementing snow17 with sacsma is consistently superior while the dd method can perform comparably well with machbv in general this study reveals that besides considering the effects of calibration process utilizing different precipitation input scenarios can lead to more robust conclusion of model comparison process in data poor watersheds the findings of this study suggest that machbv and gr4j are the most robust lumped conceptual rainfall runoff models reacting well to poor mean areal rainfall estimation in data scarce watersheds and performing well regarding different aspects of the hydrographs while the sacsma also reliably simulates streamflow in both watersheds in addition this study confirms the high potential of the archived aggregated daily capa data to be considered as a hydrologic forcing in data poor watersheds in northern ontario moreover another implication of the results is that implementing the more complex snow17 model for snowmelt estimation in watersheds with low data availability does not always provide more reliable results and its effectiveness depends on the hydrologic model structure limitations of this study are as follows the study was designed for assessing the general performance of models regarding all aspects of hydrographs i e low medium and high flows simultaneously however inter comparing various models being calibrated regarding different particular class of flows separately would be advisable although the hydrologic responses of the two considered watersheds are not quite similar the findings of this study remain applicable within the same topographic and climatologic conditions so we recommend further application of the proposed model inter comparison for different types of watersheds i e mountainous semi arid semi urban with low data availability for providing more comprehensive conclusions there are other conceptual models with different structures that are worth to be investigated in future studies the reliability of canadian precipitation analysis in estimating mean areal precipitation as an input of lumped models in data scarce regions were revealed in this study however further studies need to be carried out to comprehensively assessed the accuracy of spatial heterogeneity of capa data in northern ontario using a distributed or semi distributed hydrologic models credit authorship contribution

8329,study region big east river and black river watersheds in northern ontario canada as snow dominated data poor case studies study focus in this study seven lumped conceptual models were thoroughly compared in order to determine the best performing model for reproducing different components of the hydrograph including low and high flows in data poor catchments all models were calibrated using five various objective functions for reducing the effects of calibration process on models performance additionally the effects of precipitation an important factor particularly in data scarce regions were assessed by comparing two precipitation input scenarios 1 low density ground based gauge data and 2 the canadian precipitation analysis capa data the final goal of this study was to compare the effects of using either the degree day or snow17 snowmelt estimation methods on the accuracy of streamflow simulation new hydrological insights the results indicate that in general machbv is the best performing model at simulating daily streamflow in a data poor watershed and both sacsma and gr4j can provide competitive results additionally machbv and gr4j are superior to the other conceptual models regarding high flow simulation moreover it was found that incorporating the more complex snow17 snowmelt estimation method did not always enhance the performance of the hydrologic models finally the results also confirmed the reliability of the capa data as an alternative forcing precipitation in the case of low data availability keywords model inter comparison simple conceptual models data scarce regions canadian precipitation analysis capa snowmelt estimation canada 1 introduction possessing reliable hydrological models is an important issue for operational hydrology and water resources management donnelly makowecki and moore 1999 razavi and coulibaly 2017 and this is a unique challenge in data scarce regions adjei et al 2015 various types of rainfall runoff models from lumped empirical to fully distributed physically based ones have been designed with different mathematical representations of hydrological processes beven 2011 lü et al 2013 moradkhani and sorooshian 2008 empirical or data driven models are based on mathematical equations not specifically related to the physical processes of the watershed although these models have some advantages such as having higher performance efficiency they are only valid within the boundaries of the given data shrestha and solomatine 2009 in contrast physically based distributed models are better at representing spatial variability when characterizing the water cycle processes and can produce more reliable results moradkhani and sorooshian 2008 smith et al 2004 having parameters with physical interpretation and spatial variability is the main advantage of physically based distributed models however their proper estimation requires more computational cost and huge amount of data shrestha 2009 this poses a problem when the area of interest has low data availability gan et al 2006 grayson et al 2002 tegegne et al 2017b young 2002 conceptual lumped models are another group of hydrologic models which can provide a desirable alternative to empirical and physically based distributed models these models are commonly based on several interconnected conceptual elements representing different hydrologic components there are various conceptual hydrologic models with different structures and processes and the popularity of these models is due to their simplicity and low computational costs inter comparison of various models is one of the most convenient approaches for assessing the influence of model structure and aiding in the selection of the best performing model breuer et al 2009 garavaglia et al 2017 also through the comparison a multi model ensemble can be generated which can then be used for quantifying model structural uncertainty seiller et al 2012 various studies have been conducted using model inter comparison experiments in the field of streamflow simulation e g chiew et al 1993 das et al 2008 gan et al 1997 koch et al 2016 michaud and sorooshian 1994 shi et al 2011 suliman et al 2015 te linde et al 2008 tegegne et al 2017a vansteenkiste et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 however few of them focused on regions with low data availability refsgaard and knudsen 1996 compared a physically based distributed a lumped conceptual and a semi distributed hydrologic models for three data scarce regions in zimbabwe their results showed that although using the distributed model provided reliable results it did not outperformed simpler ones in term of streamflow simulation at the outlet the study by tegegne et al 2017b found that through the inter comparison of lumped conceptual models with a physically based semi distributed model in data poor catchments use of a more complex model could not be justified anshuman et al 2019 proposed considering conceptual over physically based models in the case of facing watersheds with low data availability in addition comparing a semi distributed and a lumped model by srivastava et al 2020 again showed the superiority of the lumped model for hydrological modeling in data limited basins although it can be argued that simple lumped conceptual hydrologic models could be the best choice for modeling rainfall runoff process in data scarce watersheds the need of comprehensive comparison of the performance of various lumped conceptual model structures is strongly felt on regions with limited data availability furthermore the applicability of a conceptual hydrologic model is highly related to how well its parameters are estimated sorooshian et al 1993 although using a multi objective calibration procedure provides valuable information about the parameter equifinality and uncertainty there are different studies ranging from flood forecasting e g han et al 2019 reggiani et al 2009 wijayarathne and coulibaly 2020 to climate change assessment e g ashofteh et al 2017 li et al 2014 where one optimal parameter set is utilized for streamflow simulation or forecasting various performance statistics have been developed to evaluate the performance of hydrological models and each of them can be considered as an objective function for estimating parameters lü et al 2013 wöhling et al 2013 therefore the selected objective function may affect the performance of the calibrated rainfall runoff model although reducing these effects on the model inter comparison process seems important for achieving more reliable results gan et al 1997 ouermi et al 2019 it has not received much attention in previous studies reliable and accurate historical forcing data has a considerable effect on the calibration process and the corresponding model performance te linde et al 2008 temperature can be accurately estimated using the low density measurements however accounting for the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation is challenging in data poor watersheds price et al 2014 consequently assessing the potential of utilizing other sources of precipitation data e g satellite or radar based data as input into a rainfall runoff model seems necessary in the case of limited ground based observation stations this has recently motivated research in data scarce regions to evaluate the influence of using other sources of precipitation e g climate forecast system reanalysis data dile and srinivasan 2014 fuka et al 2014 tropical rainfall measuring mission precipitation analysis adjei et al 2015 collischonn et al 2008 worqlul et al 2017 and north american regional reanalysis choi et al 2009 for models calibration their general finding is that the precipitation products provide valuable information for data scarce regions while their evaluation at local scale is required due to regional variability of their quality lakew et al 2020 sirisena et al 2018 in addition by removing possible random and systematic errors the application of a bias correction method can enhance the applicability of precipitation products at regional scale habib et al 2014 canada specific a canadian precipitation analysis capa data is a gridded precipitation product which is generated using various sources of precipitation such as observations radar data and forecasts mahfouf et al 2007 there are few studies evaluating capa in terms of hydrologic performance eum et al 2014 applied capa into the vic model for streamflow simulation of canadian mountainous catchments in the case study by gaborit et al 2017 a comparison was made between capa and ground based observations in terms of the accuracy of runoff predictions using two lumped models also boluwade et al 2018 assessed the reliability of capa as forcing of watflood hydrologic model in previous studies the accuracy of various precipitation products were evaluated while none have utilized them in a model inter comparison experiment for reducing the effects of forcing input on model performance also assessing precipitation products utilizing multiple hydrologic models lead to more robust results than their proxy evaluation using streamflow data and an auxiliary model fortin et al 2018 the main objective of this study is to evaluate various lumped conceptual models with different structures for continuous daily streamflow prediction in order to propose the most suitable one for operational hydrology in watersheds with low data availability by focusing on two data poor watersheds in northern ontario canada the performance of seven different lumped conceptual models are thoroughly compared using different statistics focusing on low and high flow conditions in the proposed inter comparison framework we utilized an ensemble of calibrated parameter sets for each hydrologic model derived from implementing different objective functions which reduces the effects of the calibration process on models performance also besides the low density gauge measurements we used capa precipitation data as an alternative forcing input in the model comparison process this helps us reach more robust conclusions about the direct ability of different hydrologic model structures for streamflow simulation in addition we have the opportunity to evaluate the reliability of using capa data as an alternative input forcing precipitation in the case of low available historical meteorological data in northern ontario moreover given that the regions of interest are snow dominated watersheds where the snowmelt freshet is the main cause of floods using a proper snowmelt estimation routine in model structure seems necessary for accurate streamflow simulation therefore as a side objective of this study a comparison is made between two popular temperature index methods the simple degree day samuel et al 2011 and the more complex snow17 anderson 2006 1973 to evaluate their potential for improving stream flow estimation in snow dominated basins with low data availability it is of note that there are lots of studies comparing temperature index with complex energy balance snowmelt models bowling et al 2003 debele et al 2010 essery et al 2013 troin et al 2015 while the comparison between different conceptual methods where the only required inputs are temperature and precipitation has not received much attention agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 2 methods 2 1 study area and data description the study regions are the big east river and the black river watersheds which have areas of 620 and 1522 km2 respectively both watersheds are located in the muskoka bracebridge areas of northern ontario canada fig 1 the terrain elevation of the big east river watershed ranges from 293 to 564 meter above sea level masl while the black river changes from 221 to 421 masl there are no major urban areas in either watersheds and with the exception of the southern part of the black river used for agriculture the dominant land cover of two basins are mixed forest vegetation there are only six environment and climate change canada ec meteorological stations with more than 10 years of reliable data and all are located near but not within the aforementioned watersheds boundaries fig 1 each watershed has one hydrometric station located at their outlets confirming the status of low data availability based on all available historical data the long term daily mean air temperature of the regions is around 5 c and the warmest and coldest months are february and july respectively the temperature is near or below freezing point from november to march indicating a need for modeling snow storage and snowmelt processes the highest discharge for both watersheds occurs during spring indicating the runoff is snowmelt dominated table 1 apart from ec meteorological stations the archive of canadian precipitation analysis capa produced by the meteorological service of canada mahfouf et al 2007 is another source of precipitation time series available for both study regions capa is a near real time gridded precipitation analysis based on the combination of observation and climate model data with a spatial and temporal resolution of 15 km and 6 hours respectively lespinas et al 2015 capa points i e center of each capa grid located inside or near both watersheds are illustrated in fig 1 capa provides better spatial coverage of both watersheds so considering it as an alternative forcing precipitation input may enhance the performance of hydrologic models in the case of limited data measurements consequently two different precipitation input scenarios will be evaluated in the first scenario the daily precipitation comes from interpolation of the available ec meteorological stations to the center of the watersheds using the inverse distance weighting american society of civil engineers 1996 method the second scenario involves using the thiessen polygon method thiessen 1911 to generate mean areal precipitation with the daily aggregated capa data the primary comparison of two scenarios shows that in general capa data underestimates the precipitation amount in comparison with ec fig 2 however capa specifically in black river watershed proposes more intense rainfall events in this study both aforementioned scenarios are separately used to calibrate the models parameters and the reliability of using capa data is evaluated based on the performance of the calibrated models 2 2 rainfall runoff models the seven structurally different conceptual hydrologic models compared in this study are 1 the sacramento soil moisture accounting sacsma burnash et al 1973 2 the mcmaster university hydrologiska byrans vattenbalansavdelning machbv samuel et al 2011 3 génie rural à 4 paramètres journaliers gr4j perrin et al 2003 4 the modified version of the soil moisture and accounting routing smarg liang 1992 and three different implementations of the hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms software scharffenberg 2016 these models are chosen mainly based on their structural diversity and performances in previous studies sacsma is widely used for operational flood forecasting in united states e g day 1985 seo et al 2003 vrugt et al 2006 and it was proven to perform well in canadian catchments agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 wijayarathne and coulibaly 2020 machbv is the modified version of hbv bergström 1976 which is specifically developed for enhancing streamflow estimation of ungauged basins samuel et al 2012 2011 smarg is another well known conceptual model with variable number of soil storage which is proven to provide better performance than its original version in humid and semi humid regions tan and o connor 1996 gr4j is a parsimonious hydrologic model with two conceptual storages and was successfully applied in canadian cold regions gaborit et al 2017 martel et al 2020 seiller et al 2012 moreover hec hms is a widely used platform all over the world which provides several different methods for developing structurally different models to simulate rainfall runoff process gyawali and watkins 2013 teng et al 2018 the main different characteristics of the structures of these seven models are summarized in table 2 these models possess distinct complexities and their number of parameters varies based on their corresponding number of hydrologic processes and descriptions a brief explanation of each model is provided in the following sections it is worthy of note that in all sacsma machbv smarg and gr4j the daily potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the simplified thornthwaite equation samuel et al 2011 thornthwaite 1948 by multiplying mean daily temperature by a t h o r n as the only parameter being determined through calibration process table 3 in addition the simple degree day dd snowmelt routine was added to these models for representing changes in the snowpack as well as discriminating snow and rainfall a brief explanation of the dd method is presented in section 3 3 2 2 1 sacramento soil moisture accounting sacsma the sacsma is a well known conceptual lumped hydrologic model which is used by the national weather service river forecast system nwsrfs for flood forecasting in this model the surface of the basin is divided into pervious and impervious areas the soil profile of the pervious portion is partitioned into the thin upper and thicker lower zones a total of five state variable reservoirs are used to determine the accumulation of tension and free water storages representing the water bound and not bound to the soil particles respectively caldwell et al 2015 razavi and coulibaly 2017 moreover the nash cascade method is implemented as the routing approach in this model as can be seen in table 3 the model possesses 17 parameters that must be specified by the user or through an automatic calibration 2 2 2 mcmaster university hydrologiska byrans vattenbalansavdelning machbv the machbv is a nonlinear variant of the conceptual hbv model bergström 1976 in this model a soil moisture routine accounts for fluctuations of the soil moisture storage of the basin a response function comprising upper and lower soil reservoirs is used for estimating the amount of runoff based on the recharge from soil moisture routine finally considering the modified routing routine proposed by samuel et al 2012 where the nonlinear storage discharge relationship is considered in the lower layer of deep soil the final streamflow is obtained these processes are controlled through 10 parameters shown in table 3 more detailed description of the machbv model can be found in samuel et al 2011 2012 2 2 3 the modified version of soil moisture and accounting routing smarg the smarg is a 10 parameter lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model following the structure of its earliest version i e smar o connell et al 1970 in this modification a single reservoir groundwater component is added for considering the effects of groundwater on total estimated discharge liang 1992 therefore it is more reliable in humid regions where the groundwater component contributes significantly in generating runoff tan and o connor 1996 this model uses a nonlinear water balance routine for simulating runoff generation process by visualizing the watershed as a stack of horizontal soil storage layers then the generated surface runoff is transferred through nash cascade of equal linear reservoirs model nash 1957 while the previously mentioned single linear reservoir is used for routing the groundwater discharge the brief descriptions of the model parameters and their initial ranges are provided in table 3 2 2 4 génie rural à 4 paramètres journaliers gr4j the gr4j is a daily conceptual rainfall runoff model developed based on the gr3j model edijanto et al 1999 with only four parameters needing to be calibrated table 3 this model consists of three subsequent steps first net precipitation and evapotranspiration is calculated afterward a portion of net rainfall goes to the one parameter x 1 production store where the actual evapotranspiration and percolation are determined then the remaining portion of net precipitation and percolation are used for determining discharge a unit hydrograph with time base of x 2 and a one parameter x 3 non linear routing store transfer 90 percent of the available water as slow flow while the other ten percent is considered as a fast flow and routed by a unit hydrograph with time base of 2 x 2 finally after applying the one parameter x 4 groundwater exchange component the total discharge is computed by adding the two aforementioned routed flows perrin et al 2003 2 2 5 lumped hec hms based models the hec hms software developed by the us army corps of engineers is designed for both continuous and event based simulation of the rainfall runoff process of dendritic watersheds scharffenberg 2016 it is a reliable platform for developing variants of lumped and semi distributed hydrologic models by allowing the user to choose from an assortment of methods which can model different components of hydrologic cycles i e surface canopy loss transform baseflow and routing processes the general structure of any continuous hydrologic model developed based on the hec hms framework is illustrated in fig 3 as can be seen the meteorological component including the snow rainfall discrimination and snowmelt module estimates the excess water that may contribute to runoff generation then the basin component consisting of the conceptual simulations of different physical phenomena determines the streamflow value at the outlet of the watershed in this study three lumped structurally different hydrologic models were developed using different combinations of the available baseflow and loss methods in the hec hms platform the first hec hms model called hec1 hereafter uses the deficit and constant loss method and the recession baseflow method while the other two models i e hec2 and hec3 use the soil moisture accounting loss method with the recession or linear reservoir baseflow methods respectively the parameters of the utilized approaches presented in table 4 show the total number of 7 15 and 17 parameters for hec1 hec2 and hec3 models respectively excluding the parameters of snowmelt routine it is worth mentioning that the only snowmelt method available in the hec hms software is the temperature index that is an extension of the degree day dd approach however unlike the dd approach where a constant snowmelt rate is used for each degree above a base temperature the melting rate in hec hms is determined as a function of an antecedent temperature index ati gyawali and watkins 2013 razmkhah et al 2016 as can be seen in table 4 due to the importance of ati melt rate atimr function on the accuracy of the snowmelt process 22 different scenarios are defined for the atimr curve proposed by usace khalida et al 2014 u s army corps of engineers 1991 and the best one is determined through the calibration process additionally all three hec hms based models use the monthly average pet option in their meteorology models the monthly average was calculated using the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 which is proved to be one of the most promising temperature based pet estimation method in cold regions almorox et al 2015 2 3 snowmelt routines as previously mentioned due to the significant effects of the snowmelt process on stream flows in both big east river and black river watersheds two different temperature index models requiring only temperature and precipitation data are selected both methods possess the same snow rainfall discrimination procedure where the upper t r and lower t s threshold temperatures are used as two calibrating parameters to distinguish between snow and rainfall samuel et al 2011 in addition in both models the amount of rain and snow are simply modified by multiplying by rain correction r c f and snow correction s c f factors respectively for snowmelt estimation the degree day dd method relies on a linear relationship between snowmelt and air temperature t if t is less than the melting temperature threshold t m the melt rate is calculated by multiplying difference between t and t m by degree day factor d d f the snow17 approach however considers some of the physical processes involved in snowmelt e g energy exchange between air and snow the effects of rain on snow the snowpack heat storage and deficit without needing additional input data agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 anderson 2006 during the non rain period the same concept as dd is used for melt rate calculation whereas the melt factor seasonally changes based on two parameters maximum m f m a x and minimum m f m i n melt factors additionally the melt during rain is determined by a simplified empirical energy balance equation shamir and georgakakos 2006 other parameters which should be calibrated for snow17 include the average wind function u a d j antecedent snow temperature index t i p m maximum negative melt factor n m f and the water holding capacity of the snow pack p l w h c detailed descriptions of both snow routing approaches can be found in the above cited references 2 4 optimization and evaluation processes the main purpose of the calibration of a rainfall runoff model is to select the best parameter values by minimizing the difference between observations and model streamflow predictions chiew et al 1993 however the choice of a proper objective function from a bunch of well known performance statistics is not a straightforward task in this study for decreasing the influence of choosing objective function on models inter comparison five criteria including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash volume error nve kling gupta efficiency kge modified nash volume error mnve and peak weighted root mean square error pwrmse were selected and considered as different single objective functions in order to find the best parameter set for each of the rainfall runoff models table 5 while the first three metrics are formulated to accurately simulate medium flows the latter two ones focus on providing more accurate high flow simulation all models are calibrated for the period from 2006 to 2011 with the year 2006 considered as warm up period the three year period 2012 to 2015 was used for the validation the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 was used to calibrate the parameters for each model in this study dds is a heuristic global single solution based search algorithm that was developed to calibrate complex hydrological models with a large number of parameters arsenault et al 2014 the main distinguishing feature of this method is the transition from global to local search by dynamically rescaling the dimension of the search space the ostrich calibration toolkit matott 2005 was used to run the dds optimization for each model it is of note that although there are two available automatic calibration algorithms in hec hms software they perform poorly in finding the optimized parameter sets especially when there are a relatively high number of parameters to be calibrated cunderlik and simonovic 2004 from the literature with the exception of dariane et al 2016 who developed an automatic calibration for the hec hms program based on genetic algorithm there are no studies that calibrate all parameters of a continuous hec hms model with snowmelt routine using auto optimization methods in this paper ostrich matlab hec hms and hec dssvue are linked together in order to apply the dds optimization algorithm to calibrate hec hms models fig 4 moreover in this study seven different evaluation metrics are used for assessing the performance of the calibrated models table 5 apart from standard n s e we utilized n s e calculated based on logarithmic n s e l and squared n s e s transformed stream flows for reflecting the accuracy of low and high flows respectively volume error v e assesses the long term performance of the model simulation and peak error p e evaluates the models ability in capturing peak flows also the transferability of a model in time is illustrated using the coefficient of transferability t m where the lower values show better model parameters transferability from calibration to validation period moreover for more specific evaluation of different models ability in reproducing high flows n s e is calculated and compared using the 90 percentile streamflow values n s e 90 we also utilize representative hydrographs and scatterplots as graphical tools for visually assessing the performance of different models 3 results 3 1 objective functions evaluation the combination of seven hydrologic models two different precipitation input scenarios and five various objective functions leads to 70 different calibrated models for each watershed evaluating the effect of considering different objective functions is the prime step before comparing various hydrologic models therefore a comparison is made between the performance of the calibrated models using the five performance criteria in table 5 as an objective function for both the big east river and black river watersheds in the validation period fig 5 the first thing that stands out from the comparison results in both basins is that neither of the objective functions has complete superiority in providing the most promising parameters set of all models based on the results it is shown that although the p w r m s e and m n v e statistics give more weights to high flow values using them as an objective function does not significantly improve the performance of the calibrated models regarding high flows additionally the models calibrated with those metrics pwrmse and mnve are the worst at modeling low flows leading to large variation in n s e l moreover as expected calibrated models utilizing n s e as an objective function perform well according to n s e based performance criteria i e n s e n s e s and n s e l however there are some concerns about their performance regarding volume and peak error related measurements especially in big east river watershed where both v e and p e uncertainty of n s e based calibrated models are relatively large in addition the comparison of n s e l measurements shows that using n v e for calibrating models outperform the other ones in low flow simulation in both watersheds the relative good performance of the k g e based calibrated models is noticeable in big east river while in black river watershed they are not the best ones by looking at all different performance criteria simultaneously it can be seen that using k g e and n v e provide good and reliable performance when considering different aspects of the hydrographs i e low high and peak flows however it is impossible to determine one objective function as the best one that can be used for calibrating all hydrologic models in both watersheds for better clarifying the effects of choosing objective function on model results table 6 exemplifies the validation performances of machbv and smarg hydrologic models being calibrated using n v e and k g e as objective functions in big east river using n v e provides better parameter estimation of machbv while k g e performs better for smarg the opposite is true in black river watershed where k g e and n v e are better objective functions for machbv and smarg respectively the use of n v e leads to the superiority of machbv in big east river while smarg perform better if both models are calibrated with k g e the same issue arise in black river where comparing k g e calibrated models shows the advantages of machbv over smarg however the same performances are achieved in the case of using n v e 3 2 model comparison the main goal of this study is to find the most promising conceptual hydrologic model in data poor watersheds by reducing the effects of the calibration process on models performance therefore two types of inter comparison are made between the seven aforementioned hydrologic models first we compared all calibrated models with each other consequently the twenty calibrated sets of parameters for each hydrologic model are considered to create the box plots of the evaluation performance metrics for the validation period fig 6 the most obvious conclusion derived from fig 6 is that in general the hec hms based models perform worst in comparison to the other hydrologic models this relatively poor performance is more significant when the low flows are the main concerns of the simulation moreover regarding high flows the machbv shows the best performance while the high capability of the gr4j model in high flows simulation cannot be ignored specifically in the big east river watershed where the p e criteria of the gr4j models is the best one by looking at all six performance statistics the machbv is the most consistent hydrologic model for both watersheds and can be considered the best rated one the performance of both the sacsma and gr4j models also provide reliable and valuable results whereas the hec based models do not the second type of model inter comparison is between the best calibrated set of parameters for each model using the ec precipitation input scenario we chose the best parameter set by comparing all the aforementioned performance statistics focusing on the validation period the set of parameters with the best rank and rational condition i e the values of different performance measurements are controlled manually and parameters set providing unreasonable predictions are ignored was determined as the best selected one the evaluated performance statistics of the final selected models in both calibration and validation periods and the relative comparison between them are presented in table 7 and fig 7 respectively what stands out in the results for the black river watershed is that in general machbv is the best rated model based on most of the criteria in both calibration and validation periods however the results are more complex for the big east river watershed where the gr4j model is the best performing one during the validation period while machbv sacsma and gr4j models perform competitively based on the calibration period results moreover regarding high flow based criteria machbv and gr4j respectively provide the best results in black river and big east river watersheds in addition as concluded in the previous comparison although hec2 and hec3 compared with hec1 relatively lead to more reliable results the three hec based models do not perform as well as the other four conceptual models in either watersheds for a better comparison of different model performance in simulating high flows scatter plots of the simulated and observed daily peak flows peak flows greater than 75 percentile are illustrated in fig 8 additionally for qualitative inspection fig 9 presents a representative portion of the simulated and observed hydrographs based on various hydrologic models with their best parameter sets presented in table 7 as was concluded previously machbv and gr4j show better performance in comparison to the other models regarding high flows in both watersheds however it is worthy of note that even the best hydrologic models possess a clear tendency to underestimate peak flows especially in the black river watershed this underestimation can likely be attributed to both the models structures as well as the quality of forcing input data the poor estimation of mean areal precipitation derived from low density meteorological stations can lead to systematic under overestimation of stream flows collischonn et al 2008 tegegne et al 2017b 3 3 the effect of forcing precipitation input capa versus ground based stations in the case of low density meteorological measurements utilizing other sources of data as forcing inputs into hydrologic models is necessary here in order to evaluate the reliability of canadian precipitation analysis capa data a comparison is made between the simulation results derived from the best optimal parameter set of all hydrologic models using the two predefined input scenarios the results as shown in fig 10 indicate that in general the capa based calibrated models performed approximately similar to the calibrated models based on ec data however the average transferability statistic implies that using capa data in comparison to ec provides more consistent performance for the models during the calibration and validation periods also by focusing on high flows it can be concluded that capa based calibrated models performed better specifically in the black river watershed where both n s e 90 and p e criteria of capa based calibrated models possess a noticeable superiority over ec based ones moreover the effects of using different precipitation scenarios on model performances are separately evaluated for various hydrologic models using the percentage of improvement in low medium and high flows these percentages are respectively defined as the percent increase in n s e l n s e and n s e s criteria when capa is used as forcing input in comparison to the ec scenario table 8 as can be seen the effects of using capa as an alternative forcing precipitation input is not consistent with different hydrologic model regarding high flows the results shows the advantage of using capa for almost all models in both big east river and black river watersheds where respectively the average of 18 and 12 percentage of performance improvement occurs based on n s e s criterion however the effects of implementing capa on low flow performance of different models do not follow the same trend in big east river watershed using capa leads to lower n s e l of machbv sacsma and smarg while the low flow performance improvement of hec hms based models is significantly high on the other hand in black river watershed except hec2 and hec3 where implementing ec and capa precipitation scenarios respectively results in better low flow simulation other models performances regarding low flows does not significantly changes when different input scenarios are used besides hec2 with 24 n s e based improvement the general performances of different models i e using nse measurement do not face significant changes in the case of using capa as forcing input 3 4 evaluation of snowmelt estimation methods degree day and snow17 models for assessing the effects of implementing a more complex snowmelt routine a comparison is made between the machbv and sacsma hydrologic models in conjunction with degree day dd and snow17 snowmelt estimation approaches four model structures stemming from the combination of two aforementioned hydrologic models and snow modules are calibrated using two predefined input scenarios and five aforementioned objective functions in both watersheds in order to facilitate the evaluation the percentages of model improvement in medium and high flows were used the former one is defined as a percent increase in n s e when the snow17 model is implemented in comparison to dd method while the latter one is based on n s e s criteria for focusing on high flows specifically positive values of model improvement shows the advantage of using the snow17 method fig 11 presents the model improvements in both calibration and validation periods using all calibrated models for each watershed for the sacsma in both watersheds during both periods the median is more than zero indicating enhancement of the model performance in the case of adapting the snow17 model however the positive effect of using the snow17 model combined with the machbv model structure cannot be concluded for instance although the model improvements during the calibration period in the big east river watershed are almost positive especially regarding high flows opposite results are obtained in the validation period where the high flow model improvement median is around 30 percent moreover in order to complete the assessment a comparison has been made between the best optimal parameter set of each model structure table 5 in line with the previous comparison the results indicate that coupling the sacsma and snow17 provides better results especially in high flows where the maximum of approximately 25 improvement occurs however the dd approach seems to be more appropriate to be used in conjunction with the machbv model structure especially in the big east river watershed in addition the performance of the models regarding the whole hydrographs i e model improvement based on nse varies between 2 and 8 depicting no specific enhancement of general models performance in the case of implementing more complex snowmelt models table 9 4 discussion assessing the effects of different objective functions on model performances indicate that in general using k g e and n v e as an objective function can provide more reliable estimation of different models parameters n v e is a combination of n s e and v e table 5 and its best value gives both the lowest difference between computed and observed flows and small volume error lindström 1997 samuel et al 2011 k g e also consider three measures correlation bias and variability simultaneously and provide more consistent results than n s e especially in basins where the variability of the observed flow is high buzacott et al 2019 gupta et al 2009 such as big east river watershed where the streamflow coefficient of variation is 1 21 compared with 1 05 in black river however the two aforementioned criteria do not always lead to the best optimal parameter sets for different hydrologic models in both watersheds and will affect the performance of various models in different manners fig 5 and table 6 this proves the necessity of considering multiple objective functions in model inter comparison process in order to find more robust and comprehensive conclusions inter comparison of different conceptual hydrologic models suggests that machbv is the most consistent model providing reliable low medium and high flow estimation in both basins this conclusion is in line with the original purpose of developing machbv which was to simulate stream flows of ungauged watersheds in ontario samuel et al 2011 2012 also the parsimonious gr4j model with the lowest complexity possess competitive performances in both watersheds especially regarding high flow simulation figs 8 and 9 besides the proven capability of gr4j model structure in daily streamflow simulation wijayarathne and coulibaly 2020 this advantage may be due to the remarkable ability of gr4j to compensate the problem of having poor precipitation input the parameters of gr4j model i e x 1 x 2 and x 3 can be relatively distorted through the calibration process in order to provide good results even with limited input data andréassian et al 2001 drogue and khediri 2016 simonneaux et al 2008 this ability is also demonstrated where along with machbv gr4j possesses the lowest changes of performance in comparison to other models when capa is used as another source of precipitation table 8 on the other hand compared with other conceptual models the hec hms based ones have relatively poor performances in both watersheds which is more significant in low flow simulation with hec1 and hec2 the possible reason of their poor performance which is more pronounced than hec3 is the low capability of the recession method in accurately estimating base flow in addition this may be due to the use of the fixed monthly estimated pet for hec hms based models compared with other models where the daily pet is determined during the calibration process therefore evaluating the effects of using an external pet estimation model linked and calibrated with hec hms on the accuracy of streamflow simulation is recommended evaluating the effects of capa as another source of precipitation for both watersheds indicate that the effect of using different input scenarios is not similar for different hydrologic models and considering it in model comparison process is required for possessing robust conclusions as previously stated changing rainfall has the least effect on machbv and gr4j models table 8 proving their suitability for study regions with low data availability also the reliability of capa as another source of precipitation for both watersheds is confirmed by comparing the performance of different hydrologic models capa based calibrated models yield better high flow estimation than using sparse ground based measurements for model calibration fig 10 and table 8 this is more obvious in black river watershed and can be justifiable by the fact that ec based input scenario underestimates severe daily rainfall events in the black river watershed fig 2 in line with previous studies the results of this study show that using reliable spatially distributed data can provides more accurate mean areal precipitation estimates and affect the performances of the lumped hydrologic models in data poor regions collischonn et al 2008 martel et al 2020 however more comprehensive evaluation of data with high spatial resolution and the effects of its spatial heterogeneity on hydrologic model performances required the application of a distributed or semi distributed hydrologic models mazzoleni et al 2019 snowmelt module is an important part of any hydrologic model in snow dominated watersheds therefore this study compared degree day dd and more complex snow17 methods relying on temperature and precipitation as the only inputs in conjunction with two hydrologic models i e machbv and sacsma in general in line with agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 the results indicate the competitive performance of dd in both watersheds which may be related to the land use characteristics of the regions which are forested regarding high flows the snow17 performs better than dd in black river watershed while in big east river this superiority is less noticeable and diminishes from calibration to validation periods this may be attributed to the steeper topography of the big east river watershed and not dividing it into different elevation zones agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 anderson 2006 another possible reason for this outcome is the lack of long term historical data in data scarce regions the higher degrees of freedom of snow17 method compared with ddm can lead to parameter overfitting when the length of the calibration period is not long enough due to low data availability 5 summary and conclusions inter comparison of various conceptual hydrologic models for continuous daily streamflow simulation in watersheds with low data availability is the main goal of this study consequently the performance of seven lumped conceptual rainfall runoff models with different structures i e sacsma machbv smarg gr4j and three hec hms based models were compared in two data poor and snow dominated watersheds big east river and black river located in northern ontario canada all models were calibrated using five different criteria i e n s e k g e n v e m n v e and p w r m s e and two different input scenarios in order to relax the influence of calibration process on the models results the comparison results suggest that although the sacsma and gr4j hydrologic models possess competitive performances machbv shows the best results in simulating the daily stream flows for both watersheds also the gr4j model shows the highest accuracy for high flow prediction in both watersheds the results also indicate that the hec hms based models provide lower performance especially for low flows from inter comparing the different structures of the hec hms models using the soil moisture accounting and linear reservoir approaches are preferred to deficit and constant loss and recession methods for continuous daily streamflow simulation moreover alongside model comparison the evaluation of the effects of using different objective functions shows that k g e and n v e are the most consistent criteria leading to reliable parameter estimation with reasonable performance regarding different parts of the hydrograph while comparing different model structures require considering the effects of objective function selection furthermore the comparison between gauged and capa based calibrated models in both watersheds indicates the high potential of capa data as a good alternative in the case of low data availability capa not only provides the same level of performance in general but also leads to better results than ground based data regarding high flows in addition due to the importance of accurate snowmelt estimation in snow dominated watersheds we compared the performance of the machbv and sacsma hydrologic models in conjunction with degree day method dd and more complex snow17 snowmelt estimation methods in both watersheds in general incorporation of snow17 does not significantly improve the performance of either hydrologic models by focusing on high flows however the results show that implementing snow17 with sacsma is consistently superior while the dd method can perform comparably well with machbv in general this study reveals that besides considering the effects of calibration process utilizing different precipitation input scenarios can lead to more robust conclusion of model comparison process in data poor watersheds the findings of this study suggest that machbv and gr4j are the most robust lumped conceptual rainfall runoff models reacting well to poor mean areal rainfall estimation in data scarce watersheds and performing well regarding different aspects of the hydrographs while the sacsma also reliably simulates streamflow in both watersheds in addition this study confirms the high potential of the archived aggregated daily capa data to be considered as a hydrologic forcing in data poor watersheds in northern ontario moreover another implication of the results is that implementing the more complex snow17 model for snowmelt estimation in watersheds with low data availability does not always provide more reliable results and its effectiveness depends on the hydrologic model structure limitations of this study are as follows the study was designed for assessing the general performance of models regarding all aspects of hydrographs i e low medium and high flows simultaneously however inter comparing various models being calibrated regarding different particular class of flows separately would be advisable although the hydrologic responses of the two considered watersheds are not quite similar the findings of this study remain applicable within the same topographic and climatologic conditions so we recommend further application of the proposed model inter comparison for different types of watersheds i e mountainous semi arid semi urban with low data availability for providing more comprehensive conclusions there are other conceptual models with different structures that are worth to be investigated in future studies the reliability of canadian precipitation analysis in estimating mean areal precipitation as an input of lumped models in data scarce regions were revealed in this study however further studies need to be carried out to comprehensively assessed the accuracy of spatial heterogeneity of capa data in northern ontario using a distributed or semi distributed hydrologic models credit authorship contribution
