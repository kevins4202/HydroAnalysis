2295,stochastic streamflow generation is crucial for water resources planning and management as well as water conservancy project design and operation this study proposes an accurate reliable and parsimonious approach for stochastic streamflow generation considering temporal and spatial dependence on the basis of regular vine copula model the emphasis is on advancing an r statistic based strategy of vine structure determination that divide the vine copula model construction into two independent parts and avoid continuous accumulation of uncertainty in the traditional kendall s tau based method two study regions the upper colorado river basin and middle yangtze river basin with diverse hydrology regime and available data length are selected as case studies to showcase the performance of the proposed approach in practice the results indicate better performance than two existing models in terms of streamflow estimation and demonstrate that stochastic simulation series can preserve distribution and statistical characteristics of observed records r vine copula model constructed by the proposed approach is confirmed to possess low sensitivity to the number of predictor variables as well as good adaptability and robustness to streamflow series with diverse characteristics and abundances the enhanced capability and performance stem from the accurate identification of predictor variables and characterization of complex and diverse dependence structures among different streamflow series on the basis of a comprehensive and precise dependence measure r statistic keywords stochastic streamflow generation r statistic vine copula vine structure determination spatiotemporal interdependence data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction stochastic streamflow generation is of considerable importance in water resources planning and management due to limit observed streamflow records and unbalanced distribution of hydrometric stations ahn 2021 ben aissia et al 2017 it is also instructive in the context of water conservancy project design and operation as a result of its prominent role in predicting and preventing extreme hydrological events that have not yet been observed in the past but nonetheless can be expected in the future szilagyi et al 2006 more specifically spatiotemporal interdependence of river runoff processes within a region is crucial for the uniform dispatch and regulation of water quantity and quality which increasingly demands high performance stochastic streamflow generation considering temporal and spatial dependence on the basis of multisite observed streamflow records dyer et al 2014 zhai et al 2017 the fundamental principle of high performance stochastic streamflow generation is that the simulated series can preserve the distribution and statistical characteristics of the observed records and reduce uncertainty hao and singh 2013 chen et al 2019 data driven models have emerged as a feasible and promising technique for hydrological simulation demonstrating preferable predictability with less input data and parameters as well as more convenient operations compared to physically based models moradkhani et al 2004 tiwari and chatterjee 2010 liu et al 2015b in recent decades considerable efforts regarding the application of data driven models for stochastic streamflow generation have become quite prevalent traditional data driven models are composed of parametric methods and nonparametric ones multiple linear regression mlr and autoregressive moving average arma model and its variants are probably the most widely adopted parametric methods for streamflow simulation and estimation mckerchar and delleur 1974 adamowski et al 2012 sirangelo et al 2017 the main disadvantages of these models are the limitations in describing nonlinear dependence and representing nonstandard probability distribution functions which also leads to inaccurate greater lags ahead estimation hao and singh 2013 chen et al 2015 trigonometric box cox transformation with arma residuals trend and seasonal components tbats model as a hybrid model of exponential smoothing method box cox transformation and arma has been used to handle complex seasonality and non linear features contained in hydrometeorological time series de livera et al 2011 herbert et al 2021 nonparametric methods in the light of bootstrapping kernel density estimation and k nearest neighbor resampling method also served to simulate streamflow records lall and sharma 1996 nowak et al 2010 prairie et al 2007 sharma and o neill 2002 however these methods are limited to exploit within the range of the sample data and are inefficient and cumbersome to extend to high dimensions chen et al 2015 lall et al 2016 the probability based theory of copulas has been gaining popularity in the probabilistic modeling and forecasting of hydrometeorological variables due to the advantages of selecting and combining arbitrary marginal distributions dong et al 2022 copula based stochastic streamflow simulation thus has improved to ability to consider temporal and spatial dependence as well as the potential impacts of climate change hao and singh 2013 nazemi et al 2013 2020 wang et al 2019 nazemi et al 2013 2020 hassanzadeh et al 2016 2017 worland et al 2019 panahi et al 2021 however traditional bivariate copulas lack accuracy and flexibility in modelling complex and diverse dependence structures with high dimensionality which limit further application in stochastic streamflow generation considering temporal and spatial dependence among different streamflow records bevacqua et al 2017 brunner et al 2019 regular vine r vine copula serves as a promising tool for establishing multivariate framework with a hierarchical set of bivariate copulas and conditional bivariate copulas as basic modules aas et al 2009 dißmann et al 2013 the prominent flexibility of r vine copula enables multivariate dependence structures among various hydrometeorological series to be reproduced liu et al 2015a resulting in extensive application in hydrology yu et al 2019 nazemi et al 2020 hatami and nazemi 2022 vine copula based stochastic streamflow generators can also consider more predictors such as meteorological factors and large scale climate indices lee et al 2018 wang et al 2019 zaerpour et al 2021 however several issues implied in vine copula application need urgent attention first and foremost the existing strategy leads to substantial time consumption and accumulation of uncertainty inevitably because each step of vine copula model development is affected by former steps czado et al 2013 ni et al 2020 on the other hand kendall s tau rank correlation coefficient is usually chosen as weight factor to determine vine structure with the objective of quantitative comparing dependence among different variables vernieuwe et al 2015 wang et al 2019 however kendall s tau is only a global measure of the dependence without ability to capture the complex dependence characteristics e g nonlinear and tail dependence genest and favre 2007 there is an urgent need to develop superior vine structure determination strategy and choose a more comprehensive weight factor to further upgrading the construction method for vine copula model furthermore the applications of r vine copula in hydrology especially for stochastic streamflow generation rarely consider high dimensional temporal and spatial dependence simultaneously tosunoglu and singh 2018 ahn 2021 liu et al 2021 and only focus on two simplified subclasses of r vine canonical vine c vine and drawable vine d vine wang et al 2019 tosunoglu et al 2020 tao et al 2021 xu et al 2022 which are insufficient to exhibit its superior ability to describe dependence structures among multiple variables in addition the traditional strategy to construct vine copula model is implemented based on stepwise selection wherein vine structure determination and bivariate copula selection are conducted iteratively dißmann et al 2013 this study aims to propose an improved construction approach for vine copula model integrating predictor variables selection algorithm and vine structure determination strategy in the light of r statistic to produce accurate and extensive stochastic simulation series considering temporal and spatial dependence among various observed streamflow records r statistic the normalization of mutual information mi and conditional mutual information cmi enables direct comparison of dependence while retains the properties of mi making it a better measure of complex dependence than kendall s tau the predictor variables selection algorithm serves to screen out unnecessary predictor variables and the vine structure determination strategy devotes to avoid substantial time consumption and continuous accumulation of uncertainty to achieve the above objective this study 1 identifies predictor variables that exhibit temporal or spatial dependence with predictand variable according to r statistic 2 implements the r statistic based vine structure determination strategy to construct r vine copula models capable of depicting complex and diverse dependence structures among different streamflow series 3 evaluates the streamflow estimation performance of the proposed approach by comparing with the traditional kendall s tau based vine copula vc tau model and tbats model 4 examines whether stochastic simulation series can preserve distribution and statistical characteristics as well as extreme streamflow characteristics of observed records two study regions the upper colorado river basin and middle yangtze river basin with diverse hydrology regime and available data length are selected as case studies to showcase the performance of the proposed approach in practice the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodological basis for this study section 3 introduces the implementation process of the proposed integrated approach for stochastic streamflow generation section 4 outlines study area and data used as case studies section 5 provides analysis and discussion regarding the results of case studies and section 6 summarizes the essential conclusions of this study 2 methodology 2 1 regular vine copulas in accordance with the fundamental work of sklar 1959 consider f x is the joint cumulative distribution function cdf of a random vector x x 1 x 2 x n with marginal cdfs f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n there exists a copula function c which is the joint cdfs of n dimensional random vector u u 1 u 2 u n with uniform marginal cdfs on the unit cube 0 1 n the relation between f x and c can be expressed as 1 f x c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n c u 1 u 2 u n where the copula c is unique if f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n are continuous joe 1997 the corresponding joint probability density function pdf can be obtained as 2 f x c u 1 u 2 u n k 1 n f k x k where c is copula pdf and f k x k denotes marginal pdfs of x for k 1 2 n vine copulas provide a generic approach to construct multivariate joint distributions based on pair copula constructions pccs pccs can decompose the n dimensional multivariate density function into n n 1 2 basic modules named pair copula which are a panoply of bivariate copulas and conditional bivariate copulas regular vine r vine a hierarchical graphical structure with a sequence of trees edges and nodes is introduced to represent the high dimensional dependence structures n n 1 2 pair copulas decomposed from multivariate dependence structures can be ordered as n 1 nested trees t i i 1 n 1 with n 2 n 1 2 nodes joined by n n 1 2 edges according to the conditioned sets c e a c e b and conditioning sets d e bedford and cooke 2002 kurowicka and cooke 2006 the decomposition of multivariate density function for n dimensional r vine copulas can be shown as 3 f x k 1 n f k x k j 1 n 1 e e i c c e a c e b d e f c e a d e x c e a x d e f c e b d e x c e b x d e where e i denotes the set of edges e belonging to t i and x d e refers to the variables in d e according to joe 1996 and aas et al 2009 the conditional distribution function of t conditioned on an m dimensional vector t t 1 t 2 t m can be factorized as 4 f t t t t h t t θ c t t i t i f t t i t t i f t i t i t i t i θ f t i t i t i t i here t is the marginal cdf of the predictand variable x while t t 1 t 2 t m serves as the marginal cdf of an m dimensional predictor variable p p 1 p 2 p m that is t t 1 t 2 t m f x x f p 1 p 1 f p m p m t i i 1 m is an arbitrary element of t and t i denotes the m dimensional vector t excluding t i c t t i t i refers to a bivariate copula distribution function with parameter s θ arbitrary

predictand variable to illustrate the conditional distribution function f t t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 based on a 5 dimensional c vine copula model can be written as 5 f t t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t t 1

t 1 denote the parameter s of c t t 4 t 1 t 2 t 3 f t t 1 t 2 t 3 t t 1 t 2 t 3 f t 4 t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 1 t 2 t 3 and c t t 1 f t t f t 1 t 1 respectively θ c t 2 t 1 θ c t 3 t 1 θ c t 4 t 1 θ c t t 2 t 1 θ c t 3 t 2 t 1 θ c t 4 t 2 t 1 θ c t t 3 t 1 t 2 and θ c t 4 t 3 t 1 t 2 are defined similarly given standard uniform distribution random numbers τ the estimation or stochastic simulation of predictand variable x conditioned on four predictor variables p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 4 can be achieved based on the inverse form of equation 5 6 x f x 1 f t t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 1 t t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 f x 1 h 1 h

traditional kendall s tau based method for vine copula model development relies on the iterative processes of kendall s tau calculation copula function selection copula parameter estimation and conditional data generation for each tree t i i 1 n 1 obviously the i t h iterative process for t i is affected by the results of previous i 1 processes causing continuous accumulation of uncertainty and considerable consumption of time it is necessary and beneficial to separate the vine copula model construction into two independent parts vine structure determination and bivariate copula selection and estimation by means of a more comprehensive weight factor which can accurately evaluate the complex and diverse dependence among different variables in other words vine structure should have been determined according to an optimal weight factor before the selection and estimation process of bivariate copula function for each pair copula ni et al 2020 proposed a mutual information mi based approach for vine structure determination in which mi and conditional mutual information cmi of all possible variable pairs were calculated from the original data series and employed to determine the copulae relations in each tree t i without data transform of conditional variables the results proved that the mi based approach satisfactorily modeled different kinds of dependence structure and yielded more information on variables in comparison with traditional kendall s tau based method as a measure of complex dependence mi enjoys the following excellent properties i mi is invariant even under strictly monotonic variable transformations cover and thomas 2006 ii mi places the same importance on linear and nonlinear dependence kinney and atwal 2014 these properties secure mi as a widespread used measure of complex dependence however the main disadvantage of mi is the lack of normalization limiting the direct comparison of dependence between different variable pairs r statistic the normalization of mi and cmi was introduced to measure the dependence between non linear non normal random variables granger and lin 1994 r statistic corresponding to two n dimensional random variables x x 1 x 2 x n and y y 1 y 2 y n can be defined as 7 r x y 1 exp 2 i where i refers to mi or cmi of x and y there is a nonlinear positive correlation between r statistic and i the relative magnitude of r statistic can be directly compared while inheriting the advantages of mi zeng et al 2018 introduced a jackknife version of the kernel density estimator kde for the mi named jmi and proved that jmi obtains an asymptotically unique maximum solution which can be used as the optimal evaluation of mi in view of the equalized bandwidth the proposed approach contributes to freeing the mi estimation from predetermined tuning parameters and possessing desirable statistical characteristics such as automatic bias correction and high freedom in independence test for a detailed description of jmi please refer to zeng et al 2018 similarly jackknife version of conditional mutual information jcmi can be calculated as an extension to the jmi on the lines cmi is an extension to mi r statistic normalized by jmi and jcmi has the potential to be an excellent dependence measure and can be considered as better weight factors than kendall s tau in the determination of vine structure in view of the existing disadvantages of the traditional kendall s tau based method an improved strategy of determining vine structure with r statistic as weight factor is proposed the specific procedure involves the following two steps i calculate the r statistics based on jmi of all possible variable pairs and then determine the copulae relationships among different variables that maximizes the sum of r statistics as the optimal structure of t 1 ii calculate the r statistics based on jcmi of all possible node pairs determined in t 1 and then identify the copulae relationships among different conditional variables that maximizes the sum of r statistics as the optimal structure of t 2 repeat this step until t 3 t n 1 are specified sequentially 3 implementation process of stochastic streamflow generation with objective of achieving accurate and extensive stochastic streamflow series pertaining to target hydrometric station for specific month which is defined as predictand variable r statistic based predictor variables selection algorithm and vine structure determination strategy are employed to accomplish stochastic streamflow generation at a monthly scale detailed implementation process involves several sequential steps i selection of predictor variables observed streamflow series which possess temporal or spatial dependence with predictand variable for specific month are chosen as predictor variables firstly the accurate lag time l t of monthly streamflow records from target hydrometric station are determined according to akaike information criterion aic final prediction error criterion fpe and hannan quinn criterion hq akaike 1971 1973 hannan and quinn 1979 candidate predictors associated in spatial are defined as streamflow series from hydrometric stations in adjacent region while lag 1 lag l t streamflow records are considered as candidate predictors associated in temporal secondly jmi between each candidate predictor and the corresponding predictand variable is calculated and corresponding r statistic is further obtained to compare the magnitude of the dependence a candidate predictor can be selected as predictor variable when the r statistic between the candidate predictor and corresponding predictand variable exceeds the predetermined threshold in addition the candidate predictor with the maximum value of r statistics in a month is also considered as predictor variable when r statistics corresponding to different lag times in that month are less than the predetermined threshold ii selection of marginal distribution eight parameter distribution functions which are commonly used in hydrology are served as candidate marginal distributions of all considered variables predictand variable and corresponding predictor variables for each month the parameter distributions considered in this study include pearson type iii p iii normal logarithmic normal cauchy gamma generalized extreme value gev gumbel and weibull distributions chen et al 2019 kolmogorov smirnov k s test is performed to determine whether samples come from the population with specific parameter distribution the best fitted parameter distribution is determined based on the normalized root mean square error nrmse in order to meet the needs of vine copula modeling the probability integral transformation algorithm is used to convert observed streamflow series into corresponding copula data with uniform marginal cdfs on the unit cube 0 1 n iii determination of vine structure the vine structure of r vine copula models for each month are determined in accordance with the proposed r statistic based vine structure determination strategy array constraint set an n dimensional lower triangular array is employed to represent the copulae relationships among different pair copulas contained in vine structure morales nápoles 2008 iv selection of copula function and parameter s for each pair copula selection proceeds by computing the aic relating to each alternative copula function on the basis of the calibration data set and then determining the optimal copula function and its parameter s corresponding to each pair copula with minimum aic the alternative copula functions include elliptical copulas gaussian and student s t four types of archimedean copulas clayton gumbel frank and joe four mixed modes of archimedean copulas clayton gumbel joe gumbel joe clayton and joe frank and the corresponding three rotated versions 90 180 and 270 maximum likelihood estimate mle is applied to further evaluate the copula parameters limited memory broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bound l bfgs b method is employed for optimization due to its higher optimize efficiency in comparison to newton method and bfgs method moreover goodness of fit test is conducted to validate the null hypothesis that the dependence structure between two variables obeys the selected copula function v estimation of predictand variable observed monthly streamflow series in both calibration period and validation period are estimated using the monte carlo method and inverse form of equation 4 to verify the accuracy and rationality of r vine copula model for each month more specifically 1000 random numbers subject to standard uniform distribution u 0 1 are generated by monte carlo method and substituted into inverse form of equation 4 producing 1000 corresponding realizations of predictand variable the mean value of these realizations can be considered as the optimal estimation which are compared with the estimation results of traditional kendall s tau based vine copula vc tau model and tbats model the accuracy of above three models are further evaluated by following four quantitative metrics the root mean square error rmse modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mnse krause et al 2005 modified kling gupta efficiency mkge kling et al 2012 and mean absolute percentage error mape vi generation of stochastic streamflow series similar to the estimation process of predictand variable the generation of stochastic streamflow series is also performed by applying the monte carlo method and inverse form of equation 4 500 groups of independent and uniformly distributed random numbers over the interval 0 1 with the same length as the observed streamflow records are generated by monte carlo method and substituted into inverse form of equation 4 producing 500 groups stochastic streamflow series for each month a visual comparison should be carried out to examine distribution characteristics between observed streamflow records and stochastic streamflow series furthermore stochastic streamflow series are also verified whether it can preserve the essential statistical characteristics of the observed streamflow records including mean standard deviation s d coefficient of skewness c s lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient acf 1 lag 2 autocorrelation coefficient acf 2 lag 2 partial correlation coefficient pacf 2 r statistic and kendall s tau in addition four extreme streamflow characteristics maximum and minimum monthly flows and the month in which it occurred pertaining to observed streamflow records and 500 groups stochastic simulation series are compared for the purposes of screening out unnecessary predictors and reducing the computational burdens there are two predetermined thresholds of r statistic 0 5742 and 0 6717 which correspond to 0 2 and 0 3 of jmi or jcmi and are defined as threshold 1 and threshold 2 respectively two groups of predictor variables relating to same month may be generated by threshold 1 and threshold 2 if the value of corresponding r statistic is greater than threshold 1 but less than threshold 2 both two groups of predictor variables were applied to the following steps to construct corresponding vine copula model and additional evaluation should be developed to determine the optimal multivariate vine copula omvc model considering the accuracy and computational burden of model in addition step ii and iii are executed on the basis of the complete streamflow records which is helpful to accurately construct univariate margin distributions and determine multivariate copulae relationships ahn 2021 while step iv is developed based on the calibration data set to facilitate subsequent model validation in step v 4 case study to showcase the performance of the proposed approach in practice it was applied for simulating monthly streamflow of two target hydrometric stations in two considered study regions the upper colorado river basin and middle yangtze river basin with diverse hydrological characteristics in addition there are significant distinctions in the length of observation streamflow records above two case studies are helpful to verify the response of this proposed approach to different hydrology regime and available data length the colorado river basin covers parts of seven states in the southwestern united states and the sonoran desert in mexico the whole basin is divided into upper and lower reach with lee s ferry just below glen canyon dam as the point of division monthly streamflow records of five hydrometric stations in the upper colorado river ucr basin resourced from the us geological survey usgs national water information system are selected as a case study five hydrometric stations corresponding to five usgs gauge numbers 09072500 09095500 09152500 09180000 09180500 are denoted as cr1 cr2 gr1 dr1 and cr3 respectively a schematic of colorado river basin and locations of five hydrometric stations is shown in fig 1 a cr1 cr2 and cr3 are located on the ucr from upstream to downstream while gr1 and dr1 serve as outflow control points of two tributaries of the ucr namely gunnison river and dolores river cr2 is chosen as the target hydrometric station in the ucr basin for applying the proposed approach a total of 114 years of available monthly streamflow records spanning the period from 1906 to 2019 are applied to evaluate the model performance records from the initial 100 year period are used for model calibration and the remaining records are subsequently for model validation for simplicity a naming scheme is applied in the following section that is the name of a hydrometric station with a numeric subscript refers to the observed monthly streamflow record from the hydrometric station in specific month and the numbers 1 12 in the subscript represent 12 months respectively for example c r 1 1 refers to the observed monthly streamflow record from cr1 in january the yangtze river is the longest river in china running through nineteen provincial administrative regions the middle yangtze river myr basin refers to the catchment area of the yangtze river and its tributaries between yichang section in hubei province and hukou section in jiangxi province observed monthly streamflow series 1993 2020 recorded by five hydrometric stations in the myr basin including jianli jl chenglingji clj luoshan ls xiantao xt and hankou hk are selected as another case study clj which is located at the intersection of the myr and dongting lake is deemed as the outlet control section of dongting lake xt serves as outflow control point located at downstream of the hanjiang river jl ls and hk are located on the myr from upstream to downstream where ls and hk monitors the hydrological situation after dongting lake and hanjiang river flows into the myr respectively ls is chosen as the target hydrometric station in the myr basin for applying the proposed approach a schematic of the myr basin and locations of five hydrometric stations is shown in fig 1 b similarly streamflow records from the initial 20 year period are served as calibration data set and the remaining records are regarded as validation data set 5 results and discussion to facilitate understanding of the abbreviations in results and discussion section corresponding descriptions are summarized in table s1 of the supplementary material 5 1 selection of predictor variables and corresponding marginal distribution before implementing stochastic streamflow generation of cr2 predictor variables relating to predictand variable for specific month should be ensured in terms of the evaluation results of aic fpe and hq shown in fig 2 a all three information criteria had minimum values when lag time l t 6 which means that lag 1 lag 6 streamflow records from cr2 can be considered as candidate predictors associated in temporal table 1 presents r statistics relating to different lag times of observed monthly streamflow series from cr2 r statistics marked in bold correspond to the predictor variables suggested by threshold 1 while r statistics marked in bold italic refer to the predictor variables determined by threshold 2 in the light of two predetermined thresholds of r statistic two groups of predictor variables relating to january april november and december were identified threshold 1 and threshold 2 suggested the same predictor variable s for the remaining months because the corresponding r statistics are greater than threshold 2 considering the spatial locations of different hydrometric stations and the influence of tributaries flowing into the main stream streamflow series from cr1 gr1 dr1 and cr3 were considered as candidate predictors in spatial r statistics relating to the observed monthly streamflow series from different hydrometric stations are reported in table 2 r statistics between cr1 and cr2 gr1 and cr2 as well as cr3 and cr2 exceed threshold 2 indicating that monthly streamflow series from cr1 gr1 and cr3 should be considered as the predictor variables of those from cr2 however r statistics between observed monthly streamflow series from dr1 and cr2 exhibit complicated situation r statistics between dr1 and cr2 in february april and december are less than threshold 1 while r statistics in may and october are greater than threshold 1 but less than threshold 2 the results demonstrate that d r 1 2 d r 1 4 and d r 1 12 cannot be regarded as a predictor variable of streamflow records from cr2 in the corresponding month furthermore not threshold 2 but only threshold 1 suggests that d r 1 5 and d r 1 10 should be considered as a predictor variable of c r 2 5 and c r 2 10 respectively leading to two groups of predictor variables associated in spatial with regard to may and october besides streamflow records from dr1 in the remaining months are unanimously recommended by threshold 1 and threshold 2 as the predictor variables because r statistics between dr1 and cr2 pertaining to the remaining months are greater than threshold 2 in summary predictand variable and predictor variables for each month in the ucr basin are presented in table s2 of the supplementary material two groups of predictor variables suggested by threshold 1 and threshold 2 which relates to january april may october november and december are named standard group and reduced dimension group respectively similarly predictor variables for the monthly streamflow simulation of ls station were also determined by following the instructions in step i as shown in fig 2 b aic fpe and hq had minimum values when lag time l t 1 and lag 1 streamflow records from ls can be considered as the predictor variable for the monthly streamflow simulation table 2 also summarizes r statistics relating to the observed monthly streamflow series from different hydrometric stations in the myr basin implementation process of predictor variables selection for the monthly streamflow simulation of ls station is similar to that of cr2 mentioned above and is therefore presented in the supplementary material predictand variable and corresponding predictor variables for each month in the myr basin are summarized in table s3 of the supplementary material predictand variable and corresponding predictor variables for each month in the ucr basin and myr basin were fitted to eight candidate parametric distributions tables s4 and s5 summarize the values of nrmse pertaining to eight candidate parameter distributions for observed monthly streamflow series from the ucr basin and myr basin respectively the minimum nrmse marked in bold corresponds to the optimal parametric distribution p values which were returned from k s test and regard to the optimal parametric distributions ranged from 0 2317 to 0 9942 greater than the predetermined level of significance α herein α 0 05 indicating that the selected optimal parametric distributions satisfy the appropriateness to be the marginal distribution of observed monthly streamflow series 5 2 determination of the optimal multivariate vine copula models after determining the predictand variables and corresponding predictor variables as well as their marginal distributions the vine structures of r vine copula models for each month can be finalized based on the proposed r statistic based vine structure determination strategy vine structures of r vine copula models for the pairs of predictand variable and corresponding predictor variables listed in table s2 and s3 were determined by implementing the proposed r statistic based vine structure determination strategy subsequently copula functions and corresponding parameter s for each pair copula were evaluated and determined in the light of step iv presented in section 3 a total of 32 r vine copula models were established 18 of which on the basis of monthly streamflow series from the ucr basin and the remaining 14 in accordance with monthly streamflow series from the myr basin it should be noted that standard groups and reduced dimension groups which are suggested by threshold 1 and threshold 2 have their own r vine copula models named standard vine copula model and reduced dimension vine copula model respectively specifically the observed streamflow records from the ucr basin in january april may october november and december as well as those from the myr basin in july and august correspond to two groups of predictor variables and naturally possess two types of r vine copula models except for the months above mentioned the remaining months only have a unique r vine copula model which was naturally regarded as the omvc model for corresponding month table 3 summarizes the aic values of all 32 r vine copula models the results demonstrate that standard vine copula model has relatively smaller aic value than corresponding reduced dimension vine copula model but also corresponds to more complex vine structure and longer time consumption of model development it is necessary to determine the omvc model from standard and reduced dimension vine copula models considering the accuracy and computational burden the proposed methods in step v and vi for streamflow series estimation and stochastic streamflow generation were applied in advance to select the omvc model comparison of mean standard deviation s d coefficient of skewness c s of the stochastic simulation series from standard and reduced dimension vine copula models are presented in fig 3 a c mean and s d of the stochastic simulation series of ls exist certain difference while those of cr2 exhibit satisfied consistency in addition fig 3 d shows observed monthly streamflow records and corresponding estimated series generated from standard and reduced dimension vine copula models a visual comparison demonstrates that estimated monthly streamflow series of ls generated from standard vine copula models are better align with observed streamflow records than those from reduced dimension vine copula models the results prove that predictor variables used to construct standard models can provide more plentiful information to estimate predictand variable especially for extreme streamflow records standard vine copula models can offer more accurate estimation results than reduced dimension models indicating that predictor variables in standard group are more conducive to depict upper tail dependence among different observed monthly streamflow series than those in reduced dimension group nevertheless the diversity between estimated monthly streamflow series of cr2 generated from standard and reduced dimension vine copula models is fairly minor and both estimation results are generally consistent with observed streamflow records by further analyzing the opposite results obtained in consistent comparison of streamflow estimation and stochastic simulation of cr2 and ls based on standard and reduced dimension vine copula models we can summarize that the sensitivity of the r vine copula model constructed by the proposed approach to the number of predictor variables is relatively low when sample data are abundant especially for the predictand variable c r 2 12 two predictor variables c r 2 6 and c r 2 7 contained in standard group were excluded from corresponding reduced dimension group the consistent comparison however not only exhibited similar results of the estimated streamflow series generated from standard and reduced dimension models but also proved that three basic statistics mean s d and c s of two stochastic simulation series are highly consistent in other words this low sensitivity to the number of predictor variables contributes to ensure the accuracy of modeling when a few predictor variables are missing so as to still generate the simulation results with satisfied accuracy and low uncertainty in summary standard vine copula models pertaining to monthly streamflow series from the myr basin in july and august can be regarded as the omvc models while reduced dimension vine copula models relating to monthly streamflow series from the ucr basin in january april may october november and december should be considered as the omvc models the dimensionality ranges of the omvc models relating to monthly streamflow series from the ucr basin and myr basin are 5 8 and 5 6 respectively array constraint sets corresponding to all omvc models of observed monthly streamflow series from the ucr basin and myr basin are presented in table s6 of the supplementary material the estimation results of observed streamflow records from cr2 and ls were produced by following the proposed method in step v to verify the accuracy and rationality of the omvc model for each month fig 4 illustrates the time series of observed streamflow records and estimation results of cr2 and ls generated from the omvc vc tau and tabts models it should be emphasized that vc tau models for each month were established according to the calibration data set composed of same predictand variable and predictor variables as omvc models for same month tabts model corresponding to cr2 or ls was constructed only based on observed monthly streamflow records in the calibration period from corresponding hydrometric station cr2 or ls in general the estimation results accord with the inter annual variation trend of streamflow records from cr2 and ls but exist deviation to be reckoned from some extreme streamflow records the results indicate that tabts model underestimated the extreme streamflow records from cr2 while omvc and vc tau models produced satisfied estimated series although the estimation results of ls generated from the omvc vc tau and tabts models show varying degrees of deviation from extreme streamflow records the performance of the omvc models are preferable to that of vc tau and tbats models in order to compare the three estimation results more accurately four quantitative metrics rmse mnse mkge and mape of omvc vc tau and tbats models for monthly streamflow estimation of cr2 and ls were evaluated and summarized in table 4 it is clear that the omvc models show improvement upon four quantitative metrics of vc tau and tbats models in both calibration period and validation period more specifically the omvc models for monthly streamflow estimation of cr2 come in better than vc tau and tbats models with about 7 and 29 reduction of rmse 16 19 and 23 28 reduction of mape as well as moderate improvement of mnse and mkge focusing on monthly streamflow estimation of ls the omvc models are also superior to vc tau and tbats models with about 6 and 16 reduction of rmse and mape as well as moderate improvement of mnse and mkge compared with the estimation results generated from vc tau and tbats models the improvement of four quantitative metrics produced by omvc models for monthly streamflow estimation of cr2 is greater than that of ls indicating that the estimation results of cr2 generated from all three types of models are more accurate than those of ls the potential reason for above phenomena can be attributed to the distinctions in hydrology regime and available data length between the ucr basin and myr basin firstly the longer sample data length is helpful in establishing more accurate vine copula model to depict complex and diverse dependence structures among different streamflow series hao and singh 2015 while the time span of observed streamflow records from the ucr basin is significantly longer than that from the myr basin secondly the volatile hydrological situations of the myr inevitably increase the complexity and difficulty of hydrological simulation xu et al 2022 the myr collects streamflow with different monthly distribution and inter annual trend from various tributaries river connected lakes as well as the upper reaches of the yangtze river and withstands continuous heavy rainfall in june and july called plum rain resulting in the runoff process with high magnitude large inter annual variability and more frequent extreme values compared with the myr the ucr shows almost opposite runoff characteristics from the perspective of hydrology regime and data abundance it is more difficult to accurately describe the dependence structures among different streamflow series from the myr basin than that from the ucr basin leading to the distinctions in the accuracy of streamflow estimation of cr2 and ls furthermore analysis of variance anova was implemented based on r environment to detect the significance of the pairwise differences between monthly observed records and corresponding estimated series produced by omvc vc tau and tbats the null hypothesis for anova is that there is no significant difference between the monthly observed records and corresponding estimated series the results of anova show that the performances of the above three models are different specifically for streamflow estimations of cr2 the null hypothesis is rejected when detecting the difference between the monthly observed records and corresponding estimated series produced by vc tau model in december as for the tbats model the rejections of null hypothesis relate to the streamflow estimations in january and december for streamflow estimations of ls the rejections of null hypothesis occur in april and june for vc tau and in january february august and november for tbats model however streamflow estimations of cr2 and ls produced by the omvc model in different months pass the anova test indicating that no significant difference is detected in addition the 95 uncertainty intervals of 1000 realizations for the validation period produced by omvc and vc tau models were compared and presented in fig 5 tbats model was not included in this comparison because the aforementioned analysis had shown that the accuracy of its estimation results was significantly worse than omvc and vc tau models fig 5 shows that omvc and vc tau models can cover the observed streamflow records within the 95 uncertainty intervals however omvc model corresponds to significantly narrower confidence interval than vc tau model indicating that omvc model bring considerable improvements in predictive uncertainty to summarize omvc models still produced satisfied estimation results of streamflow records from cr2 and ls and exhibited improvement upon vc tau and tbats models the results of streamflow series estimation validate the superiority of the omvc models developed by the proposed approach and their feasibility of generating high performance stochastic streamflow series 5 3 verification of stochastic streamflow series following the proposed stochastic streamflow generation approach in step vi 500 groups of stochastic streamflow series for each month with the same length as the observed records were generated based on the omvc models comprehensive inspection and verification were then developed to evaluate the performance of the omvc models in stochastic streamflow generation first of all raincloud plots for comparing overall distribution characteristics between observed records and simulated series relating to cr2 and ls are presented in fig 6 a and b respectively raincloud plot combines randomized jittered data points boxplot and split half violin plot in a complementary fashion and visualizes raw data probability density distribution and key statistics in an intuitive modular and appealing format with minimal redundancy allen et al 2021 it should be noted that randomized jittered data points shown in fig 6 a and b represent observed records while boxplot and split half violin plot describe central tendency and probability density distribution of simulated series respectively it is obvious that the distribution range of monthly simulated series of cr2 and ls cover corresponding monthly observed records meanwhile the observed records and simulated series corresponding to same month share same central tendency the results prove that overall distribution characteristics of observed records and simulated series are consistent furthermore both monthly observed records and simulated series were classified into three flow intervals in terms of their value the three flow intervals entitled monthly high flow monthly median flow and monthly low flow account for 20 60 and 20 of complete data respectively distribution characteristics of different flow intervals were compared and presented in fig 6 c and d the visual comparison indicates that the majority of monthly observed records and simulated series in same flow interval correspond to same distribution range especially for the comparison results of cr2 in fig 6 c monthly observed records and simulated series in each flow interval can keep high identical as for ls several simulated values in the monthly low flow interval underestimate corresponding observed values and a few extreme observed values are beyond the scope of corresponding simulated series in the monthly high flow interval in addition the monthly simulated series of ls seem to be more concentrated than those of cr2 which is embodied in fewer months with mild outliers in the boxplots as shown in fig 6 c and d mild outliers occur in the monthly simulated series of ls in february march june august november and december but they are absent only in the monthly simulated series of cr2 in june this distinction also signifies that the simulated series of ls are too conservative to cover all extreme observed records while the proportion of extreme values in monthly observed series of ls is higher than that of cr2 considering the abundance and distribution characteristics of observed streamflow series from the ucr basin and myr basin used to establish the omvc models these phenomena can be explained that longer sample data and more stable hydrological situations are convinced to facilitate accurate stochastic streamflow simulation after the comparison of distribution characteristics eight types of essential statistical characteristics were further evaluated figs 7 and 8 present boxplots of mean standard deviation s d coefficient of skewness c s r statistic lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient acf 1 lag 2 autocorrelation coefficient acf 2 and lag 2 partial correlation coefficient pacf 2 pertaining to 500 groups of simulated series of cr2 and ls respectively in addition corresponding boxplots of kendall s tau are shown in fig s1 of the supplementary material it should be noted that the boxplots in fig s1 were achieved based on the sequential calculation of kendall s tau between the observed records from a hydrological station regarded as predictor variable and 500 groups of simulated series the same process was used to calculate jmi and then corresponding r statistic was obtained on the basis of equation 4 in accordance with evaluation criterion proposed by hao and singh 2013 the performance of stochastic streamflow generation was judged to be good when a statistic pertaining to observed records fell within the corresponding boxplot of simulated series as the comparison results shown in figs 7 and 8 and fig s1 the majority of observed statistics fall within the corresponding boxplots which indicates that the simulated series can preserve the statistical characteristics of the observed series expect for essential statistical characteristics extreme streamflow characteristics are important for evaluating the performance of stochastic streamflow generation annual maximum and minimum monthly flows and the month in which it occurred pertaining to observed streamflow records and 500 groups stochastic simulation series are compared and presented in fig 9 fig 9 a b present the comparison results of annual maximum and minimum monthly flows relating to cr2 respectively while fig 9 c d show corresponding results relating to ls the results demonstrate that annual maximum and minimum values of monthly observed records and simulated series share same distribution range and corresponding occurrence months also exhibit good consistency the above results verify that omvc model can accurately capture the tail dependence and generate satisfactory stochastic simulation series that reflect extreme streamflow characteristics in summary the performance of stochastic streamflow generation based on the omvc models should be regarded as satisfactory according to the above evaluation and analysis applications of the proposed approach in the ucr basin and myr basin eventually achieve high performance stochastic streamflow generation after selecting the predictor variables and constructing omvc models for each month the generated accurate and extensive stochastic simulation series can preserve essential distribution and statistical characteristics thereby overcoming the disadvantage of limited observed records and thus are instructive in the context of water resources planning and management of the above two basins moreover omvc models constructed by the proposed approach can be supposed to possess good adaptability and robustness considering satisfactory simulation results of monthly streamflow records from two study regions with diverse hydrology regime and available data length due to the scalability and flexibility of the proposed approach more potential predictor variables such as meteorological factors and large scale climate indices can also be incorporated into consideration for stochastic streamflow generation 6 conclusions this study proposed an integrated approach to constructing high dimensional r vine copula model for stochastic streamflow generation considering temporal and spatial dependence among various observed streamflow records r statistic a comprehensive dependence measure was applied as screening index for predictor variables selection and weight factor for vine structure determination r statistic was calculated based on corresponding jmi and jcmi instead of the traditional estimation of mi and cmi which significantly simplified the calculation process and improved the estimation accuracy benefiting from the advantages of r statistic the predictor variables selection algorithm could accurately screen out unnecessary predictor variables by using two predetermined thresholds of r statistic while the vine structure determination strategy could effectively avoid continuous accumulation of uncertainty in the traditional kendall s tau based method and separate the vine copula model construction into two independent parts vine structure determination and bivariate copula selection and estimation the above optimizations can not only construct more accurate r vine copula model to characterize the dependence structure among various variables but also significantly reduce the computational burdens and time consumption so as to proceed accurate streamflow estimation and stochastic simulation the proposed approach was applied in two study regions the ucr basin and myr basin with diverse hydrology regime and available data length the omvc models of observed monthly streamflow series for each month were determined by implementing this integrated approach and the determination process of omvc models also demonstrated that the sensitivity of the r vine copula model constructed by the proposed approach to the number of predictor variables is relatively low when sample data are abundant streamflow estimation and stochastic simulation were then performed and validated sequentially based on the omvc models the estimation results from the omvc vc tau and tabts models were compared visually and quantitatively and the results indicated that omvc models could produce satisfied streamflow estimations of observed records from cr2 and ls and show improvement upon vc tau and tbats models meanwhile stochastic simulation series of cr2 and ls had high accuracy because their distribution and statistical characteristics and extreme streamflow characteristics are consistent with observed streamflow records it is worth mentioning that the performance of both streamflow estimation and stochastic simulation were better for cr2 than for ls due to the significant contribution of longer sample data and more stable hydrological situations to summarize the omvc models still generated satisfied estimation results and simulation series of cr2 and ls certifying that r vine copula model constructed by the proposed approach possesses good adaptability and robustness to streamflow series with diverse characteristics and abundances it should be emphasized that this integrated approach allows to consider observed streamflow series from other basins and at various time scales e g weekly annual and extend to higher dimensions by including more additional predictor variables the proposed approach was used for stochastic streamflow generation as a demonstration in this study but it can also be extended for the estimation and prediction of other hydrometeorological variables e g water level precipitation temperature and wind speed in addition the proposed vine copula model construction approach is expected to implement in context of climate change by drawing on practices of li and babovic 2019a 2019b that is applying empirical copula to reconstruct the dependence between different spatio temporal downscaled global climate model gcm series in multi site context and propose a multisite weather generator the future work will focus on exploring the variation characteristics and response patterns of runoff process under different climatic scenarios to provide a scientific reference for regional water resources planning and

2295,stochastic streamflow generation is crucial for water resources planning and management as well as water conservancy project design and operation this study proposes an accurate reliable and parsimonious approach for stochastic streamflow generation considering temporal and spatial dependence on the basis of regular vine copula model the emphasis is on advancing an r statistic based strategy of vine structure determination that divide the vine copula model construction into two independent parts and avoid continuous accumulation of uncertainty in the traditional kendall s tau

predictor variables as well as good adaptability and robustness to streamflow series with diverse characteristics and abundances the enhanced capability and performance stem from the accurate identification of predictor variables and characterization of complex and diverse dependence structures among different streamflow series on the basis of a comprehensive and precise dependence measure r statistic keywords stochastic streamflow generation r statistic vine copula vine structure determination spatiotemporal interdependence data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction stochastic streamflow generation is of considerable importance in water resources planning and management due to limit observed streamflow records and unbalanced distribution of hydrometric stations ahn 2021 ben aissia et al 2017 it is also instructive in the context of water conservancy project design and operation as a result of its prominent role in predicting and preventing extreme hydrological events that have not yet been observed in the past but nonetheless can be expected in the future szilagyi et al 2006 more specifically spatiotemporal interdependence of river runoff processes within a region is crucial for the uniform dispatch and regulation of water quantity and quality which increasingly demands high performance stochastic streamflow generation considering temporal and spatial dependence on the basis of multisite observed streamflow records dyer et al 2014 zhai et al 2017 the fundamental principle of high performance stochastic streamflow generation is that the simulated series can preserve the distribution and statistical characteristics of the observed records and reduce uncertainty hao and singh 2013 chen et al 2019 data driven models have emerged as a feasible and promising technique for hydrological simulation demonstrating preferable predictability with less input data and parameters as well as more convenient operations compared to physically based models moradkhani et al 2004 tiwari and chatterjee 2010 liu et al 2015b in recent decades considerable efforts regarding the application of data driven models for stochastic streamflow generation have become quite prevalent traditional data driven models are composed of parametric methods and nonparametric ones multiple linear regression mlr and autoregressive moving average arma model and its variants are probably the most widely adopted parametric methods for streamflow simulation and estimation mckerchar and delleur 1974 adamowski et al 2012 sirangelo et al 2017 the main disadvantages of these models are the limitations in describing nonlinear dependence and representing nonstandard probability distribution functions which also leads to inaccurate greater lags ahead estimation hao and singh 2013 chen et al 2015 trigonometric box cox transformation with arma residuals trend and seasonal components tbats model as a hybrid model of exponential smoothing method box cox transformation and arma has been used to handle complex seasonality and non linear features contained in hydrometeorological time series de livera et al 2011 herbert et al 2021 nonparametric methods in the light of bootstrapping kernel density estimation and k nearest neighbor resampling method also served to simulate streamflow records lall and sharma 1996 nowak et al 2010 prairie et al 2007 sharma and o neill 2002 however these methods are limited to exploit within the range of the sample data and are inefficient and cumbersome to extend to high dimensions chen et al 2015 lall et al 2016 the probability based theory of copulas has been gaining popularity in the probabilistic modeling and forecasting of hydrometeorological variables due to the advantages of selecting and combining arbitrary marginal distributions dong et al 2022 copula based stochastic streamflow simulation thus has improved to ability to consider temporal and spatial dependence as well as the potential impacts of climate change hao and singh 2013 nazemi et al 2013 2020 wang et al 2019 nazemi et al 2013 2020 hassanzadeh et al 2016 2017 worland et al 2019 panahi et al 2021 however traditional bivariate copulas lack accuracy and flexibility in modelling complex and diverse dependence structures with high dimensionality which limit further application in stochastic streamflow generation considering temporal and spatial dependence among different streamflow records bevacqua et al 2017 brunner et al 2019 regular vine r vine copula serves as a promising tool for establishing multivariate framework with a hierarchical set of bivariate copulas and conditional bivariate copulas as basic modules aas et al 2009 dißmann et al 2013 the prominent flexibility of r vine copula enables multivariate dependence structures among various hydrometeorological series to be reproduced liu et al 2015a resulting in extensive application in hydrology yu et al 2019 nazemi et al 2020 hatami and nazemi 2022 vine copula based stochastic streamflow generators can also consider more predictors such as meteorological factors and large scale climate indices lee et al 2018 wang et al 2019 zaerpour et al 2021 however several issues implied in vine copula application need urgent attention first and foremost the existing strategy leads to substantial time consumption and accumulation of uncertainty inevitably because each step of vine copula model development is affected by former steps czado et al 2013 ni et al 2020 on the other hand kendall s tau rank correlation coefficient is usually chosen as weight factor to determine vine structure with the objective of quantitative comparing dependence among different variables vernieuwe et al 2015 wang et al 2019 however kendall s tau is only a global measure of the dependence without ability to capture the complex dependence characteristics e g nonlinear and tail dependence genest and favre 2007 there is an urgent need to develop superior vine structure determination strategy and choose a more comprehensive weight factor to further upgrading the construction method for vine copula model furthermore the applications of r vine copula in hydrology especially for stochastic streamflow generation rarely consider high dimensional temporal and spatial dependence simultaneously tosunoglu and singh 2018 ahn 2021 liu et al 2021 and only focus on two simplified subclasses of r vine canonical vine c vine and drawable vine d vine wang et al 2019 tosunoglu et al 2020 tao et al 2021 xu et al 2022 which are insufficient to exhibit its superior ability to describe dependence structures among multiple variables in addition the traditional strategy to construct vine copula model is implemented based on stepwise selection wherein vine structure determination and bivariate copula selection are conducted iteratively dißmann et al 2013 this study aims to propose an improved construction approach for vine copula model integrating predictor variables selection algorithm and vine structure determination strategy in the light of r statistic to produce accurate and extensive stochastic simulation series considering temporal and spatial dependence among various observed streamflow records r statistic the normalization of mutual information mi and conditional mutual information cmi enables direct comparison of dependence while retains the properties of mi making it a better measure of complex dependence than kendall s tau the predictor variables selection algorithm serves to screen out unnecessary predictor variables and the vine structure determination strategy devotes to avoid substantial time consumption and continuous accumulation of uncertainty to achieve the above objective this study 1 identifies predictor variables that exhibit temporal or spatial dependence with predictand variable according to r statistic 2 implements the r statistic based vine structure determination strategy to construct r vine copula models capable of depicting complex and diverse dependence structures among different streamflow series 3 evaluates the streamflow estimation performance of the proposed approach by comparing with the traditional kendall s tau based vine copula vc tau model and tbats model 4 examines whether stochastic simulation series can preserve distribution and statistical characteristics as well as extreme streamflow characteristics of observed records two study regions the upper colorado river basin and middle yangtze river basin with diverse hydrology regime and available data length are selected as case studies to showcase the performance of the proposed approach in practice the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodological basis for this study section 3 introduces the implementation process of the proposed integrated approach for stochastic streamflow generation section 4 outlines study area and data used as case studies section 5 provides analysis and discussion regarding the results of case studies and section 6 summarizes the essential conclusions of this study 2 methodology 2 1 regular vine copulas in accordance with the fundamental work of sklar 1959 consider f x is the joint cumulative distribution function cdf of a random vector x x 1 x 2 x n with marginal cdfs f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n there exists a copula function c which is the joint cdfs of n dimensional random vector u u 1 u 2 u n with uniform marginal cdfs on the unit cube 0 1 n the relation between f x and c can be expressed as 1 f x c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n c u 1 u 2 u n where the copula c is unique if f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n are continuous joe 1997 the corresponding joint probability density function pdf can be obtained as 2 f x c u 1 u 2 u n k 1 n f k x k where c is copula pdf and f k x k denotes marginal pdfs of x for k 1 2 n vine copulas provide a generic approach to construct multivariate joint distributions based on pair copula constructions pccs pccs can decompose the n dimensional multivariate density function into n n 1 2 basic modules named pair copula which are a panoply of bivariate copulas and conditional bivariate copulas regular vine r vine a hierarchical graphical structure with a sequence of trees edges and nodes is introduced to represent the high dimensional dependence structures n n 1 2 pair copulas decomposed from multivariate dependence structures can be ordered as n 1 nested trees t i i 1 n 1 with n 2 n 1 2 nodes joined by n n 1 2 edges according to the conditioned sets c e a c e b and conditioning sets d e bedford and cooke 2002 kurowicka and cooke 2006 the decomposition of multivariate density function for n dimensional r vine copulas can be shown as 3 f x k 1 n f k x k j 1 n 1 e e i c c e a c e b d e f c e a d e x c e a x d e f c e b d e x c e b x d e where e i denotes the set of edges e belonging to t i and x d e refers to the variables in d e according to joe 1996 and aas et al 2009 the conditional distribution function of t conditioned on an m dimensional vector t t 1 t 2 t m can be factorized as 4 f t t t t h t t θ c t t i t i f t t i t t i f t i t i t i t i θ f t i t i t i t i here t is the marginal cdf of the predictand variable x while t t 1 t 2 t m serves as the marginal cdf of an m dimensional predictor variable p p 1 p 2 p m that is t t 1 t 2 t m f x x f p 1 p 1 f p m

predictand variable to illustrate the conditional distribution function f t t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 based on a 5 dimensional c vine copula model can be written as 5 f t t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t t 1

traditional kendall s tau based method for vine copula model development relies on the iterative processes of kendall s tau calculation copula function selection copula parameter estimation and conditional data generation for each tree t i i 1 n 1 obviously the i t h iterative process for t i is affected by the results of previous i 1 processes causing continuous accumulation of uncertainty and considerable consumption of time it is necessary and beneficial to separate the vine copula model construction into two independent parts vine structure determination and bivariate copula selection and estimation by means of a more comprehensive weight factor which can accurately evaluate the complex and diverse dependence among different variables in other words vine structure should have been determined according to an optimal weight factor before the selection and estimation process of bivariate copula function for each pair copula ni et al 2020 proposed a mutual information mi based approach for vine structure determination in which mi and conditional mutual information cmi of all possible variable pairs were calculated from the original data series and employed to determine the copulae relations in each tree t i without data transform of conditional variables the results proved that the mi based approach satisfactorily modeled different kinds of dependence structure and yielded more information on variables in comparison with traditional kendall s tau based method as a measure of complex dependence mi enjoys the following excellent properties i mi is invariant even under strictly monotonic variable transformations cover and thomas 2006 ii mi places the same importance on linear and nonlinear dependence kinney and atwal 2014 these properties secure mi as a widespread used measure of complex dependence however the main disadvantage of mi is the lack of normalization limiting the direct comparison of dependence between different variable pairs r statistic the normalization of mi and cmi was introduced to measure the dependence between non linear non normal random variables granger and lin 1994 r statistic corresponding to two n dimensional random variables x x 1 x 2 x n and y y 1 y 2 y n can be defined as 7 r x y 1 exp 2 i where i refers to mi or cmi of x and y there is a nonlinear positive correlation between r statistic and i the relative magnitude of r statistic can be directly compared while inheriting the advantages of mi zeng et al 2018 introduced a jackknife version of the kernel density estimator kde for the mi named jmi and proved that jmi obtains an asymptotically unique maximum solution which can be used as the optimal evaluation of mi in view of the equalized bandwidth the proposed approach contributes to freeing the mi estimation from predetermined tuning parameters and possessing desirable statistical characteristics such as automatic bias correction and high freedom in independence test for a detailed description of jmi please refer to zeng et al 2018 similarly jackknife version of conditional mutual information jcmi can be calculated as an extension to the jmi on the lines cmi is an extension to mi r statistic normalized by jmi and jcmi has the potential to be an excellent dependence measure and can be considered as better weight factors than kendall s tau in the determination of vine structure in view of the existing disadvantages of the traditional kendall s tau based method an improved strategy of determining vine structure with r statistic as weight factor is proposed the specific procedure involves the following two steps i calculate the r statistics based on jmi of all possible variable pairs and then determine the copulae relationships among different variables that maximizes the sum of r statistics as the optimal structure of t 1 ii calculate the r statistics based on jcmi of all possible node pairs determined in t 1 and then identify the copulae relationships among different conditional variables that maximizes the sum of r statistics as the optimal structure of t 2 repeat this step until t 3 t n 1 are specified sequentially 3 implementation process of stochastic streamflow generation with objective of achieving accurate and extensive stochastic streamflow series pertaining to target hydrometric station for specific month which is defined as predictand variable r statistic based predictor variables selection algorithm and vine structure determination strategy are employed to accomplish stochastic streamflow generation at a monthly scale detailed implementation process involves several sequential steps i selection of predictor variables observed streamflow series which possess temporal or spatial dependence with predictand variable for specific month are chosen as predictor variables firstly the accurate lag time l t of monthly streamflow records from target hydrometric station are determined according to akaike information criterion aic final prediction error criterion fpe and hannan quinn criterion hq akaike 1971 1973 hannan and quinn 1979 candidate predictors associated in spatial are defined as streamflow series from hydrometric stations in adjacent region while lag 1 lag l t streamflow records are considered as candidate predictors associated in temporal secondly jmi between each candidate predictor and the corresponding predictand variable is calculated and corresponding r statistic is further obtained to compare the magnitude of the dependence a candidate predictor can be selected as predictor variable when the r statistic between the candidate predictor and corresponding predictand variable exceeds the predetermined threshold in addition the candidate predictor with the maximum value of r statistics in a month is also considered as predictor variable when r statistics corresponding to different lag times in that month are less than the predetermined threshold ii selection of marginal distribution eight parameter distribution functions which are commonly used in hydrology are served as candidate marginal distributions of all considered variables predictand variable and corresponding predictor variables for each month the parameter distributions considered in this study include pearson type iii p iii normal logarithmic normal cauchy gamma generalized extreme value gev gumbel and weibull distributions chen et al 2019 kolmogorov smirnov k s test is performed to determine whether samples come from the population with specific parameter distribution the best fitted parameter distribution is determined based on the normalized root mean square error nrmse in order to meet the needs of vine copula modeling the probability integral transformation algorithm is used to convert observed streamflow series into corresponding copula data with uniform marginal cdfs on the unit cube 0 1 n iii determination of vine structure the vine structure of r vine copula models for each month are determined in accordance with the proposed r statistic based vine structure determination strategy array constraint set an n dimensional lower triangular array is employed to represent the copulae relationships among different pair copulas contained in vine structure morales nápoles 2008 iv selection of copula function and parameter s for each pair copula selection proceeds by computing the aic relating to each alternative copula function on the basis of the calibration data set and then determining the optimal copula function and its parameter s corresponding to each pair copula with minimum aic the alternative copula functions include elliptical copulas gaussian and student s t four types of archimedean copulas clayton gumbel frank and joe four mixed modes of archimedean copulas clayton gumbel joe gumbel joe clayton and joe frank and the corresponding three rotated versions 90 180 and 270 maximum likelihood estimate mle is applied to further evaluate the copula parameters limited memory broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bound l bfgs b method is employed for optimization due to its higher optimize efficiency in comparison to newton method and bfgs method moreover goodness of fit test is conducted to validate the null hypothesis that the dependence structure between two variables obeys the selected copula function v estimation of predictand variable observed monthly streamflow series in both calibration period and validation period are estimated using the monte carlo method and inverse form of equation 4 to verify the accuracy and rationality of r vine copula model for each month more specifically 1000 random numbers subject to standard uniform distribution u 0 1 are generated by monte carlo method and substituted into inverse form of equation 4 producing 1000 corresponding realizations of predictand variable the mean value of these realizations can be considered as the optimal estimation which are compared with the estimation results of traditional kendall s tau based vine copula vc tau model and tbats model the accuracy of above three models are further evaluated by following four quantitative metrics the root mean square error rmse modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mnse krause et al 2005 modified kling gupta efficiency mkge kling et al 2012 and mean absolute percentage error mape vi generation of stochastic streamflow series similar to the estimation process of predictand variable the generation of stochastic streamflow series is also performed by applying the monte carlo method and inverse form of equation 4 500 groups of independent and uniformly distributed random numbers over the interval 0 1 with the same length as the observed streamflow records are generated by monte carlo method and substituted into inverse form of equation 4 producing 500 groups stochastic streamflow series for each month a visual comparison should be carried out to examine distribution characteristics between observed streamflow records and stochastic streamflow series furthermore stochastic streamflow series are also verified whether it can preserve the essential statistical characteristics of the observed streamflow records including mean standard deviation s d coefficient of skewness c s lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient acf 1 lag 2 autocorrelation coefficient acf 2 lag 2 partial correlation coefficient pacf 2 r statistic and kendall s tau in addition four extreme streamflow characteristics maximum and minimum monthly flows and the month in which it occurred pertaining to observed streamflow records and 500 groups stochastic simulation series are compared for the purposes of screening out unnecessary predictors and reducing the computational burdens there are two predetermined thresholds of r statistic 0 5742 and 0 6717 which correspond to 0 2 and 0 3 of jmi or jcmi and are defined as threshold 1 and threshold 2 respectively two groups of predictor variables relating to same month may be generated by threshold 1 and threshold 2 if the value of corresponding r statistic is greater than threshold 1 but less than threshold 2 both two groups of predictor variables were applied to the following steps to construct corresponding vine copula model and additional evaluation should be developed to determine the optimal multivariate vine copula omvc model considering the accuracy and computational burden of model in addition step ii and iii are executed on the basis of the complete streamflow records which is helpful to accurately construct univariate margin distributions and determine multivariate copulae relationships ahn 2021 while step iv is developed based on the calibration data set to facilitate subsequent model validation in step v 4 case study to showcase the performance of the proposed approach in practice it was applied for simulating monthly streamflow of two target hydrometric stations in two considered study regions the upper colorado river basin and middle yangtze river basin with diverse hydrological characteristics in addition there are significant distinctions in the length of observation streamflow records above two case studies are helpful to verify the response of this proposed approach to different hydrology regime and available data length the colorado river basin covers parts of seven states in the southwestern united states and the sonoran desert in mexico the whole basin is divided into upper and lower reach with lee s ferry just below glen canyon dam as the point of division monthly streamflow records of five hydrometric stations in the upper colorado river ucr basin resourced from the us geological survey usgs national water information system are selected as a case study five hydrometric stations corresponding to five usgs gauge numbers 09072500 09095500 09152500 09180000 09180500 are denoted as cr1 cr2 gr1 dr1 and cr3 respectively a schematic of colorado river basin and locations of five hydrometric stations is shown in fig 1 a cr1 cr2 and cr3 are located on the ucr from upstream to downstream while gr1 and dr1 serve as outflow control points of two tributaries of the ucr namely gunnison river and dolores river cr2 is chosen as the target hydrometric station in the ucr basin for applying the proposed approach a total of 114 years of available monthly streamflow records spanning the period from 1906 to 2019 are applied to evaluate the model performance records from the initial 100 year period are used for model calibration and the remaining records are subsequently for model validation for simplicity a naming scheme is applied in the following section that is the name of a hydrometric station with a numeric subscript refers to the observed monthly streamflow record from the hydrometric station in specific month and the numbers 1 12 in the subscript represent 12 months respectively for example c r 1 1 refers to the observed monthly streamflow record from cr1 in january the yangtze river is the longest river in china running through nineteen provincial administrative regions the middle yangtze river myr basin refers to the catchment area of the yangtze river and its tributaries between yichang section in hubei province and hukou section in jiangxi province observed monthly streamflow series 1993 2020 recorded by five hydrometric stations in the myr basin including jianli jl chenglingji clj luoshan ls xiantao xt and hankou hk are selected as another case study clj which is located at the intersection of the myr and dongting lake is deemed as the outlet control section of dongting lake xt serves as outflow control point located at downstream of the hanjiang river jl ls and hk are located on the myr from upstream to downstream where ls and hk monitors the hydrological situation after dongting lake and hanjiang river flows into the myr respectively ls is chosen as the target hydrometric station in the myr basin for applying the proposed approach a schematic of the myr basin and locations of five hydrometric stations is shown in fig 1 b similarly streamflow records from the initial 20 year period are served as calibration data set and the remaining records are regarded as validation data set 5 results and discussion to facilitate understanding of the abbreviations in results and discussion section corresponding descriptions are summarized in table s1 of the supplementary material 5 1 selection of predictor variables and corresponding marginal distribution before implementing stochastic streamflow generation of cr2 predictor variables relating to predictand variable for specific month should be ensured in terms of the evaluation results of aic fpe and hq shown in fig 2 a all three information criteria had minimum values when lag time l t 6 which means that lag 1 lag 6 streamflow records from cr2 can be considered as candidate predictors associated in temporal table 1 presents r statistics relating to different lag times of observed monthly streamflow series from cr2 r statistics marked in bold correspond to the predictor variables suggested by threshold 1 while r statistics marked in bold italic refer to the predictor variables determined by threshold 2 in the light of two predetermined thresholds of r statistic two groups of predictor variables relating to january april november and december were identified threshold 1 and threshold 2 suggested the same predictor variable s for the remaining months because the corresponding r statistics are greater than threshold 2 considering the spatial locations of different hydrometric stations and the influence of tributaries flowing into the main stream streamflow series from cr1 gr1 dr1 and cr3 were considered as candidate predictors in spatial r statistics relating to the observed monthly streamflow series from different hydrometric stations are reported in table 2 r statistics between cr1 and cr2 gr1 and cr2 as well as cr3 and cr2 exceed threshold 2 indicating that monthly streamflow series from cr1 gr1 and cr3 should be considered as the predictor variables of those from cr2 however r statistics between observed monthly streamflow series from dr1 and cr2 exhibit complicated situation r statistics between dr1 and cr2 in february april and december are less than threshold 1 while r statistics in may and october are greater than threshold 1 but less than threshold 2 the results demonstrate that d r 1 2 d r 1 4 and d r 1 12 cannot be regarded as a predictor variable of streamflow records from cr2 in the corresponding month furthermore not threshold 2 but only threshold 1 suggests that d r 1 5 and d r 1 10 should be considered as a predictor variable of c r 2 5 and c r 2 10 respectively leading to two groups of predictor variables associated in spatial with regard to may and october besides streamflow records from dr1 in the remaining months are unanimously recommended by threshold 1 and threshold 2 as the predictor variables because r statistics between dr1 and cr2 pertaining to the remaining months are greater than threshold 2 in summary predictand variable and predictor variables for each month in the ucr basin are presented in table s2 of the supplementary material two groups of predictor variables suggested by threshold 1 and threshold 2 which relates to january april may october november and december are named standard group and reduced dimension group respectively similarly predictor variables for the monthly streamflow simulation of ls station were also determined by following the instructions in step i as shown in fig 2 b aic fpe and hq had minimum values when lag time l t 1 and lag 1 streamflow records from ls can be considered as the predictor variable for the monthly streamflow simulation table 2 also summarizes r statistics relating to the observed monthly streamflow series from different hydrometric stations in the myr basin implementation process of predictor variables selection for the monthly streamflow simulation of ls station is similar to that of cr2 mentioned above and is therefore presented in the supplementary material predictand variable and corresponding predictor variables for each month in the myr basin are summarized in table s3 of the supplementary material predictand variable and corresponding predictor variables for each month in the ucr basin and myr basin were fitted to eight candidate parametric distributions tables s4 and s5 summarize the values of nrmse pertaining to eight candidate parameter distributions for observed monthly streamflow series from the ucr basin and myr basin respectively the minimum nrmse marked in bold corresponds to the optimal parametric distribution p values which were returned from k s test and regard to the optimal parametric distributions ranged from 0 2317 to 0 9942 greater than the predetermined level of significance α herein α 0 05 indicating that the selected optimal parametric distributions satisfy the appropriateness to be the marginal distribution of observed monthly streamflow series 5 2 determination of the optimal multivariate vine copula models after determining the predictand variables and corresponding predictor variables as well as their marginal distributions the vine structures of r vine copula models for each month can be finalized based on the proposed r statistic based vine structure determination strategy vine structures of r vine copula models for the pairs of predictand variable and corresponding predictor variables listed in table s2 and s3 were determined by implementing the proposed r statistic based vine structure determination strategy subsequently copula functions and corresponding parameter s for each pair copula were evaluated and determined in the light of step iv presented in section 3 a total of 32 r vine copula models were established 18 of which on the basis of monthly streamflow series from the ucr basin and the remaining 14 in accordance with monthly streamflow series from the myr basin it should be noted that standard groups and reduced dimension groups which are suggested by threshold 1 and threshold 2 have their own r vine copula models named standard vine copula model and reduced dimension vine copula model respectively specifically the observed streamflow records from the ucr basin in january april may october november and december as well as those from the myr basin in july and august correspond to two groups of predictor variables and naturally possess two types of r vine copula models except for the months above mentioned the remaining months only have a unique r vine copula model which was naturally regarded as the omvc model for corresponding month table 3 summarizes the aic values of all 32 r vine copula models the results demonstrate that standard vine copula model has relatively smaller aic value than corresponding reduced dimension vine copula model but also corresponds to more complex vine structure and longer time consumption of model development it is necessary to determine the omvc model from standard and reduced dimension vine copula models considering the accuracy and computational burden the proposed methods in step v and vi for streamflow series estimation and stochastic streamflow generation were applied in advance to select the omvc model comparison of mean standard deviation s d coefficient of skewness c s of the stochastic simulation series from standard and reduced dimension vine copula models are presented in fig 3 a c mean and s d of the stochastic simulation series of ls exist certain difference while those of cr2 exhibit satisfied consistency in addition fig 3 d shows observed monthly streamflow records and corresponding estimated series generated from standard and reduced dimension vine copula models a visual comparison demonstrates that estimated monthly streamflow series of ls generated from standard vine copula models are better align with observed streamflow records than those from reduced dimension vine copula models the results prove that predictor variables used to construct standard models can provide more plentiful information to estimate predictand variable especially for extreme streamflow records standard vine copula models can offer more accurate estimation results than reduced dimension models indicating that predictor variables in standard group are more conducive to depict upper tail dependence among different observed monthly streamflow series than those in reduced dimension group nevertheless the diversity between estimated monthly streamflow series of cr2 generated from standard and reduced dimension vine copula models is fairly minor and both estimation results are generally consistent with observed streamflow records by further analyzing the opposite results obtained in consistent comparison of streamflow estimation and stochastic simulation of cr2 and ls based on standard and reduced dimension vine copula models we can summarize that the sensitivity of the r vine copula model constructed by the proposed approach to the number of predictor variables is relatively low when sample data are abundant especially for the predictand variable c r 2 12 two predictor variables c r 2 6 and c r 2 7 contained in standard group were excluded from corresponding reduced dimension group the consistent comparison however not only exhibited similar results of the estimated streamflow series generated from standard and reduced dimension models but also proved that three basic statistics mean s d and c s of two stochastic simulation series are highly consistent in other words this low sensitivity to the number of predictor variables contributes to ensure the accuracy of modeling when a few predictor variables are missing so as to still generate the simulation results with satisfied accuracy and low uncertainty in summary standard vine copula models pertaining to monthly streamflow series from the myr basin in july and august can be regarded as the omvc models while reduced dimension vine copula models relating to monthly streamflow series from the ucr basin in january april may october november and december should be considered as the omvc models the dimensionality ranges of the omvc models relating to monthly streamflow series from the ucr basin and myr basin are 5 8 and 5 6 respectively array constraint sets corresponding to all omvc models of observed monthly streamflow series from the ucr basin and myr basin are presented in table s6 of the supplementary material the estimation results of observed streamflow records from cr2 and ls were produced by following the proposed method in step v to verify the accuracy and rationality of the omvc model for each month fig 4 illustrates the time series of observed streamflow records and estimation results of cr2 and ls generated from the omvc vc tau and tabts models it should be emphasized that vc tau models for each month were established according to the calibration data set composed of same predictand variable and predictor variables as omvc models for same month tabts model corresponding to cr2 or ls was constructed only based on observed monthly streamflow records in the calibration period from corresponding hydrometric station cr2 or ls in general the estimation results accord with the inter annual variation trend of streamflow records from cr2 and ls but exist deviation to be reckoned from some extreme streamflow records the results indicate that tabts model underestimated the extreme streamflow records from cr2 while omvc and vc tau models produced satisfied estimated series although the estimation results of ls generated from the omvc vc tau and tabts models show varying degrees of deviation from extreme streamflow records the performance of the omvc models are preferable to that of vc tau and tbats models in order to compare the three estimation results more accurately four quantitative metrics rmse mnse mkge and mape of omvc vc tau and tbats models for monthly streamflow estimation of cr2 and ls were evaluated and summarized in table 4 it is clear that the omvc models show improvement upon four quantitative metrics of vc tau and tbats models in both calibration period and validation period more specifically the omvc models for monthly streamflow estimation of cr2 come in better than vc tau and tbats models with about 7 and 29 reduction of rmse 16 19 and 23 28 reduction of mape as well as moderate improvement of mnse and mkge focusing on monthly streamflow estimation of ls the omvc models are also superior to vc tau and tbats models with about 6 and 16 reduction of rmse and mape as well as moderate improvement of mnse and mkge compared with the estimation results generated from vc tau and tbats models the improvement of four quantitative metrics produced by omvc models for monthly streamflow estimation of cr2 is greater than that of ls indicating that the estimation results of cr2 generated from all three types of models are more accurate than those of ls the potential reason for above phenomena can be attributed to the distinctions in hydrology regime and available data length between the ucr basin and myr basin firstly the longer sample data length is helpful in establishing more accurate vine copula model to depict complex and diverse dependence structures among different streamflow series hao and singh 2015 while the time span of observed streamflow records from the ucr basin is significantly longer than that from the myr basin secondly the volatile hydrological situations of the myr inevitably increase the complexity and difficulty of hydrological simulation xu et al 2022 the myr collects streamflow with different monthly distribution and inter annual trend from various tributaries river connected lakes as well as the upper reaches of the yangtze river and withstands continuous heavy rainfall in june and july called plum rain resulting in the runoff process with high magnitude large inter annual variability and more frequent extreme values compared with the myr the ucr shows almost opposite runoff characteristics from the perspective of hydrology regime and data abundance it is more difficult to accurately describe the dependence structures among different streamflow series from the myr basin than that from the ucr basin leading to the distinctions in the accuracy of streamflow estimation of cr2 and ls furthermore analysis of variance anova was implemented based on r environment to detect the significance of the pairwise differences between monthly observed records and corresponding estimated series produced by omvc vc tau and tbats the null hypothesis for anova is that there is no significant difference between the monthly observed records and corresponding estimated series the results of anova show that the performances of the above three models are different specifically for streamflow estimations of cr2 the null hypothesis is rejected when detecting the difference between the monthly observed records and corresponding estimated series produced by vc tau model in december as for the tbats model the rejections of null hypothesis relate to the streamflow estimations in january and december for streamflow estimations of ls the rejections of null hypothesis occur in april and june for vc tau and in january february august and november for tbats model however streamflow estimations of cr2 and ls produced by the omvc model in different months pass the anova test indicating that no significant difference is detected in addition the 95 uncertainty intervals of 1000 realizations for the validation period produced by omvc and vc tau models were compared and presented in fig 5 tbats model was not included in this comparison because the aforementioned analysis had shown that the accuracy of its estimation results was significantly worse than omvc and vc tau models fig 5 shows that omvc and vc tau models can cover the observed streamflow records within the 95 uncertainty intervals however omvc model corresponds to significantly narrower confidence interval than vc tau model indicating that omvc model bring considerable improvements in predictive uncertainty to summarize omvc models still produced satisfied estimation results of streamflow records from cr2 and ls and exhibited improvement upon vc tau and tbats models the results of streamflow series estimation validate the superiority of the omvc models developed by the proposed approach and their feasibility of generating high performance stochastic streamflow series 5 3 verification of stochastic streamflow series following the proposed stochastic streamflow generation approach in step vi 500 groups of stochastic streamflow series for each month with the same length as the observed records were generated based on the omvc models comprehensive inspection and verification were then developed to evaluate the performance of the omvc models in stochastic streamflow generation first of all raincloud plots for comparing overall distribution characteristics between observed records and simulated series relating to cr2 and ls are presented in fig 6 a and b respectively raincloud plot combines randomized jittered data points boxplot and split half violin plot in a complementary fashion and visualizes raw data probability density distribution and key statistics in an intuitive modular and appealing format with minimal redundancy allen et al 2021 it should be noted that randomized jittered data points shown in fig 6 a and b represent observed records while boxplot and split half violin plot describe central tendency and probability density distribution of simulated series respectively it is obvious that the distribution range of monthly simulated series of cr2 and ls cover corresponding monthly observed records meanwhile the observed records and simulated series corresponding to same month share same central tendency the results prove that overall distribution characteristics of observed records and simulated series are consistent furthermore both monthly observed records and simulated series were classified into three flow intervals in terms of their value the three flow intervals entitled monthly high flow monthly median flow and monthly low flow account for 20 60 and 20 of complete data respectively distribution characteristics of different flow intervals were compared and presented in fig 6 c and d the visual comparison indicates that the majority of monthly observed records and simulated series in same flow interval correspond to same distribution range especially for the comparison results of cr2 in fig 6 c monthly observed records and simulated series in each flow interval can keep high identical as for ls several simulated values in the monthly low flow interval underestimate corresponding observed values and a few extreme observed values are beyond the scope of corresponding simulated series in the monthly high flow interval in addition the monthly simulated series of ls seem to be more concentrated than those of cr2 which is embodied in fewer months with mild outliers in the boxplots as shown in fig 6 c and d mild outliers occur in the monthly simulated series of ls in february march june august november and december but they are absent only in the monthly simulated series of cr2 in june this distinction also signifies that the simulated series of ls are too conservative to cover all extreme observed records while the proportion of extreme values in monthly observed series of ls is higher than that of cr2 considering the abundance and distribution characteristics of observed streamflow series from the ucr basin and myr basin used to establish the omvc models these phenomena can be explained that longer sample data and more stable hydrological situations are convinced to facilitate accurate stochastic streamflow simulation after the comparison of distribution characteristics eight types of essential statistical characteristics were further evaluated figs 7 and 8 present boxplots of mean standard deviation s d coefficient of skewness c s r statistic lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient acf 1 lag 2 autocorrelation coefficient acf 2 and lag 2 partial correlation coefficient pacf 2 pertaining to 500 groups of simulated series of cr2 and ls respectively in addition corresponding boxplots of kendall s tau are shown in fig s1 of the supplementary material it should be noted that the boxplots in fig s1 were achieved based on the sequential calculation of kendall s tau between the observed records from a hydrological station regarded as predictor variable and 500 groups of simulated series the same process was used to calculate jmi and then corresponding r statistic was obtained on the basis of equation 4 in accordance with evaluation criterion proposed by hao and singh 2013 the performance of stochastic streamflow generation was judged to be good when a statistic pertaining to observed records fell within the corresponding boxplot of simulated series as the comparison results shown in figs 7 and 8 and fig s1 the majority of observed statistics fall within the corresponding boxplots which indicates that the simulated series can preserve the statistical characteristics of the observed series expect for essential statistical characteristics extreme streamflow characteristics are important for evaluating the performance of stochastic streamflow generation annual maximum and minimum monthly flows and the month in which it occurred pertaining to observed streamflow records and 500 groups stochastic simulation series are compared and presented in fig 9 fig 9 a b present the comparison results of annual maximum and minimum monthly flows relating to cr2 respectively while fig 9 c d show corresponding results relating to ls the results demonstrate that annual maximum and minimum values of monthly observed records and simulated series share same distribution range and corresponding occurrence months also exhibit good consistency the above results verify that omvc model can accurately capture the tail dependence and generate satisfactory stochastic simulation series that reflect extreme streamflow characteristics in summary the performance of stochastic streamflow generation based on the omvc models should be regarded as satisfactory according to the above evaluation and analysis applications of the proposed approach in the ucr basin and myr basin eventually achieve high performance stochastic streamflow generation after selecting the predictor variables and constructing omvc models for each month the generated accurate and extensive stochastic simulation series can preserve essential distribution and statistical characteristics thereby overcoming the disadvantage of limited observed records and thus are instructive in the context of water resources planning and management of the above two basins moreover omvc models constructed by the proposed approach can be supposed to possess good adaptability and robustness considering satisfactory simulation results of monthly streamflow records from two study regions with diverse hydrology regime and available data length due to the scalability and flexibility of the proposed approach more potential predictor variables such as meteorological factors and large scale climate indices can also be incorporated into consideration for stochastic streamflow generation 6 conclusions this study proposed an integrated approach to constructing high dimensional r vine copula model for stochastic streamflow generation considering temporal and spatial dependence among various observed streamflow records r statistic a comprehensive dependence measure was applied as screening index for predictor variables selection and weight factor for vine structure determination r statistic was calculated based on corresponding jmi and jcmi instead of the traditional estimation of mi and cmi which significantly simplified the calculation process and improved the estimation accuracy benefiting from the advantages of r statistic the predictor variables selection algorithm could accurately screen out unnecessary predictor variables by using two predetermined thresholds of r statistic while the vine structure determination strategy could effectively avoid continuous accumulation of uncertainty in the traditional kendall s tau based method and separate the vine copula model construction into two independent parts vine structure determination and bivariate copula selection and estimation the above optimizations can not only construct more accurate r vine copula model to characterize the dependence structure among various variables but also significantly reduce the computational burdens and time consumption so as to proceed accurate streamflow estimation and stochastic simulation the proposed approach was applied in two study regions the ucr basin and myr basin with diverse hydrology regime and available data length the omvc models of observed monthly streamflow series for each month were determined by implementing this integrated approach and the determination process of omvc models also demonstrated that the sensitivity of the r vine copula model constructed by the proposed approach to the number of predictor variables is relatively low when sample data are abundant streamflow estimation and stochastic simulation were then performed and validated sequentially based on the omvc models the estimation results from the omvc vc tau and tabts models were compared visually and quantitatively and the results indicated that omvc models could produce satisfied streamflow estimations of observed records from cr2 and ls and show improvement upon vc tau and tbats models meanwhile stochastic simulation series of cr2 and ls had high accuracy because their distribution and statistical characteristics and extreme streamflow characteristics are consistent with observed streamflow records it is worth mentioning that the performance of both streamflow estimation and stochastic simulation were better for cr2 than for ls due to the significant contribution of longer sample data and more stable hydrological situations to summarize the omvc models still generated satisfied estimation results and simulation series of cr2 and ls certifying that r vine copula model constructed by the proposed approach possesses good adaptability and robustness to streamflow series with diverse characteristics and abundances it should be emphasized that this integrated approach allows to consider observed streamflow series from other basins and at various time scales e g weekly annual and extend to higher dimensions by including more additional predictor variables the proposed approach was used for stochastic streamflow generation as a demonstration in this study but it can also be extended for the estimation and prediction of other hydrometeorological variables e g water level precipitation temperature and wind speed in addition the proposed vine copula model construction approach is expected to implement in context of climate change by drawing on practices of li and babovic 2019a 2019b that is applying empirical copula to reconstruct the dependence between different spatio temporal downscaled global climate model gcm series in multi site context and propose a multisite weather generator the future work will focus on exploring the variation characteristics and response patterns of runoff process under different climatic scenarios to provide a scientific reference for regional water resources planning and

2296,rainfall induced runoff transported plentiful terrestrial dissolved organic carbon doc to downstream waters significantly regulating the biogeochemical cycling of carbon in downstream waters however the dynamics of doc exporting from agricultural catchments in response to different rainfall patterns remain largely unknown this study aimed to understand the effects of rainfall patterns on the runoff doc quantity and quality in a representative agricultural catchment in southwest china six rainfall events producing runoff including three moderate rainfalls two heavy rainfalls and one rainstorm were recorded to investigate the shifts in runoff doc concentration and its quality indicators i e suva254 indicating the aromaticity content c c ratio denoting the proportion of colored substances to uncolored substances and e4 e6 ratio denoting the fulvic acid to humic acid of doc the results showed that doc concentration in runoff discharge was highest in the moderate and heavy rainfalls occurring at the early rainy season while was much lower in the rainstorm exported doc flux reached 1 82 kg hm 2 h 1 in the rainstorm which was 3 95 60 67 times that in the other rainfall events suva254 and c c ratio fluctuated softly during the moderate rainfalls and rainstorm and changed strongly during the heavy rainfall with longest antecedent dry day the moderate and heavy rainfalls with longer antecedent dry day and the rainstorm delivered doc with higher suva254 and c c ratio than the other rainfall events did discharge was positively correlated with doc concentration during rainfall across all rainfall patterns while was negatively correlated with suva254 and c c ratio forward stepwise regression analysis showed that doc flux per hour was only positively linearly correlated with rainfall intensity our results were valuable for understanding the biogeochemical cycling of doc in analogous catchments worldwide keywords carbon cycle rainfall events agricultural catchment optical properties water quality management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic carbon doc is the most active and mobile part of carbon pools in aquatic and terrestrial systems chantigny 2003 hansen et al 2016 it consists of varieties of molecules sizes and structures from simple amino acids and sugars to complex hydrophobic aromatic and humic substances findlay and sinsabaugh 2003 wallage et al 2006 doc plays a key role in regulating nutrients availability metals mobility microbial activities in soils and waters and in interfering with the formation of byproducts and costs during drinking water treatment kalbitz et al 2000 kaplan et al 2006 gücker et al 2016 therefore it is of great significance to understand the dynamic changes of doc from soils to waters in addition regnier et al 2013 estimated that doc flux from soils to inland waters 1 9 1 0 pg c yr 1 was significantly higher than that to terrestrial ecosystems c storage 0 9 pg c yr 1 demonstrating that doc is a vital component of the global carbon cycle although the existence of the estimated value for doc transported from soils to waters strohmeier et al 2013 wise et al 2019 panton et al 2020 the dynamics of doc quantity and quality during lateral transport in response to the influencing factor such as rainfall patterns are much unclear hampering the precise assessment for the biogeochemical cycling of doc from local to global scales in general the quantity and quality of doc collectively impact the biogeochemical processes of doc inamdar et al 2011 hansen et al 2016 therein the doc quantity is usually characterized by the concentration and flux which has been studied extensively strohmeier et al 2013 gücker et al 2016 while the doc quality is dependent on the chemical composition and can be interpreted by the specific uv visible absorbance as the intrinsic spectroscopic features of doc fractions wallage et al 2006 hansen et al 2016 for example the ratio of uv absorbance at 254 nm to doc concentration suva254 indicates the aromatic contents of doc weishaar et al 2003 the ratio of uv absorbance at 400 nm to doc concentration c c ratio denotes the proportion of colored substances to uncolored substances wallage et al 2006 the ratio of uv absorbance at 465 nm to that at 665 nm e4 e6 ratio represents the proportion of fulvic acid to humic acid mao et al 2017 although great efforts have been made to investigate the doc quantity and quality in terrestrial and aquatic systems respectively related researches on their joint dynamics of doc in runoff are still scarce precipitation is the essential driver for the soil doc exporting to downstream water bodies delpla et al 2011 over the past decades many attentions were paid to the characteristics of rainfall induced doc transportation in catchments due to the increasing frequency of extreme rainfalls evans et al 2005 inamdar et al 2011 therein the doc exports during storm events were extensively studied because these events led to explosive increases in runoff and rapid migration of soil doc vidon et al 2008 humbert et al 2015 sánchez murillo et al 2019 found that rainfall water contributed 42 4 98 2 of the total runoff discharge and storm runoff governed 62 2 of the annual doc exports from a 2 6 km2 pristine tropical catchment in costa rica nevertheless jeong et al 2012 found that rainstorm water only contributed 23 of the total discharge and 48 of annual doc export in a small mountainous forest catchment in south korea these inconsistent results suggest a large variability in the magnitude of rainstorm contributions to runoff discharge and doc export besides these studies just simply divided the doc export of the catchments into rainstorm and base flow cases and the doc export in response to different rainfall patterns is still elusive jeong et al 2012 humbert et al 2015 sánchez murillo et al 2019 therefore it is undoubtedly needed to deepen the understanding of the dynamics of doc exports during different rainfall patterns in the catchment scale which will help accurately assess the regional doc budget increasing doc export into the inland waters was observed during the last decades wilson and xenopoulos 2009 numerous studies have studied the doc export characteristics during rainstorms and base flow from the forest and wetland dominated catchments gaelen et al 2014 humbert et al 2020 however similar studies on agricultural catchment are scare indeed agricultural land accounts for approximately 40 of the global land surface and expands intensively to meet the food demands for human growth wilson and xenopoulos 2009 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 the changes in management practices such as tillage and fertilization distinctly alter the quantity and quality of organic matter materials landscape features and hydrological paths of agricultural catchments significantly modifying the accessibility and processing of doc during rainfall events graeber et al 2012 humbert et al 2020 besides the exported doc from upstream soils also largely affects the intrinsic characteristics of doc in downstream waters jaffé et al 2012 hansen et al 2016 hence characterizing the doc dynamics under different rainfall patterns in agricultural catchments is valuable for better understanding the biogeochemical cycling of doc as affected by agricultural activities the objectives of this study are thus to 1 determine the dynamics of the quantity and quality of doc in runoff discharge under different rainfall patterns in the agricultural catchment and 2 identify the correlations between rainfall characteristics and the quantity and quality of doc in runoff 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out at shipanqiu catchment zhong county chongqing municipality southwestern china 108 10 25 e 30 24 53 n fig 1 the study area belongs to the subtropical warm and humid monsoon area with a mean annual temperature of 18 5 c the average annual precipitation is 1 100 mm mainly occurring from may to september the catchment covers an area of 44 05 hm2 with the elevation range from 119 to 780 m above the sea level the catchment directly discharges into the yangtze river through concrete drainage ditches the overlying soils in the study catchment are purple soil corresponding to the regosols in fao taxonomy and entisols in usda taxono lin 2002 cropland is the main land use followed by secondary forest and orchard accounting for 35 46 28 17 and 13 78 of the total area in the catchment respectively the cropland is dominated by the maize zea mays l and oilseed rape brassica campestris l rotations and annual fertilization application are 250 350 kg ha 1 urea and 300 600 kg ha 1 compound fertilizers n p2o5 k2o 15 15 15 the forest is dominated by pinus massoniana lamb hook mixed with cupressus funebris endl quercus fabric hance and cunninghamia lanceolata lamb without fertilization the orchard is planted with citurs reticulate blanco and applied annually 500 900 kg ha 1 compound fertilizers n p2o5 k2o 15 15 15 during the study period from may to september the oilseed rape brassica campestris l was planted in september and harvested in may of the following year the maize zea mays l was planted in may and harvested in the late august fertilizers were applied according to the growth status of crops and citurs reticulate blanco in cropland and orchard 2 2 sample collection and analysis field monitoring of precipitation and runoff was conducted in the rainy season from may to september in 2019 in shipanqiu catchment totally 30 rainfall events occurred and could be grouped into four categories according to the standard meteorological definitions including 6 light rainfalls 0 1 mm in 12 h 4 9 mm in 12 h 13 moderate rainfalls 5 mm in 12 h 14 9 mm in 12 h 6 heavy rainfalls 15 mm in 12 h 29 9 mm in 12 h and 1 rainstorm 30 mm in 12 h 69 9 mm in 12 h among them only 11 rainfall events produced runoff table s1 in addition the precipitation data was missed on june 22 and 28 july 19 and 23 because of the failures of monitoring equipment and the runoff samples on july 8 were also missed light rainfalls recorded didn t generate runoff in the study catchment table s1 therefore six rainfall events were chosen to identify the dynamics of doc in runoff under different rainfall patterns including 3 moderate rainfalls on june 11 9 72 mm in 12 h 17 5 04 mm in 12 h and july 31 5 88 mm in 12 h 2 heavy rainfalls on june 5 17 76 mm in 12 h and august 28 21 96 mm in 12 h 1 rainstorm on august 6 40 08 mm in 12 h table 2 in the study agricultural catchment precipitation was continuously recorded by an automatic siphon rain gauge located in the study catchment basher flume with automatic flow monitor was set up at the outlet of the catchment to record the runoff discharge changes before draining into the yangtze river samples were manually collected at 10 30 min 1 or 2 h intervals at the outlet of the basher flume according to the discharge amount and the sampling frequency increases to 5 minute intervals manually in the rainstorms as the rapidly elevated flow conditions samples were kept in 500 ml clean polyethylene bottles and delivered to the laboratory within 24 h and were filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes and stored at 4 c for subsequent analysis within 72 h doc concentration mg l 1 in runoff was measured by a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu japan jiang et al 2018 the uv vis absorbance at 254 400 465 and 665 nm were measured in a 10 mm quartz cuvette by aqualog horiba japan absorption spectrometer equipped with a 150 w ozone free xenon lamp at a constant temperature of 20 c milli q water was used as the blank several specific uv vis spectral parameters were assessed including suav254 c c and e4 e6 ratios which are widely used to denote the proportions of aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 colored substances wallage et al 2006 and fulvic acid to humic acid mao et al 2017 respectively 2 3 data calculation antecedent dry day add was dry days from the

positively correlated with abs665 and abs254 was significantly negatively correlated with c c ratio suva254 was significantly positively correlated with c c ratio table 4 fsra was adopted to determine the predictors of docper hour of rainfall event when considering the potential multicollinearity among rainfall and runoff characteristics variables and the prediction model was listed as follows 11 doc per h o u r 0 036 0 521 r i n 6 f 8 09 r 2 0 669 p 0 047 where doc per h o u r is doc flux per hour kg hm 2 h 1 ri is rainfall intensity mm h 1 only ri showed positive relationship with docper hour 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of discharge doc concentration and flux under different rainfall patterns doc concentration fluctuated strongest in the rainstorm on august 6 and followed by the heavy rainfall on august 28 of which fm of discharge were both higher this was probably ascribed to the complicated transport processes and various doc sources during the two rainfall events these two rainfall events with higher ri and precipitation could mobilize more distant doc sources than other rainfalls and the doc in runoff continuously exchanged along the transporting path resulting in the stronger fluctuation of doc concentration hosen et al 2018 wise et al 2019 in addition discharge peaked twice during the rainstorm and the highest doc concentration lagged the first peak discharge this was similar to previous studies showing the maximum doc concentration at or after discharge peak inamdar et al 2011 in contrast doc concentration showed no marked increase near the second peak discharge this was likely because the magnitude of increase in discharge at the second peak was much greater than the magnitude of increase in doc inputs in the rainstorm leading to the dilution of doc clark et al 2007 inamdar et al 2011 the peak discharge of the rainstorm was 5 82 45 01 times that of other rainfall events during the sampling periods which increased more strongly than the variations between mean doc concentrations of each rainfall event fig 2a b table 1 the dilution effects may also be responsible for the lower mean doc concentration in the rainstorm compared with that in the heavy and moderate rainfalls docper hour showed no significant difference between the heavy rainfalls and moderate rainfalls the exception was found in the moderate rainfall on june 11 nevertheless docper hour in the rainstorm was remarkably higher and was 3 96 60 67 times that in other rainfall patterns indicating that doc was mainly exported by the rainstorm meanwhile it should also be noted that the moderate rainfall with long rd likely led to high docaccum flux the precipitation ri and docper hour in the moderate rainfall on june 11 was 0 25 times that in the rainstorm though its daccum was only 0 04 times that in the rainstorm the high docper hour with relatively low discharge in the moderate rainfall on june 11 was likely due to the interactive effects of the timing of rainfall event with low add and long rd on the one hand this rainfall event occurred at the beginning of the rainy season before the terrestrial doc materials were frequently flushed and provided abundant doc materials for subsequent rainfall events leading to high doc concentration in runoff on the other hand long rd and low add promoted higher discharge though low rainfall intensity and collectively leading to high doc export gaelen et al 2014 but similar result was not observed in the heavy rainfall on june 5 with higher docm ri and similar timing of rainfall event when comparing with the moderate rainfall on june 11 in addition we found that there was no significant correlation between precipitation rd and add and docper hour these results suggested that the doc export induced by rainfall events was regulated by various factors which requires further interpretation in the near future 4 2 dynamics of doc quality under different rainfall patterns suva254 and c c ratio were both fluctuated softly in the moderate rainfalls on june 11 and 17 the rainstorm on august 6 and the heavy rainfall on june 5 while varied strongly during the heavy rainfall on august 28 the mean suva254 and c c ratio were higher in the moderate rainfall on july 31 and in the rainstorm on august 6 and the heavy rainfall on august 28 this was likely owing to the interactive effects of rainfall characteristics and antecedent soil moisture on doc transporting rainfall with small precipitation and low ri such as the heavy rainfall on june 5 and the moderate rainfalls on june 11 and 17 was only able to flush the doc source left in the drainage system which was highly processed with low suva254 and c c ratio wise et al 2019 while the suva254 in the moderate rainfall on july 31 was higher and fluctuated stronger than those in the other two moderate rainfalls this was likely because the photo degradation in drainage ditches potentially transformed the labile compounds to the higher microbial resistant ones during the longer add on july 31 hansen et al 2016 additionally the intrinsic characteristics of organic matter left in the ditches from previous rainfall events may be also responsible for the results the large precipitation high ri and small add in the rainstorm on august 6 led to higher discharge and hydrologic connectivity resulting in rapidly connecting between the isolated doc sources such as retention ponds low lying regions surface soil litter and other distal terrestrial sources lyon et al 2008 wise et al 2019 these doc sources were mixed up along the hydrologic paths and difficult to distinguish at high discharge which was reflected by the soft fluctuation of suva254 and c c ratio during rainfall event and the high mean suva254 and c c ratio however the doc runoff samples were collected at the discharge recession stage on august 28 and different doc sources were transported by runoff and delayed in drainage systems the low discharge could not fully mix the residues in drainage and heterogeneously transported these substances in the channel leading to high fluctuation of suva254 and c c ratio in addition the long add accelerated the fragmentation of organic matter and the photo degradation effects on doc altered the characters of doc inputting to runoff guarch ribot and butturini 2016 hasen et al 2016 and complicated the dynamics of doc quality during rainfall 4 3 relationships between doc quantity and quality and rainfall characteristics doc concentration was positively correlated with the discharge during various rainfall events which was partially similar with strohmeier et al 2013 who found that doc concentration was positively correlated with the discharge during rainstorm this was probably ascribed to the higher hydrological connectivity of the catchment and transporting capacity of discharge that enhanced the flushing of land landscape and inputs of more distal and various doc sources hosen et al 2018 wise et al 2019 but the positive relationships may be broken due to that the increased magnitude of discharge was much higher than that of doc substances which was also observed by inamdar et al 2011 who reported that doc was diluted with high discharge during the rainstorm in addition discharge was negatively correlated with suva254 and c c ratio during rainfall events under each rainfall pattern however these correlations were positive when all six rainfall events were analyzed together the latter positive relationships were partially consistent with the results of vidon et al 2008 suggesting that doc aromaticity increased during rainstorm with high discharge compared with base flow unfortunately how the doc quality respond to discharge during rainfall events was still unclear more attention should be paid to the responses between doc quality and discharge as well as rainfall characteristics the docper hour was controlled by ri alone in our study and discharge was also positively correlated with ri and docper hour those results were similar to clark et al 2007 who found that the discharge was the decisive factor rather than doc concentration affecting the doc exports during rainfall events and doc flux discharge and rainfall intensity were also closely correlated this suggested that the effective controlling for doc export from terrestrial ecosystems was the reduction in discharge rather than the runoff doc concentration the c c ratio was significantly positively correlated with add this was because that longer add accelerated more terrestrial organic matter fragmentized and accumulated on the landscape surface such as leaves crop residues and litter providing more abundant and movable terrestrial doc materials for runoff guarch ribot and butturini 2016 in addition the wetting up of soil by rainfall after long dry days effectively accelerated the broken up of soil aggregates to be easier eroded defersha and melesse 2012 rewetting effect increased the aromatic content in soils resulting in increases in humic and aromatic substances in runoff patel et al 2021 this result was further supported by the higher suva254 and c c ratio in the moderate rainfall on july 31 and in the heavy rainfall on august 28 with higher add compared with other moderate and heavy rainfall events 4 4 implications the exports of doc from forest catchments are of higher concentration and proportions of aromatic components vink et al 2007 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 hosen et al 2018 however the mean doc concentration 33 85 mg l 1 and suva254 3 51 l mg 1 m 1 in our catchment were much higher than the doc concentration in the river 2 81 mg l 1 average of 5 rainfall events and runoff from forest catchment 9 2 mg l 1 an annual average induced by rainfall events strohmeier et al 2013 kozak et al 2021 this was probably because our runoff samples were collected in summer rainfall events with higher temperature producing the highest doc concentrations and proportions of aromatic components across four seasons bolan et al 2011 inamdar et al 2011 while the mean doc concentration in other studies were mostly calculated by multiple seasons clark et al 2007 the artificial drainage systems offered more effective channels for doc exports in agricultural catchments than in forest catchments resulting in the reduction in doc retention in low lying regions and the exposure time of doc to microbial consumption hansen et al 2016 wise et al 2019 further the intensive erosion in agricultural catchments accelerated the loss of terrestrial doc which is rich in humic and aromatic components kozak et al 2021 begum et al 2022 the intensive anthropogenic activities in agricultural catchments such as tillage and fertilization may lead to highly dynamics of doc exports gücker et al 2016 reported that heightened urbanization and agriculture increased doc exports at the cerrado atlantic rainforest transition therefore more efforts should be made to deepen our understanding of doc dynamics in agricultural catchments and help improving the assessments of doc exports under different rainfall patterns in subtropical area 5 conclusions in this study six rainfall events including three moderate rainfalls two heavy rainfalls and one rainstorm during rainy season were investigated to determine the discharge the concentration and related uv vis variables of doc during rainfall events in an agricultural catchment in southwest china the doc concentration was related to the timing of rainfall event and was higher in the heavy and moderate rainfalls occurring at the earlier period than other rainfalls rainstorm delivered more doc than moderate and heavy rainfalls but the moderate with long runoff producing time and low add may also lead to high doc exports the suva254 and c c ratio varied softly during the moderate rainfalls and rainstorm while fluctuated strongly during the heavy rainfall with higher precipitation and longer add the mean suva254 and c c ratio were higher in the moderate and heavy rainfall with long add and rainstorm than those in other rainfall events the docper hour was only governed by ri which were both significantly positively correlated with discharge discharge was positively correlated with doc quantity and absorbance coefficients during the period of rainfall across all rainfall patterns and was negatively correlated with doc quality variables the findings highlighted the effects of rainfall patterns ri and add on the exporting doc quantity and quality during rainfall events in the agricultural catchment our results are valuable to further understanding the biogeochemical cycling of doc from terrestrial ecosystems drive by the distinct rainfall events and also provide useful

however the dynamics of doc exporting from agricultural catchments in response to different rainfall patterns remain largely unknown this study aimed to understand the effects of rainfall patterns on

and humic substances findlay and sinsabaugh 2003 wallage et al 2006 doc plays a key role in regulating nutrients availability metals mobility microbial activities in soils and waters and in interfering with the formation of byproducts and costs during drinking water treatment kalbitz et al 2000 kaplan et al 2006 gücker et al 2016 therefore it is of great significance to understand the dynamic changes of doc from soils to waters in addition regnier et al 2013 estimated that doc flux from soils to inland waters 1 9 1 0 pg c yr 1 was significantly higher than that to terrestrial ecosystems c storage 0 9 pg c yr 1 demonstrating that doc is a vital component of the global carbon cycle although the existence of the estimated value for doc transported from soils to waters strohmeier et al 2013 wise et al 2019 panton et al 2020 the dynamics of doc quantity and quality during lateral transport in response to the influencing factor such as rainfall patterns are much unclear hampering the precise assessment for the biogeochemical cycling of doc from local to global scales in general the quantity and quality of doc collectively impact the biogeochemical processes of doc inamdar et al 2011 hansen et al 2016 therein the doc quantity is usually characterized by the concentration and flux which has been studied extensively strohmeier et al 2013 gücker et al 2016 while the doc quality is dependent on the chemical composition and can be interpreted by the specific uv visible absorbance as the intrinsic spectroscopic features of doc fractions wallage et al 2006 hansen et al 2016 for example the ratio of uv absorbance at 254 nm to doc concentration suva254 indicates the aromatic contents of doc weishaar et al 2003 the ratio of uv absorbance at 400 nm to doc concentration c c ratio denotes the proportion of colored substances to uncolored substances wallage et al 2006 the ratio of uv absorbance at 465 nm to that at 665 nm e4 e6 ratio represents the proportion of fulvic acid to humic acid mao et al 2017 although great efforts have been made to investigate the doc quantity and quality in terrestrial and aquatic systems respectively related researches on their joint dynamics of doc in runoff are still scarce precipitation is the essential driver for the soil doc exporting to downstream water bodies delpla et al 2011 over the past decades many attentions were paid to the characteristics of rainfall induced doc transportation in catchments due to the increasing frequency of extreme rainfalls evans et al 2005 inamdar et al 2011 therein the doc exports during storm events were extensively studied because these events led to explosive increases in runoff and rapid migration of soil doc vidon et al 2008 humbert et al 2015 sánchez murillo et al 2019 found that rainfall water contributed 42 4 98 2 of the total runoff discharge and storm runoff governed 62 2 of the annual doc exports from a 2 6 km2 pristine tropical catchment in costa rica nevertheless jeong et al 2012 found that rainstorm water only contributed 23 of the total discharge and 48 of annual doc export in a small mountainous forest catchment in south korea these inconsistent results suggest a large variability in the magnitude of rainstorm contributions to runoff discharge and doc export besides these studies just simply divided the doc export of the catchments into rainstorm and base flow cases and the doc export in response to different rainfall patterns is still elusive jeong et al 2012 humbert et al 2015 sánchez murillo et al 2019 therefore it is undoubtedly needed to deepen the understanding of the dynamics of doc exports during different rainfall patterns in the catchment scale which will help accurately assess the regional doc budget increasing doc export into the inland waters was observed during the last decades wilson and xenopoulos 2009 numerous studies have studied the doc export characteristics during rainstorms and base flow from the forest and wetland dominated catchments gaelen et al 2014 humbert et al 2020 however similar studies on agricultural catchment are scare indeed agricultural land accounts for approximately 40 of the global land surface and expands intensively to meet the food demands for human growth wilson and xenopoulos 2009 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 the changes in management practices such as tillage and fertilization distinctly alter the quantity and quality of organic matter materials landscape features and hydrological paths of agricultural catchments significantly modifying the accessibility and processing of doc during rainfall events graeber et al 2012 humbert et al 2020 besides the exported doc from upstream soils also largely affects the intrinsic characteristics of doc in downstream waters jaffé et al 2012 hansen et al 2016 hence characterizing the doc dynamics under different rainfall patterns in agricultural catchments is valuable for better understanding the biogeochemical cycling of doc as affected by agricultural activities the objectives of this study are thus to 1 determine the dynamics of the quantity and quality of doc in runoff discharge under different rainfall patterns in the agricultural catchment and 2 identify the correlations between rainfall characteristics and the quantity and quality of doc in runoff 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out at shipanqiu catchment zhong county chongqing municipality southwestern china 108 10 25 e 30 24 53 n fig 1 the study area belongs to the subtropical warm and humid monsoon area with a mean annual temperature of 18 5 c the average annual precipitation is 1 100 mm mainly occurring from may to september the catchment covers an area of 44 05 hm2 with the elevation range from 119 to 780 m above the sea level the catchment directly discharges into the yangtze river through concrete drainage ditches the overlying soils in the study catchment are purple soil corresponding to the regosols in fao taxonomy and entisols in usda taxono lin 2002 cropland is the main land use followed by secondary forest and orchard accounting for 35 46 28 17 and 13 78 of the total area in the catchment respectively the cropland is dominated by the maize zea mays l and oilseed rape brassica campestris l rotations and annual fertilization application are 250 350 kg ha 1 urea and 300 600 kg ha 1 compound fertilizers n p2o5 k2o 15 15 15 the forest is dominated by pinus massoniana lamb hook mixed with cupressus funebris endl quercus fabric hance and cunninghamia lanceolata lamb without fertilization the orchard is planted with citurs reticulate blanco and applied annually 500 900 kg ha 1 compound fertilizers n p2o5 k2o 15 15 15 during the study period from may to september the oilseed rape brassica campestris l was planted in september and harvested in may of the following year the maize zea mays l was planted in may and harvested in the late august fertilizers were applied according to the growth status of crops and citurs reticulate blanco in cropland and orchard 2 2 sample collection and analysis field monitoring of precipitation and runoff was conducted in the rainy season from may to september in 2019 in shipanqiu catchment totally 30 rainfall events occurred and could be grouped into four categories according to the standard meteorological definitions including 6 light rainfalls 0 1 mm in 12 h 4 9 mm in 12 h 13 moderate rainfalls 5 mm in 12 h 14 9 mm in 12 h 6 heavy rainfalls 15 mm in 12 h 29 9 mm in 12 h and 1 rainstorm 30 mm in 12 h 69 9 mm in 12 h among them only 11 rainfall events produced runoff table s1 in addition the precipitation data was missed on june 22 and 28 july 19 and 23 because of the failures of monitoring equipment and the runoff samples on july 8 were also missed light rainfalls recorded didn t generate runoff in the study catchment table s1 therefore six rainfall events were chosen to identify the dynamics of doc in runoff under different rainfall patterns including 3 moderate rainfalls on june 11 9 72 mm in 12 h 17 5 04 mm in 12 h and july 31 5 88 mm in 12 h 2 heavy rainfalls on june 5 17 76 mm in 12 h and august 28 21 96 mm in 12 h 1 rainstorm on august 6 40 08 mm in 12 h table 2 in the study agricultural catchment precipitation was continuously recorded by an automatic siphon rain gauge located in the study catchment basher flume with automatic flow monitor was set up at the outlet of the catchment to record the runoff discharge changes before draining into the yangtze river samples were manually collected at 10 30 min 1 or 2 h intervals at the outlet of the basher flume according to the discharge amount and the sampling frequency increases to 5 minute intervals manually in the rainstorms as the rapidly elevated flow conditions samples were kept in 500 ml clean polyethylene bottles and delivered to the laboratory within 24 h and were filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes and stored at 4 c for subsequent analysis within 72 h doc concentration mg l 1 in runoff was measured by a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu japan jiang et al 2018 the uv vis absorbance at 254 400 465 and 665 nm were measured in a 10 mm quartz cuvette by aqualog horiba japan absorption spectrometer equipped with a 150 w ozone free xenon lamp at a constant temperature of 20 c milli q water was used as the blank several specific uv vis spectral parameters were assessed including suav254 c c and e4 e6 ratios which are widely used to denote the proportions of aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 colored substances wallage et al 2006 and fulvic acid to humic acid mao et al 2017 respectively 2 3 data calculation antecedent dry day add was dry days from the

the moderate and heavy rainfalls table s2 the interrelationships among ri dm daccum docaccum flux and docper hour were significantly positive table 4 c c ratio was significantly positively correlated

positively correlated with abs665 and abs254 was significantly negatively correlated with c c ratio suva254 was significantly positively correlated with c c ratio table 4 fsra was adopted to determine the predictors of docper hour of rainfall event when considering the potential multicollinearity among rainfall and runoff characteristics variables and the prediction model was listed as follows 11 doc per h o u r 0 036 0 521 r i n 6 f 8 09 r 2 0 669 p 0 047 where doc per h o u r is doc flux per hour kg hm 2 h 1 ri is rainfall intensity mm h 1 only ri showed positive relationship with docper hour 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of discharge doc concentration and flux under different rainfall patterns doc concentration fluctuated strongest in the rainstorm on august 6 and followed by the heavy rainfall on august 28 of which fm of discharge were both higher this was probably ascribed to the complicated transport processes and various doc sources during the two rainfall events these two rainfall events with higher ri and precipitation could mobilize more distant doc sources than other rainfalls and the doc in runoff continuously exchanged along the transporting path resulting in the stronger fluctuation of doc concentration hosen et al 2018 wise et al 2019 in addition discharge peaked twice during the rainstorm and the highest doc concentration lagged the first peak discharge this was similar to previous studies showing the maximum doc concentration at or after discharge peak inamdar et al 2011 in contrast doc concentration showed no marked increase near the second peak discharge this was likely because the magnitude of increase in discharge at the second peak was much greater than the magnitude of increase in doc inputs in the rainstorm leading to the dilution of doc clark et al 2007 inamdar et al 2011 the peak discharge of the rainstorm was 5 82 45 01 times that of other rainfall events during the sampling periods which increased more strongly than the variations between mean doc concentrations of each rainfall event fig 2a b table 1 the dilution effects may also be responsible for the lower mean doc concentration in the rainstorm compared with that in the heavy and moderate rainfalls docper hour showed no significant difference between the heavy rainfalls and moderate rainfalls the exception was found in the moderate rainfall on june 11 nevertheless docper hour in the rainstorm was remarkably higher and was 3 96 60 67 times that in other rainfall patterns indicating that doc was mainly exported by the rainstorm meanwhile it should also be noted that the moderate rainfall with long rd likely led to high docaccum flux the precipitation ri and docper hour in the moderate rainfall on june 11 was 0 25 times that in the rainstorm though its daccum was only 0 04 times that in the rainstorm the high docper hour with relatively low discharge in the moderate rainfall on june 11 was likely due to the interactive effects of the timing of rainfall event with low add and long rd on the one hand this rainfall event occurred at the beginning of the rainy season before the terrestrial doc materials were frequently flushed and provided abundant doc materials for subsequent rainfall events leading to high doc concentration in runoff on the other hand long rd and low add promoted higher discharge though low rainfall intensity and collectively leading to high doc export gaelen et al 2014 but similar result was not observed in the heavy rainfall on june 5 with higher docm ri and similar timing of rainfall event when comparing with the moderate rainfall on june 11 in addition we found that there was no significant correlation between precipitation rd and add and docper hour these results suggested that the doc export induced by rainfall events was regulated by various factors which requires further interpretation in the near future 4 2 dynamics of doc quality under different rainfall patterns suva254 and c c ratio were both fluctuated softly in the moderate rainfalls on june 11 and 17 the rainstorm on august 6 and the heavy rainfall on june 5 while varied strongly during the heavy rainfall on august 28 the mean suva254 and c c ratio were higher in the moderate rainfall on july 31 and in the rainstorm on august 6 and the heavy rainfall on august 28 this was likely owing to the interactive effects of rainfall characteristics and antecedent soil moisture on doc transporting rainfall with small precipitation and low ri such as the heavy rainfall on june 5 and the moderate rainfalls on june 11 and 17 was only able to flush the doc source left in the drainage system which was highly processed with low suva254 and c c ratio wise et al 2019 while the suva254 in the moderate rainfall on july 31 was higher and fluctuated stronger than those in the other two moderate rainfalls this was likely because the photo degradation in drainage ditches potentially transformed the labile compounds to the higher microbial resistant ones during the longer add on july 31 hansen et al 2016 additionally the intrinsic characteristics of organic matter left in the ditches from previous rainfall events may be also responsible for the results the large precipitation high ri and small add in the rainstorm on august 6 led to higher discharge and hydrologic connectivity resulting in rapidly connecting between the isolated doc sources such as retention ponds low lying regions surface soil litter and other distal terrestrial sources lyon et al 2008 wise et al 2019 these doc sources were mixed up along the hydrologic paths and difficult to distinguish at high discharge which was reflected by the soft fluctuation of suva254 and c c ratio during rainfall event and the high mean suva254 and c c ratio however the doc runoff samples were collected at the discharge recession stage on august 28 and different doc sources were transported by runoff and delayed in drainage systems the low discharge could not fully mix the residues in drainage and heterogeneously transported these substances in the channel leading to high fluctuation of suva254 and c c ratio in addition the long add accelerated the fragmentation of organic matter and the photo degradation effects on doc altered the characters of doc inputting to runoff guarch ribot and butturini 2016 hasen et al 2016 and complicated the dynamics of doc quality during rainfall 4 3 relationships between doc quantity and quality and rainfall characteristics doc concentration was positively correlated with the discharge during various rainfall events which was partially similar with strohmeier et al 2013 who found that doc concentration was positively correlated with the discharge during rainstorm this was probably ascribed to the higher hydrological connectivity of the catchment and transporting capacity of discharge that enhanced the flushing of land landscape and inputs of more distal and various doc sources hosen et al 2018 wise et al 2019 but the positive relationships may be broken due to that the increased magnitude of discharge was much higher than that of doc substances which was also observed by inamdar et al 2011 who reported that doc was diluted with high discharge during the rainstorm in addition discharge was negatively correlated with suva254 and c c ratio during rainfall events under each rainfall pattern however these correlations were positive when all six rainfall events were analyzed together the latter positive relationships were partially consistent with the results of vidon et al 2008 suggesting that doc aromaticity increased during rainstorm with high discharge compared with base flow unfortunately how the doc quality respond to discharge during rainfall events was still unclear more attention should be paid to the responses between doc quality and discharge as well as rainfall characteristics the docper hour was controlled by ri alone in our study and discharge was also positively correlated with ri and docper hour those results were similar to clark et al 2007 who found that the discharge was the decisive factor rather than doc concentration affecting the doc exports during rainfall events and doc flux discharge and rainfall intensity were also closely correlated this suggested that the effective controlling for doc export from terrestrial ecosystems was the reduction in discharge rather than the runoff doc concentration the c c ratio was significantly positively correlated with add this was because that longer add accelerated more terrestrial organic matter fragmentized and accumulated on the landscape surface such as leaves crop residues and litter providing more abundant and movable terrestrial doc materials for runoff guarch ribot and butturini 2016 in addition the wetting up of soil by rainfall after long dry days effectively accelerated the broken up of soil aggregates to be easier eroded defersha and melesse 2012 rewetting effect increased the aromatic content in soils resulting in increases in humic and aromatic substances in runoff patel et al 2021 this result was further supported by the higher suva254 and c c ratio in the moderate rainfall on july 31 and in the heavy rainfall on august 28 with higher add compared with other moderate and heavy rainfall events 4 4 implications the exports of doc from forest catchments are of higher concentration and proportions of aromatic components vink et al 2007 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 hosen et al 2018 however the mean doc concentration 33 85 mg l 1 and suva254 3 51 l mg 1 m 1 in our catchment were much higher than the doc concentration in the river 2 81 mg l 1 average of 5 rainfall events and runoff from forest catchment 9 2 mg l 1 an annual average induced by rainfall events strohmeier et al 2013 kozak et al 2021 this was probably because our runoff samples were collected in summer rainfall events with higher temperature producing the highest doc concentrations and proportions of aromatic components across four seasons bolan et al 2011 inamdar et al 2011 while the mean doc concentration in other studies were mostly calculated by multiple seasons clark et al 2007 the artificial drainage systems offered more effective channels for doc exports in agricultural catchments than in forest catchments resulting in the reduction in doc retention in low lying regions and the exposure time of doc to microbial consumption hansen et al 2016 wise et al 2019 further the intensive erosion in agricultural catchments accelerated the loss of terrestrial doc which is rich in humic and aromatic components kozak et al 2021 begum et al 2022 the intensive anthropogenic activities in agricultural catchments such as tillage and fertilization may lead to highly dynamics of doc exports gücker et al 2016 reported that heightened urbanization and agriculture increased doc exports at the cerrado atlantic rainforest transition therefore more efforts should be made to deepen our understanding of doc dynamics in agricultural catchments and help improving the assessments of doc exports under different rainfall patterns in subtropical area 5 conclusions in this study six rainfall events including three moderate rainfalls two heavy rainfalls and one rainstorm during rainy season were investigated to determine the discharge the concentration and related uv vis variables of doc during rainfall events in an agricultural catchment in southwest china the doc concentration was related to the timing of rainfall event and was higher in the heavy and moderate rainfalls occurring at the earlier period than other rainfalls rainstorm delivered more doc than moderate and heavy rainfalls but the moderate with long runoff producing time and low add may also lead to high doc exports the suva254 and c c ratio varied softly during the moderate rainfalls and rainstorm while fluctuated strongly during the heavy rainfall with higher precipitation and longer add the mean suva254 and c c ratio were higher in the moderate and heavy rainfall with long add and rainstorm than those in other rainfall events the docper hour was only governed by ri which were both significantly positively correlated with discharge discharge was positively correlated with doc quantity and absorbance coefficients during the period of rainfall across all rainfall patterns and was negatively correlated with doc quality variables the findings highlighted the effects of rainfall patterns ri and add on the exporting doc quantity and quality during rainfall events in the agricultural catchment our results are valuable to further understanding the biogeochemical cycling of doc from terrestrial ecosystems drive by the distinct rainfall events and also provide useful

characterize hydrology and provide insight into ecological functioning a multispectral approach is highly cost effective and well suited to remote intermittent rivers with little or no gauging infrastructure here we develop an algorithm to extract hydrological attributes i e pool area length perimeter and mean width from multispectral imagery sentinel 2 and use these attributes to create a suite of ecologically relevant hydrological metrics we describechanges in attributes and metrics in a large lowland intermittent river as it transitions from wet to dry over a four year period we also describe temporal changes in attributes and metrics among five river sections with contrasting hydrological persistence and fragmentation our algorithm successfully identified surface water in the main channel and the adjacent floodplain the centerline of pools and their upstream and downstream ends metrics proved effective at describing seasonal patterns in hydrology revealing how the size complexity and elongation of surface water features e g pools decreased as the study river transitioned from wet to dry and how fragmentation increased metrics also successfully differentiated the river sections with varied hydrological persistence ecohydrological metrics derived from multispectral imagery have the potential to provide meaningful insights into riverine morphology resilience and ecological functioning our spatial approach represents a significant advancement in the ability to characterize and manage intermittent rivers which are increasingly threatened by water resource development and a drying climate keywords hydrological metrics remote sensing river management ecohydrology intermittent rivers northern australia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction intermittent streams and rivers characterized by periods of no flow account for at least half of the length of all the world s rivers datry et al 2017 messager et al 2021 they are becoming increasingly widespread due to water resource development and climate change in regions with drier climate trends smettem et al 2013 intermittent rivers sustain unique biodiversity and provide a range of goods and services that people depend on acuña et al 2014 boulton 2014 datry et al 2014 in recognition of their importance and the threats they face intermittent rivers are receiving greater attention blackman et al 2021 chiu et al 2017 datry et al 2017 koundouri et al 2017 larkin et al 2020 even though they have been historically under represented in the hydrologic literature shanafield et al 2021 accurately describing the hydrology of intermittent rivers is a critical step in improving our understanding and management of these systems as it allows us to characterize their natural state assess impacts and monitor recovery however describing the hydrology of intermittent rivers is often not straightforward traditional approaches such as using gauged discharge data provide little information once flow ceases and no insight into the location morphology or resilience of river pools moreover this type of approach is costly as it requires field maintenance consequently many large rivers in remote and dryland regions have sparse or no hydrological gauging data callow and boggs 2013 hydrologic and hydrodynamic models generated from digital elevation models dems are an alternative method to characterize flood extent and other river characteristics but they also have limitations for instance hydrologic and hydrodynamic models are dependent on dem spatial resolution and are particularly sensitive to dem accuracy in dryland landscapes callow et al 2007 callow and smettem 2009 highly accurate dems are also rarely available in remote dryland river basins due to the high costs of producing them also they often need extra correction and processing steps to better represent the known hydrology jarihani et al 2015 despite these limitations gauged discharge data or hydrologic models are still the primary means for the ecohydrological characterization and classification of rivers including intermittent rivers bond and kennard 2017 d ambrosio et al 2017 kennard et al 2010 olden et al 2012 richter et al 1996 multispectral imagery can provide a different perspective on the hydrology of intermittent rivers and has the potential to overcome some of the limitations of gauging data or hydrologic models due to their high frequency temporal and spatial continuity and lower costs multispectral images can be analyzed to generate attributes for surface water e g pool area length perimeter along the length of a river or for specific sections within a river which can then be used to derive metrics e g pool complexity pool size that provide insight into ecological functioning while this is yet to be done in intermittent rivers metrics derived from this type of imagery have been used in terrestrial environments to quantify landscape structure and change crowley and cardille 2020 hermosilla et al 2019 mcgarigal and marks 1995 olariu et al 2022 and to describe the morphology of catchments beven et al 1988 frasson et al 2019 some of these metrics have the potential to be adapted and transferred to intermittent river systems to better understand their ecohydrological characteristics for instance metrics based on the size and shape of surface water features could be used to describe the amount and location of macro e g main channel floodplain and mesohabitats pool runs riffles they can also provide an insight into the littoral zone extent a zone with important ecological importance roach et al 2014 winfield 2004 yuan et al 2013 metrics based on morphology could also provide an insight into sedimentation erosion and infiltration rates gitz et al 2015 reddy et al 2004 and those based on the persistence of surface water through time could be used to identify ecological refuge locations and provide insights into surface water and groundwater dynamics sims et al 2016 lastly metrics based on surface water connectivity could provide an insight into the downstream transport of physical and biological particles river fragmentation and the potential for organism dispersal pringle 2010 pringle 2001 ward et al 2002 thus ecohydrological metrics derived from multispectral images offer much promise as a cost effective way to generate information that can support the management and protection of intermittent river systems the broad aim of this study was to generate novel hydrological metrics derived from multispectral imagery obtained from sentinel 2a and 2b satellites that have the potential to provide an insight into the ecology of intermittent rivers we had four specific aims 1 develop an algorithm to extract hydrological attributes e g area length perimeter and mean width about surface water from multispectral imagery 2 use these attributes to create a suite of ecologically relevant hydrological metrics 3 describe changes in attributes and metrics in a river system as it transitioned from wet to dry and 4 describe seasonal variation in each attribute and metric within river sections with contrasting hydrological persistence and fragmentation characterizing intermittent rivers using this approach can support the management and protection of semi arid environments facing increasing pressures from development and climate change and provide an insight into the benefits of an optical remotely sensed approach compared to conventional gauged discharge data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and design the study was undertaken in the fitzroy river located in the semi arid kimberley region of western australia fig 1 it has a catchment area of approximately 94 000 km2 and a length of 733 km harrington et al 2011 petheram et al 2018 the fitzroy catchment exhibits distinct hydrological seasonality experiencing extreme flood flows during wet times of the year november april with 87 of the runoff occurring between january and march before drying to loosely interconnected pools in the dry period may october beesley et al 2021 charles et al 2016 petheram et al 2018 there is extreme spatial and temporal variation in water extent with the maintenance of hydrological connectivity constrained by the strong seasonal climate variation and the influence of groundwater discharge zones taylor et al 2018 the water sustaining persistent pools comes either from groundwater discharging from the local alluvial aquifers associated with the river s floodplain or the regional groundwater associated with sedimentary sandstones of the grant group and poole sandstone harrington et al 2011 harrington and harrington 2015 taylor et al 2018 rainfall in a hydrological year nov oct is highly variable for instance in the last three hydrological years 2019 2021 the catchment experienced the lowest 348 mm 2019 and second highest total rainfall 854 mm 2021 measured over the last 19 years 2003 2022 for the average of the two closest rain stations noonkanbah and looma fig 1 this variable rainfall manifest in highly divergent stream discharge over the study period for two gauging stations noonkanbah and looma department of water and environmental regulations water information reporting system the main channel of the fitzroy river was visually defined and manually vectorized using arcgis pro 3 0 and esri base maps the area of interest was defined as a 250 m wide buffer on each side of the manually vectorized drainage line five river sections were chosen along the lowland stretch of the river between the confluence with the cunningham anabranch to approximately 100 km upstream of the estuary fig 1 we chose to perform our study on five representative sections rather than the entire river to make our study more tractable our five focal sections had approximately the same surface area 5 1 km2 and spanned the same length of the main channel river 10 2 km our focal sections spanned a hydrological continuum from persistent high likelihood of groundwater discharge reaches to intermittent low likelihood of groundwater discharge reaches allowing us to evaluate the ability of our metrics to differentiate a hydrological persistence gradient the 10 2 km length was somewhat arbitrarily chosen but we considered it suitable for our aim as it was large enough to confidently characterize a river section s hydrology but was not so large that it spanned regions with very different water persistence conditions river sections were broadly classified as 1 low persistence very fragmented with very little or no water at the end of the dry season 2 low persistence very fragmented with some water at the end of the dry season 3 intermediate persistence fragmented but with refuge pools containing water at the end of the dry season 4 high persistence low fragmentation with refuge pools and a considerable extent of water at the end of the dry season and 5 very high persistence low fragmentation with a considerable extent of refuge pools and water at the end of the dry season our classification was based on a thorough visual inspection of fortnightly remotely sensed multispectral imagery sentinel 2 captured in a particularly dry year 2019 a long term study of pool persistence using landsat sims et al 2016 and knowledge of the hydrology of the river as reported by harrington et al 2011 harrington and harrington 2016 harrington and harrington 2015 sims et al 2016 and taylor et al 2018 2 2 image datasets sentinel 2 multispectral surface reflectance nbart images nadir brdf adjusted reflectance terrain illumination correction downloaded from the digital earth australia dea database http www ga gov au dea accessed

line 2 3 defining and deriving metrics extracted from multispectral imagery to characterize intermittent rivers 2 3 1 method workflow the study workflow was divided into three parts extracting attributes deriving metrics and describing and evaluating attributes and derived metrics the first part extracted hydrological attributes at pool level from multispectral imagery in sixteen steps fig 2 and fig 3 the second part used the extracted attributes to calculate the developed metrics section 2 3 4 for the focal river sections the third part described and evaluated hydrological attributes and derived metrics changes as the river system transitioned from wet to dry seasons section 2 3 5 2 3 2 identifying water a preliminary step prior to metric generation was to map surface water extent step 1 this was done using the water detect algorithm cordeiro et al 2021 with sentinel 2 images 10 m b blue g green r red nir near infrared and adopting the input parameter values proposed for this catchment by tayer et al 2023 i e maximum clustering 6 regularization 0 07 the water detect algorithm was executed for every image see section 2 2 and the results were clipped to the area of interest 250 m buffer on each side of the drainage line the output of water detect is a binary array with values of one for water pixels and zero for non water pixels minus one represents no data values as the focus of this paper was to capture seasonal patterns especially the contraction of surface water during the dry season the clipped water mask time series was concatenated and reduced into two composites per month 15 day composites in a single data array dask development team 2016 hoyer and hamman 2017 where the maximum pixel value was taken for conflicting values i e overlapping values within a composite of the resulting 112 composite images only two had cloud coverage above 60 and 88 composites were below 5 the water mask binary array was checked for missing values in each layer of the time series since no data values such as cloud and shadow masks can influence water extent estimation falsely breaking river connectivity and causing potential misinterpretation of parameter values the missing values were populated using the following conditions step 2 a the no data value was filled with the first next valid observation or the second if the next immediate value was also missing i e backward fill b if the value was in the last position of the time series or c if the backward filling was unable to fill missing values we used a forward fill propagating up to two observations before the missing value if none of these conditions were satisfied the missing value remained unchanged as no data 2 3 3 extracting hydrological attributes after successfully mapping surface water features and addressing missing values for the entire time series we extracted attributes of interest i e pool area pool length pool mean width pool perimeter and number of pools to be used as input variables for the proposed metrics here we use the term pool to refer to a continuous area of surface water thus it may represent a range of geomorphic features including pools runs glides and riffles at each layer pixel connected regions were aggregated into unique groups using the scikit image morphology module label function van der walt et al 2014 step 3 this tool considers that two pixels are connected when they have the same value and are neighbors in any direction lateral vertical or diagonal van der walt et al 2014 hence each central pixel can potentially be connected with a maximum of eight neighboring pixels after labeling connected regions the attributes pool area pool perimeter and number of pools were retrieved for each unique group i e pool using rasterio s feature shape tool where the number of pools corresponded to the total number of unique groups step 4 to extract pool length we first applied the scikit image morphology module skeletonize function step 5 which reduces a binary image e g water non water to one pixel wide representations lee et al 1994 the resulting image is presented in the most simplified way without breaking connectivity and shape in our case representing the river centerline or streamline for each pool however the skeletonized output is not always represented by a unique line and can produce features with several connected nodes to confine the skeletonized feature to the longest segment possible i e pool length we applied the scikit image measure module label function to the skeletonized image meaning that each connected river centerline segment was given a unique identifier step 6 we then proceeded to find the start and endpoints or the most distant points for each centerline we used opencv s bradski 2000 built in filter2d convolution function to apply a custom matrix kernel k to the skeletonized image step 7 convolution filtering is a common technique for altering an image based on pixel neighbors adding each element to its local neighbors weighted by a kernel examples of convolution filtering include smoothing sharpening blurring and edge detection here we used the following 3x3 custom kernel k 1 1 1 1 10 1 1 1 1 considering that we applied the kernel k to a binary water mask water 1 and non water 0 the maximum possible value of a pixel after the convolution is 18 if a water pixel is surrounded by eight other water pixels the minimum is zero if a non water pixel is surrounded by eight non water pixels we observed the most common cases for start and endpoints pixels in the skeletonized image with a water pixel had one or three neighboring water pixels hence with a pixel value after convolution of 11 or 13 respectively step 8 with each unique pool s potential start endpoints we calculated all possible combinations of start and endpoint and the euclidean distance between these pairs of points step 9 we then selected the most distant five pairs to calculate the distance between each pair using the river centerline as the path step 10 we used the scikit image graph module mpc geometric which finds the least cost path from two points through a given cost array van der walt et al 2014 step 11 to ensure that the river path i e skeletonized water pixels was the only possible path between each start endpoint we set all non water pixels to 1 no data keeping the analysis within the skeletonized pixels the most distant path between the selected start endpoint pairs was selected as the final segment i e pool length step 12 mean pool width was estimated using scipy s euclidean distance transform tool virtanen et al 2020 with the water mask as input step 13 the tool receives as input a binary image and outputs a distance array i e an array with the same dimensions as the input image but where each pixel contains the euclidean distance to the closest border non water pixel we intersected the pool length segment step 12 with the distance array to extract the distance values from the pool centerline to the nearest border and multiplied these values by two to cover both sides of the river or the total wetted width from each centerline pixel step 14 finally for each unique pool we averaged the centerline pixel values step 15 to calculate the mean pool width step 16 the hydrological attributes extraction process was automated see data availability statement and the results of some attributes such as pool area and perimeter were compared to the values calculated in arcgis using the calculate geometry tool we also performed a qualitative analysis for pool endpoints and length by exploratory visual interpretation 2 3 4 defining and deriving ecohydrological metrics using the extracted attributes above we derived 11 ecohydrological metrics to describe river characteristics and assess differences between river sections the metrics were separated into two distinct categories that reflect surface water morphology table 1 and hydrological resilience table 2 the resulting extracted attributes i e pool area pool perimeter pool length mean pool width and number of pools from section 2 3 2 were used as inputs to derive the developed metrics the source line of code for the time series water identification attribute extraction and metrics calculation is available on github for community editing and improvement via collaboration see data availability statement morphological metrics quantitatively described pool shape i e geometry and size and were represented by five metrics the area weighted mean shape index area weighted elongation ratio area weighted mean pool area area weighted mean pool length and area weighted mean pool width all metrics were weighted by area effectively meaning that large pools within a river section exerted more influence on the metric than small pools resilience describes the capacity of a system to recover after disturbance i e drying and was represented by six metrics pixel persistence refuge area wetted area percentage of section wetted length percentage of section pool fragmentation and pool longitudinal fragmentation pixel persistence refuge area and wetted area percentage of section describe the amount of water within a section hence are relevant to water persistence and hydrologic refugia the wetted length percentage of section is the ratio between the sum of pool length within a section and section wetted length while theoretically values of this metric should not exceed 100 in reality they can because while the section line length is fixed the cumulative length of pools within the channel and in the floodplain within the buffer polygon can exceed this number for instance during the wet season river pools may extend into adjacent floodplain creeks alternatively early in the dry season multiple pools may exist side by side inside the main channel i e the river channel is braided or contains anabranches pool fragmentation and pool longitudinal fragmentation are indicators of river fragmentation and are relevant to hydrological connectivity 2 3 5 describing and evaluating hydrological attributes and derived metrics to visualize and understand patterns in attributes and metrics as the river system transitions from wet to dry we fitted polynomial lines to our data for any given attribute or metric y we created a regression model that predicted y given the day of the year day the global equation of the model is shown in eq 1 where day refers to the two composite samples per month n 24 per year polynomial terms were included for day i e dayx in recognition that metrics may display complex non linear behavior through time 1 m e t r i c y i n t e r c e p t d a y day 2 day 3 day 4 day 6 we fit linear models containing polynomial terms up to the 6th order using the ordinary least squares ols function in the package statsmodels seabold and perktold 2010 using a total of 478 observations for each model this resulted in six models of increasing complexity with increasing polynomial terms we used model selection to identify the model with best predictive capacity as we recognized that high level polynomial terms may lead to overfitting i e describing residual noise as opposed to true variation support for polynomial terms included in the global model were assessed by comparing model subsets using the akaike information criteria aic aic scores provide a measure of relative model support by trading off model fit model likelihood with model complexity i e number of parameters burnham and anderson 2004 we model averaged parameters across all competing models with δaic 4 0 as per burnham and anderson 2004 to produce the final model used for prediction see supplement for aic scores and δaic values note that δaic is the difference of the aic score of each model from the best model e g δaic of the best model is 0 the same approach was used to describe seasonal changes among river sections to explore the benefits of using metrics generated from imagery as opposed to a conventional gauged approach we visually compared attribute and metric seasonal curves with rainfall and discharge graphs generated from two gauging stations noonkanbah and looma it is important to highlight that pixel persistence and refuge area could not be analyzed using the approaches mentioned for the other metrics because these two metrics cannot be divided into time steps i e their value is created from a temporal reduction still we analyzed the differences in these metrics between sections note that the pixel persistence value used to describe any given river section was determined using the average value for the section and the value for refuge area was based on the total area within a section furthermore pixel persistence data were filtered and all values 25 discarded so that very low water observations and soils did not bias the metric mean 3 results 3 1 hydrological attributes the developed algorithm readily identified surface water in the main channel and the adjacent floodplain as well as the centerline of pools and their upstream and downstream ends fig 4 importantly the algorithm generated values for pool area and perimeter that were the same as those calculated in arcgis 3 0 the algorithm s ability to identify pool length and endpoints also showed promising results upon visual inspection 3 2 attributes and metrics during drying and wetting phases when combined across the five river sections both attributes and metrics displayed considerable variation within a year suggesting they were able to depict seasonal hydrologic patterns in the study area during the wet season there was a strong increase in pool total wetted area perimeter and length fig 5 a c changes in these attributes translated into a strong increase for metrics related to pool size fig 5g i pool shape complexity fig 5e as well as metrics that described the percent coverage of water across a river section fig 5k and l the wet season created a strong decrease in metrics that described surface water fragmentation fig 5l and m and pool elongation fig 5f note smaller values represent more elongated pools for the area weighted elongation ratio metric during the dry season the opposite patterns were observed with pools becoming smaller less complex and covering a smaller percent of the river section fig 5e g j metrics describing pool length fig 5h and k declined more gently than those related to area or width fig 5g i indicating that as the fitzroy river dried pools became narrower before they became shorter as drying progressed pools became increasingly circular fig 5f as well as more fragmented fig 5l and m seasonal trends in attributes metrics also identified the timing of peak changes in hydrology occurred in the fitzroy river peak changes occurred during the middle end of the wet season and the end of the dry beginning of the wet season as indicated by attributes and metrics displaying local maxima or minima at these times fig 5 the rapid change during the middle to the end of the wet season reflected the transition of a river in flood with high connectivity to a non flood state the other period of rapid change during the end of the dry beginning of the wet season presented the transition of the river from a series of shrinking pools in a fragmented channel back to a flooded connected state and translated into the opposite pattern for the attributes and metrics one attribute the number of pools displayed a complex seasonal pattern and is worthy of additional attention this attribute showed three local maxima between mid to late wet and the mid dry early wet season and three local minima in the mid wet early dry and late dry season fig 5d and fig 6 b the pattern arose because as the wet season progressed river discharge fig 5n increased longitudinal connectivity which caused the number of pools to decrease i e see the first local minima in february fig 6b january window note that 2018 had an early wet as the wet season reached its peak and water extent was at its maximum pools scattered across the floodplain were identified in the main channel buffer area fig 6 march window and the sum of these pools created the first local maxima in april fig 6a and b as flooding ended and the river started to fragment in the early dry season the loss of ephemeral pools caused pool numbers to decrease rapidly fig 6 july window and the number of pools reached a second local minimum in july as the dry season continued and the river fragmented further larger pools split into several small pools creating another set of local maxima in september these small fragmented pools continued to shrink as the dry season progressed until they ceased to exist creating the last local minima in november the number of pools continued to rise as the river fragmented further before the wet season commenced and improved hydrological connectivity in the early wet season december caused pools to join and their number to decrease again a similar pattern was observed albeit more muted for the attribute total wetted perimeter fig 5b an examination of fig 5 also revealed that when the river stopped flowing in the dry season and little or no information could be extracted from gauged data fig 5n our spatial metrics kept tracking hydrological characteristics of the river sections analyzed mean monthly total rainfall data fig 5o also assists our interpretation of the general behavior of the metrics by providing information on the intensity and temporal distribution of rainfall events 3 3 attributes and metrics within river sections of varying persistence and fragmentation the seasonal patterns identified above were also observed independently in each river section but their magnitude was highly variable between the five sections in line with their hydrological persistence for instance typically the more hydrological persistent the section the smoother and less steep the attribute or metric curve over time conversely the less persistent the section the more abrupt the curve decay with a steeper slope fig 7 more subdued seasonal changes were particularly evident for pool number and length fig 7d and c and for metrics linked to fragmentation fig 7l and m pool elongation fig 7f or length as a percentage of river section fig 7k these pattern emerged because river sections with relatively persistent surface water potentially due to high groundwater inputs demonstrated less variation in surface water extent hence attribute and metric values over time than river sections with little to no groundwater inputs exceptions in the general pattern did emerge especially for metrics linked to pool area or width fig 7g and i attribute and metric values also differed considerably for river sections with different hydrological persistence indicating that metrics were adept at representing spatial differences in hydrology for instance river sections with low hydrological persistence sections 1 and 2 had pools which were smaller in size i e area length width percentage of landscape during both the wet and dry season compared to those in sections with potential stronger links to groundwater sections 3 5 fig 7g j further river sections with low persistence contained more pools fig 7d that were cut off from one another fig 7l and m and covered a smaller portion of the channel fig 7j compared to river sections with high persistence metrics that directly described hydrological persistence also depicted differences among river sections indicating that they were also adept at identifying hydrological differences for instance values for pixel persistence and refuge area were considerably higher in river sections with a high likelihood of groundwater inputs sections 4 and 5 and were lower in sections of the river with minimal likelihood of groundwater inputs sections 1 and 2 fig 8 a and b fig 9 refuge area which only includes values of pixel persistence above 90 was the more sensitive of the two metrics and differed by two orders of magnitude between sections 1 and 2 and sections 3 to 5 with values of 0 0019 and 0 0207 for the former and 0 25 for the latter fig 8b pixel persistence was less sensitive with a maximum difference of only 17 between the most different river sections i e 1 and 5 fig 8a 4 discussion this study demonstrated that hydrological attributes and metrics automatically derived from multispectral imagery can accurately describe aspects of an intermittent river s hydrology and have the potential to provide meaningful insights into river morphology resilience and ecological functioning metrics proved effective at describing seasonal patterns revealing how the size complexity and elongation of surface water features e g pools decreased as the study river transitioned from wet to dry and how fragmentation increased metrics also enabled the differentiation of river sections with varied hydrological persistence using remotely sensed technology with automated algorithms to characterize the hydrology of intermittent rivers is a significant advance and has the potential to increase our understanding of remote and understudied rivers and improve their management characterizing surface water hydrology in intermittent rivers can help us generate and transfer knowledge assess impacts and monitor recovery kennard et al 2010 olden et al 2012 for instance knowledge will be generated when metrics are used to identify refuge locations in a river system or map the extent of aquatic habitats i e floodplain main channel tributary and estuarine knowledge generation can also be facilitated by using metrics as covariates in predictive models improving our ability to investigate hydrological and ecological relationships beesley et al 2014 canham et al 2021 king et al 2016 characterizing a river using remotely sensed metrics rather than gauged discharge data or hydrodynamic models provides another lens to evaluate hydrology as per olden et al 2012 and may improve our ability to transfer knowledge among river systems within a region among regions and potentially among continents it could also be incorporated into approaches that seek to protect the natural flow regime in the face of development such as the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration eloha framework poff et al 2010 the remotely sensed attributes and metrics presented in this study can also help quantify the impacts of threats such as water resource development i e the construction of impoundments surface or subsurface water extraction land use change and climate change lastly attributes and metrics can play an important role in quantifying the effect of restorative actions for instance metrics can be used to assess environmental water delivery also known as experimental floods by mapping changes in the size of aquatic habitats or could be used to quantify hydrologic changes that result from altered dam operation rules or the removal of infrastructure although our attributes and ecohydrological metrics show much promise a multispectral approach is not without challenges firstly the quality of the metrics depend directly on the quality of the water identification process which is limited by the configuration of the water detect algorithm cordeiro et al 2021 tayer et al 2023 and a range of other factors associated with the spatial resolution of the image data satellite return time and land cover variability in this study the accuracy of the water identification process is expected to have achieved similarly good results as reported by tayer et al 2023 since we used the recommended optimum time averaged input parameters i e water indices combination maximum clustering and regularization for the water detect algorithm cordeiro et al 2021 and applied them in the same catchment while this is encouraging it is important to note that the spatial resolution of the image data influences the level of detail of the water mask thus sentinel 2 data 10 m pixels may be too coarse to provide meaningful imagery for narrow intermittent waterways such as tributary streams it may also preclude mapping of small aquatic features such as riffles which are common in intermittent rivers the 5 day return cycle of sentinel 2 may also limit its ability to characterize brief hydrological events making it difficult to describe flashy rainfall runoff responses which are likely to occur in headwater streams or in systems with relatively impermeable substrates in addition this technique may not be applicable in regions with frequent cloud cover if using sentinel 2 however one of the benefits of using our approach is that it can be applied to any multispectral image with at least visible near infrared bands choosing satellites with quick return such as planetscope and worldview can help avoid cloud cover issues land cover can also affect the process of water identification since heavily shadowed burnt and urban areas can influence the accuracy of common water indices such as the normalized difference water index ndwi and modified normalized difference water index mndwi guo et al 2017 xu 2006 zhai et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 used in the water detect algorithm for this reason a preliminary visual exploratory analysis of the study area is strongly recommended to evaluate the best combination of spectral bands for any use case importantly if the water mask is accurate the process of extracting attributes should be straightforward and produce reliable results another challenge although not observed in this study is the possibility that pool length can be underestimated if the river channel bends strongly and pool endpoints lie close together in euclidean distance differences in topography among river sections may also influence a multispectral characterization of hydrology for instance some sections may have fewer topographic depressions than others and therefore form fewer ephemeral pools lastly the use of a buffer zone around a river centerline to characterize a river channel while pragmatic and timesaving has the potential to introduce error into metrics if the aim is the evaluate the main channel only as surface water on the adjacent floodplain may also be included this type of error can be countered by changing the buffer distance when configuring the algorithm or by providing the exact main channel boundary for those seeking to use our multispectral approach careful consideration must be given to the choice of parameters used as input for the water identification process we recommend using the sensitivity test developed by tayer et al s 2023 as it was specifically designed to identify the best parameters for the water detect algorithm the test compares the results of a combination of input parameters to determine values that reflect the most accurate water mask for each use case although this technique requires ground truthed or remotely interpreted data for its accuracy assessment we recommend its use because results can improve dramatically if adopted however for those unable to obtain ground truthed data we note that in some cases good results can still be achieved using the water detect default parameters cordeiro et al 2021 tayer et al 2023 tottrup et al 2022 importantly our algorithm to generate attributes and metrics has been developed in modules thus can be easily updated if more accurate methods to detect water arise a multispectral approach to characterizing the hydrology of intermittent rivers offers much promise but its advantages and usefulness will only be revealed by trialing its use we encourage others to use this method for the range of potential applications mentioned earlier we are especially keen to see its ability to characterize the similarity of riverine sections within a catchment as well as its ability to characterize hydrology among river systems studies that are able to acquire long time series imagery i e decadal will be able to investigate links between climate and hydrology and may shed new light on our understanding of the impacts of climate change on intermittent river systems such an approach may be achieved using the landsat satellite series which has been around since the 1970 s however the reduced spatial resolution of landsat imagery means that we recommend this approach only for river sections with wide channels we also welcome studies comparing and contrasting hydrological characterizations based on this spatial method with those using gauged discharge data as per olden et al 2012 and kennard et al 2010 as revealing differences may showcase the strength of a spatial approach and potentially reveal its limitations studies that link metrics to ecological patterns or processes will reveal their ecological relevance and limitations and are fundamentally important lastly we encourage others to test the developed algorithm and the resulting attributes and metrics in their intermittent rivers and report back only through trialing the method across a range of river systems will its advantages and limitations become clear this process will inevitably lead to metric refinement the addition of other metrics and recommendations about where metrics are most useful 5 conclusion in this study we developed a suite of ecohydrological attributes and metrics to characterize intermittent rivers over time that uses multiple multispectral images as input the process of calculating attributes and metrics has been automated in an open source algorithm built in a python 3 7 environment the source line of code is available on github for community editing and improvement via collaboration see data availability statement making the algorithm conveniently accessible for future users our case study indicated that the attributes and metrics were highly effective in characterizing the morphology and resilience of river sections and highlighting their relative hydrological differences our approach has great potential to be implemented because the developed algorithm has been designed to be easily used by professionals from different areas such as hydrology hydrogeology ecology climatology and management so long as the user has programming skills a better understanding of intermittent rivers hydrological characteristics and how they change through space and time is useful for resource assessments

2297,accurately describing the hydrology of intermittent rivers is a critical step in improving our understanding and management of freshwater ecosystems traditional approaches such as using gauged discharge data provide little information once flow ceases and no insight into the location morphology or persistence of river pools however multispectral images can be used to describe surface water characterize hydrology and provide insight into ecological functioning a multispectral approach is highly cost effective and well suited to remote intermittent rivers with little or no gauging infrastructure here we develop an algorithm to extract hydrological attributes i e pool area length perimeter and mean width from multispectral imagery sentinel 2 and use these attributes to create a suite of ecologically relevant hydrological metrics we describechanges in attributes and metrics in a large lowland intermittent river as it transitions from wet to dry over a four year period we also describe temporal changes in attributes and metrics among five river sections with contrasting hydrological persistence and fragmentation our algorithm successfully identified surface water in the main channel and the adjacent floodplain the centerline of pools and their upstream and downstream ends metrics proved effective at describing seasonal patterns in hydrology revealing how the size

development and a drying climate keywords hydrological metrics remote sensing river management ecohydrology intermittent rivers northern australia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction intermittent streams and rivers characterized by periods of no flow account for at least half of the length of all the world s rivers datry et al 2017 messager et al 2021 they are becoming increasingly widespread due to water resource development and climate change in regions with drier climate trends smettem et al 2013 intermittent rivers sustain unique biodiversity and provide a range of goods and services that people depend on acuña et al 2014 boulton 2014 datry et al 2014 in recognition of their importance and the threats they face intermittent rivers are receiving greater attention blackman et al 2021 chiu et al 2017 datry et al 2017 koundouri et al 2017 larkin et al 2020 even though they have been historically under represented in the hydrologic literature shanafield et al 2021 accurately describing the hydrology of intermittent rivers is a critical step in improving our understanding and management of these systems as it allows us to characterize their natural state assess impacts and monitor recovery however describing the hydrology of intermittent rivers is often not straightforward traditional approaches such as using gauged discharge data provide little information once flow ceases and no insight into the location morphology or resilience of river pools moreover this type of approach is costly as it requires field maintenance consequently many large rivers in remote and dryland regions have sparse or no hydrological gauging data callow and boggs 2013 hydrologic and hydrodynamic models generated from digital elevation models dems are an alternative method to characterize flood extent and other river characteristics but they also have limitations for instance hydrologic and hydrodynamic models are dependent on dem spatial resolution and are particularly sensitive to dem accuracy in dryland landscapes callow et al 2007 callow and smettem 2009 highly accurate dems are also rarely available in remote dryland river basins due to the high costs of producing them also they often need extra correction and processing steps to better represent the known hydrology jarihani et al 2015 despite these limitations gauged discharge data or hydrologic models are still the primary means for the ecohydrological characterization and classification of rivers including intermittent rivers bond and kennard 2017 d ambrosio et al 2017 kennard et al 2010 olden et al 2012 richter et al 1996 multispectral imagery can provide a different perspective on the hydrology of intermittent rivers and has the potential to overcome some of the limitations of gauging data or hydrologic models due to their high frequency temporal and spatial continuity and lower costs multispectral images can be analyzed to generate attributes for surface water e g pool area length perimeter along the length of a river or for specific sections within a river which can then be used to derive metrics e g pool complexity pool size that provide insight into ecological functioning while this is yet to be done in intermittent rivers metrics derived from this type of imagery have been used in terrestrial environments to quantify landscape structure and change crowley and cardille 2020 hermosilla et al 2019 mcgarigal and marks 1995 olariu et al 2022 and to describe the morphology of catchments beven et al 1988 frasson et al 2019 some of these metrics have the potential to be adapted and transferred to intermittent river systems to better understand their ecohydrological characteristics for instance metrics based on the size and shape of surface water features could be used to describe the amount and location of macro e g main channel floodplain and mesohabitats pool runs riffles they can also provide an insight into the littoral zone extent a zone with important ecological importance roach et al 2014 winfield 2004 yuan et al 2013 metrics based on morphology could also provide an insight into sedimentation erosion and infiltration rates gitz et al 2015 reddy et al 2004 and those based on the persistence of surface water through time could be used to identify ecological refuge locations and provide insights into surface water and groundwater dynamics sims et al 2016 lastly metrics based on surface water connectivity could provide an insight into the downstream transport of physical and biological particles river fragmentation and the potential for organism dispersal pringle 2010 pringle 2001 ward et al 2002 thus ecohydrological metrics derived from multispectral images offer much promise as a cost effective way to generate information that can support the management and protection of intermittent river systems the broad aim of this study was to generate novel hydrological metrics derived from multispectral imagery obtained from sentinel 2a and 2b satellites that have the potential to provide an insight into the ecology of intermittent rivers we had four specific aims 1 develop an algorithm to extract hydrological attributes e g area length perimeter and mean width about surface water from multispectral imagery 2 use these attributes to create a suite of ecologically relevant hydrological metrics 3 describe changes in attributes and metrics in a river system as it transitioned from wet to dry and 4 describe seasonal variation in each attribute and metric within river sections with contrasting hydrological persistence and fragmentation characterizing intermittent rivers using this approach can support the management and protection of semi arid environments facing increasing pressures from development and climate change and provide an insight into the benefits of an optical remotely sensed approach compared to conventional gauged discharge data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and design the study was undertaken in the fitzroy river located in the semi arid kimberley region of western australia fig 1 it has a catchment area of approximately 94 000 km2 and a length of 733 km harrington et al 2011 petheram et al 2018 the fitzroy catchment exhibits distinct hydrological seasonality experiencing extreme flood flows during wet times of the year november april with 87 of the runoff occurring between january and march before drying to loosely interconnected pools in the dry period may october beesley et al 2021 charles et al 2016 petheram et al 2018 there is extreme spatial and temporal variation in water extent with the maintenance of hydrological connectivity constrained by the strong seasonal climate variation and the influence of groundwater discharge zones taylor et al 2018 the water sustaining persistent pools comes either from groundwater discharging from the local alluvial aquifers associated with the river s floodplain or the regional groundwater associated with sedimentary sandstones of the grant group and poole sandstone harrington et al 2011 harrington and harrington 2015 taylor et al 2018 rainfall in a hydrological year nov oct is highly variable for instance in the last three hydrological years 2019 2021 the catchment experienced the lowest 348 mm 2019 and second highest total rainfall 854 mm 2021 measured over the last 19 years 2003 2022 for the average of the two closest rain stations noonkanbah and looma fig 1 this variable rainfall manifest in highly divergent stream discharge over the study period for two gauging stations noonkanbah and looma department of water and environmental regulations water information reporting system the main channel of the fitzroy river was visually defined and manually vectorized using arcgis pro 3 0 and esri base maps the area of interest was defined as a 250 m wide buffer on each side of the manually vectorized drainage line five river sections were chosen along the lowland stretch of the river between the confluence with the cunningham anabranch to approximately 100 km upstream of the estuary fig 1 we chose to perform our study on five representative sections rather than the entire river to make our study more tractable our five focal sections had approximately the same surface area 5 1 km2 and spanned the same length of the main channel river 10 2 km our focal sections spanned a hydrological continuum from persistent high likelihood of groundwater discharge reaches to intermittent low likelihood of groundwater discharge reaches allowing us to evaluate the ability of our metrics to differentiate a hydrological persistence gradient the 10 2 km length was somewhat arbitrarily chosen but we considered it suitable for our aim as it was large enough to confidently characterize a river section s hydrology but was not so large that it spanned regions with very different water persistence conditions river sections were broadly classified as 1 low persistence very fragmented with very little or no water at the end of the dry season 2 low persistence very fragmented with some water at the end of the dry season 3 intermediate persistence fragmented but with refuge pools containing water at the end of the dry season 4 high persistence low fragmentation with refuge pools and a considerable extent of water at the end of the dry season and 5 very high persistence low fragmentation with a considerable extent of refuge pools and water at the end of the dry season our classification was based on a thorough visual inspection of fortnightly remotely sensed multispectral imagery sentinel 2 captured in a particularly dry year 2019 a long term study of pool persistence using landsat sims et al 2016 and knowledge of the hydrology of the river as reported by harrington et al 2011 harrington and harrington 2016 harrington and harrington 2015 sims et al 2016 and taylor et al 2018 2 2 image datasets sentinel 2 multispectral surface reflectance nbart images nadir brdf adjusted reflectance terrain illumination correction downloaded from the digital earth australia dea database http www ga gov au dea accessed

line 2 3 defining and deriving metrics extracted from multispectral imagery to characterize intermittent rivers 2 3 1 method workflow the study workflow was divided into three parts extracting attributes deriving metrics and describing and evaluating attributes and derived metrics the first part extracted hydrological attributes at pool level from multispectral imagery in sixteen steps fig 2 and fig 3 the second part used the extracted attributes to calculate the developed metrics section 2 3 4 for the focal river sections the third part described and evaluated hydrological attributes and derived metrics changes as the river system transitioned from wet to dry seasons section 2 3 5 2 3 2 identifying water a preliminary step prior to metric generation was to map surface water extent step 1 this was done using the water detect algorithm cordeiro et al 2021 with sentinel 2 images 10 m b blue g green r red nir near infrared and adopting the input parameter values proposed for this catchment by tayer et al 2023 i e maximum clustering 6 regularization 0 07 the water detect algorithm was executed for every image see section 2 2 and the results were clipped to the area of interest 250 m buffer on each side of the drainage line the output of water detect is a binary array with values of one for water pixels and zero for non water pixels minus one represents no data values as the focus of this paper was to capture seasonal patterns especially the contraction of surface water during the dry season the clipped water mask time series was concatenated and reduced into two composites per month 15 day composites in a single data array dask development team 2016 hoyer and hamman 2017 where the maximum pixel value was taken for conflicting values i e overlapping values within a composite of the resulting 112 composite images only two had cloud coverage above 60 and 88 composites were below 5 the water mask binary array was checked for missing values in each layer of the time series since no data values such as cloud and shadow masks can influence water extent estimation falsely breaking river connectivity and causing potential misinterpretation of parameter values the missing values were populated using the following conditions step 2 a the no data value was filled with the first next valid observation or the second if the next immediate value was also missing i e backward fill b if the value was in the last position of the time series or c if the backward filling was unable to fill missing values we used a forward fill propagating up to two observations before the missing value if none of these conditions were satisfied the missing value remained unchanged as no data 2 3 3 extracting hydrological attributes after successfully mapping surface water features and addressing missing values for the entire time series we extracted attributes of interest i e pool area pool length pool mean width pool perimeter and number of pools to be used as input variables for the proposed metrics here we use the term pool to refer to a continuous area of surface water thus it may represent a range of geomorphic features including pools runs glides and riffles at each layer pixel connected regions were aggregated into unique groups using the scikit image morphology module label function van der walt et al 2014 step 3 this tool considers that two pixels are connected when they have the same value and are neighbors in any direction lateral vertical or diagonal van der walt et al 2014 hence each central pixel can potentially be connected with a maximum of eight neighboring pixels after labeling connected regions the attributes pool area pool perimeter and number of pools were retrieved for each unique group i e pool using rasterio s feature shape tool where the number of pools corresponded to the total number of unique groups step 4 to extract pool length we first applied the scikit image morphology module skeletonize function step 5 which reduces a binary image e g water non water to one pixel wide representations lee et al 1994 the resulting image is presented in the most simplified way without breaking connectivity and shape in our case representing the river centerline or streamline for each pool however the skeletonized output is not always represented by a unique line and can produce features with several connected nodes to confine the skeletonized feature to the longest segment possible i e pool length we applied the scikit image measure module label function to the skeletonized image meaning that each connected river centerline segment was given a unique identifier step 6 we then proceeded to find the start and endpoints or the most distant points for each centerline we used opencv s bradski 2000 built in filter2d convolution function to apply a custom matrix kernel k to the skeletonized image step 7 convolution filtering is a common technique for altering an image based on pixel neighbors adding each element to its local neighbors weighted by a kernel examples of convolution filtering include smoothing sharpening blurring and edge detection here we used the following 3x3 custom kernel k 1 1 1 1 10 1 1 1 1 considering that we applied the kernel k to a binary water mask water 1 and non water 0 the maximum possible value of a pixel after the convolution is 18 if a water pixel is surrounded by eight other water pixels the minimum is zero if a non water pixel is surrounded by eight non water pixels we observed the most common cases for start and endpoints pixels in the skeletonized image with a water pixel had one or three neighboring water pixels hence with a pixel value after convolution of 11 or 13 respectively step 8 with each unique pool s potential start endpoints we calculated all possible combinations of start and endpoint and the euclidean distance between these pairs of points step 9 we then selected the most distant five pairs to calculate the distance between each pair using the river centerline as the path step 10 we used the scikit image graph module mpc geometric which finds the least cost path from two points through a given cost array van der walt et al 2014 step 11 to ensure that the river path i e skeletonized water pixels was the only possible path between each start endpoint we set all non water pixels to 1 no data keeping the analysis within the skeletonized pixels the most distant path between the selected start endpoint pairs was selected as the final segment i e pool length step 12 mean pool width was estimated using scipy s euclidean distance transform tool virtanen et al 2020 with the water mask as input step 13 the tool receives as input a binary image and outputs a distance array i e an array with the same dimensions as the input image but where each pixel contains the euclidean distance to the closest border non water pixel we intersected the pool length segment step 12 with the distance array to extract the distance values from the pool centerline to the nearest border and multiplied these values by two to cover both sides of the river or the total wetted width from each centerline pixel step 14 finally for each unique pool we averaged the centerline pixel values step 15 to calculate the mean pool width step 16 the hydrological attributes extraction process was automated see data availability statement and the results of some attributes such as pool area and perimeter were compared to the values calculated in arcgis using the calculate geometry tool we also performed a qualitative analysis for pool endpoints and length by exploratory visual interpretation 2 3 4 defining and deriving ecohydrological metrics using the extracted attributes above we derived 11 ecohydrological metrics to describe river characteristics and assess differences between river sections the metrics were separated into two distinct categories that reflect surface water morphology table 1 and hydrological resilience table 2 the resulting extracted attributes i e pool area pool perimeter pool length mean pool width and number of pools from section 2 3 2 were used as inputs to derive the developed metrics the source line of code for the time series water identification attribute extraction and metrics calculation is available on github for community editing and improvement via collaboration see data availability statement morphological metrics quantitatively described pool shape i e geometry and size and were represented by five metrics the area weighted mean shape index area weighted elongation ratio area weighted mean pool area area weighted mean pool length and area weighted mean pool width all metrics were weighted by area effectively meaning that large pools within a river section exerted more influence on the metric than small pools resilience describes the capacity of a system to recover after disturbance i e drying and was represented by six metrics pixel persistence refuge area wetted area percentage of section wetted length percentage of section pool fragmentation and pool longitudinal fragmentation pixel persistence refuge area and wetted area percentage of section describe the amount of water within a section hence are relevant to water persistence and hydrologic refugia the wetted length percentage of section is the ratio between the sum of pool length within a section and section wetted length while theoretically values of this metric should not exceed 100 in reality they can because while the section line length is fixed the cumulative length of pools within the channel and in the floodplain within the buffer polygon can exceed this number for instance during the wet season river pools may extend into adjacent floodplain creeks alternatively early in the dry season multiple pools may exist side by side inside the main channel i e the river channel is braided or contains anabranches pool fragmentation and pool longitudinal fragmentation are indicators of river fragmentation and are relevant to hydrological connectivity 2 3 5 describing and evaluating hydrological attributes and derived metrics to visualize and understand patterns in attributes and metrics as the river system transitions from wet to dry we fitted polynomial lines to our data for any given attribute or metric y we created a regression model that predicted y given the day of the year day the global equation of the model is shown in eq 1 where day refers to the two composite samples per month n 24 per year polynomial terms were included for day i e dayx in recognition that metrics may display complex non linear behavior through time 1 m e t r i c y i n t e r c e p t d a y day 2 day 3 day 4 day 6 we fit linear models containing polynomial terms up to the 6th order using the ordinary least squares ols function in the package statsmodels seabold and perktold 2010 using a total of 478 observations for each model this resulted in six models of increasing complexity with increasing polynomial terms we used model selection to identify the model with best predictive capacity as we recognized that high level polynomial terms may lead to overfitting i e describing residual noise as opposed to true variation support for polynomial terms included in the global model were assessed by comparing model subsets using the akaike information criteria aic aic scores provide a measure of relative model support by trading off model fit model likelihood with model complexity i e number of parameters burnham and anderson 2004 we model averaged parameters across all competing models with δaic 4 0 as per burnham and anderson 2004 to produce the final model used for prediction see supplement for aic scores and δaic values note that δaic is the difference of the aic score of each model from the best model e g δaic of the best model is 0 the same approach was used to describe seasonal changes among river sections to explore the benefits of using metrics generated from imagery as opposed to a conventional gauged approach we visually compared attribute and metric seasonal curves with rainfall and discharge graphs generated from two gauging stations noonkanbah and looma it is important to highlight that pixel persistence and refuge area could not be analyzed using the approaches mentioned for the other metrics because these two metrics cannot be divided into time steps i e their value is created from a temporal reduction still we analyzed the differences in these metrics between sections note that the pixel persistence value used to describe any given river section was determined using the average value for the section and the value for refuge area was based on the total area within a section furthermore pixel persistence data were filtered and all values 25 discarded so that very low water observations and soils did not bias the metric mean 3 results 3 1 hydrological attributes the developed algorithm readily identified surface water in the main channel and the adjacent floodplain as well as the centerline of pools and their upstream and downstream ends fig 4 importantly the algorithm generated values for pool area and perimeter that were the same as those calculated in arcgis 3 0 the algorithm s ability to identify pool length and endpoints also showed promising results upon visual inspection 3 2 attributes and metrics during drying and wetting phases when combined across the five river sections both attributes and metrics displayed considerable variation within a year suggesting they were able to depict seasonal hydrologic patterns in the study area during the wet season there was a strong increase in pool total wetted area perimeter and length fig 5 a c changes in these attributes translated into a strong increase for metrics related to pool size fig 5g i pool shape complexity fig 5e as well as metrics that described the percent coverage of water across a river section fig 5k and l the wet season created a strong decrease in metrics that described surface water fragmentation fig 5l and m and pool elongation fig 5f note smaller values represent more elongated pools for the area weighted elongation ratio metric during the dry season the opposite patterns were observed with pools becoming smaller less complex and covering a smaller percent of the river section fig 5e g j metrics describing pool length fig 5h and k declined more gently than those related to area or width fig 5g i indicating that as the fitzroy river dried pools became narrower before they became shorter as drying progressed pools became increasingly circular fig 5f as well as more fragmented fig 5l and m seasonal trends in attributes metrics also identified the timing of peak changes in hydrology occurred in the fitzroy river peak changes occurred during the middle end of the wet season and the end of the dry beginning of the wet season as indicated by attributes and metrics displaying local maxima or minima at these times fig 5 the rapid change during the middle to the end of the wet season reflected the transition of a river in flood with high connectivity to a non flood state the other period of rapid change during the end of the dry beginning of the wet season presented the transition of the river from a series of shrinking pools in a fragmented channel back to a flooded connected state and translated into the opposite pattern for the attributes and metrics one attribute the number of pools displayed a complex seasonal pattern and is worthy of additional attention this attribute showed three local maxima between mid to late wet and the mid dry early wet season and three local minima in the mid wet early dry and late dry season fig 5d and fig 6 b the pattern arose because as the wet season progressed river discharge fig 5n increased longitudinal connectivity which caused the number of pools to decrease i e see the first local minima in february fig 6b january window note that 2018 had an early wet as the wet season reached its peak and water extent was at its maximum pools scattered across the floodplain were identified in the main channel buffer area fig 6 march window and the sum of these pools created the first local maxima in april fig 6a and b as flooding ended and the river started to fragment in the early dry season the loss of ephemeral pools caused pool numbers to decrease rapidly fig 6 july window and the number of pools reached a second local minimum in july as the dry season continued and the river fragmented further larger pools split into several small pools creating another set of local maxima in september these small fragmented pools continued to shrink as the dry season progressed until they ceased to exist creating the last local minima in november the number of pools continued to rise as the river fragmented further before the wet season commenced and improved hydrological connectivity in the early wet season december caused pools to join and their number to decrease again a similar pattern was observed albeit more muted for the attribute total wetted perimeter fig 5b an examination of fig 5 also revealed that when the river stopped flowing in the dry season and little or no information could be extracted from gauged data fig 5n our spatial metrics kept tracking hydrological characteristics of the river sections analyzed mean monthly total rainfall data fig 5o also assists our interpretation of the general behavior of the metrics by providing information on the intensity and temporal distribution of rainfall events 3 3 attributes and metrics within river sections of varying persistence and fragmentation the seasonal patterns identified above were also observed independently in each river section but their magnitude was highly variable between the five sections in line with their hydrological persistence for instance typically the more hydrological persistent the section the smoother and less steep the attribute or metric curve over time conversely the less persistent the section the more abrupt the curve decay with a steeper slope fig 7 more subdued seasonal changes were particularly evident for pool number and length fig 7d and c and for metrics linked to fragmentation fig 7l and m pool elongation fig 7f or length as a percentage of river section fig 7k these pattern emerged because river sections with relatively persistent surface water potentially due to high groundwater inputs demonstrated less variation in surface water extent hence attribute and metric values over time than river sections with little to no groundwater inputs exceptions in the general pattern did emerge especially for metrics linked to pool area or width fig 7g and i attribute and metric values also differed considerably for river sections with different hydrological persistence indicating that metrics were adept at representing spatial differences in hydrology for instance river sections with low hydrological persistence sections 1 and 2 had pools which were smaller in size i e area length width percentage of landscape during both the wet and dry season compared to those in sections with potential stronger links to groundwater sections 3 5 fig 7g j further river sections with low persistence contained more pools fig 7d that were cut off from one another fig 7l and m and covered a smaller portion of the channel fig 7j compared to river sections with high persistence metrics that directly described hydrological persistence also depicted differences among river sections indicating that they were also adept at identifying hydrological differences for instance values for pixel persistence and refuge area were considerably higher in river sections with a high likelihood of groundwater inputs sections 4 and 5 and were lower in sections of the river with minimal likelihood of groundwater inputs sections 1 and 2 fig 8 a and b fig 9 refuge area which only includes values of pixel persistence above 90 was the more sensitive of the two metrics and differed by two orders of magnitude between sections 1 and 2 and sections 3 to 5 with values of 0 0019 and 0 0207 for the former and 0 25 for the latter fig 8b pixel persistence was less sensitive with a maximum difference of only 17 between the most different river sections i e 1 and 5 fig 8a 4 discussion this study demonstrated that hydrological attributes and metrics automatically derived from multispectral imagery can accurately describe aspects of an intermittent river s hydrology and have the potential to provide meaningful insights into river morphology resilience and ecological functioning metrics proved effective at describing seasonal patterns revealing how the size complexity and elongation of surface water features e g pools decreased as the study river transitioned from wet to dry and how fragmentation increased metrics also enabled the differentiation of river sections with varied hydrological persistence using remotely sensed technology with automated algorithms to characterize the hydrology of intermittent rivers is a significant advance and has the potential to increase our understanding of remote and understudied rivers and improve their management characterizing surface water hydrology in intermittent rivers can help us generate and transfer knowledge assess impacts and monitor recovery kennard et al 2010 olden et al 2012 for instance knowledge will be generated when metrics are used to identify refuge locations in a river system or map the extent of aquatic habitats i e floodplain main channel tributary and estuarine knowledge generation can also be facilitated by using metrics as covariates in predictive models improving our ability to investigate hydrological and ecological relationships beesley et al 2014 canham et al 2021 king et al 2016 characterizing a river using remotely sensed metrics rather than gauged discharge data or hydrodynamic models provides another lens to evaluate hydrology as per olden et al 2012 and may improve our ability to transfer knowledge among river systems within a region among regions and potentially among continents it could also be incorporated into approaches that seek to protect the natural flow regime in the face of development such as the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration eloha framework poff et al 2010 the remotely sensed attributes and metrics presented in this study can also help quantify the impacts of threats such as water resource development i e the construction of impoundments surface or subsurface water extraction land use change and climate change lastly attributes and metrics can play an important role in quantifying the effect of restorative actions for instance metrics can be used to assess environmental water delivery also known as experimental floods by mapping changes in the size of aquatic habitats or could be used to quantify hydrologic changes that result from altered dam operation rules or the removal of infrastructure although our attributes and ecohydrological metrics show much promise a multispectral approach is not without challenges firstly the quality of the metrics depend directly on the quality of the water identification process which is limited by the configuration of the water detect algorithm cordeiro et al 2021 tayer et al 2023 and a range of other factors associated with the spatial resolution of the image data satellite return time and land cover variability in this study the accuracy of the water identification process is expected to have achieved similarly good results as reported by tayer et al 2023 since we used the recommended optimum time averaged input parameters i e water indices combination maximum clustering and regularization for the water detect algorithm cordeiro et al 2021 and applied them in the same catchment while this is encouraging it is important to note that the spatial resolution of the image data influences the level of detail of the water mask thus sentinel 2 data 10 m pixels may be too coarse to provide meaningful imagery for narrow intermittent waterways such as tributary streams it may also preclude mapping of small aquatic features such as riffles which are common in intermittent rivers the 5 day return cycle of sentinel 2 may also limit its ability to characterize brief hydrological events making it difficult to describe flashy rainfall runoff responses which are likely to occur in headwater streams or in systems with relatively impermeable substrates in addition this technique may not be applicable in regions with frequent cloud cover if using sentinel 2 however one of the benefits of using our approach is that it can be applied to any multispectral image with at least visible near infrared bands choosing satellites with quick return such as planetscope and worldview can help avoid cloud cover issues land cover can also affect the process of water identification since heavily shadowed burnt and urban areas can influence the accuracy of common water indices such as the normalized difference water index ndwi and modified normalized difference water index mndwi guo et al 2017 xu 2006 zhai et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 used in the water detect algorithm for this reason a preliminary visual exploratory analysis of the study area is strongly recommended to evaluate the best combination of spectral bands for any use case importantly if the water mask is accurate the process of extracting attributes should be straightforward and produce reliable results another challenge although not observed in this study is the possibility that pool length can be underestimated if the river channel bends strongly and pool endpoints lie close together in euclidean distance differences in topography among river sections may also influence a multispectral characterization of hydrology for instance some sections may have fewer topographic depressions than others and therefore form fewer ephemeral pools lastly the use of a buffer zone around a river centerline to characterize a river channel while pragmatic and timesaving has the potential to introduce error into metrics if the aim is the evaluate the main channel only as surface water on the adjacent floodplain may also be included this type of error can be countered by changing the buffer distance when configuring the algorithm or by providing the exact main channel boundary for those seeking to use our multispectral approach careful consideration must be given to the choice of parameters used as input for the water identification process we recommend using the sensitivity test developed by tayer et al s 2023 as it was specifically designed to identify the best parameters for the water detect algorithm the test compares the results of a combination of input parameters to determine values that reflect the most accurate water mask for each use case although this technique requires ground truthed or remotely interpreted data for its accuracy assessment we recommend its use because results can improve dramatically if adopted however for those unable to obtain ground truthed data we note that in some cases good results can still be achieved using the water detect default parameters cordeiro et al 2021 tayer et al 2023 tottrup et al 2022 importantly our algorithm to generate attributes and metrics has been developed in modules thus can be easily updated if more accurate methods to detect water arise a multispectral approach to characterizing the hydrology of intermittent rivers offers much promise but its advantages and usefulness will only be revealed by trialing its use we encourage others to use this method for the range of potential applications mentioned earlier we are especially keen to see its ability to characterize the similarity of riverine sections within a catchment as well as its ability to characterize hydrology among river systems studies that are able to acquire long time series imagery i e decadal will be able to investigate links between climate and hydrology and may shed new light on our understanding of the impacts of climate change on intermittent river systems such an approach may be achieved using the landsat satellite series which has been around since the 1970 s however the reduced spatial resolution of landsat imagery means that we recommend this approach only for river sections with wide channels we also welcome studies comparing and contrasting hydrological characterizations based on this spatial method with those using gauged discharge data as per olden et al 2012 and kennard et al 2010 as revealing differences may showcase the strength of a spatial approach and potentially reveal its limitations studies that link metrics to ecological patterns or processes will reveal their ecological relevance and limitations and are fundamentally important lastly we encourage others to test the developed algorithm and the resulting attributes and metrics in their intermittent rivers and report back only through trialing the method across a range of river systems will its advantages and limitations become clear this process will inevitably lead to metric refinement the addition of other metrics and recommendations about where metrics are most useful 5 conclusion in this study we developed a suite of ecohydrological attributes and metrics to characterize intermittent rivers over time that uses multiple multispectral images as input the process of calculating attributes and metrics has been automated in an open source algorithm built in a python 3 7 environment the source line of code is available on github for community editing and improvement via collaboration see data availability statement making the algorithm conveniently accessible for future users our case study indicated that the attributes and metrics were highly effective in characterizing the morphology and resilience of river sections and highlighting their relative hydrological differences our approach has great potential to be implemented because the developed algorithm has been designed to be easily used by professionals from different areas such as hydrology hydrogeology ecology climatology and management so long as the user has programming skills a better understanding of intermittent rivers hydrological characteristics and how they change through space and time is useful for resource assessments water allocation planning management prioritization e g identification of refuge locations and climate change studies by improving knowledge generation and decision making this hydrologic tool will

2298,for the purpose of investigating spatiotemporal characteristics of river sediment behavior we proposed a strategy integrating the ps insar technique together with gridding spatial calculation to estimate time series change of sediment volume over the baibufan section in daan river in taiwan firstly the ps insar performance based on ascending descending and all season dry season only images were examined to identify the most optimal sentinel 1 image data set subsequently the estimated results were validated through internal and external validations once the ps insar results were proved reliable we utilized the advantages of the long term wide extent observation to investigate the sediment behavior over sequential wet dry seasons and relatively long hydrological seasons based on the estimation of sediment volume change the most severe erosion occurred in the wet season starting from 2019 04 the erosion volume reached 1513 652 m3 and 1194 829 m3 respectively in high and median water coverage areas moreover based on the sediment maps the sediment distribution along the river was visualized in which the regions prone to erosion or deposition were also identified as the strategy for investigating the detailed spatial and temporal wise river sediment was proved feasible we are able to perform a regular observation to determine the deposition and erosion zones the corresponding change of sediment volume can subsequently be estimated for an early warning of damage of hydraulic facilities or settlements along the river keywords ps insar deformation spatiotemporal river sediment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers are dynamic fluvial systems in which each component has time variability and space heterogeneity as time flows when natural or artificial elements change in certain locations they may induce changes in the entire system and may affect the appearance of the river at the next point in time the change of sediment volume along the river way is also in the dynamic framework of time and space most of the sediment transportation was originated from the upper and middle slopes of the river catchment and then transported downstream by the water flow partly depositing in the river channel and partly moving downstream however when the amount of sediment that comes in the river is outsized under the same transportation procedure it may damage the hydraulic structures in the middle and lower reaches of the river and lead to lost in life and property on both sides of the river in order to avoid such extreme dynamic chain events and maintain the safety of the river catchment area it is critical to keep track of the dynamic sediment fluvial morphology a branch of geography is a science that describes the formation and change mechanisms of river topography at different scales based on natural forces the formation of river facies depends on the water and sand forces in the basin most rivers and streams are classified according to the river s topographical evolution and sediment yield based on the topographic data and the evaluations on historical maps the erosion and deposition zones along the river which are treated as critical areas related to flood disasters is obtained by manual digitization on a digitization board however in addition to the problem of inconsistency in subjective identification standards the cost of manual digitization also limits the updating frequency even the erosion and deposition zones required to be monitored are identified considering the time and labor cost it is challenging to directly measure the sediment along the river with continuously changing alluvium and erosion as reported by heckmann and vericat 2018 and calle et al 2020 repeated digital elevation models dems with high resolution and the associated topographic volume differences could be employed to precisely quantify sediment volumes that have been deposited temporarily stored or flushed due to the increased selection of dems of different quality and updating frequency this approach was adopted to investigate the river morphology by the distribution of the sediment volume and its change in this study geomatics techniques have been applied to estimate topographic change such as leveling surveying lane et al 1994 gnss observations brasington et al 2000 aerial photogrammetry lejot et al 2007 watanabe and kawahara 2016 terrestrial and airborne laser scanning heritage hetherington 2007 kinzel et al 2013 flener et al 2013 remote sensing approaches tomsett leyland 2019 chen et al 2021 among these techniques the measurement objects of leveling and gnss are distributed in a point manner and elevation changes are estimated through surveying at different times however it should be noted that only the changes of these fixed observation points can be detected remote sensing techniques such as uav aerial photography uav laser scanning and spaceborne multispectral imaging are capable of producing elevation data of continuous ground surface after repeated observations the area and magnitude of the deformation in the covered area can be detected although these techniques can be used to detect deformation the temporal frequency and spatial extension of the observations are limited due to factors such as time and labor costs weather conditions etc spaceborne synthetic aperture radar sar images together with time series interferometric sar insar processing have also been applied in surface change measurement and monitoring the applications include building and infrastructure deformation monitoring sousa and bastos 2013 crosetto et al 2015 gernhardt et al 2015 bianchini ciampoli et al 2020 ground surface uplift and subsidence colesanti et al 2005 wegmüller et al 2010 sun et al 2017 landslide monitoring tofani et al 2013 cigna et al 2013 rosi et al 2018 volcanic and tectonic activities peltier et al 2010 reale et al 2011 vilardo et al 2010 from the studies listed above it is known that the time series insar is capable of performing a long term and regular observation over broad area with reliable accuracy heleno et al 2011 quin and loreaux 2012 liu et al 2013 addressing the issues of ground and aerial surveying however in the application of river monitoring although sar images have been used in flood mapping manavalan 2017 and also insar was employed to estimate changes in water level height kim et al 2009 jung et al 2010 it is noted that the time series insar analysis over river is rare due to the specular reflection after the interaction between the radar microwave emitted by the sar and the surface of the calm water body the sar sensor cannot effectively obtain the backscatter together with the missing phase data the implementation of time series insar analysis over water coverage area is limited considering the advantages of spaceborne sar including being independent of weather and illumination wide coverage with short re visiting time capability of estimating ground surface height based on time series analysis etc time series insar was introduced to extract time series deformation occurred in height along the river way in spite of the undesired interaction with water as noted that the target river is a braided river time series insar analysis is still of potential to observe braid bars temporarily appear in the river if this is feasible through the experiment conducted in this study as the formation of braid bars is related to sediment change bridge 1993 the derived deformation along the river can be used to inspect the sediment behavior this study therefore aims for proposing a remote sensing insar based solution capable of estimating river sediment regularly and extensively it is expected to deliver the seasonal sediment maps indicating spatial and temporal wise sediment change along the target river in this paper together with the introduction of time series insar processing the strategy for implementing a long term dynamic sediment estimation along the river way is reported in section 2 in section 3 we demonstrate the study area data processing and validation results based on the deformation estimation sediment volume changes over the study area within coarse and fine time scales are respectively presented in section 4 the paper finishes with a discussion of the relationship between precipitation water coverage and sediment volume change and the conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 ps insar the time series insar technology applied in the study was persistent scatterer insar ps insar which has been broadly applied in monitoring long term ground surface displacement the technique was firstly proposed by ferretti et al 2001 the implementation starts with the collection of time series sar images after stacking n sar images acquired at different time with precise co registration one image was selected as the master image and the other n 1 images were paired with the master image to perform interferometric processing the interferograms were subsequently produced in which the interferometric phase δ ϕ k was the main resource for further analysis it composed of phase caused by surface deformation and error components which are listed in the eq 1 1 δ ϕ k δ ϕ d δ ϕ aps δ ϕ dem δ ϕ orb δ ϕ dc δ ϕ n where δ ϕ d represents the differential phase that reflects the phase change caused by surface deformation δ ϕ aps mainly reflects the phase delay caused by the atmosphere δ ϕ dem represents the phase error caused by inaccurate external dem when eliminating topographic error δ ϕ orb is the phase error caused by inaccurate orbit data and δ ϕ dc is decorrelation caused by variation of scatterers with long spatial or temporal baseline δ ϕ n represents random noise when receiving phase gens and van genderen 1999 in order to extract the deformation and eliminate the phase caused by other error components ps candidates psc points whose phase signal is stable in most of the sar images were selected as the robust scatterers and used as the sample for phase estimation to this end the amplitude dispersion index adi proposed by ferretti et al 2001 was calculated for selecting ps candidates adi was calculated pixel by pixel in the stack of sar images according to the eq 2 2 adi σ amp μ amp where σ amp represents the standard deviation of amplitude of stacking pixel and μ amp represents the average amplitude of it in this study we used sarproz as a ps insar processing tool perissin et al 2011 in which the amplitude stability index asi which was an index developed based on adi was applied the relationship is as follows 3 asi 1 a d i the domain of asi is between zero to one the larger the value the smaller the amplitude dispersion and the higher the stability the pixels with high asi were selected as psc and were used to distinguish the surface deformation and atmospheric error in sarproz the selected pscs were used to construct a delaunay triangulation for the purpose of establishing phase observation equations between adjacent pscs then in the atmospheric error estimation stage the spatial filtering was performed to compute δ ϕ aps of each interferogram colesanti et al 2003 khorrami et al 2019 once the atmospheric error was derived the processing entered the deformation estimation stage in which pscs were selected again based on another asi threshold value and the linear model was used for parameter estimation to obtain the time series of surface deformation the approach has been successfully applied in detecting deformation in land subsidence volcanic activity and infrastructure monitoring richter et al 2018 milillo et al 2019 foroughnia et al 2019 therefore it was introduced in extracting deformation along river way 2 2 strategy for dynamic sediment estimation it is known that time series surface subsidence or uplift can be derived from ps insar processing nevertheless it should be noted that the land cover types and their areas change over time in river way hence the performance of ps insar is influenced for example from the end of the dry season to the beginning of the wet season the rainfall increases then the areas where the river flows begin to expand turning the land cover in these expansion areas into water since the incident radar signal reflects away from the spacecraft the areas interacting with water appear dark in the sar image furthermore for the areas of water coverage that have long appeared in the time series sar images they become the areas where ps insar performance was limited since such temporal land cover change is considered as a disadvantage for ps insar implementation we proposed a solution to address the issue by exploiting the advantage of this ps insar as ps insar is advantageous of overcoming the poor interferometric coherence caused by long temporal baselines ferretti et al 2001 we only used sar images taken in dry seasons to form time series interferometric pairs by doing so it avoided the limitation that the backscatter was unstable due to the changes in the area and path of the river channel in the wet season the surface deformation of areas where river flows and retreats after a wet season can therefore be obtained through ps insar processing the image screening method has been applied in time series insar analysis over the permafrost landscape in svalbard rouyet to address seasonal phenomena rouyet et al 2019 since snow cover caused serious decorrelation sar images in snowfall seasons were not used in contrast only images in the thawing seasons were applied to estimate the time series deformation over permafrost areas with the dry season only image screening applied in this study it is worthwhile noting that the deformation value represents the amount of soil and sand brought and left behind by river water after a wet season from the ps insar results based on time series image collection including consecutive dry and wet seasons the seasonal deformation is valuable for understanding the dynamic sediment characteristics in particular for the braided river likes the target river additionally as the deformation estimated through ps insar was subsequently used to evaluate sediment volume the deformation was validated by internal and external checks to ensure reliability although the dry season only images were proposed to estimate the deformation occurred along the river way the all season sar images were also employed in ps insar processing for the purpose of internal accuracy check the persistent scatterer points ps points appearing in the common areas less covered by water in the two data sets should have similar deformation values the differences of deformation values of these ps points were used to assess the internal accuracy the external validation was performed against the time series data collected from the nearby gps stations the velocity difference was evaluated through the comparison of the two deformation values once the reliability of the ps insar estimated deformation was confirmed it was used as the basis for the subsequent estimation of sediment volume 3 ps insar estimation of surface displacement 3 1 study area and data the baibufan section of the daan river in taiwan is used as the study area as shown in fig 1 it is located in the middle reaches of the daan river the hydraulic facilities along the baibufan section have been broken many times the most serious one was hit by a typhoon in july 2013 causing the loss of the embankment foundation and damage to the co constructed road the new embankment was rebuilt in 2017 in order to understand the dynamic sediment behavior since then the baibufan section was selected as the target area and the ps insar approach was used to monitor this river section the interferometric wide iw swath mode sentinel 1 sar images with broad spatial coverage short re visiting frequency and moderate spatial resolution was the image source in this study images acquired from 2017 11 to 2021 04 in ascending and descending modes were respectively introduced in ps insar processing specifications are listed in table 1 according to the strategy designed in section 2 the images were distinguished into two categories including dry season only and all season images based on the average rainfall of the study area over the years the wet season is from may to october each year chen and chen 2003 therefore the images covered four dry seasons including 2017 11 2018 04 referred to d1 2018 11 2019 04 d2 2019 11 2020 04 d3 and 2020 11 2021 4 d4 and three wet seasons including 2018 5 2018 10 w1 2019 5 2019 10 w2 and 2020 5 2020 10 w3 together with the ascending and descending modes referred to fig 1 for image coverage extent four sets of images were crossed and processed by ps insar respectively 3 2 processing and validation as stated in the section 2 1 the reliability of the estimated deformation from ps insar is highly related to the asi playing an important role for atmospheric error estimation hence the setting of asi threshold was tested substantially it was noted that for the data set using all season images the number of images was much higher than that of the dry season only data set therefore under the same asi threshold setting the pscs selected in the all season images were more statistically stable but the number of points was less than that in the dry season only set especially in the river channel area temporarily covered by water the sparse pscs weakened the strength of the constructed delaunay triangulation and lead to incorrect estimation of atmospheric error considering the above reasons at the atmospheric correction stage the threshold value of all season set was slightly lower than the one of dry season only data set setting to 0 7 and 0 75 respectively to ensure that enough pscs could be extracted in the river channel area after the atmospheric error correction was completed the asi threshold was set to 0 65 for both data sets at the stage for estimating surface deformation at last in order to filter out low quality scatterers perissin et al 2011 temporal coherence was set to 0 7 to guarantee the reliability of the deformation estimation the ps insar processing results using dry season only ascending descending images and all season ascending descending images are shown in fig 2 before evaluating the internal accuracy we firstly compared the ps insar results derived from four groups in the overall area as expected the number of ps extracted by dry season only data set in the overall study area was more than that of all season set the ps number of dry season only set is to increase about 24 71 734 57 820 57 820 and 17 89 499 76 369 76 369 in ascending and descending imaging modes respectively see table 2 from the ps distribution presented in fig 2 it is observed that they are densely distributed in settlements however for the study area in the river way as outlined in fig 2 dry season only set has significantly more ps points than all season set has and the number of ps in dry season only is about 6 77 981 145 and 3 14 2 081 663 times higher than the number of ps in all season in ascending and descending imaging modes respectively in addition the number of descending ps in dry season only is about 2 12 2 081 981 times higher than that of ascending images these comparison results all indicated that the results estimated by dry season only descending image is the most suitable result for analyzing the study area for the implementation of internal validation we firstly selected the ps points existed in the same locations from the results of dry season only and all season data sets to form the point pair the deformation velocity of these ps points in each point pair were extracted we then subtract the two numbers to get the residual for validation as a result the mean residual of velocity of ascending and descending results were respectively computed as 0 119 mm year and 0 110 mm year as there was only little difference between the two velocities it was demonstrated that ps insar was able to minimize the effects of long temporal baseline to obtain the results similar to the one using all season images this internal validation justified the usage of ps insar results derived from dry season only images the external validation of ps results from dry season only data set was carried out against the data derived from gps stations considering the overlapping location and limited common available operation time we selected data from four gps stations including dosh gs82 nshe and suc2 referred to fig 2 for their location and collected in period of 2017 11 2019 12 in the external validation task as shown in fig 2 the deformation trend of the ps insar results derived from the ascending and descending images is highly consistent as the deformation of ps points represented the displacement in line of sight los direction it was determined that the deformation results over the study area were mainly contributed by the changes in the vertical direction therefore we directly projected the vertical component of the gps data to the satellite direction of the ps according to the sentinel 1 incident angle the projected time series gps data was then compared with the average time series deformation estimated from the ps points within 200 m around each gps station the gps observations were compared with the dry season only ps results as this was the product employed for dynamic sediment analysis the comparison between the gps data and the ascending descending ps insar results is plotted in fig 3 firstly judging by the standard deviation of the displacement surrounding gps stations it is found that the descending result is more precise than the ascending one at nshe dosh and suc2 examining further at the deformation trend the descending ps result and gps observations have a high degree of agreement and is also better than that of ascending result based on the root mean square error rmse listed in table 3 it is known that the external accuracy of ps insar results using descending images falls within 1 7 2 2 mm although the ps insar analysis adopting linear modelling fails to capture non linear deformation such as the subsidence occurred in suc2 in april 2018 and april 2019 the overall performance of ps insar is still reliable in conclusion after internal and external validations the consistency and reliability of ps results derived from dry season only descending sentinel 1 images were proved 4 spatiotemporal sediment change along the river way based on the evaluation summarized in the section 3 2 the deformation derived from the dry season only descending sentinel 1 images was following used for sediment change analysis as the ps points were discrete and discontinuous in space we performed a densification of ps points by local analysis rocca et al 2015 to derive 5 054 ps points in addition a 50 m by 50 m grid surface was produced to cover the study area a spatial intersection was performed based on 5 054 ps points and 1 183 grids each grid was then filled with the mean of the deformation values of the ps points spatially intersecting the grid the change of sediment volume could be also estimated based on this grid surface due to the inclusion of long term series of ps insar processing we have the flexibility to extract results of different time lengths to examine the sediment change as listed in fig 4 two temporal units including a hydrological season of 18 months including a wet season and a dry or wet season of 6 months were used to inspect the sediment change along the target river section the corresponding rainfall data was collected from shuang qi station which is the nearest one in the study area referred to fig 1 for its location firstly we composed three hydrological seasons hss spanning dry wet dry seasons including 2017 11 2019 04 hs1 2018 11 2020 04 hs2 and 2019 11 2021 04 hs3 from the image coverage period of 2017 11 2021 04 referred to fig 4 from the ps insar results produced by dry season only images the deformation values caused by deposition temporary store or flush during these three hydrological seasons were extracted respectively the deformation maps of the three hydrological seasons are illustrated in fig 5 showing the spatial distribution of the sediment along the river way in different seasons 1 obvious deposition accumulated in the river reaches in the downstream direction of the target area in the hs2 and hs3 periods the phenomenon is also observed in the map of hs1 although the distribution range is not as wide as the ones in the other two hss it is revealed that the region is prone to deposition 2 although it is mainly deposition in the downstream section relative apparent deposition and erosion exist in the common local area outlined by the red dashed circle in all three deformation maps 3 after hs1 and hs2 deposition and erosion were randomly distributed in the middle and upstream reaches of the target area after h3 different from the geomorphology pattern shown in the maps of hs1 and hs2 there was a relatively large erosion area this erosion may be related to the low rainfall in hs3 4 a large scale local erosion occurs in the region outlined by the red dashed circle in the east side of the target area to the upstream direction but it is also mixed with small scale deposition secondly we split each hydrological season into the dry wet and dry seasons and extracted corresponding deformation for each grid the resultant deformation maps are shown in fig 6 take the hs1 as an example the overall deformation distribution and values are displayed in fig 5 a now we are able to separately observe the sediment behavior in the study area after each dry and wet season for the convenience of description two dashed lines were drawn to divide the target area into three reaches specific findings include 1 obvious differences are observed in the sediment distribution after the dry and wet seasons significant erosion is mostly only seen in the wet seasons 2 after the dry season large scale deposition zones appear in the downstream west of the dashed line on the left the deposition pattern of d3 and d4 is similar where the area is more prominent while the ones of d1 and d2 are smaller compared with d2 the deposition location in d1 is more towards the middle of the target area fig 6 a 3 after the dry season the sediment change is moderate in the middle section of the target area between the two dashed lines it is visualized that the erosion area is larger than the deposition which is especially obvious after the d4 fig 6 g 4 after the dry season of d1 d2 and d3 the deposition and erosion are randomly distributed in the upstream east of the dashed line on the right however a deposition clustering zone is observed in the upstream in the map of d4 fig 6 g 5 a random distribution of deposition and erosion is observed along the river after the three wet seasons however it is noted that more areas with severe erosion existed after the w2 fig 6 d 6 after w3 in the middle section of the river target area to the upstream there is a deposition clustering zone the deposition also occurs in the same location after d1 and d2 7 a number of local erosion or deposition zones are observed in the same areas such as zones a c and e outlined by red dashed circles it is worthwhile noting as these areas are close to levee facilities 8 spatial heterogeneity is visualized in the zone b in d1 and d3 where serious erosion is surrounded by deposition grids 9 it is found that a significant deposition frequently occurs in zone d fig 7 b 7 d f where an apparent small scale erosion is around through a visual inspection based on the deformation maps with coarse and fine temporal resolution it allows us to see detailed spatiotemporal characteristics of sediment in daan river as demonstrated above it is highlighted that the method proposed in this study is able to provide a regular and extensive observation on sediment change of the river way the seasonal sediment change maps can be a useful tool to monitor the sediment behavior 5 discussion 5 1 relationship between precipitation water coverage and sediment volume change since sediment behavior is closely related to water coverage for a further inspection we produced a water coverage map along the river way according to the temporal coverage of river water to achieve this a total of 85 sentinel 2 multi spectral images taken from 2017 10 to 2021 04 were used to calculate the time series normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 over the study area referred to fig 8 for examples of ndwi maps the pixels whose ndwi was over 0 were treated as water coverage in which changes in water and non water covers on the river way can be clearly observed subsequently the 50 m by 50 m grid cells were again introduced as the base to extract the time series ndwi after counting the number of times that each grid was covered by water we used the quartile classification method to classify the grids for the grids whose water coverage times were greater than the q3 value they were classified as the high water coverage area grids with water coverage between q2 q3 or less than q2 respectively belonged to the median and low water coverage areas the q2 and q3 were 9 and 31 respectively and the water coverage map is illustrated in fig 7 the grids of high and median water coverage areas are mostly located along the main river channels while the low water coverage area are located in the bare sandy areas outside the river channels or the areas covered by vegetation for the purpose of analyzing the association between the deformation and the water cover only the grids spatially intersected with the ps points were following used based on the deformation value in each grid and the grid size the sediment volume could be computed it should be noted that although the deformation in each grid represented the displacement in los direction the deformation trend of the ps insar results derived from the ascending and descending images is highly consistent it could be determined that the deformation results over the study area were mainly contributed by the changes in the vertical direction therefore we used the incident angle θ inc 39 3235 degrees in the eq 4 to convert the deformation into the vertical direction hastaoglu 2016 given that the area of each grid was 2 500 m2 by multiplying the grid area by the vertical deformation the volume of sediment change that occurs in each grid was derived 4 v h v los cos θ inc the relationship among precipitation water coverage and sediment volume change was firstly investigated on a hydrological season time scale the change of overall sediment volume over the high median low water coverage areas in the three hydrological seasons are listed in table 4 comparing the mean deformation rate the second season hs2 is of the highest subsidence in high and median water coverage areas to investigate the reason for this we summed up the cumulative rainfall of the three hydrological seasons which were 2 244 mm 3 123 mm and 1 432 mm fig 4 and found a reasonable fact that the higher the cumulative rainfall over the analysis period the higher the river runoff and the increased erosion and transport capacity in the river channel in other words the results of the ps insar analysis pointed out a positive correlation between the amount of cumulative rainfall and surface change within the river way the areas where a negative impact on the stability of the river slope and the riverbed deposit along with cumulative rainfall increasing could be visualized in the maps referred to fig 5 furthermore the cumulative changes of sediment volume together with the deformation statistics over the three water coverage areas in each season are listed in table 5 with a finer time scale improved from a hydrological season it is realized that erosion was still predominant in almost all seasons in all three water coverage areas also both serious subsidence and deviation occurred in high water coverage area however based on the analysis performed within the finer temporal period it is noted that the most serious erosion occurred in the wet season from 2019 04 to 2019 11 in hs2 during the period sediment erosion volume occurred in the high and median water coverage areas respectively reached 1 513 652 m3 and 1 194 829 m3 meanwhile it is also worthwhile noting that deposition happened for the first time in all seasons and the volume reached 412 649 m3 in order to understand the reason causing such a serious dynamic change we linked the cumulative rainfall listed in fig 4 it is found that the highest precipitation of 2 344 mm in the whole study period was also occurred in the wet season 2019 04 2019 11 through the analysis the understanding of the correlation between river sediment behavior and rainfall could be highly improved in addition the total sediment volume change over this river section for each dry or wet season can be introduced as the initial value for sediment transportation simulations given that the most serious sediment change was formed after the period from 2019 04 to 2019 11 w2 we used the gridded deformation map fig 6 d to further demonstrated its potential benefits in sediment behavior investigations firstly as the sar images in wet season were excluded in the ps insar processing four ndwi maps were employed to illustrate the land cover change in the w2 period as shown in fig 8 the geomorphological changes in the main river are reflected as observed in fig 8 a at the end of the dry season the channel width is narrow and the area of high water cover is small the width of the main channel and the high water cover gradually increase as time enters the wet season fig 9 b d as the gradient of this section of the river levels off new channel tributaries begin to form in previously dry areas the characteristics of braided river is clearly demonstrated secondly a spatial clustering analysis anselin 1995 was performed based on the gridded deformation map to extract significant hotspots of subsidence and uplift indicating erosion and deposition zones respectively fig 8 from the location of the hotspots and the change of river channel it is observed that the mounded areas are primarily located on both sides of the original river terrace braided rivers are usually located in wide channels unstable banks and shallow water it is because the supply of sedimentation is greater than the capacity of river transportation without external forces on the river the temporal features of the braided river in the landscape are expected to facilitate ps insar geomorphological change detection the four ndwi maps in fig 8 show a high correlation between the river channel changes and the erosion deposition zones identified by the hotspot analysis in which the major erosion areas in the ps insar analysis mostly coincide with the meandering river line after the wet season based on the method the time series regions of deposition and erosion over dry and wet seasons can be extracted the sediment transportation can be further inspected it is beneficial for the rivers where local sediment observations are not available the analysis is also applicable for examining the engineering effectiveness of the levee facilities baibufan levee a 1 km long levee completed in 2017 as pointed out in fig 8 was constructed to be set back 30 m into the land based on the deposition zone in front of the baibufan levee appeared after the w2 it was demonstrated that the design of the levee prevents foundation erosion and contributes to the stability of the levee 5 2 time series deposition erosion analysis in addition to the spatial clustering of erosion and deposition sediment behavior with high temporal resolution is investigated based on the time series insar analysis we selected three regions close to the upstream the baibufan levee and the downstream of the study area marked as r1 r2 and r3 respectively in fig 8 b and presented the time series sediment trend the water coverage level as shown in fig 7 was also considered in the analysis in fig 9 a the sediment variability characteristics of r1 can be identified within the high water coverage area located in the mainstream channel during the dry seasons of 2017 2020 taking the trend of the dry season in 2017 2017 11 2018 4 as the baseline indicated by the red line by observing the green line it is realized that the erosion occurred in the streambed in the dry season in 2018 as abundant rainfall 2 344 mm as listed in fig 4 was accumulated in the wet season in 2019 the overall downwash on the riverbed was evident and the trend can be observed along the blue line the black line following demonstrates that the riverbed did not continue to wash downwards but remained on the same datum in 2020 next the characteristics of the high riverbank over r2 close to the baibufan levee is demonstrated in fig 9 b given the grids we investigated are located in low water coverage area and also in riverbank deposition zone it is expected to observe ground uplift which is obviously reflected by the blue line illustrated in fig 9 b after the rainfall accumulation in the wet season in 2019 not only the overall ground uplift is clear the peaks of deposition in early november 2019 mid january 2020 and end april 2020 are also obvious however the trend of the black line reveals that the deposition is less serious in the dry season of 2020 2021 which might be caused by low rainfall in the wet season in 2020 from the perspective of hydraulic engineering it is beneficial to observe no bank erosion after heavy rainfall occurred close to the baibufan levee as shown in fig 9 c the trends of deposition or erosion in r3 are complicated as the selected grids are distributed in high and median water coverage areas for which they are presented by solid and dashed lines respectively for high water covered area we notice a similar trend to the ones in fig 9 a where the four trend lines are divided into two groups the red and green lines are in one group while the blue and black lines are in another group it is inferred that the rainfall accumulated in the wet season in 2019 caused comparable erosion in the upstream and downstream of the study area however from the dashed lines illustrated grids over median water covered area such phenomenon is not clear instead the blue and black dashed lines are close to the red and green lines as the location of these median water covered grids is away from the main stream the erosion caused by plentiful rainfall in 2019 does not spread to the areas indicating the sediment transportation caused by the flow is less significant as the monitoring can be conducted regularly the analysis demonstrated above is feasible for supporting hydrological management authorities to examine the potential for rapid topographic changes within the river the results can assist governments in determining whether additional sediment control is required to prevent flood hazards 6 conclusions and recommendations the main objective of this study was to investigate spatiotemporal characteristics of daan river sediment behavior this was achieved by a two stage processing approach at first ps insar technique together with dry season only sar image selection strategy to firstly estimate the surface deformation along the river subsequently the deformation value was converted into sediment volume through gridding calculation since the overall approach has been approved feasible we summarized three points worthwhile highlighting in this study 1 in order to reduce the limitations for ps insar processing caused by unfavorable atmospheric condition and wide water coverage occurred in wet seasons we proposed the dry season only image selection approach even though the image number introduced to ps insar reduced from 196 to 104 ascending images and from 178 to 99 for descending images see table 1 through the internal and external accuracy examinations it was demonstrated that we still delivered reliable deformation results the image selection strategy could therefore be feasible for time series insar applications in other rivers 2 since the ps insar results derived in this study has been proved reliable we took the advantage of the long term wide extent observation to investigate the sediment behavior over hydrological seasons and relatively shorter wet dry seasons from the analysis reported in the sections 4 and 5 ps insar and the resultant deformation maps were proved to be a useful technique and products for spatiotemporal sediment investigation although other techniques capable of producing dems is feasible of achieving this the efficiency and cost of our method outperform others 3 in our study area the baibufan section in daan river we identified the specific areas prone to deposition or erosion in different seasons to further analyze sediment behavior we classified the study area into high median low water coverage areas we also collected the cumulative rainfall as discussed in the section 5 the relations between sediment event water coverage and precipitation were established spatial hotspots indicating deposition and erosion zones were also presented to demonstrate the added value of the products based on these findings the following recommendations are proposed which aim for technical improvement and future applications 1 the sar image selection strategy applied in this study indeed helps to improve the performance of ps insar implementation meanwhile as the images acquired in the wet seasons are removed an analysis of sediment change with an improved temporal resolution is not achievable based on the analysis reported in section 3 there were 2 081 and 663 ps points derived respectively from the ps insar using dry season only and all season descending images in order to improve the number and also the distribution of the stable points for detailed sediment investigations other time series insar techniques with different principles of image pair formation such as small baseline subset sbas or stable scatterer selection such as distributed scatterer ds insar will be examined 2 based on the successful application in baibufan section in daan river in this study it is of great potential to employ the same approach to the watershed including the whole river way and surrounding mountainous area in the future research by doing so the balance of soil and sand transportation in the watershed can be evaluated actually the feasibility was already demonstrated in the deformation results over wide area as shown in fig 2 however for such a larger spatial extent with various land cover types insar technical challenges and sar image resolution issue should be addressed then 3 for disaster prevention purpose the amount of sediment transportation by streams in southern taiwan after heavy rains or typhoons often affects the safety of bridge structures downstream for instance the heavy rainfall triggered by typhoon lupit on 2022 8 7 caused an intense debris flow in the yusui stream and destroyed the minbaklu bridge downstream shiu et al 2022 the disaster caused a severe disruption of route 20 for 17 days and created an isolated effect in remote tribes in view of this the soil and water conservation bureau swcb in taiwan has commenced an assessment of unstable sediment production in large scale catchments although it is possible to produce dtms of the streambed in the river channel through multi phase remote sensing satellite observations numerical modelling of debris flow still requires understanding the hotspot and activity of unstable sedimentation area in the streambed the techniques proposed in this study can be applied regularly and precisely to identify the spatial distribution of unsteady sediment declaration of competing interest the authors declare

2298,for the purpose of investigating spatiotemporal characteristics of river sediment behavior we proposed a strategy integrating the ps insar technique together with gridding spatial calculation to estimate time series change of sediment volume over the baibufan section in daan river in taiwan firstly the ps insar performance based on ascending descending and all season dry season only images were examined to identify the most optimal sentinel 1 image data set subsequently the estimated results were validated through internal and external validations once the ps insar results were proved reliable we utilized the advantages of the long term wide extent observation to investigate the sediment behavior over sequential wet dry seasons and relatively long hydrological seasons based on the estimation of sediment volume change the most severe erosion occurred in the wet season starting from 2019 04 the erosion volume reached 1513 652 m3 and 1194 829 m3 respectively in high and median water coverage areas moreover based on the sediment maps the sediment distribution along the river was visualized in which the regions prone to erosion or deposition were also identified as the strategy for investigating the detailed spatial and temporal wise river sediment was proved feasible we are able to perform a regular observation to determine the deposition and erosion zones the corresponding change of sediment volume can subsequently be estimated for an early warning of damage of hydraulic facilities or settlements along the river keywords ps insar deformation spatiotemporal river sediment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers are dynamic fluvial systems in which each component has time variability and space heterogeneity as time flows when natural or artificial elements change in certain locations they may induce changes in the entire system and may affect the appearance of the river at the next point in time the change of sediment volume along the river way is also in the dynamic framework of time and space most of the sediment transportation was originated from the upper and middle slopes of the river catchment and then transported downstream by the water flow partly depositing in the river channel and partly moving downstream however when the amount of sediment that comes in the river is outsized under the same transportation procedure it may damage the hydraulic structures in the middle and lower reaches of the river and lead to lost in life and property on both sides of the river in order to avoid such extreme dynamic chain events and maintain the safety of the river catchment area it is critical to keep track of the dynamic sediment fluvial morphology a branch of geography is a science that describes the formation and change mechanisms of river topography at different scales based on natural forces the formation of river facies depends on the water and sand forces in the basin most rivers and streams are classified according to the river s topographical evolution and sediment yield based on the topographic data and the evaluations on historical maps the erosion and deposition zones along the river which are treated as critical areas related to flood disasters is obtained by manual digitization on a digitization board however in addition to the problem of inconsistency in subjective identification standards the cost of manual digitization also limits the updating frequency even the erosion and deposition zones required to be monitored are identified considering the time and labor cost it is challenging to directly measure the sediment along the river with continuously changing alluvium and erosion as reported by heckmann and vericat 2018 and calle et al 2020 repeated digital elevation models dems with high resolution and the associated topographic volume differences could be employed to precisely quantify sediment volumes that have been deposited temporarily stored or flushed due to the increased selection of dems of different quality and updating frequency this approach was adopted to investigate the river morphology by the distribution of the sediment volume and its change in this study geomatics techniques have been applied to estimate topographic change such as leveling surveying lane et al 1994 gnss observations brasington et al 2000 aerial photogrammetry lejot et al 2007 watanabe and kawahara 2016 terrestrial and airborne laser scanning heritage hetherington 2007 kinzel et al 2013 flener et al 2013 remote sensing approaches tomsett leyland 2019 chen et al 2021 among these techniques the measurement objects of leveling and gnss are distributed in a point manner and elevation changes are estimated through surveying at different times however it should be noted that only the changes of these fixed observation points can be detected remote sensing techniques such as uav aerial photography uav laser scanning and spaceborne multispectral imaging are capable of producing elevation data of continuous ground surface after repeated observations the area and magnitude of the deformation in the covered area can be detected although these techniques can be used to detect deformation the temporal frequency and spatial extension of the observations are limited due to factors such as time and labor costs weather conditions etc spaceborne synthetic aperture radar sar images together with time series interferometric sar insar processing have also been applied in surface change measurement and monitoring the applications include building and infrastructure deformation monitoring sousa and bastos 2013 crosetto et al 2015 gernhardt et al 2015 bianchini ciampoli et al 2020 ground surface uplift and subsidence colesanti et al 2005 wegmüller et al 2010 sun et al 2017 landslide monitoring tofani et al 2013 cigna et al 2013 rosi et al 2018 volcanic and tectonic activities peltier et al 2010 reale et al 2011 vilardo et al 2010 from the studies listed above it is known that the time series insar is capable of performing a long term and regular observation over broad area with reliable accuracy heleno et al 2011 quin and loreaux 2012 liu et al 2013 addressing the issues of ground and aerial surveying however in the application of river monitoring although sar images have been used in flood mapping manavalan 2017 and also insar was employed to estimate changes in water level height kim et al 2009 jung et al 2010 it is noted that the time series insar analysis over river is rare due to the specular reflection after the interaction between the radar microwave emitted by the sar and the surface of the calm water body the sar sensor cannot effectively obtain the backscatter together with the missing phase data the implementation of time series insar analysis over water coverage area is limited considering the advantages of spaceborne sar including being independent of weather and illumination wide coverage with short re visiting time capability of estimating ground surface height based on time series analysis etc time series insar was introduced to extract time series deformation occurred in height along the river way in spite of the undesired interaction with water as noted that the target river is a braided river time series insar analysis is still of potential to observe braid bars temporarily appear in the river if this is feasible through the experiment conducted in this study as the formation of braid bars is related to sediment change bridge 1993 the derived deformation along the river can be used to inspect the sediment behavior this study therefore aims for proposing a remote sensing insar based solution capable of estimating river sediment regularly and extensively it is expected to deliver the seasonal sediment maps indicating spatial and temporal wise sediment change along the target river in this paper together with the introduction of time series insar processing the strategy for implementing a long term dynamic sediment estimation along the river way is reported in section 2 in section 3 we demonstrate the study area data processing and validation results based on the deformation estimation sediment volume changes over the study area within coarse and fine time scales are respectively presented in section 4 the paper finishes with a discussion of the relationship between precipitation water coverage and sediment volume change and the conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 ps insar the time series insar technology applied in the study was persistent scatterer insar ps insar which has been broadly applied in monitoring long term ground surface displacement the technique was firstly proposed by ferretti et al 2001 the implementation starts with the collection of time series sar images after stacking n sar images acquired at different time with precise co registration one image was selected as the master image and the other n 1 images were paired with the master image to perform interferometric processing the interferograms were subsequently produced in which the interferometric phase δ ϕ k was the main resource for further analysis it composed of phase caused by surface deformation and error components which are listed in the eq 1 1 δ ϕ k δ ϕ d δ ϕ aps δ ϕ dem δ ϕ orb δ ϕ dc δ ϕ n where δ ϕ d represents the differential phase that reflects the phase change caused by surface deformation δ ϕ aps mainly reflects the phase delay caused by the atmosphere δ ϕ dem represents the phase error caused by inaccurate external dem when eliminating topographic error δ ϕ orb is the phase error caused by inaccurate orbit data and δ ϕ dc is decorrelation caused by variation of scatterers with long spatial or temporal baseline δ ϕ n represents random noise when receiving phase gens and van genderen 1999 in order to extract the deformation and eliminate the phase caused by other error components ps candidates psc points whose phase signal is stable in most of the sar images were selected as the robust scatterers and used as the sample for phase estimation to this end the amplitude dispersion index adi proposed by ferretti et al 2001 was calculated for selecting ps candidates adi was calculated pixel by pixel in the stack of sar images according to the eq 2 2 adi σ amp μ amp where σ amp represents the standard deviation of amplitude of stacking pixel and μ amp represents the average amplitude of it in this study we used sarproz as a ps insar processing tool perissin et al 2011 in which the amplitude stability index asi which was an index developed based on adi was applied the relationship is as follows 3 asi 1 a d i the domain of asi is between zero to one the larger the value the smaller the amplitude dispersion and the higher the stability the pixels with high asi were selected as psc and were used to distinguish the surface deformation and atmospheric error in sarproz the selected pscs were used to construct a delaunay triangulation for the purpose of establishing phase observation equations between adjacent pscs then in the atmospheric error estimation stage the spatial filtering was performed to compute δ ϕ aps of each interferogram colesanti et al 2003 khorrami et al 2019 once the atmospheric error was derived the processing entered the deformation estimation stage in which pscs were selected again based on another asi threshold value and the linear model was used for parameter estimation to obtain the time series of surface deformation the approach has been successfully applied in detecting deformation in land subsidence volcanic activity and infrastructure monitoring richter et al 2018 milillo et al 2019 foroughnia et al 2019 therefore it was introduced in extracting deformation along river way 2 2 strategy for dynamic sediment estimation it is known that time series surface subsidence or uplift can be derived from ps insar processing nevertheless it should be noted that the land cover types and their areas change over time in river way hence the performance of ps insar is influenced for example from the end of the dry season to the beginning of the wet season the rainfall increases then the areas where the river flows begin to expand turning the land cover in these expansion areas into water since the incident radar signal reflects away from the spacecraft the areas interacting with water appear dark in the sar image furthermore for the areas of water coverage that have long appeared in the time series sar images they become the areas where ps insar performance was limited since such temporal land cover change is considered as a disadvantage for ps insar implementation we proposed a solution to address the issue by exploiting the advantage of this ps insar as ps insar is advantageous of overcoming the poor interferometric coherence caused by long temporal baselines ferretti et al 2001 we only used sar images taken in dry seasons to form time series interferometric pairs by doing so it avoided the limitation that the backscatter was unstable due to the changes in the area and path of the river channel in the wet season the surface deformation of areas where river flows and retreats after a wet season can therefore be obtained through ps insar processing the image screening method has been applied in time series insar analysis over the permafrost landscape in svalbard rouyet to address seasonal phenomena rouyet et al 2019 since snow cover caused serious decorrelation sar images in snowfall seasons were not used in contrast only images in the thawing seasons were applied to estimate the time series deformation over permafrost areas with the dry season only image screening applied in this study it is worthwhile noting that the deformation value represents the amount of soil and sand brought and left behind by river water after a wet season from the ps insar results based on time series image collection including consecutive dry and wet seasons the seasonal deformation is valuable for understanding the dynamic sediment characteristics in particular for the braided river likes the target river additionally as the deformation estimated through ps insar was subsequently used to evaluate sediment volume the deformation was validated by internal and external checks to ensure reliability although the dry season only images were proposed to estimate the deformation occurred along the river way the all season sar images were also employed in ps insar processing for the purpose of internal accuracy check the persistent scatterer points ps points appearing in the common areas less covered by water in the two data sets should have similar deformation values the differences of deformation values of these ps points were used to assess the internal accuracy the external validation was performed against the time series data collected from the nearby gps stations the velocity difference was evaluated through the comparison of the two deformation values once the reliability of the ps insar estimated deformation was confirmed it was used as the basis for the subsequent estimation of sediment volume 3 ps insar estimation of surface displacement 3 1 study area and data the baibufan section of the daan river in taiwan is used as the study area as shown in fig 1 it is located in the middle reaches of the daan river the hydraulic facilities along the baibufan section have been broken many times the most serious one was hit by a typhoon in july 2013 causing the loss of the embankment foundation and damage to the co constructed road the new embankment was rebuilt in 2017 in order to understand the dynamic sediment behavior since then the baibufan section was selected as the target area and the ps insar approach was used to monitor this river section the interferometric wide iw swath mode sentinel 1 sar images with broad spatial coverage short re visiting frequency and moderate spatial resolution was the image source in this study images acquired from 2017 11 to 2021 04 in ascending and descending modes were respectively introduced in ps insar processing specifications are listed in table 1 according to the strategy designed in section 2 the images were distinguished into two categories including dry season only and all season images based on the average rainfall of the study area over the years the wet season is from may to october each year chen and chen 2003 therefore the images covered four dry seasons including 2017 11 2018 04 referred to d1 2018 11 2019 04 d2 2019 11 2020 04 d3 and 2020 11 2021 4 d4 and three wet seasons including 2018 5 2018 10 w1 2019 5 2019 10 w2 and 2020 5 2020 10 w3 together with the ascending and descending modes referred to fig 1 for image coverage extent four sets of images were crossed and processed by ps insar respectively 3 2 processing and validation as stated in the section 2 1 the reliability of the estimated deformation from ps insar is highly related to the asi playing an important role for atmospheric error estimation hence the setting of asi threshold was tested substantially it was noted that for the data set using all season images the number of images was much higher than that of the dry season only data set therefore under the same asi threshold setting the pscs selected in the all season images were more statistically stable but the number of points was less than that in the dry season only set especially in the river channel area temporarily covered by water the sparse pscs weakened the strength of the constructed delaunay triangulation and lead to incorrect estimation of atmospheric error considering the above reasons at the atmospheric correction stage the threshold value of all season set was slightly lower than the one of dry season only data set setting to 0 7 and 0 75 respectively to ensure that enough pscs could be extracted in the river channel area after the atmospheric error correction was completed the asi threshold was set to 0 65 for both data sets at the stage for estimating surface deformation at last in order to filter out low quality scatterers perissin et al 2011 temporal coherence was set to 0 7 to guarantee the reliability of the deformation estimation the ps insar processing results using dry season only ascending descending images and all season ascending descending images are shown in fig 2 before evaluating the internal accuracy we firstly compared the ps insar results derived from four groups in the overall area as expected the number of ps extracted by dry season only data set in the overall study area was more than that of all season set the ps number of dry season only set is to increase about 24 71 734 57 820 57 820 and 17 89 499 76 369 76 369 in ascending and descending imaging modes respectively see table 2 from the ps distribution presented in fig 2 it is observed that they are densely distributed in settlements however for the study area in the river way as outlined in fig 2 dry season only set has significantly more ps points than all season set has and the number of ps in dry season only is about 6 77 981 145 and 3 14 2 081 663 times higher than the number of ps in all season in ascending and descending imaging modes respectively in addition the number of descending ps in dry season only is about 2 12 2 081 981 times higher than that of ascending images these comparison results all indicated that the results estimated by dry season only descending image is the most suitable result for analyzing the study area for the implementation of internal validation we firstly selected the ps points existed in the same locations from the results of dry season only and all season data sets to form the point pair the deformation velocity of these ps points in each point pair were extracted we then subtract the two numbers to get the residual for validation as a result the mean residual of velocity of ascending and descending results were respectively computed as 0 119 mm year and 0 110 mm year as there was only little difference between the two velocities it was demonstrated that ps insar was able to minimize the effects of long temporal baseline to obtain the results similar to the one using all season images this internal validation justified the usage of ps insar results derived from dry season only images the external validation of ps results from dry season only data set was carried out against the data derived from gps stations considering the overlapping location and limited common available operation time we selected data from four gps stations including dosh gs82 nshe and suc2 referred to fig 2 for their location and collected in period of 2017 11 2019 12 in the external validation task as shown in fig 2 the deformation trend of the ps insar results derived from the ascending and descending images is highly consistent as the deformation of ps points represented the displacement in line of sight los direction it was determined that the deformation results over the study area were mainly contributed by the changes in the vertical direction therefore we directly projected the vertical component of the gps data to the satellite direction of the ps according to the sentinel 1 incident angle the projected time series gps data was then compared with the average time series deformation estimated from the ps points within 200 m around each gps station the gps observations were compared with the dry season only ps results as this was the product employed for dynamic sediment analysis the comparison between the gps data and the ascending descending ps insar results is plotted in fig 3 firstly judging by the standard deviation of the displacement surrounding gps stations it is found that the descending result is more precise than the ascending one at nshe dosh and suc2 examining further at the deformation trend the descending ps result and gps observations have a high degree of agreement and is also better than that of ascending result based on the root mean square error rmse listed in table 3 it is known that the external accuracy of ps insar results using descending images falls within 1 7 2 2 mm although the ps insar analysis adopting linear modelling fails to capture non linear deformation such as the subsidence occurred in suc2 in april 2018 and april 2019 the overall performance of ps insar is still reliable in conclusion after internal and external validations the consistency and reliability of ps results derived from dry season only descending sentinel 1 images were proved 4 spatiotemporal sediment change along the river way based on the evaluation summarized in the section 3 2 the deformation derived from the dry season only descending sentinel 1 images was following used for sediment change analysis as the ps points were discrete and discontinuous in space we performed a densification of ps points by local analysis rocca et al 2015 to derive 5 054 ps points in addition a 50 m by 50 m grid surface was produced to cover the study area a spatial intersection was performed based on 5 054 ps points and 1 183 grids each grid was then filled with the mean of the deformation values of the ps points spatially intersecting the grid the change of sediment volume could be also estimated based on this grid surface due to the inclusion of long term series of ps insar processing we have the flexibility to extract results of different time lengths to examine the sediment change as listed in fig 4 two temporal units including a hydrological season of 18 months including a wet season and a dry or wet season of 6 months were used to inspect the sediment change along the target river section the corresponding rainfall data was collected from shuang qi station which is the nearest one in the study area referred to fig 1 for its location firstly we composed three hydrological seasons hss spanning dry wet dry seasons including 2017 11 2019 04 hs1 2018 11 2020 04 hs2 and 2019 11 2021 04 hs3 from the image coverage period of 2017 11 2021 04 referred to fig 4 from the ps insar results produced by dry season only images the deformation values caused by deposition temporary store or flush during these three hydrological seasons were extracted respectively the deformation maps of the three hydrological seasons are illustrated in fig 5 showing the spatial distribution of the sediment along the river way in different seasons 1 obvious deposition accumulated in the river reaches in the downstream direction of the target area in the hs2 and hs3 periods the phenomenon is also observed in the map of hs1 although the distribution range is not as wide as the ones in the other two hss it is revealed that the region is prone to deposition 2 although it is mainly deposition in the downstream section relative apparent deposition and erosion exist in the common local area outlined by the red dashed circle in all three deformation maps 3 after hs1 and hs2 deposition and erosion were randomly distributed in the middle and upstream reaches of the target area after h3 different from the geomorphology pattern shown in the maps of hs1 and hs2 there was a relatively large erosion area this erosion may be related to the low rainfall in hs3 4 a large scale local erosion occurs in the region outlined by the red dashed circle in the east side of the target area to the upstream direction but it is also mixed with small scale deposition secondly we split each hydrological season into the dry wet and dry seasons and extracted corresponding deformation for each grid the resultant deformation maps are shown in fig 6 take the hs1 as an example the overall deformation distribution and values are displayed in fig 5 a now we are able to separately observe the sediment behavior in the study area after each dry and wet season for the convenience of description two dashed lines were drawn to divide the target area into three reaches specific findings include 1 obvious differences are observed in the sediment distribution after the dry and wet seasons significant erosion is mostly only seen in the wet seasons 2 after the dry season large scale deposition zones appear in the downstream west of the dashed line on the left the deposition pattern of d3 and d4 is similar where the area is more prominent while the ones of d1 and d2 are smaller compared with d2 the deposition location in d1 is more towards the middle of the target area fig 6 a 3 after the dry season the sediment change is moderate in the middle section of the target area between the two dashed lines it is visualized that the erosion area is larger than the deposition which is especially obvious after the d4 fig 6 g 4 after the dry season of d1 d2 and d3 the deposition and erosion are randomly distributed in the upstream east of the dashed line on the right however a deposition clustering zone is observed in the upstream in the map of d4 fig 6 g 5 a random distribution of deposition and erosion is observed along the river after the three wet seasons however it is noted that more areas with severe erosion existed after the w2 fig 6 d 6 after w3 in the middle section of the river target area to the upstream there is a deposition clustering zone the deposition also occurs in the same location after d1 and d2 7 a number of local erosion or deposition zones are observed in the same areas such as zones a c and e outlined by red dashed circles it is worthwhile noting as these areas are close to levee facilities 8 spatial heterogeneity is visualized in the zone b in d1 and d3 where serious erosion is surrounded by deposition grids 9 it is found that a significant deposition frequently occurs in zone d fig 7 b 7 d f where an apparent small scale erosion is around through a visual inspection based on the deformation maps with coarse and fine temporal resolution it allows us to see detailed spatiotemporal characteristics of sediment in daan river as demonstrated above it is highlighted that the method proposed in this study is able to provide a regular and extensive observation on sediment change of the river way the seasonal sediment change maps can be a useful tool to monitor the sediment behavior 5 discussion 5 1 relationship between precipitation water coverage and sediment volume change since sediment behavior is closely related to water coverage for a further inspection we produced a water coverage map along the river way according to the temporal coverage of river water to achieve this a total of 85 sentinel 2 multi spectral images taken from 2017 10 to 2021 04 were used to calculate the time series normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 over the study area referred to fig 8 for examples of ndwi maps the pixels whose ndwi was over 0 were treated as water coverage in which changes in water and non water covers on the river way can be clearly observed subsequently the 50 m by 50 m grid cells were again introduced as the base to extract the time series ndwi after counting the number of times that each grid was covered by water we used the quartile classification method to classify the grids for the grids whose water coverage times were greater than the q3 value they were classified as the high water coverage area grids with water coverage between q2 q3 or less than q2 respectively belonged to the median and low water coverage areas the q2 and q3 were 9 and 31 respectively and the water coverage map is illustrated in fig 7 the grids of high and median water coverage areas are mostly located along the main river channels while the low water coverage area are located in the bare sandy areas outside the river channels or the areas covered by vegetation for the purpose of analyzing the association between the deformation and the water cover only the grids spatially intersected with the ps points were following used based on the deformation value in each grid and the grid size the sediment volume could be computed it should be noted that although the deformation in each grid represented the displacement in los direction the deformation trend of the ps insar results derived from the ascending and descending images is highly consistent it could be determined that the deformation results over the study area were mainly contributed by the changes in the vertical direction therefore we used the incident angle θ inc 39 3235 degrees in the eq 4 to convert the deformation into the vertical direction hastaoglu 2016 given that the area of each grid was 2 500 m2 by multiplying the grid area by the vertical deformation the volume of sediment change that occurs in each grid was derived 4 v h v los cos θ inc the relationship among precipitation water coverage and sediment volume change was firstly investigated on a hydrological season time scale the change of overall sediment volume over the high median low water coverage areas in the three hydrological seasons are listed in table 4 comparing the mean deformation rate the second season hs2 is of the highest subsidence in high and median water coverage areas to investigate the reason for this we summed up the cumulative rainfall of the three hydrological seasons which were 2 244 mm 3 123 mm and 1 432 mm fig 4 and found a reasonable fact that the higher the cumulative rainfall over the analysis period the higher the river runoff and the increased erosion and transport capacity in the river channel in other words the results of the ps insar analysis pointed out a positive correlation between the amount of cumulative rainfall and surface change within the river way the areas where a negative impact on the stability of the river slope and the riverbed deposit along with cumulative rainfall increasing could be visualized in the maps referred to fig 5 furthermore the cumulative changes of sediment volume together with the deformation statistics over the three water coverage areas in each season are listed in table 5 with a finer time scale improved from a hydrological season it is realized that erosion was still predominant in almost all seasons in all three water coverage areas also both serious subsidence and deviation occurred in high water coverage area however based on the analysis performed within the finer temporal period it is noted that the most serious erosion occurred in the wet season from 2019 04 to 2019 11 in hs2 during the period sediment erosion volume occurred in the high and median water coverage areas respectively reached 1 513 652 m3 and 1 194 829 m3 meanwhile it is also worthwhile noting that deposition happened for the first time in all seasons and the volume reached 412 649 m3 in order to understand the reason causing such a serious dynamic change we linked the cumulative rainfall listed in fig 4 it is found that the highest precipitation of 2 344 mm in the whole study period was also occurred in the wet season 2019 04 2019 11 through the analysis the understanding of the correlation between river sediment behavior and rainfall could be highly improved in addition the total sediment volume change over this river section for each dry or wet season can be introduced as the initial value for sediment transportation simulations given that the most serious sediment change was formed after the period from 2019 04 to 2019 11 w2 we used the gridded deformation map fig 6 d to further demonstrated its potential benefits in sediment behavior investigations firstly as the sar images in wet season were excluded in the ps insar processing four ndwi maps were employed to illustrate the land cover change in the w2 period as shown in fig 8 the geomorphological changes in the main river are reflected as observed in fig 8 a at the end of the dry season the channel width is narrow and the area of high water cover is small the width of the main channel and the high water cover gradually increase as time enters the wet season fig 9 b d as the gradient of this section of the river levels off new channel tributaries begin to form in previously dry areas the characteristics of braided river is clearly demonstrated secondly a spatial clustering analysis anselin 1995 was performed based on the gridded deformation map to extract significant hotspots of subsidence and uplift indicating erosion and deposition zones respectively fig 8 from the location of the hotspots and the change of river channel it is observed that the mounded areas are primarily located on both sides of the original river terrace braided rivers are usually located in wide channels unstable banks and shallow water it is because the supply of sedimentation is greater than the capacity of river transportation without external forces on the river the temporal features of the braided river in the landscape are expected to facilitate ps insar geomorphological change detection the four ndwi maps in fig 8 show a high correlation between the river channel changes and the erosion deposition zones identified by the hotspot analysis in which the major erosion areas in the ps insar analysis mostly coincide with the meandering river line after the wet season based on the method the time series regions of deposition and erosion over dry and wet seasons can be extracted the sediment transportation can be further inspected it is beneficial for the rivers where local sediment observations are not available the analysis is also applicable for examining the engineering effectiveness of the levee facilities baibufan levee a 1 km long levee completed in 2017 as pointed out in fig 8 was constructed to be set back 30 m into the land based on the deposition zone in front of the baibufan levee appeared after the w2 it was demonstrated that the design of the levee prevents foundation erosion and contributes to the stability of the levee 5 2 time series deposition erosion analysis in addition to the spatial clustering of erosion and deposition sediment behavior with high temporal resolution is investigated based on the time series insar analysis we selected three regions close to the upstream the baibufan levee and the downstream of the study area marked as r1 r2 and r3 respectively in fig 8 b and presented the time series sediment trend the water coverage level as shown in fig 7 was also considered in the analysis in fig 9 a the sediment variability characteristics of r1 can be identified within the high water coverage area located in the mainstream channel during the dry seasons of 2017 2020 taking the trend of the dry season in 2017 2017 11 2018 4 as the baseline indicated by the red line by observing the green line it is realized that the erosion occurred in the streambed in the dry season in 2018 as abundant rainfall 2 344 mm as listed in fig 4 was accumulated in the wet season in 2019 the overall downwash on the riverbed was evident and the trend can be observed along the blue line the black line following demonstrates that the riverbed did not continue to wash downwards but remained on the same datum in 2020 next the characteristics of the high riverbank over r2 close to the baibufan levee is demonstrated in fig 9 b given the grids we investigated are located in low water coverage area and also in riverbank deposition zone it is expected to observe ground uplift which is obviously reflected by the blue line illustrated in fig 9 b after the rainfall accumulation in the wet season in 2019 not only the overall ground uplift is clear the peaks of deposition in early november 2019 mid january 2020 and end april 2020 are also obvious however the trend of the black line reveals that the deposition is less serious in the dry season of 2020 2021 which might be caused by low rainfall in the wet season in 2020 from the perspective of hydraulic engineering it is beneficial to observe no bank erosion after heavy rainfall occurred close to the baibufan levee as shown in fig 9 c the trends of deposition or erosion in r3 are complicated as the selected grids are distributed in high and median water coverage areas for which they are presented by solid and dashed lines respectively for high water covered area we notice a similar trend to the ones in fig 9 a where the four trend lines are divided into two groups the red and green lines are in one group while the blue and black lines are in another group it is inferred that the rainfall accumulated in the wet season in 2019 caused comparable erosion in the upstream and downstream of the study area however from the dashed lines illustrated grids over median water covered area such phenomenon is not clear instead the blue and black dashed lines are close to the red and green lines as the location of these median water covered grids is away from the main stream the erosion caused by plentiful rainfall in 2019 does not spread to the areas indicating the sediment transportation caused by the flow is less significant as the monitoring can be conducted regularly the analysis demonstrated above is feasible for supporting hydrological management authorities to examine the potential for rapid topographic changes within the river the results can assist governments in determining whether additional sediment control is required to prevent flood hazards 6 conclusions and recommendations the main objective of this study was to investigate spatiotemporal characteristics of daan river sediment behavior this was achieved by a two stage processing approach at first ps insar technique together with dry season only sar image selection strategy to firstly estimate the surface deformation along the river subsequently the deformation value was converted into sediment volume through gridding calculation since the overall approach has been approved feasible we summarized three points worthwhile highlighting in this study 1 in order to reduce the limitations for ps insar processing caused by unfavorable atmospheric condition and wide water coverage occurred in wet seasons we proposed the dry season only image selection approach even though the image number introduced to ps insar reduced from 196 to 104 ascending images and from 178 to 99 for descending images see table 1 through the internal and external accuracy examinations it was demonstrated that we still delivered reliable deformation results the image selection strategy could therefore be feasible for time series insar applications in other rivers 2 since the ps insar results derived in this study has been proved reliable we took the advantage of the long term wide extent observation to investigate the sediment behavior over hydrological seasons and relatively shorter wet dry seasons from the analysis reported in the sections 4 and 5 ps insar and the resultant deformation maps were proved to be a useful technique and products for spatiotemporal sediment investigation although other techniques capable of producing dems is feasible of achieving this the efficiency and cost of our method outperform others 3 in our study area the baibufan section in daan river we identified the specific areas prone to deposition or erosion in different seasons to further analyze sediment behavior we classified the study area into high median low water coverage areas we also collected the cumulative rainfall as discussed in the section 5 the relations between sediment event water coverage and precipitation were established spatial hotspots indicating deposition and erosion zones were also presented to demonstrate the added value of the products based on these findings the following recommendations are proposed which aim for technical improvement and future applications 1 the sar image selection strategy applied in this study indeed helps to improve the performance of ps insar implementation meanwhile as the images acquired in the wet seasons are removed an analysis of sediment change with an improved temporal resolution is not achievable based on the analysis reported in section 3 there were 2 081 and 663 ps points derived respectively from the ps insar using dry season only and all season descending images in order to improve the number and also the distribution of the stable points for detailed sediment investigations other time series insar techniques with different principles of image pair formation such as small baseline subset sbas or stable scatterer selection such as distributed scatterer ds insar will be examined 2 based on the successful application in baibufan section in daan river in this study it is of great potential to employ the same approach to the watershed including the whole river way and surrounding mountainous area in the future research by doing so the balance of soil and sand transportation in the watershed can be evaluated actually the feasibility was already demonstrated in the deformation results over wide area as shown in fig 2 however for such a larger spatial extent with various land cover types insar technical challenges and sar image resolution issue should be addressed then 3 for disaster prevention purpose the amount of sediment transportation by streams in southern taiwan after heavy rains or typhoons often affects the safety of bridge structures downstream for instance the heavy rainfall triggered by typhoon lupit on 2022 8 7 caused an intense debris flow in the yusui stream and destroyed the minbaklu bridge downstream shiu et al 2022 the disaster caused a severe disruption of route 20 for 17 days and created an isolated effect in remote tribes in view of this the soil and water conservation bureau swcb in taiwan has commenced an assessment of unstable sediment production in large scale catchments although it is possible to produce dtms of the streambed in the river channel through multi phase remote sensing satellite observations numerical modelling of debris flow still requires understanding the hotspot and activity of unstable sedimentation area in the streambed the techniques proposed in this study can be applied regularly and precisely to identify the spatial distribution of unsteady sediment declaration of competing interest the authors declare

understanding of n pollution legacy effects and human alteration of landscapes e g dam construction and land use land cover hinders development of efficient n management strategies this study integrated long term 1980 2015 net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs nani and different forms of n exports hydroclimate data dam construction and landscape metrics to elucidate n sources and the factors controlling n fluxes in the yangtze river basin yrb over the 36 year study period annual nani in the yrb increased from 4166 to 8571 kg n km 2 yr 1 riverine concentrations of total nitrogen tn dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved organic nitrogen don increased 3 fold 3 fold and 36 fold during 1980 2015 respectively whereas riverine particulate nitrogen pn decreased by 90 such long term riverine n export dynamics were driven by elevated nani landscape configuration change and dam construction activities inclusion of these variables in multiple linear regression models explained 91 83 and 96 of the annual variability in riverine din don and pn fluxes respectively estimated riverine tn flux from sum of predicted din don and pn fluxes showed high agreement with measured values r2 0 92 nash sutcliffe coefficients 0 91 indicating strong efficacy for the developed regression models separation of annual riverine n exports into current year nani versus legacy source contributions indicated that legacy sources contributed 49 26 82 51 1 78 95 87 98 and 56 36 86 of riverine din don pn and tn exports respectively the release of legacy n from the landscape is associated with increases in dam construction urban density and the number of small area farm operations between 1980 and 2015 this study highlights the potential of aggregating multiple historical n input datasets along with changes in land use and river regulation to model long term riverine n export dynamics the results of the study provide a foundation for developing integrated watershed n

identification nutrient legacy effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen n is an essential element for living organisms and is often recognized as a critical factor limiting ecosystem primary production especially in agricultural systems galloway et al 2004 in the past several decades enhanced human activities have significantly elevated global n inputs to the terrestrial biosphere increased 3 5 times to sustain increasing global needs for food and energy green et al 2004 chen et al 2018 excess n inputs decrease ecosystem n use efficiency leading to increased nutrient leaching that may trigger degradation of aquatic ecosystems such as harmful algae blooms coastal eutrophication and hypoxia galloway et al 2004 to develop effective n management strategies to protect aquatic ecosystem health it is necessary to understand riverine n export dynamics and accurately quantify n sources as the largest river in the eurasian continent the yangtze river yrb has the large population 400 million and its watershed hosts intensive industrial and agricultural activities that generate half of china s gross domestic product causing severe eutrophication in the yangtze river and coastal waters liu et al 2018 during the 2000 2010 period there were 500 red tide events in the lower reaches of the yangtze river estuary and its adjacent coastal waters as well as regular development of a coastal dead zone due to oxygen depletion shen et al 2011 therefore a range of mechanistic and lumped models e g global news din enps lsb marina image gnm and sirpat have been developed or adapted to quantify n dynamics and sources in the yrb yan et al 2010 wang et al 2011 strokal et al 2016 liu et al 2018 chen et al 2019 cui et al 2021 although these models achieve satisfactory model performances they identified very different n source contributions to yrb riverine export e g non point source pollution contributed 35 to 99 hindering the establishment of efficient n control measures yao et al 2021 these discrepancies in model results may arise from considerable input and mechanistic uncertainties including different n input accounting methods used by the various models moreover the lack of explicit mechanisms to describe legacy n contributions and the effects of human activities e g dam construction and landscape configuration across this highly heterogeneous watershed creates great uncertainties excessive anthropogenic n inputs coupled with the long response time for hydrological and biogeochemical n cycling processes lead to considerable n accumulation in global watersheds chen et al 2018 legacy n pools stored in soil sediments and groundwater can slowly move through the watershed before being discharged in streamflow tesoriero et al 2013 additionally the increasing dam reservoir capacity over the past decades has strongly altered n transport and biogeochemical processes in global basins maavara et al 2020 causing increased interception of large riverine n loads from 6 tg yr 1 in 1900 to 33 tg yr 1 in 2000 responding to hydroclimatic factors and human activities the large amount of legacy n retained in soil sediment and groundwater pools contributes to riverine exports with a significant lag period chen et al 2018 van meter et al 2018 several watershed scale models such as the exploration of long term nutrient trajectories model van meter et al 2017 soil water assessment tool lag model ilampooranan et al 2019 and net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs nani based models chen et al 2014 2016 meng et al 2021 were developed to identify legacy source contributions to riverine n export these modeling results highlight how the lag effect associated with legacy n sources contributes to the apparent ineffectiveness of various n reduction plans or beneficial management practices to immediately decrease riverine n loads despite the rapid increase in reservoir impoundment in recent decades maavara et al 2020 there is a paucity of studies addressing the long term effects of dam construction on the fate and transport of riverine n especially the various forms of n e g particulate vs dissolved organic vs inorganic within the yrb chen et al 2016 combined nani and water discharge to simulate the long term riverine din dynamics however they did not explore the impacts of increasing dam capacity yang et al 2018 on regulating riverine n dynamics legacy n sources contributing to riverine export are dependent on both the magnitude of legacy n pools and the watershed processes affecting the transport from source zones to surface waters chen et al 2018 goyette et al 2019 hydrological and biogeochemical processes are strongly regulated by the spatial characteristics e g land use cover composition and landscape configuration of watersheds goyette et al 2019 while several studies have reported the relationship between land use patterns and water quality variability liu et al 2012 wu and lu 2021 the current understanding of how spatial characteristics regulates legacy n release is still limited there are only a few studies attempting to identify the effects of landscape composition and configuration on legacy n transport meng et al 2021 for example areas with a higher proportion of human activities agricultural and residential lands retain transform and release more n than wildland ecosystems landscape configuration reflects physical distribution and spatial heterogeneity e g aggregation and fragmentation levels of landscapes mcgarigal et al 2012 which affects n transport by further mediating water generation exchange and storage processes liu et al 2020 therefore including landscape characteristics and configurations is important to accurately describe n sources transformation and transport processes across heterogeneous watersheds especially with regard to legacy n dynamics this study investigated a 36 year record 1980 2015 of riverine n exports in response to changes in nani dam capacity hydroclimate and landscape metrics in the yrb our primary objectives were to i examine the historical trends of nani and different forms of riverine n export tn total n pn particulate n din dissolved inorganic n don dissolved organic n ii develop empirical models that include the n legacy effect and riverine terrestrial n transport processes and iii identify legacy n source contributions to different n forms and the factors regulating their transformations this study provides a simple but comprehensive model framework that includes both n legacy effects and human activities for simulating long term riverine n fluxes results of this study improve our quantitative understanding of the magnitude of legacy n contributions and the factors controlling legacy n release thereby guiding development of strategies to improve watershed n management and remediation at the watershed scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area

non point sources increased from 2642 to 6094 kg n km 2 yr 1 between 1980 and 2015 whereas nanip i e dominantly point sources increased from 1524 to 2477 kg n km 2 yr 1 during the same period fig 2 in terms of individual sources chemical fertilizer n input was the dominant source contributing 51 41 55 of the total annual nani chemical fertilizer input increased from 1712 to 4532 kg n km 2 yr 1 in 1980 2015 with the highest rate of change occurring between 1980 and 1996 128 and the lowest rate of change occurring between 1996 and 2015 16 fig 2 with increasing human and livestock populations nffi increased by 63 from 1524 to 2477 kg n km 2 yr 1 between 1980 and 2015 the abf nad and si components contributed 12 5 and 1 of the total annual nani respectively specifically abf increased from 737 to 922 kg n km 2 yr 1 and nad increased from 172 to 623 kg n km 2 yr 1 while si decreased from 20 to 17 kg n km 2 yr 1 according to the sensitivity analyses nani values were sensitive to animal n consumption rates number of livestock poultry and chemical n fertilizer input fig s5 implying that improving accuracies of these variables can reduce uncertainty of estimated nani 3 2 riverine n export dynamics over the 1980 2015 study period riverine tn flux increased from 833 kg n km 2 yr 1 1 56 mg n l to 2987 kg n km 2 yr 1 5 61 mg n l riverine din nitrate vs ammonium 83 vs 17 don and pn fluxes accounted for 59 28 and 13 of the riverine tn flux respectively as the primary component of riverine n din flux demonstrated an increasing trend from 455 to 1811 kg n km 2 yr 1 and contributed a greater proportion 55 61 of tn over the study period fig s7a riverine din flux was significantly correlated with nanin nanip and dam storage capacity table 3 riverine don flux showed a large increase from 31 to 1139 kg n km 2 yr 1 4 38 of tn and demonstrated significant correlations with nani dam storage and hydroclimatic variables table 3 these correlations imply a considerable influence of anthropogenic n inputs and human regulation on riverine dissolved n exports in the yrb in contrast riverine pn export decreased from 347 to 37 kg n km 2 yr 1 42 1 of tn over the study period riverine pn flux showed significant correlations with dam reservoir storage and water discharge table 3 inferring a potential control by human regulation and hydrology on riverine pn dynamics along with the construction of the jialing dam group capacity 5 60 km3 in the mid 1980 s and three gorges dam capacity 39 3 km3 in 2003 riverine pn fluxes decreased by 30 and 40 respectively fig s7b the random forest analysis explained 69 91 of the variation in riverine n exports and identified the potential impacts of land use type and landscape configuration as potential controlling factors fig 3 the major landscape metrics impacting tn and din flux were lpi of the residential land lpi res and lsi of the agricultural land lsi agr further the pd of residential land pd res and lpi of agricultural land lpi agr were identified as important factors affecting riverine don and pn fluxes these results imply that the residential and agricultural land configuration associated with different n sources influences n exports in the yrb 3 3 modeling and forecasting riverine n fluxes combining the regression and random forest analyses presented above we further developed regression

the temporal variability of observed riverine tn fluxes in 1980 2015 fig 4d indicating a strong efficacy for the developed regression models these model formulations provide a robust and reasonable performance for predicting annual riverine tn fluxes relative error 13 31 based on eqs 3 5 we forecasted riverine n export loads for the 2016 2045 period by setting baseline values at 2015 levels for v nanin nanip and landscape metrics with the assumed six scenarios table 2 under the developing scenario although riverine din 8 and pn 38 fluxes would decrease tn flux is predicted to increase by 30 in 2045 due to a 90 increase in don flux fig 4 under the tackling nonpoint and tackling point scenarios riverine n fluxes showed a decreasing trend 7 to 35 under the landscape develop scenario although riverine din and pn fluxes would decrease by 50 and 7 respectively tn flux will increase 2 along with a considerable increase 82 in don flux in comparison the din flux will increase 44 under the landscape backward scenario while don pn and tn fluxes will decrease 85 38 and 8 respectively fig 4 3 4 source apportionment of riverine n fluxes by setting nanin and nanip as 0 in eq 3 and 4 riverine din and don fluxes were apportioned to legacy sources flegacy and current year inputs fcy given the large dam capacity that retains the majority of pn from soil erosion and runoff from impervious surfaces in the yrb the pn flux was separated into fcy by setting to no pn contribution from dams and flegacy hu et al 2020 over the 1980 2015 period the average legacy contributions to riverine din don pn and tn fluxes were 49 ranges 26 86 51 1 78 95 87 98 and 56 36 83 respectively the fcy contributions to riverine din and tn fluxes showed a significant increasing trend fig 4 the random forest analysis table 4 showed that the 17 anthropogenic factors e g dam construction and landscape configuration influenced the contributions from different sources to riverine n exports legacy n and current year inputs for the legacy n contribution dam capacity residential area and lpi agr were the most important variables influencing din flegacy whereas lpi res dam capacity and residential area were the most important variables influencing don flegacy the pn flegacy was primarily influenced by pd res lpi agr and lsi res table 4 in comparison the din fcy increased along with the increase of lpi res lsi agr and residential area the don fcy increased with decreasing pd res lsi res and lpi agr although the random forest analysis showed that pd agr pd for and lsi agr were major factors influencing pn fcy no significant correlation was observed between pn fcy and these factors this is probably due to the small pn contribution from the current year mean 5 2 13 fig 4c 4 discussion 4 1 long term fate of nani the nani determined for the yrb in this study was higher than previous estimates 3537 8177 kg n km 2 yr 1 in 1980 2012 chen et al 2016 which we attribute primarily to the use of a higher resolution dataset county scale yao et al 2021 the calculated multi year average nani for the yrb 6993 kg n km 2 yr 1 was much higher than that for mainland china 3791 kg n km 2 yr 1 in 1980 2015 han et al 2014 and northeastern u s watersheds 2370 kg n km 2 yr 1 during the early 1990 s boyer et al 2002 specifically nani in the lower reach of the yrb up to 41600 kg n km 2 yr 1 was much higher than some previously identified nani hot spots such as the dianchi basin southwestern china 9900 kg n km 2 yr 1 in 2000 2010 gao et al 2014 and the huai river basin central china 25400 kg n km 2 yr 1 in 2003 2010 zhang et al 2015 the persistent high level of nani led to the yrb becoming a hotspot for n export and accumulation during 1980 2015 study period 27 of total nani was exported by rivers which is within the range of global studies 15 30 boyer et al 2002 swaney et al 2012 chen et al 2016 the fates for the remaining 73 of nani can be ascribed to denitrification dam reservoir burial soil vadose zone retention and accumulation in groundwater swaney et al 2012 chen et al 2016 previous studies indicated denitrification as a potentially important pathway for nani removal within nearby the yrb 10 43 of n inputs chen et al 2014 for example a field scale experiment conducted in cropland soils of the yrb reported that soil denitrification consumed 15 of nani yan et al 2011 with another 3 of nani denitrified during riverine transport in the yrb liu et al 2015 liu et al 2018 model results assigned 13 of nani to retention by sediment burial in reservoirs lakes and streams the fate of the remaining 45 of nani in the yrb may be transient storage in soils vadose zone groundwater wood product export and or retention in forest biomass chen et al 2014 maavara et al 2020 it is estimated that 240 tg n accumulated in soil vadose zone groundwater and sediments during the 1980 2015 period field experiments within the yrb reported that 30 of the chemical n fertilizer 15 of nani was stored in soils xia et al 2010 with soil n contents increasing 19 44 over the past several decades yuan et al 1993 zhao et al 2016 4 2 factors controlling riverine n export dynamics the correlation analysis and random forest results fig 3 table 3 infer that riverine n dynamics were primarily regulated by nani dam reservoir capacity and landscape configuration metrics with different n forms controlled by contrasting factors specifically the increasing pattern of the riverine din flux can be attributed to the elevated nani and enhanced n transformation processes from other n forms e g pn and don in soil and sediment chen et al 2018 the positive impact of nanip table 3 implies potential point source contributions to riverine din export total sewage discharge in the yrb was estimated to increase from 2 0 1010 mt to 3 5 1010 mt between 1998 and 2015 li 2011 and showed a similar trend to din flux the increase of riverine din flux was also derived from increasing nanin table 3 originating from agricultural runoff and groundwater primarily in the form of nitrate chai et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 physical disturbance and alternation of soil moisture contents promote the transformation of legacy n accumulated in the soil n pool soil organic matter to nitrate that is readily transported to river systems chen et al 2018 the increasing pool of legacy n in sediments pn and don of dams reservoirs is also susceptible to release as din to surface waters akbarzadeh et al 2019 maavara et al 2020 in addition to n sources lpires and lsiagr were identified as the primary landscape metrics controlling the terrestrial transport of nanip and nanin to surface waters fig 3a this is consistent with several previous studies that determined impacts of landscape composition and configuration on the magnitude of n sources and terrestrial transport to rivers yu et al 2016 wu and lu 2021 therefore the increasing n inputs from current year nani and the considerable release of legacy n pools groundwater soil and sediments due to changes of landscape configurations and river regulation mainly controlled the riverine din dynamics in the yrb riverine don dynamics were also regulated by n sources dam building and landscape configuration increased sewage discharge mainly ammonium and don in the yrb li 2011 provides an increasing source of riverine don over the study period the negative and positive relationships of riverine don flux with pd res r2 0 79 p 0 01 and residential land area r2 0 77 p 0 01 respectively suggest that intensification and expansion of residential lands contributed to the increase of riverine don load fig 3c the decomposition of vegetation litterfall and metabolites animal plant and microbial residues and the leaching of soil organic matter are known to be important sources of riverine don flux kalbitz et al 2000 further soil erosion from agricultural lands with large organic nitrogen accumulation was demonstrated to be an important source of don to river systems berhe and torn 2017 the negative relationship between lpi agr and riverine don r2 0 79 p 0 01 infers an effect resulting from agricultural land consolidation on reducing n loss a recent study concluded that the consolidation of agricultural lands to larger field size 16 ha in china could reduce total n inputs by 24 and increase n use efficiency by 18 duan et al 2021 additionally increasing dam reservoir storage lowers flow velocities decreased by 86 and increases hydraulic residence time increased by 200 in the yrb thereby promoting the growth of phytoplankton and a subsequent release of don upon algal biomass decomposition chen et al 2018 maavara et al 2020 for example qiu and ye 2011 reported that phytoplankton biomass in the yangtze river increased by 2 5 fold from 50 000 to 100000 250000 cells l 1 following three gorges dam impoundment further gu et al 2015 demonstrated that degradation of algae cells 107 cells released 0 07 0 42 mg of don documenting the contribution of algae to don in eutrophic systems therefore riverine don dynamics were mainly regulated by the increasing sewage discharge expansion of residential lands fragmented farmlands and dam construction that increase the release of legacy n pools soil organic n and sediments in the yrb the decreasing riverine pn fluxes were primarily controlled by factors regulating transport processes such as construction of dams reservoirs rather than nani the observed negative relationship between nani and riverine pn flux was likely affected by the increasing dam capacity that intercepts a large amount of the riverine pn flux table 3 the lower water flow velocity within reservoirs decreases sediment transport capacity resulting in the deposition of sediments and associated nutrients akbarzadeh et al 2019 hu et al 2009 reported that three gorges dam intercepted 170 mt yr 1 sediments with an average interception efficiency of 75 therefore riverine pn dynamics were largely controlled by the dam interception 4 3 legacy n source dynamics due to the increasingly built up legacy n pools legacy n sources contributed to high proportions of riverine n exports in yrb over the study period fig 4 estimated legacy n source contributions to tn flux in yrb were within the range reported in adjacent chinese watersheds 35 85 chen et al 2014 2016 meng et al 2021 north american and european watersheds 23 85 van meter and basu 2017 liu et al 2021 sarrazin et al 2022 there were significant differences among anthropogenic factors regulating the release and transport of legacy n from source zones to river systems table 4 chen et al 2018 especially the landscape configuration and dam construction mediating hydrological e g water residence time recession process and flow paths and biogeochemical processes e g decomposition mineralization nitrification and denitrification specifically the majority of the pn flux was derived from legacy sources 95 including sources from soil erosion and reservoir sediments the flegacy in pn was positively correlated with pd res and lsi res but negatively correlated with lpi res and dam capacity table 4 smaller pd res and lsi res values represent aggregation and larger patches of residential lands table 1 which might reduce surface runoff and soil erosion contributing pn zhang et al 2019 the increase of dam capacity resulted in enhanced pn interception from soil erosion and runoff from impervious residential surfaces a considerable amount of legacy pn can be derived from the soil organic n pool which is reported to retained 40 60 of applied fertilizer n in agricultural soils jenkinson et al 2004 sebilo et al 2013 and 25 95 of n inputs in residential soils groffman et al 2004 whitall and paerl 2001 notably the pn intercepted by dams reservoirs maybe transformed to other forms e g don din thereby becoming an important n source of other n forms in downstream river segments liu et al 2018 this study estimated that legacy n sources contributed 26 82 of the riverine din flux which was comparable to previous estimates in the yrb 29 51 chen et al 2016 given the considerable n retention in the yrb nitrate leaching from mineralization of soil organic n and discharge from groundwater are likely legacy sources for the din flux hamilton 2012 tomich et al 2016 depending on the magnitude of soil organic n and groundwater n pools climatic conditions soil properties and human disturbance the legacy sources will elevate din concentrations in river systems for several years to decades tesoriero et al 2013 chen et al 2018 additionally the transformation of legacy n pools in reservoir sediments can produce considerable din that diffuses upward into the water column thereby becoming an important riverine n source zamora et al 2013 the flegacy contribution showed decreasing trends over time highlighting the increasing importance of fcy as a contributor to din and tn fluxes fig 4a the exponential relationship between nani and riverine din flux r2 0 84 n 36 indicates an increasing export rate for current year n along with the elevated nani in the yrb fig 4a we posit that the accumulation of n 40 retention in the yrb over the past decades resulted in an increasing degree of n saturation in soils groundwater and decreasing n retention efficiency swaney et al 2012 chen et al 2018 legacy n contributions to the don flux showed large variations 1 78 compared with other n forms fig 4 which may be due to the multiple transport processes occurring along the terrestrial landscape to river channel pathway as well as increasing dam reservoir storage that invoke complex biogeochemical transformations that consume produce don maavara et al 2020 sources of legacy don were primarily assigned to soil erosion and leaching from croplands that have experienced considerable soil organic n accumulation berhe and torn 2017 and from increasing urban areas e g urban parks street trees and lawns receiving n fertilizer zhao et al 2006 the random forest analysis showed that flegacy in dissolved forms din and don was positively correlated with residential area and lpi res and dam capacity table 4 the significantly increased lpi res 8 times and residential area 1 times and decreased lsi res values indicated the increasingly compact development of large cities fenta et al 2017 which were consistent with reported 20 increase of the built up area in large cities of china e g chongqin nanjin yangtze river delta etc during 2001 2018 sun et al 2020 the dramatic urbanization may increase legacy n in groundwater gu et al 2013 and the leaching of don from urban parks grasslands thompson and kao kniffin 2019 lpi agr was negatively correlated with flegacy in dissolved forms table 4 implying that fragmented and small size agricultural lands tend to release more legacy n fluxes to river wu and lu 2021 moreover smaller lpi values were associated with higher stream flow and base flow contribution liu et al 2020 which increased nitrate contributions from groundwater reservoir impoundment prolongs the hydraulic residence time which promotes organic n settling on sediments and dissolved nutrient uptake or sorption the longer residence time also provides a greater opportunity for the transformation of pn and soil organic n in sediment to dissolved n akbarzadeh et al 2019 which can be released to downstream by perturbation of natural and artificial regulations beusen et al 2016 maavara et al 2020 increased water temperature in reservoirs associated with decreased ss and elevated light penetration may further enhance microbial transformations of pn to din in reservoir sediments he et al 2016 4 4 the efficiency of developed multiple regression models the developed regression models eq 3 5 incorporating n sources landscape configuration metrics hydrological and river regulation factors provided efficient predictions for riverine n fluxes the regression models in this study r2 0 83 0 96 nse 0 80 0 95 relative error 12 49 showed comparable or superior performance for estimating riverine n fluxes with global news din marina image gnm sirpat enps lsb and export coefficient models r2 0 63 0 93 relative error 419 399 ding et al 2010 yan et al 2010 strokal et al 2016 chen et al 2019 cui et al 2021 additionally this study validated model efficiency by comparing simulated tn fluxes to the sum of results from the din don and pn models r2 0 92 p 0 001 providing a simple and effective approach to assess model validation compared to previous nani based models in the yrb chen et al 2016 our models parameterized both terrestrial processes landscape configuration and riverine transport factors interception by dams for quantifying the influence of current year n inputs and legacy n sources on the export of different n forms fig 4 compared to previous modeling studies this study adopted more comprehensive model predictors for developing regression models and conducted a crucial validation step to demonstrate the efficacy of models in the yrb considering the complexities of n biogeochemistry and transport processes in croplands across the yrb the established model provides a reasonable tool for estimating riverine n sources in the yrb the simplicity of these models makes them easily applicable to assess impacts of changing n sources landscape configuration metrics hydrological and river regulation on riverine n export dynamics in spite of the overall good model performance metrics it should be pointed out that some simulated results deviate appreciably from the observed results fig 4 these discrepancies may result from various data sources of riverine n fluxes and n input sources as well as interaction effects of different influencing factors for example the different data sources sm part b for long term tn calculated from tn din ratios liu et al 2018 din most are field measurements and pn calculated from ss and n density coefficients mayer 1998 fluxes have resulted in higher relative errors 84 342 for some simulated don tn din pn fluxes fig 4b the potential interaction effects among different influencing factors for predicting riverine n fluxes might create highly sensitive parameter estimators with inflated variances and improper regression model selection kroll and song 2013 therefore future efforts should collect integrated monitoring river water quality data with increasing sampling frequency biweekly to monthly elwan et al 2018 li et al 2019 to improve the reliability of the developed regression models to avoid the influence of interaction effects of different influencing factors more updated methods e g machine learning can be adopted to predict riverine n fluxes from nani hydrological variables and landscape metrics etc 4 5 implications for watershed n management nitrogen management measures related to current year nani legacy n sources and landscape configuration were identified as important factors for reducing riverine n exports in the yrb given the high chemical n fertilizer application rates 41 55 of nani fig 2 reducing the amount of chemical fertilizers is a key strategy for nani reduction measures such as aggregating agricultural lands and increasing farm size higher lpi agr and smaller lsi agr wu and lu 2021 to improve n use efficiency are expected to improve n fertilizer management and reduce leaching losses thereby achieving both sustainable food production and environmental protection duan et al 2021 the landscape develop scenario showed the highest riverine din export reduction fig 4a and included a decrease of lsi agr that is associated with better farmland planning and management despite the lack of a reduction in the don flux under the tackling nonpoint scenario riverine din and tn fluxes decreased by 35 and 19 in 2045 respectively emphasizing the importance of nonpoint source pollution in regulating riverine n export the landscape develop scenario assuming compact development of large cities higher lpi res fenta et al 2017 projected a considerable increase in don export fig 4b further highlighting the importance of reducing don export from residential areas given the increasing nanip associated with relatively low waste treatment efficiency in china 63 of tn removal efficiency zhang et al 2020 it is warranted to improve the collection and treatment of domestic wastewater tackling point scenario projected to reduce all n forms by 7 to 23 fig 4 this premise is supported by the positive relationship between lpi res and increased residential area during the compact development of large cities and the fcy and flegacy contributions to dissolved n forms table 4 considering the large legacy n pools and their long term contribution to future riverine n fluxes fig 4 strategies should be applied to mitigate legacy n pools for example permeable reactive barrier technology field buffer strips riparian buffers and flow through wetlands could provide efficient n removal from surface and ground waters during transport to river channels van meter et al 2017 sustainable fertilizer management e g effective soil testing programs precision fertilizer management and balanced fertilization should be integrated to optimize uptake of legacy nutrients residing in the soil profile and to reduce new fertilizer requirements chen et al 2018 to reduce the potential negative impacts of reservoir impoundment on riverine n dynamics appropriate hydrologic regulation scheme could be employed bosch 2008 for example balancing water flows between upstream and downstream reservoirs and adjusting water release depths e g epilimnion vs hypolimnion release from reservoirs can decrease hydrologic residence times and nutrient algal export from reservoirs to help mitigate downstream algal blooms maavara et al 2020 5 conclusion this study presents a historically explicit analysis of long term nani and riverine n flux dynamics in the yrb and identifies the primary factors regulating n transformations and transport dynamics over the study period 1980 2015 estimated nani increased from 4166 to 8571 kg n km 2 yr 1 with major inputs from chemical fertilizer 41 55 and net food feed 27 38 despite a significant decrease of riverine pn 89 and ss 74 fluxes riverine din don and tn fluxes increased 3 36 and 3 fold respectively these contrasting trends were associated with changes in n input sources nanin versus nanip enhanced n transformation processes due to increasing reservoir impoundment landscape patterns and progressively increasing legacy n pools while riverine pn was dominantly controlled by river regulation impoundment din and don were regulated by nani dam reservoir capacity water discharge and landscape patterns multiple regression models incorporating nanin nanip dam reservoir capacity water discharge and landscape metrics were highly effective in explaining inter annual variability in riverine din don pn and tn fluxes regression models estimated that legacy n sources contributed 49 51 95 and 56 of riverine din don pn and tn exports during the 1980 2015 period respectively legacy n releases in the yrb were not only dependent on the magnitude of legacy n pools but were also influenced by landscape patterns composition and configuration and river regulation that controlled n transport processes from source zones to river systems the compact development of large cities increased dissolved forms legacy n release while decreased legacy pn release and fragmented and small farm size increased the release of legacy n in dissolved forms the intensive dam construction reduced legacy pn release and transformed considerable pn and soil organic n in sediments to dissolved forms which increased riverine din and don exports integrated n control strategies in the yrb should combine reduction anthropogenic n inputs landscape planning management and legacy n pool mitigation to achieve effective reduce riverine n exports credit authorship contribution statement minpeng hu data curation

2299,a quantitative understanding of different n sources and the factors controlling riverine n fluxes is critical for optimizing water pollution control strategies however the lack of a comprehensive understanding of n pollution legacy effects and human alteration of landscapes e g dam construction and land use land cover hinders development of efficient n management strategies this study integrated long term 1980 2015 net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs nani and different forms of n exports hydroclimate data dam construction and landscape metrics to elucidate n sources and the factors controlling n fluxes in the yangtze river basin yrb over the 36 year study period annual nani in the yrb increased from 4166 to 8571 kg n km 2 yr 1 riverine concentrations of total nitrogen tn dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved organic nitrogen don increased 3 fold 3 fold and 36 fold during 1980 2015 respectively whereas riverine particulate nitrogen pn decreased by 90 such long term riverine n export dynamics were driven by elevated nani landscape configuration change and dam construction activities inclusion of these variables in multiple linear regression models explained 91 83 and 96 of the annual variability in riverine din don and pn fluxes respectively estimated riverine tn flux from sum of predicted din don and pn fluxes showed high agreement with measured values r2 0 92 nash sutcliffe coefficients 0 91 indicating strong efficacy for the developed regression models separation of annual riverine n exports into current year nani versus legacy source contributions indicated that legacy sources contributed 49 26 82 51 1 78 95 87 98 and 56 36 86 of riverine din don pn and tn exports respectively the release of legacy n from the landscape is associated with increases in dam construction urban density and the number of small area farm operations between 1980 and 2015 this study highlights the potential of aggregating multiple historical n input datasets along with changes in land use and river regulation to model long term riverine n export dynamics the results of the study provide a foundation for developing integrated watershed n management strategies that address both current and legacy n pollution keywords yangtze river net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs nani water quality modeling landscape metrics pollutant source identification nutrient legacy effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen n is an essential element for living organisms and is often recognized as a critical factor limiting ecosystem primary production especially in agricultural systems galloway et al 2004 in the past several decades enhanced human activities have significantly elevated global n inputs to the terrestrial biosphere increased 3 5 times to sustain increasing global needs for food and energy green et al 2004 chen et al 2018 excess n inputs decrease ecosystem n use efficiency leading to increased nutrient leaching that may trigger degradation of aquatic ecosystems such as harmful algae blooms coastal eutrophication and hypoxia galloway et al 2004 to develop effective n management strategies to protect aquatic ecosystem health it is necessary to understand riverine n export dynamics and accurately quantify n sources as the largest river in the eurasian continent the yangtze river yrb has the large population 400 million and its watershed hosts intensive industrial and agricultural activities that generate half of china s gross domestic product causing severe eutrophication in the yangtze river and coastal waters liu et al 2018 during the 2000 2010 period there were 500 red tide events in the lower reaches of the yangtze river estuary and its adjacent coastal waters as well as regular development of a coastal dead zone due to oxygen depletion shen et al 2011 therefore a range of mechanistic and lumped models e g global news din enps lsb marina image gnm and sirpat have been developed or adapted to quantify n dynamics and sources in the yrb yan et al 2010 wang et al 2011 strokal et al 2016 liu et al 2018 chen et al 2019 cui et al 2021 although these models achieve satisfactory model performances they identified very different n source contributions to yrb riverine export e g non point source pollution contributed 35 to 99 hindering the establishment of efficient n control measures yao et al 2021 these discrepancies in model results may arise from considerable input and mechanistic uncertainties including different n input accounting methods used by the various models moreover the lack of explicit mechanisms to describe legacy n contributions and the effects of human activities e g dam construction and landscape configuration across this highly heterogeneous watershed creates great uncertainties excessive anthropogenic n inputs coupled with the long response time for hydrological and biogeochemical n cycling processes lead to considerable n accumulation in global watersheds chen et al 2018 legacy n pools stored in soil sediments and groundwater can slowly move through the watershed before being discharged in streamflow tesoriero et al 2013 additionally the increasing dam reservoir capacity over the past decades has strongly altered n transport and biogeochemical processes in global basins maavara et al 2020 causing increased interception of large riverine n loads from 6 tg yr 1 in 1900 to 33 tg yr 1 in 2000 responding to hydroclimatic factors and human activities the large amount of legacy n retained in soil sediment and groundwater pools contributes to riverine exports with a significant lag period chen et al 2018 van meter et al 2018 several watershed scale models such as the exploration of long term nutrient trajectories model van meter et al 2017 soil water assessment tool lag model ilampooranan et al 2019 and net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs nani based models chen et al 2014 2016 meng et al 2021 were developed to identify legacy source contributions to riverine n export these modeling results highlight how the lag effect associated with legacy n sources contributes to the apparent ineffectiveness of various n reduction plans or beneficial management practices to immediately decrease riverine n loads despite the rapid increase in reservoir impoundment in recent decades maavara et al 2020 there is a paucity of studies addressing the long term effects of dam construction on the fate and transport of riverine n especially the various forms of n e g particulate vs dissolved organic vs inorganic within the yrb chen et al 2016 combined nani and water discharge to simulate the long term riverine din dynamics however they did not explore the impacts of increasing dam capacity yang et al 2018 on regulating riverine n dynamics legacy n sources contributing to riverine export are dependent on both the magnitude of legacy n pools and the watershed processes affecting the transport from source zones to surface waters chen et al 2018 goyette et al 2019 hydrological and biogeochemical processes are strongly regulated by the spatial characteristics e g land use cover composition and landscape configuration of watersheds goyette et al 2019 while several studies have reported the relationship between land use patterns and water quality variability liu et al 2012 wu and lu 2021 the current understanding of how spatial characteristics regulates legacy n release is still limited there are only a few studies attempting to identify the effects of landscape composition and configuration on legacy n transport meng et al 2021 for example areas with a higher proportion of human activities agricultural and residential lands retain transform and release more n than wildland ecosystems landscape configuration reflects physical distribution and spatial heterogeneity e g aggregation and fragmentation levels of landscapes mcgarigal et al 2012 which affects n transport by further mediating water generation exchange and storage processes liu et al 2020 therefore including landscape characteristics and configurations is important to accurately describe n sources transformation and transport processes across heterogeneous watersheds especially with regard to legacy n dynamics this study investigated a 36 year record 1980 2015 of riverine n exports in response to changes in nani dam capacity hydroclimate and landscape metrics in the yrb our primary objectives were to i examine the historical trends of nani and different forms of riverine n export tn total n pn particulate n din dissolved inorganic n don dissolved organic n ii develop empirical models that include the n legacy effect and riverine terrestrial n transport processes and iii identify legacy n source contributions to different n forms and the factors regulating their transformations this study provides a simple but comprehensive model framework that includes both n legacy effects and human activities for simulating long term riverine n fluxes results of this study improve our quantitative understanding of the magnitude of legacy n contributions and the factors controlling legacy n release thereby guiding development of strategies to improve watershed n management and remediation at the watershed scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area

develop and landscape backward were adopted to simulate the potential trends of nani dam capacity and landscape configuration table 2 fig 4 specifically the developing scenario assumes a 13 increase of nanin 23 increase of nanip and 30 increase in dam capacity relative to 2015 similar to trends in past decades as well as a 35 increase of lpi res and a 14 26 and 2 decrease of lsi agr pd res and lpi agr relative to 2015 respectively the dam building scenario incorporates a 30 increase in dam reservoir capacity with constant nani and landscape metrics relative to 2015 under the tackling nonpoint and tackling point scenarios nanin and nanip are projected to decrease 29 1785 kg n km 2 yr 1 and 36 903 kg n km 2 yr 1 respectively under the landscape develop scenario lpi res increased 35 while lsi agr pd res and lpi agr decreased 14 26 and 2 respectively under the landscape backward scenarios lpi res decreased 26 while lsi agr pd res and lpi agr decreased 16 35 and 2 respectively a

increased from 4166 kg n km 2 yr 1 in 1980 to 8571 kg n km 2 yr 1 in 2015 average 6993 kg n km 2 yr 1 annual nani rapidly increased by 79 between 1980 and 1996 and then slowly increased by 15 from 1996 to 2015 p 0 001 fig 2 annual nani presented a strong positive relationship with population density r2 0 89 p 0 001 and livestock density r2 0 95 p 0 001 yao et al 2021 annual nanin i e dominantly non point sources increased from 2642 to 6094 kg n km 2 yr 1 between 1980 and 2015 whereas nanip i e dominantly point sources increased from 1524 to 2477 kg n km 2 yr 1 during the same period fig 2 in terms of individual sources chemical fertilizer n input was the dominant source contributing 51 41 55 of the total annual nani chemical fertilizer input increased from 1712 to 4532 kg n km 2 yr 1 in 1980 2015 with the highest rate of change occurring between 1980 and 1996 128 and the lowest rate of change occurring between 1996 and 2015 16 fig 2 with increasing human and livestock populations nffi increased by 63 from 1524 to 2477 kg n km 2 yr 1 between 1980 and 2015 the abf nad and si components contributed 12 5 and 1 of the total annual nani respectively specifically abf increased from 737 to 922 kg n km 2 yr 1 and nad increased from 172 to 623 kg n km 2 yr 1 while si decreased from 20 to 17 kg n km 2 yr 1 according to the sensitivity analyses nani values were sensitive to animal n consumption rates number of livestock poultry and chemical n fertilizer input fig s5 implying that improving accuracies of these variables can reduce uncertainty of estimated nani 3 2 riverine n export dynamics over the 1980 2015 study period riverine tn flux increased from 833 kg n km 2 yr 1 1 56 mg n l to 2987 kg n km 2 yr 1 5 61 mg n l riverine din nitrate vs ammonium 83 vs 17 don and pn fluxes accounted for 59 28 and 13 of the riverine tn flux respectively as the primary component of riverine n din flux demonstrated an increasing trend from 455 to 1811 kg n km 2 yr 1 and contributed a greater proportion 55 61 of tn over the study period fig s7a riverine din flux was significantly correlated with nanin nanip and dam storage capacity table 3 riverine don flux showed a large increase from 31 to 1139 kg n km 2 yr 1 4 38 of tn and demonstrated significant correlations with nani dam storage and hydroclimatic variables table 3 these correlations imply a considerable influence of anthropogenic n inputs and human regulation on riverine dissolved n exports in the yrb in contrast riverine pn export decreased from 347 to 37 kg n km 2 yr 1 42 1 of tn over the study period riverine pn flux showed significant correlations with dam reservoir storage and water discharge table 3 inferring a potential control by human regulation and hydrology on riverine pn dynamics along with the construction of the jialing dam group capacity 5 60 km3 in the mid 1980 s and three gorges dam capacity 39 3 km3 in 2003 riverine pn fluxes decreased by 30 and 40 respectively fig s7b the random forest analysis explained 69 91 of the variation in riverine n exports and identified the potential impacts of land use type and landscape configuration as potential controlling factors fig 3 the major landscape metrics impacting tn and din flux were lpi of the residential land lpi res and lsi of the agricultural land lsi agr further the pd of residential land pd res and lpi of agricultural land lpi agr were identified as important factors affecting riverine don and pn fluxes these results imply that the residential and agricultural land configuration associated with different n sources influences n exports in the yrb 3 3 modeling and forecasting riverine n fluxes combining the regression and random forest analyses presented above we further developed regression models for predicting riverine n fluxes din don and pn nanip point source potential and nanin nonpoint source potential combined with dam capacity v km3 water discharge q km3 year and key landscape

in annual riverine din fluxes with a nse value of 0 89 between simulated and observed values fig 4 a equation 4 explains 83 of the variation in annual riverine don export with an nse of 0 80 fig 4b calibrated equation 5 accounts for 96 of the variation in annual riverine pn export with an nse of 0 95 fig 4c annual riverine tn flux estimated as the sum of din don and pn explained 92 nse 0 91 of the temporal variability of observed riverine tn fluxes in 1980 2015 fig 4d indicating a strong efficacy for the developed regression models these model formulations provide a robust and reasonable performance for predicting annual riverine tn fluxes relative error 13 31 based on eqs 3 5 we forecasted riverine n export loads for the 2016 2045 period by setting baseline values at 2015 levels for v nanin nanip and landscape metrics with the assumed six scenarios table 2 under the developing scenario although riverine din 8 and pn 38 fluxes would decrease tn flux is predicted to increase by 30 in 2045 due to a 90 increase in don flux fig 4 under the tackling nonpoint and tackling point scenarios riverine n fluxes showed a decreasing trend 7 to 35 under the landscape develop scenario although riverine din and pn fluxes would decrease by 50 and 7 respectively tn flux will increase 2 along with a considerable increase 82 in don flux in comparison the din flux will increase 44 under the landscape backward scenario while don pn and tn fluxes will decrease 85 38 and 8 respectively fig 4 3 4 source apportionment of riverine n fluxes by setting nanin and nanip as 0 in eq 3 and 4 riverine din and don fluxes were apportioned to legacy sources flegacy and current year inputs fcy given the large dam capacity that retains the majority of pn from soil erosion and runoff from impervious surfaces in the yrb the pn flux was separated into fcy by setting to no pn contribution from dams and flegacy hu et al 2020 over the 1980 2015 period the average legacy contributions to riverine din don pn and tn fluxes were 49 ranges 26 86 51 1 78 95 87 98 and 56 36 83 respectively the fcy contributions to riverine din and tn fluxes showed a significant increasing trend fig 4 the random forest analysis table 4 showed that the 17 anthropogenic factors e g dam construction and landscape configuration influenced the contributions from different sources to riverine n exports legacy n and current year inputs for the legacy n contribution dam capacity residential area and lpi agr were the most important variables influencing din flegacy whereas lpi res dam capacity and residential area were the most important variables influencing don flegacy the pn flegacy was primarily influenced by pd res lpi agr and lsi res table 4 in comparison the din fcy increased along with the increase of lpi res lsi agr and residential area the don fcy increased with decreasing pd res lsi res and lpi agr although the random forest analysis showed that pd agr pd for and lsi agr were major factors influencing pn fcy no significant correlation was observed between pn fcy and these factors this is probably due to the small pn contribution from the current year mean 5 2 13 fig 4c 4 discussion 4 1 long term fate of nani the nani determined for the yrb in this study was higher than previous estimates 3537 8177 kg n km 2 yr 1 in 1980 2012 chen et al 2016 which we attribute primarily to the use of a higher resolution dataset county scale yao et al 2021 the calculated multi year average nani for the yrb 6993 kg n km 2 yr 1 was much higher than that for mainland china 3791 kg n km 2 yr 1 in 1980 2015 han et al 2014 and northeastern u s watersheds 2370 kg n km 2 yr 1 during the early 1990 s boyer et al 2002 specifically nani in the lower reach of the yrb up to 41600 kg n km 2 yr 1 was much higher than some previously identified nani hot spots such as the dianchi basin southwestern china 9900 kg n km 2 yr 1 in 2000 2010 gao et al 2014 and the huai river basin central china 25400 kg n km 2 yr 1 in 2003 2010 zhang et al 2015 the persistent high level of nani led to the yrb becoming a hotspot for n export and accumulation during 1980 2015 study period 27 of total nani was exported by rivers which is within the range of global studies 15 30 boyer et al 2002 swaney et al 2012 chen et al 2016 the fates for the remaining 73 of nani can be ascribed to denitrification dam reservoir burial soil vadose zone retention and accumulation in groundwater swaney et al 2012 chen et al 2016 previous studies indicated denitrification as a potentially important pathway for nani removal within nearby the yrb 10 43 of n inputs chen et al 2014 for example a field scale experiment conducted in cropland soils of the yrb reported that soil denitrification consumed 15 of nani yan et al 2011 with another 3 of nani denitrified during riverine transport in the yrb liu et al 2015 liu et al 2018 model results assigned 13 of nani to retention by sediment burial in reservoirs lakes and streams the fate of the remaining 45 of nani in the yrb may be transient storage in soils vadose zone groundwater wood product export and or retention in forest biomass chen et al 2014 maavara et al 2020 it is estimated that 240 tg n accumulated in soil vadose zone groundwater and sediments during the 1980 2015 period field experiments within the yrb reported that 30 of the chemical n fertilizer 15 of nani was stored in soils xia et al 2010 with soil n contents increasing 19 44 over the past several decades yuan et al 1993 zhao et al 2016 4 2 factors controlling riverine n export dynamics the correlation analysis and random forest results fig 3 table 3 infer that riverine n dynamics were primarily regulated by nani dam reservoir capacity and landscape configuration metrics with different n forms controlled by contrasting factors specifically the increasing pattern of the riverine din flux can be attributed to the elevated nani and enhanced n transformation processes from other n forms e g pn and don in soil and sediment chen et al 2018 the positive impact of nanip table 3 implies potential point source contributions to riverine din export total sewage discharge in the yrb was estimated to increase from 2 0 1010 mt to 3 5 1010 mt between 1998 and 2015 li 2011 and showed a similar trend to din flux the increase of riverine din flux was also derived from increasing nanin table 3 originating from agricultural runoff and groundwater primarily in the form of nitrate chai et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 physical disturbance and alternation of soil moisture contents promote the transformation of legacy n accumulated in the soil n pool soil organic matter to nitrate that is readily transported to river systems chen et al 2018 the increasing pool of legacy n in sediments pn and don of dams reservoirs is also susceptible to release as din to surface waters akbarzadeh et al 2019 maavara et al 2020 in addition to n sources lpires and lsiagr were identified as the primary landscape metrics controlling the terrestrial transport of nanip and nanin to surface waters fig 3a this is consistent with several previous studies that determined impacts of landscape composition and configuration on the magnitude of n sources and terrestrial transport to rivers yu et al 2016 wu and lu 2021 therefore the increasing n inputs from current year nani and the considerable release of legacy n pools groundwater soil and sediments due to changes of landscape configurations and river regulation mainly controlled the riverine din dynamics in the yrb riverine don dynamics were also regulated by n sources dam building and landscape configuration increased sewage discharge mainly ammonium and don in the yrb li 2011 provides an increasing source of riverine don over the study period the negative and positive relationships of riverine don flux with pd res r2 0 79 p 0 01 and residential land area r2 0 77 p 0 01 respectively suggest that intensification and expansion of residential lands contributed to the increase of riverine don load fig 3c the decomposition of vegetation litterfall and metabolites animal plant and microbial residues and the leaching of soil organic matter are known to be important sources of riverine don flux kalbitz et al 2000 further soil erosion from agricultural lands with large organic nitrogen accumulation was demonstrated to be an important source of don to river systems berhe and torn 2017 the negative relationship between lpi agr and riverine don r2 0 79 p 0 01 infers an effect resulting from agricultural land consolidation on reducing n loss a recent study concluded that the consolidation of agricultural lands to larger field size 16 ha in china could reduce total n inputs by 24 and increase n use efficiency by 18 duan et al 2021 additionally increasing dam reservoir storage lowers flow velocities decreased by 86 and increases hydraulic residence time increased by 200 in the yrb thereby promoting the growth of phytoplankton and a subsequent release of don upon algal biomass decomposition chen et al 2018 maavara et al 2020 for example qiu and ye 2011 reported that phytoplankton biomass in the yangtze river increased by 2 5 fold from 50 000 to 100000 250000 cells l 1 following three gorges dam impoundment further gu et al 2015 demonstrated that degradation of algae cells 107 cells released 0 07 0 42 mg of don documenting the contribution of algae to don in eutrophic systems therefore riverine don dynamics were mainly regulated by the increasing sewage discharge expansion of residential lands fragmented farmlands and dam construction that increase the release of legacy n pools soil organic n and sediments in the yrb the decreasing riverine pn fluxes were primarily controlled by factors regulating transport processes such as construction of dams reservoirs rather than nani the observed negative relationship between nani and riverine pn flux was likely affected by the increasing dam capacity that intercepts a large amount of the riverine pn flux table 3 the lower water flow velocity within reservoirs decreases sediment transport capacity resulting in the deposition of sediments and associated nutrients akbarzadeh et al 2019 hu et al 2009 reported that three gorges dam intercepted 170 mt yr 1 sediments with an average interception efficiency of 75 therefore riverine pn dynamics were largely controlled by the dam interception 4 3 legacy n source dynamics due to the increasingly built up legacy n pools legacy n sources contributed to high proportions of riverine n exports in yrb over the study period fig 4 estimated legacy n source contributions to tn flux in yrb were within the range reported in adjacent chinese watersheds 35 85 chen et al 2014 2016 meng et al 2021 north american and european watersheds 23 85 van meter and basu 2017 liu et al 2021 sarrazin et al 2022 there were significant differences among anthropogenic factors regulating the release and transport of legacy n from source zones to river systems table 4 chen et al 2018 especially the landscape configuration and dam construction mediating hydrological e g water residence time recession process and flow paths and biogeochemical processes e g decomposition mineralization nitrification and denitrification specifically the majority of the pn flux was derived from legacy sources 95 including sources from soil erosion and reservoir sediments the flegacy in pn was positively correlated with pd res and lsi res but negatively correlated with lpi res and dam capacity table 4 smaller pd res and lsi res values represent aggregation and larger patches of residential lands table 1 which might reduce surface runoff and soil erosion contributing pn zhang et al 2019 the increase of dam capacity resulted in enhanced pn interception from soil erosion and runoff from impervious residential surfaces a considerable amount of legacy pn can be derived from the soil organic n pool which is reported to retained 40 60 of applied fertilizer n in agricultural soils jenkinson et al 2004 sebilo et al 2013 and 25 95 of n inputs in residential soils groffman et al 2004 whitall and paerl 2001 notably the pn intercepted by dams reservoirs maybe transformed to other forms e g don din thereby becoming an important n source of other n forms in downstream river segments liu et al 2018 this study estimated that legacy n sources contributed 26 82 of the riverine din flux which was comparable to previous estimates in the yrb 29 51 chen et al 2016 given the considerable n retention in the yrb nitrate leaching from mineralization of soil organic n and discharge from groundwater are likely legacy sources for the din flux hamilton 2012 tomich et al 2016 depending on the magnitude of soil organic n and groundwater n pools climatic conditions soil properties and human disturbance the legacy sources will elevate din concentrations in river systems for several years to decades tesoriero et al 2013 chen et al 2018 additionally the transformation of legacy n pools in reservoir sediments can produce considerable din that diffuses upward into the water column thereby becoming an important riverine n source zamora et al 2013 the flegacy contribution showed decreasing trends over time highlighting the increasing importance of fcy as a contributor to din and tn fluxes fig 4a the exponential relationship between nani and riverine din flux r2 0 84 n 36 indicates an increasing export rate for current year n along with the elevated nani in the yrb fig 4a we posit that the accumulation of n 40 retention in the yrb over the past decades resulted in an increasing degree of n saturation in soils groundwater and decreasing n retention efficiency swaney et al 2012 chen et al 2018 legacy n contributions to the don flux showed large variations 1 78 compared with other n forms fig 4 which may be due to the multiple transport processes occurring along the terrestrial landscape to river channel pathway as well as increasing dam reservoir storage that invoke complex biogeochemical transformations that consume produce don maavara et al 2020 sources of legacy don were primarily assigned to soil erosion and leaching from croplands that have experienced considerable soil organic n accumulation berhe and torn 2017 and from increasing urban areas e g urban parks street trees and lawns receiving n fertilizer zhao et al 2006 the random forest analysis showed that flegacy in dissolved forms din and don was positively correlated with residential area and lpi res and dam capacity table 4 the significantly increased lpi res 8 times and residential area 1 times and decreased lsi res values indicated the increasingly compact development of large cities fenta et al 2017 which were consistent with reported 20 increase of the built up area in large cities of china e g chongqin nanjin yangtze river delta etc during 2001 2018 sun et al 2020 the dramatic urbanization may increase legacy n in groundwater gu et al 2013 and the leaching of don from urban parks grasslands thompson and kao kniffin 2019 lpi agr was negatively correlated with flegacy in dissolved forms table 4 implying that fragmented and small size agricultural lands tend to release more legacy n fluxes to river wu and lu 2021 moreover smaller lpi values were associated with higher stream flow and base flow contribution liu et al 2020 which increased nitrate contributions from groundwater reservoir impoundment prolongs the hydraulic residence time which promotes organic n settling on sediments and dissolved nutrient uptake or sorption the longer residence time also provides a greater opportunity for the transformation of pn and soil organic n in sediment to dissolved n akbarzadeh et al 2019 which can be released to downstream by perturbation of natural and artificial regulations beusen et al 2016 maavara et al 2020 increased water temperature in reservoirs associated with decreased ss and elevated light penetration may further enhance microbial transformations of pn to din in reservoir sediments he et al 2016 4 4 the efficiency of developed multiple regression models the developed regression models eq 3 5 incorporating n sources landscape configuration metrics hydrological and river regulation factors provided efficient predictions for riverine n fluxes the regression models in this study r2 0 83 0 96 nse 0 80 0 95 relative error 12 49 showed comparable or superior performance for estimating riverine n fluxes with global news din marina image gnm sirpat enps lsb and export coefficient models r2 0 63 0 93 relative error 419 399 ding et al 2010 yan et al 2010 strokal et al 2016 chen et al 2019 cui et al 2021 additionally this study validated model efficiency by comparing simulated tn fluxes to the sum of results from the din don and pn models r2 0 92 p 0 001 providing a simple and effective approach to assess model validation compared to previous nani based models in the yrb chen et al 2016 our models parameterized both terrestrial processes landscape configuration and riverine transport factors interception by dams for quantifying the influence of current year n inputs and legacy n sources on the export of different n forms fig 4 compared to previous modeling studies this study adopted more comprehensive model predictors for developing regression models and conducted a crucial validation step to demonstrate the efficacy of models in the yrb considering the complexities of n biogeochemistry and transport processes in croplands across the yrb the established model provides a reasonable tool for estimating riverine n sources in the yrb the simplicity of these models makes them easily applicable to assess impacts of changing n sources landscape configuration metrics hydrological and river regulation on riverine n export dynamics in spite of the overall good model performance metrics it should be pointed out that some simulated results deviate appreciably from the observed results fig 4 these discrepancies may result from various data sources of riverine n fluxes and n input sources as well as interaction effects of different influencing factors for example the different data sources sm part b for long term tn calculated from tn din ratios liu et al 2018 din most are field measurements and pn calculated from ss and n density coefficients mayer 1998 fluxes have resulted in higher relative errors 84 342 for some simulated don tn din pn fluxes fig 4b the potential interaction effects among different influencing factors for predicting riverine n fluxes might create highly sensitive parameter estimators with inflated variances and improper regression model selection kroll and song 2013 therefore future efforts should collect integrated monitoring river water quality data with increasing sampling frequency biweekly to monthly elwan et al 2018 li et al 2019 to improve the reliability of the developed regression models to avoid the influence of interaction effects of different influencing factors more updated methods e g machine learning can be adopted to predict riverine n fluxes from nani hydrological variables and landscape metrics etc 4 5 implications for watershed n management nitrogen management measures related to current year nani legacy n sources and landscape configuration were identified as important factors for reducing riverine n exports in the yrb given the high chemical n fertilizer application rates 41 55 of nani fig 2 reducing the amount of chemical fertilizers is a key strategy for nani reduction measures such as aggregating agricultural lands and increasing farm size higher lpi agr and smaller lsi agr wu and lu 2021 to improve n use efficiency are expected to improve n fertilizer management and reduce leaching losses thereby achieving both sustainable food production and environmental protection duan et al 2021 the landscape develop scenario showed the highest riverine din export reduction fig 4a and included a decrease of lsi agr that is associated with better farmland planning and management despite the lack of a reduction in the don flux under the tackling nonpoint scenario riverine din and tn fluxes decreased by 35 and 19 in 2045 respectively emphasizing the importance of nonpoint source pollution in regulating riverine n export the landscape develop scenario assuming compact development of large cities higher lpi res fenta et al 2017 projected a considerable increase in don export fig 4b further highlighting the importance of reducing don export from residential areas given the increasing nanip associated with relatively low waste treatment efficiency in china 63 of tn removal efficiency zhang et al 2020 it is warranted to improve the collection and treatment of domestic wastewater tackling point scenario projected to reduce all n forms by 7 to 23 fig 4 this premise is supported by the positive relationship between lpi res and increased residential area during the compact development of large cities and the fcy and flegacy contributions to dissolved n forms table 4 considering the large legacy n pools and their long term contribution to future riverine n fluxes fig 4 strategies should be applied to mitigate legacy n pools for example permeable reactive barrier technology field buffer strips riparian buffers and flow through wetlands could provide efficient n removal from surface and ground waters during transport to river channels van meter et al 2017 sustainable fertilizer management e g effective soil testing programs precision fertilizer management and balanced fertilization should be integrated to optimize uptake of legacy nutrients residing in the soil profile and to reduce new fertilizer requirements chen et al 2018 to reduce the potential negative impacts of reservoir impoundment on riverine n dynamics appropriate hydrologic regulation scheme could be employed bosch 2008 for example balancing water flows between upstream and downstream reservoirs and adjusting water release depths e g epilimnion vs hypolimnion release from reservoirs can decrease hydrologic residence times and nutrient algal export from reservoirs to help mitigate downstream algal blooms maavara et al 2020 5 conclusion this study presents a historically explicit analysis of long term nani and riverine n flux dynamics in the yrb and identifies the primary factors regulating n transformations and transport dynamics over the study period 1980 2015 estimated nani increased from 4166 to 8571 kg n km 2 yr 1 with major inputs from chemical fertilizer 41 55 and net food feed 27 38 despite a significant decrease of riverine pn 89 and ss 74 fluxes riverine din don and tn fluxes increased 3 36 and 3 fold respectively these contrasting trends were associated with changes in n input sources nanin versus nanip enhanced n transformation processes due to increasing reservoir impoundment landscape patterns and progressively increasing legacy n pools while riverine pn was dominantly controlled by river regulation impoundment din and don were regulated by nani dam reservoir capacity water discharge and landscape patterns multiple regression models incorporating nanin nanip dam reservoir capacity water discharge and landscape metrics were highly effective in explaining inter annual variability in riverine din don pn and tn fluxes regression models estimated that legacy n sources contributed 49 51 95 and 56 of riverine din don pn and tn exports during the 1980 2015 period respectively legacy n releases in the yrb were not only dependent on the magnitude of legacy n pools but were also influenced by landscape patterns composition and configuration and river regulation that controlled n transport processes from source zones to river systems the compact development of large cities increased dissolved forms legacy n release while decreased legacy pn release and fragmented and small farm size increased the release of legacy n in dissolved forms the intensive dam construction reduced legacy pn release and transformed considerable pn and soil organic n in sediments to dissolved forms which increased riverine din and don exports integrated n control strategies in the yrb should combine reduction anthropogenic n inputs landscape planning management and legacy n pool mitigation to achieve effective reduce riverine n exports credit authorship contribution statement minpeng hu data curation
