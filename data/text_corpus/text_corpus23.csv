115,foam injection is a promising option for soil remediation applications however predicting how it will propagate in highly permeable aquifers under groundwater flow is challenging here we have studied pressure and saturation variations during foam propagation a 2d tank packed with 1 mm glass beads was used to study foam injection in highly permeable porous media under lateral flow specifically we evaluated the efficiency of pressure and time domain reflectometer tdr sensors to predict foam propagation using an imaging technique a numerical model coupling two phase flow and surfactant transport was developed to simulate the experimental results this model takes into account the effect of non newtonian behavior of foam surfactant concentration and critical capillary pressure through the definition of the mobility reduction factor mrf the experimental results show that the foam injection pressure first increases with a logarithmic law and then stabilizes this pressure stabilization can be related to the state of pseudo equilibrium between foam generation and destruction we observed an asymmetrical foam propagation due to water lateral flow comparisons of the liquid saturation fields calculated by analysis of tdr probes and estimated by imaging show that the tdr sensors monitor foam propagation well in saturated porous media they can predict the shape of the injected foam contrary to pressure sensors it is possible to capture weak foam behavior using tdr sensors finally the numerical model we have developed correctly captures the shape of foam propagation and its ability to divert water flows this model produces the propagation of the strong foam well and predicts the saturation and pressure fields with good precision keywords non newtonian fluid foam monitoring highly permeable porous media 2d tank numerical simulation 1 introduction foam injection technology has recently been used in porous media for contaminated aquifer remediation processes varying the foam properties liquid content bubble size viscosity interfacial tension capillarity makes it suitable for different applications as a blocking agent it lowers the soil s relative permeability to water in highly permeable layers and diverts the fluid flow to lower permeability layers aranda et al 2020 bertin et al 2017 kovscek and bertin 2003 omirbekov et al 2020b blocking foams can also be used to confine a contaminated area aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020a portois et al 2018 moreover the injected treatment using foam can follow the highly permeable zone and leave the contaminants in the poorly permeable zones glass et al 1988 zhang et al 2009 where the surfactant or traditional water based amendment delivery techniques are not efficient because of the preferential flow as a vectorization agent foam can be used to transport additives and enhance redox reactions additives such as chemicals zhong et al 2011 gases maire et al 2019 bacteria choi et al 2009 and nanoparticles shen et al 2011 as a mobilization agent plug effect desorption foams can be used to desorb and push the pollutant towards a recovery well couto et al 2009 jeong and corapcioglu 2003 longpré girard et al 2016 its non newtonian behavior can mitigate the heterogeneity of the medium and improve remediation yield and rate therefore remediation efficiency is increased in heterogeneous media most porous media faced in soil contamination and remediation applications have a high permeability compared to those usually studied in petroleum reservoir engineering therefore the application of foam flow to highly permeable porous media still faces specific challenges in particular its propagation and stability in highly permeable porous media under groundwater flow is still challenging contrary to foam flow in rock in very highly permeable porous media foam flow depends on the bubble size when the bubble size is much smaller than the pore size foam behaves as a non newtonian shear thinning fluid however increasing the bubble size will drastically decrease the foam s apparent viscosity within a newtonian behavior followed by a gradual transition to shear thinning behavior for higher flow omirbekov et al 2020a in this condition foam flow occurs first with a weak foam regime and then with a strong foam flow regime aranda et al 2020 in the case of highly permeable porous media it is recommended to inject the pre generated foam using a finer porous media to increase the number of foam bubbles and therefore switch faster to the strong regime flow with higher non newtonian behavior aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020a some authors have studied foam injection and propagation in experimental 2d tank setups most of these studies have focused on how heterogeneity and the presence of pollutant or surfactant type and its concentration influence foam behavior bertin et al 2017 bouzid et al 2018 forey et al 2021 longpré girard et al 2016 longpré girard et al 2016 used a small 2d tank to study foam application for mobility control and lnapl recovery they reported a better sweep indicating better mobility control using foam longpré girard et al 2016 bertin et al 2017 used a decametric metallic 2d tank with two lateral glass panes to study foam flow in heterogeneous porous media they showed that foam is generated in the high permeability layer and will divert flow towards the low permeability region bertin et al 2017 a 2d tank setup was used to study the delivery of an oxidant solution into the unsaturated layered porous media with success bouzid et al 2018 forey et al 2021 used a 2d tank equipped with absolute pressure sensors and imaging to study foam reinforced with colloidal particles formation and propagation in the presence of oil using a co injection process they found that solid silica particles can significantly reduce the destruction of foam in contact with oil the interpolation of the pressure sensors allowed them to better analyze the foam formation and propagation forey et al 2021 more recently davarzani et al 2021 performed a series of experiments on decimetric 2d tanks filled with 1 mm glass beads to investigate the blocking effect of foam for soil remediation applications the pre generated foam was injected at the bottom center of the tank they observed the semi circular propagation of the strong foam followed by an asymmetrical weak foam propagation around it the presence of the weak foam means that only few lamellae are stable meaning in turn that resistance to flow is low in this zone moreover they found that foam can completely divert the groundwater flow just after injection however the foam s stability depends significantly on the groundwater flow mainly due to surfactant dilution in the water because of dispersion the results showed that foam can also serve as a means for gas transport more homogeneously in porous media especially for soil remediation applications davarzani et al 2021 real time in situ monitoring and modeling of how foam travels after injection into aquifers is needed to optimize the new remediation process using foam but still missing using pressure and time domain reflectometry tdr sensors could fill this gap wu et al 2012 tested three different cases of pure foam injection foam injection into a silica sand column and foam injection into a column filled with sediment from a real site they performed complex resistivity electrical conductivity and tdr measurements for all these cases in a centimeter scale column they reported the sensitivity of the electrical and tdr signal for monitoring foam flow in unsaturated porous media tdr can capture increasing water content related to the presence of foam in the unsaturated zone the authors concluded that tdr measurements are useful for estimating the water content but they are not sufficiently sensitive to record the small changes in water redistribution at the pore scale wu et al 2012 moreover the presence of the air in unsaturated porous media can disturb the measurements of the tdr in the presence of the foam turning to foam modeling we see two main approaches to modeling flow in porous media zhang et al 2009 mechanistic solve partial differential equations to compute foam texture and empirical modify the gas viscosity to calculate foam mobility the mechanistic approach uses bubble population balance models to accurately assess bubble formation destruction and propagation géraud et al 2017 the population balance models are based on the definition of the number of lamellae as a variable coupled with the equation of two phase flow in porous media the gas mobility can be expressed as a function of the bubble density water saturation and other parameters the dynamic change in foam texture can be captured in the unsteady state regime many different existing formulations are developed to relate the foam viscosity or gas mobility to the bubble density kam and rossen 2003 described bubble generation as a function of the time averaged pressure gradient kam and rossen 2003 most population balance models are based on the lamella creation by the capillary snap off bertin et al 1998 kovscek and radke 1994 myers and radke 2000 ettinger and radke 1992 used the same rate expression to describe the rate of bubble division the second mechanism for creating foam ettinger and radke 1992 recently almajid et al 2021 developed a mechanistic model with the constitutive relation depending on the local pressure gradient permeability and bubble density coming from the pore scale flow properties almajid et al 2021 this can model low and high quality regimes in porous media many other models have been developed to simulate foam flow in porous media like the bubble population balance model falls et al 1988 fergui et al 1998 kovscek and radke 1994 the fractional flow theory zhang et al 2009 the catastrophe theory kam 2008 the percolation theory models rossen 1990 and filtration theory wan et al 2001 most of these models simulate the phenomenon at a pore scale and need a lot of computer power they are useful at small scale to understand the mechanisms and their dependence on some parameters but are difficult to use at the field scale the complexity of the mechanistic model is not necessary if it is known that strong foam will be created kam et al 2007 the fractional flow model is not suitable for some foam flows due to the number of assumptions needed zhang et al 2009 moreover it is difficult to obtain the model parameters from experimental data because of the extrapolation needed empirical models represent the mechanisms of foam formation and destruction on a macroscopic scale and require few parameters compared to mechanistic models such as the population balance models a mobility reduction factor mrf is used to adjust the gas mobility related to foam generation and destruction some studies focused on modifying only the gas viscosity to drive foam mobility they consider the effect of surfactant concentration water saturation gas velocity marfoe 1987 or oil saturation chang et al 1990 islam 1988 on the foam apparent viscosity mohammadi et al 1995 proposed to modify the gas relative permeability to derive foam mobility depending on the surfactant concentration and pressure gradient mohammadi et al 1995 in porous media capillary pressure is a key element in determining foam texture foam texture includes descriptions of bubble size shape and distribution khatib et al 1988 have experimentally shown that there is a transition from strong foam to weak foam at a critical capillary pressure p c it is also possible to link this critical capillary pressure to a critical saturation the value of the critical saturation depends on several parameters such as the permeability of the porous medium the surfactant type and its concentration or the nature of the fluid surrounding the foam this value must therefore be measured experimentally when the pressure exceeds the critical capillary pressure p c it is assumed that the foam is destroyed drastically affecting its mobility a steady state model for the foam water system called the fixed p c model was developed by zhou and rossen 1995 where the limiting capillary pressure is independent of gas and liquid flow zhou et al 1995 in this model the gas mobility at critical capillary pressure p c is a function of the foam quality and the critical water saturation rossen et al 1999 extended the fixed p c model to calculate mrf taking into account the surfactant concentration and this critical saturation rossen et al 1999 cheng et al 2000 modified the proposed equation to include the non newtonian behavior of foam according to gas flow rate cheng et al 2000 this model was modified by dholkawala 2007 adding the phenomenon of foam generation and coalescence dholkawala et al 2007 the reader can look at hematpur et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 for a detailed formulation of the different foam flows in porous media models and their comparisons the best way to model foam flow depends on the available experimental data objectives and available modeling tools as the phenomena studied in this work are at the darcy scale and due to the weaknesses of fractional flow theories we propose an empirical mrf model with mechanistic generalized darcy s law to simulate foam flow in porous media here the mrf model was built upon an existing empirical approach used by cheng et al 2000 considering the effect of the non newtonian behavior surfactant concentration and critical capillary pressure on the foam flow mobility the main advantage of this empiric model for calculating the mrf is needing fewer physical fitting parameters compared to a population balance based model taking into account the most important physical phenomena influencing foam mobility surfactant concentration plays a crucial role in foam stability and also in the mrf value wang et al 2012 therefore it is essential to take into account surfactant transport when modeling foam flow in porous media the surfactant transport in porous media is modeled using the diffusion and advection equations taking into account the dispersion the velocity field for the advection term comes from the solution of darcy s law gas mobility in darcy s law is also a function of the surfactant concentration we propose therefore a strongly coupled model our work gives a better understanding of foam flow in highly permeable aquifers using experimental and numerical approaches the main focus was on pressure and saturation variations during foam propagation a meter scale 2d tank setup filled with 1 mm glass beads was used to model foam injection in highly permeable porous media this 2d tank is a larger and improved version of that described in davarzani et al 2021 with the large scale 2d tank used in this study we could better investigate foam propagation the setup gave us the saturation directly from the imaging thanks to the transparent glass of the tank front the pressure and tdr sensor network proposed in this new 2d tank installed in the rear measured water saturation and pressure the experimental data obtained in this study was used to evaluate the potential of tdr and pressure gauges as tools for monitoring foam injection in the saturated zone the lack of gas in this zone can help to better evaluate the presence of the foam and how it flows in porous media comparing these with saturation fields obtained using imaging can help to better assess the potential of other monitoring techniques the saturation using the tdr sensors and imaging technique and pressure data can be then served to validate the model results the water flow was generated horizontally to model a more realistic foam injection case in the aquifer the pre generated foam was injected at the bottom center of the tank to our knowledge there is a lack of knowledge in the literature concerning the study of foam flow under water flow in a metric scale 2d setup a numerical model coupling two phase foam and water flow and surfactant transport was developed using comsol multiphysics to simulate the experimental results 2 theoretical consideration and numerical model formulation the mathematical formulations we used to simulate foam flow in porous media are as follows we used wang s mixture model wang and beckermann 1993 coupled with an empirical model to represent foam mobility the solute transport equations were used to simulate surfactant transport during foam injection this choice was motivated by the fact that we studied the problem at the two dimensional darcy scale the mixture model is the simplest to be solved numerically because the coupling between the equations is not strong 2 1 two phase flow formulation the conservation of the mass of the mixture can be written as 1 ϕ ρ t ρ u 0 where u is the mixture darcy s velocity m s 1 φ porosity and ρ kg m 3 is the mixture density calculated as below 2 ρ s w ρ w s n w ρ n w 3 ρ u ρ w u w ρ n w u nw where si ui and ρ i are the fluid saturation velocity and density of i w nw phase respectively the mean dynamic viscosity of the two phase mixture pa s is defined as 4 μ ρ ρ w k r w μ w ρ n w k r n w μ n w where k r i refers to the relative permeability of phase i w nw to handle these physical quantities more easily the relative mobility λ r i of phase i is defined as λ r i μ k r i μ i with i w n w 5 λ r w λ r n w 1 darcy s two phase flow equations for isotropic porous media can be written as below 6 u i k int k r i μ i p i ρ i g w i t h i w n w where k int m2 refers to the intrinsic permeability tensor which can be reduced to a scalar permeability k int m2 for an isotropic medium u i m s 1 is the darcy velocities of phase i μ i pa s the fluid dynamic viscosity pi pa its pressure ρ i kg m 3 its density g m s 2 the standard gravitational acceleration the pseudo mixing pressure which was formulated by chavent 1976 reads 7 p λ r w p w λ r n w p n w then we can deduce the mixture darcy s law as 8 u k i n t μ p ρ k g where ρ k kg m 3 the kinetic density of the mixture that is defined by 9 ρ k λ r w ρ w λ r n w ρ n w the mass balance related to the wetting saturation phase sw becomes 10 ϕ s w ρ w t λ w ρ u d c s w ρ k i n t μ λ w λ n w δ ρ g where dc pa s is the capillary diffusion coefficient defined as 11 d c ρ k i n t μ λ w λ n w p c s w since the porosity is constant and the two immiscible fluids jointly fill the void space the sum of the phase saturations must be equal to one 12 s w s nw 1 the effective wetting saturation is usually defined as 13 s e w s w s r w 1 s r w where s r w is the residual wetting phase saturation the difference between the non wetting and wetting pressure is known as the capillary pressure and can be defined as a function of the normalized wetting fluid saturation 14 p c s e w p n w p w we used the van genuchten mualem model to relate the capillary pressure and relative permeability to the wetting phase saturation mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 15 s e w 1 α p c n m where α m 1 and n are the van genuchten soil parameters with m 1 1 n the relative permeability for the wetting and non wetting phase can be written respectively as 16 k r w s e w l 1 1 s e w 1 m m 2 17 k rnw 1 s e w l 1 s e w 1 m 2 m the parameter l has been considered equal to 0 5 which is commonly accepted in this type of porous medium chen et al 1999 mualem 1976 eq 10 describes the two phase flow in association with the equation for conservation of the mass of the mixture eq 1 with three unknowns sw p and pc the system is closed thanks to the constitutive relationships for the capillary pressure and relative permeability eqs 12 17 using the definition of pseudo mixing pressure eq 7 and the definition of capillary pressure it is possible to calculate the pressure gradients of each phase as below 18 p w p λ r n w p c 19 p n w p λ r w p c once the governing equations related to the two phase flows in porous media have been established we must model the behavior of the foam in porous media the following hypotheses are necessary to model foam flow at the darcy scale i foam is considered as a single gas phase zhou et al 1995 ii the mobility of water depends on the water saturation whether or not there is foam zhou et al 1995 and finally iii the mobility of the gas is controlled by the texture of the foam falls et al 1989 foam has a high viscosity that varies depending on how it is generated and destroyed it is therefore necessary to integrate these properties into the equations thus the foam will not be modeled as a two phase structure but as a single non wetting phase affected by a variable mobility reduction factor mrf modifying the phase mobility in the equations the wetting phase will represent only the water around the foam and not the surfactant solution that is part of the foam the gas phase of the foam is considered continuous and the effect of the lamellae is presented by the mrf the mrf is applied to the gas mobility to obtain that of the foam as 20 λ f m λ g m r f where λ fm is foam mobility pa 1 s 1 and λ g gas mobility pa 1 s 1 the resistance factor rf represents the reduction in foam mobility compared to a single phase flow of water therefore the two factors are related as 21 m r f r f μ w μ g mrf is determined experimentally from foam flow in porous columns it is known to depend on several parameters such as porous media petro physical properties surfactant type and concentration and flow condition it is a commonly used key parameter that determines the foam flow regime in porous media the mrf can vary from a few tens for foams with a coarse texture weak foam to hundreds of thousands for foams with a fine texture lee 2014 the case where mrf 1 corresponds to a conventional gas phase flow without foam here we considered that the mrf varies as a function of the multiplication of the maximum mobility reduction and different factors that vary between 0 and 1 this concept has been successfully widely used in different commercial reservoir simulators such as stars cmg eclipse schlumberger company and utchem university of texas at austin 2 2 surfactant transport formulation solute transport is governed by the classic differential advection dispersion equation in porous media 22 ϕ s w c t u c d eff c q s where c is the surfactant concentration mol m 3 d eff the effective diffusion coefficient tensor m2 s 1 u the mixture darcy velocity field m s 1 and qs mol m 3 s 1 a sink or source term since aos is anionic it is assumed that adsorption is negligible on glass beads qs 0 the effective diffusion coefficient tensor includes the contributions of molecular diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion by the effect of flow velocity the values of the effective diffusion coefficient tensor depend on the solute transport regime to evaluate this regime it is necessary to calculate the péclet number as 23 p e d p u d m where dp is the pore mean size of the porous media m dm is the molecular binary diffusion coefficient of aos m2 s 1 in water and u m s 1 the infiltration velocity the péclet number for a water flow applied in this study is in the order of 102 this péclet value shows that the pure mechanical dispersion phenomenon 300 pe 105 is dominant therefore a classical expression was used to calculate the longitudinal and transversal dispersion coefficients delgado 2007 24 d e f f l d m 1 τ 1 8 p e 25 d e f f t d m 1 τ 0 025 p e where d eff l and d eff t are the longitudinal and transversal dispersion coefficients m² s 1 respectively τ is the tortuosity of the medium estimated by the millington and quirk relationship in a saturated medium millington and quirk 1961 τ φ 1 3 26 the molecular diffusion coefficient of aos was deduced from azmi et al 2019 movchan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 and we suggest an average value of dm 10 10 m2 s 1 3 experimental study 3 1 materials and fluids we used 1 mm glass beads to fill the 2d tank the main reason is that the same type and size of glass beads were used in our previous studies aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020a 2020b the measured permeability and porosity of porous media made of these glass beads were 8 4 10 10 m² and 0 37 using beads made of glass means good transparency properties and better visualization of flows and saturation by imaging following the results in aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020a 2020b we used a solution of alpha olefin sulfonate surfactant aos concentrated at 4 cmc for the experiments n2 purity 99 99 and carbon dioxide purity 99 7 were used to generate the foam and reduce the air trapping in the porous column respectively 3 2 experimental setup and procedure 3 2 1 foam generator and 2d tank setup the experimental setup is presented in fig 1 this setup includes a porous column to generate foam the pre generated foam is then injected into the center bottom of a 2d tank filled with glass beads and saturated with water we used a pvc column 10 cm long filled with very fine glass beads 0 1 mm diameter to generate foam this generates a stronger foam with a sharper interface than foam generated using a co injection technique aranda et al 2020 the permeability and porosity of this porous column were 1 1 10 11 m² and 0 38 respectively the aos surfactant solution and n2 gas were co injected using a tee connector into the pre generator to generate foam we used a mass flow controller brooks delta smart ii 0 7 of rate and 0 2 f s to control the gas flow the volume of the surfactant solution was regulated using a peristaltic pump ismatec reglo icc 1 reading the 2d tank length 1 m height 0 6 m and width 0 085 m is composed of a central porous reservoir and two side cavities fig 1 the front part of the 2d tank is made of transparent glass to photograph the foam flow using the light reflected method that transparent glass also allowed us to visualize using photography the rear of the tank was made with a special polymer to plug a network of pressure and tdr time domain reflectometry sensors time domain reflectometry is the most widely used non destructive method to determine the water content of porous media the cavities are separated from the central reservoir using a perforated metal plate the cavities distribute pressure homogeneously across the cavities foam is injected from a center bottom hole 3 125 cm five side connection points help to generate the lateral water flow given the tank depth and the size of the foam inlet small 3d effects near the nozzle may occur but philippe et al 2021 using a smaller 2d tank have shown that this effect can be neglected even for a less stable two phase flow philippe et al 2021 we followed the same experimental protocol as davarzani et al 2021 and as shown in fig 1 we used a primary circuit to inject foam from the bottom the secondary and tertiary circuits were used to create the lateral flow of water and to pump out excess water from the cavities respectively two absolute pressure sensors keller pa 33x accuracy 1 5 pa were placed upstream of the pre generator all circuit pipes were made of pvc and had an inside diameter of 1 4 inch we used the secondary circuit to inject deionized water into the left cavity using a peristaltic pump ismatec reglo icc we injected water at two points into the cavity to obtain a more homogeneous lateral flow two other pipes were used to pump water from the right side cavity these two pipes were installed at the same level as the left cavity s pipes the pumping and injection flow rates were the same in all pipes to ensure a homogeneous and constant lateral flow after injecting foam through the central hole the water level inside the tank increased to keep the water level constant the excess water was pumped using two pipes tertiary circuit installed in each cavity at the saturated zone surface the pumped water weight was measured using a mass balance sartorius mse8201s precision 0 1 g from this we calculated the volume of foam injected into the 2d tank we used a photography system installed in a darkroom this system includes a high resolution camera of 45 7 megapixels of brilliant resolution with a 105 mm focal length lens and a spotlight to photograph the foam injection process installed in a darkroom a standard grey scale that was attached to the tank surface allowed the images to be calibrated a set of 25 tdr probes and 25 absolute pressure sensors are inserted in the back part of the tank to measure the saturation and pressure fields inside the porous media in the 2d tank tdr devices are electronic and transmit the wave by two parallel embedded metal rods waveguides these waveguides are connected to the tdr via a coaxial cable tdr works based on the travel time of high frequency electromagnetic signals into the medium the dielectric permittivity of the medium is then calculated using the reflected signals dielectric permittivity is a physical property that characterizes the degree of electrical polarization of material under the influence of an external electric field a tdr device directly measures the relative permittivity which is defined as the ratio of the real effective dielectric permittivity and the free space permittivity relative permittivity is the ability of a material to obtain intrinsic polarization the tdr probes used for this device were ech2o 5te manufactured by meter group 1 from 1 to 40 15 measurement from 40 to 80 with dimensions of 10 cm 3 2 cm waveguides 5 cm long and 0 5 cm wide and a range between 1 air and 80 water these probes use a wave of frequency 70 mhz and the value of the relative permittivity measured corresponds to an average over a square mesh with 5 cm sides centered on the probe the complex dielectric permittivity consists of two parts a real and an imaginary part however at high frequencies the imaginary part is negligible glover 2015 heimovaara et al 1994 the permittivity of a porous medium is strongly related to polar molecules like water due to electric polarization and dipolar polarization of the water molecule the relative permittivity dielectric constant of water is about 80 while most of the soil particles have relative permittivity values between 2 and 7 and that of air is equal to 1 consequently the relative permittivity of porous media can be used to estimate the water saturation the tdr device should be calibrated to determine the relationship between the measured porous media s effective relative permittivity and the water saturation the existing empirical formulations can also be used to estimate the water saturation in some cases using empirical relationships e g topp et al 1980 or theoretical models such as the complex refractive index model crim birchak et al 1974 endres and knight 1992 roth and attinger 1990 the absolute pressure sensors are of the keller pr 21 y type with an accuracy of 7 5 mbar the locations of the probes in the 2d tank are shown in fig 2 the first and second digits of the sensor name correspond to its row counting from the top of the tank and its column starting from the left of the tank respectively 3 2 2 experimental procedures the 2d tank was filled up completely with 1 mm glass beads deionized water was then injected through the center bottom injection point with a very low flow rate 2 0 ml min this low flow rate injection ensures stable water flow upward and avoids air being trapped in pores we left a small unsaturated zone in the 2d tank to avoid any water spill from the top see fig 1 a lateral flow of 1 4 m day was created using the secondary circuit a blue dye was injected from the left cavity to verify the homogeneity of the lateral flow the foam generator was first filled with 0 1 mm glass beads to avoid any air trapping co2 was injected before injecting water and then surfactant cs 4 cmc into the column finally n2 gas and the surfactant solution were co injected into the column with a foam quality of 85 and a total flow rate of 4 ml min as soon as we observed the strong foam at the column outlet and the pressure signal before the foam generator becomes stable the foam was directed to the 2d tank at the same time the tertiary pipes evacuated any water excess before and during the experiment photographs were also taken before and during the foam injection permittivity and pressure values were recorded every 30 s using a campbell scientific data logger cr6 3 3 data analysis 3 1 1 image analysis we used light reflection methods lrm see alazaiza et al 2016 to obtain the relationship between light intensity and liquid saturation a linear relationship between the optical density and liquid saturation in foam can be considered davarzani et al 2021 27 s w α o d β where coefficients α and β are then calculated from two calibration images where the saturations are known we used an image of foam zone near the injection point sw 0 05 and a second image before foam injection sw 1 to find these coefficients values the transmitted light can be related to the sum of the measured reflected light intensity ir and the light intensity reflected by a perfectly white surface ii flores et al 2011 kechavarzi et al 2000 schincariol et al 1993 stimson 1974 28 o d lo g 10 i r i i once the saturation was calculated all meshes were colored according to their gray intensity then the intensity and saturation fields could be discretized the saturation slices of 0 0 1 0 1 0 3 0 3 0 5 0 5 0 7 0 7 0 9 0 9 1 were selected and a color scale linked the saturation values to a range of color from white to blue for more details on image analysis the reader can refer to davarzani et al 2021 for foam flow and colombano et al 2020 2021 luciano et al 2010 o carroll et al 2004 philippe et al 2020 2021 for non aqueous phase liquid flow 3 3 2 tdr data acquisition and calibration in this study an empirical relationship was used to obtain the water content θ w from the relative permittivity data topp et al 1980 29 ε θ 3 57 31 7 θ 114 θ 2 68 2 θ 3 where θ is the volumetric liquid content and ε the relative permittivity of the bulk system measured using a tdr sensor by performing a 3rd order polynomial regression on the inverse of this function for θ w 0 0 4 we get r 2 0 9998 30 θ w ε 1 06 10 5 ε 3 7 54 10 4 ε 2 2 95 10 2 ε 9 11 10 2 each probe was then calibrated independently by performing a linear relationship from two measurements where the liquid content is known θ 0 dry porous medium and θ ϕ porous medium saturated with water since the values depend on the arrangement of the glass beads this calibration was done before each experiment 4 results and discussions 4 1 experimental results demonstration this section discusses how pressure changes at the injection point and the pressure and saturation fields the saturation fields measured by tdr are compared with those estimated using image analysis 4 1 1 injection pressure the foam was injected under the same conditions throughout the experiment fig 3 shows how injection pressure changes as a function of time we observed a steady increase in pressure followed by signal stabilization this phenomenon can be explained in two complementary ways aging of the foam at the level of the displacement front which causes a local decrease in the apparent viscosity and a reduction in water saturation at the level of the injection zone which leads to an increase in local capillary pressure to its critical value if we consider that the aging of the foam at the level of the displacement front is weak then from measuring the pressure field we can evaluate the critical capillary pressure this depends on the formulation of the foam its quality and the properties of the porous medium since all of our experiments were carried out with the same parameters it is possible to deduce the critical capillary pressure p c as 31 p c p f o a m p l where p f o a m is the stabilizing pressure of the foam during the experiments and pl is the pressure of the liquid depending on the hydrostatic pressure in the tank because there is no water flow at the injection level thus it is possible to conclude that the critical capillary pressure of this foam in a porous medium of 1 mm glass beads is approximately 195 mbar this value is in the same order of magnitude found in the literature for unconsolidated porous media khatib et al 1988 during the early stages of the injection the pressure development follows a logarithmic law see fig 3 this is the behavior that should be observed in the case of the injection of a viscous fluid together with propagation in the form of a perfect half disk these measurements are therefore in agreement with the observations showing that the shape of the strong foam is a half disk 4 1 2 saturation and pressure fields fig 4 shows how the liquid saturation changes over time on line 3 of the tdr probes line 3 contains five tdr probes and is in the middle of the tank values greater than 1 and less than 0 are due to measurement accuracy which is around 0 1 for the saturation related to the permittivity measurement precision 1 the initial permittivity values glass beads fully saturated by water were varied between 16 and 20 according to the position of the sensors in the 2d tank and could fall to a value close to 3 e g for sensor 5 3 after foam injection once the foam reaches and fills the measurement radius of a probe the saturation value decreases until it reaches a value close to 0 since measurement precision is 0 1 we conclude that the liquid saturation after passing the foam is between 0 and 0 1 these values are in good agreement with the measurements carried out in columns aranda et al 2020 where the liquid saturation ranged between 0 03 and 0 1 after a steady state foam flow was reached these values also show the shape of the foam propagation quite well the center tdr probe at 3 3 is the first to measure a decrease in saturation and to reach the final value of liquid saturation then the saturation falls respectively in sensors 3 2 3 4 then 3 1 probe 3 5 is hardly affected by the foam flow this is coherent with the spherical shape of the foam propagation with an asymmetric extension on the left side due to the lateral flow which has been already observed by photographs and by calculating the aspect ratio see davarzani et al 2021 the rapid and smooth decrease in the saturation on the 3 3 probe shows that the foam flows as a strong foam with a defined front the 3 1 sensor shows behavior more like a mixture of weak foam and gas the decrease in saturation is slower and marked by sudden variations this is due to the arrival of a train of gas bubbles in the area of the probe which abruptly reduces the liquid saturation since the weak foam front propagates more diffusely than the strong foam the decrease observed is slow however the saturation decreases until it reaches a value close to those measured for the strong foam the displacement of water by the weak foam is therefore comparable to that achieved by the strong foam in a slower regime we show in fig 5 the saturation and pressure fields in the 2d tank after t 10 h 20 h and 29 h of injection using data from the 25 probes pressure fields are calculated by subtracting the hydrostatic pressure so that only the pressure variations due to foam injection and lateral flow are shown spatial interpolation between probes was performed using the kriging method davis and sampson 1986 implemented in tecplot a commercial software package these fields are compared to the photographs in the background consistent with what has been observed with the injection pressures presented above the pressure field inside the 2d tank also remains stable even if the front propagation continues to progress since the critical capillary pressure is reached at the injection point which corresponds to the maximum pressure of the tank the pressure field stabilizes in accordance with this value these fields also show that the pressure generated by the lateral flow is negligible compared to the pressure generated by the foam flow it can therefore be concluded that the pressure field will not change in the case of a prolonged injection weak foam will be generated in greater quantity to compensate for the increased radius by a loss of viscosity and thus keep the pressure constant because of the distance between the pressure sensors and interpolation precision it is not possible to capture the circular form of the foam using the pressure field interpolating the data over the entire spatial domain does not accurately calculate the position of the front because of the distance between the sensors the kriging interpolation method therefore creates a gradient between the two values aside from the precise location of the front the array of probes provides a correct picture of the reality of foam propagation the saturation values in the strong foam are less than 0 1 saturation is also very low in weak foam with values ranging between 0 1 and 0 3 which are particularly visible in this figure contrary to the pressure sensors it is possible to capture the weak foam behavior using tdr sensors finally the value of liquid saturation decreases very little in areas where the only upward flow of free gas occurs above the zone of strong foam the values are approximately 0 9 in these areas 4 1 3 comparison between tdr measurements and photographic analysis in order to compare and validate the results obtained by the tdr probes and by the photographic analysis the average liquid saturation values on a 5 cm square mesh centered on the position of each tdr probe were calculated by imaging the parameters for the linear relation between optical density and water saturation after image calibration were α 1 54 β 2 98 and iref 19 fig 6 shows these results for row 3 of the 2d tank the saturations calculated from the tdr probes are shown in solid lines and the saturations calculated from the photographic analysis are shown in dotted lines with marks the saturation dynamics were the same with both methods however the values calculated by imaging are slightly shifted in time compared to those measured by tdrs this could be explained by greater sensitivity in the imaging to the movements of free gas that precedes the arrival of the foam front or to a possible 3d edge effect by which the gas bubbles would first move towards the 2d tank front glass in this way the gas would be fully captured by the photographic analysis while the tdr probe would only capture a little gas in its area of influence also the under prediction is more severe for probes 3 3 and 3 4 from the observation we believe that there is more free gas in the center and right side of the tank compared to the left side because of the flow direction these results therefore show the limits of these measurement methods which are very useful for monitoring saturation variations and relating them to the physical phenomena involved in fig 7 we present 2d saturation fields obtained by photographic analysis and tdr probes respectively the same colors are used to represent the same ranges of saturation as noted previously the saturation fields obtained using tdr probes do not allow very precise visualization of the foam front because of the limited quantity of sensors photographic analysis can identify areas of strong and weak foam and the transitions between these areas the advantage of tdr sensors is that they can be used in field monitoring this comparison highlights the fact that the liquid saturation is slightly lower on the bottom part of the tank around the injection point this observation is valid for both methods and shows the presence of the drainage phenomenon at these time and space scales the liquid phase flows down to the tank by gravity resulting in a foam that is wetter than the center of the tank 4 2 model parameters numerical simulation and results 4 2 1 two phase flow hypothesis and estimation of parameters it has been observed experimentally that viscous effects are dominant over capillary effects during foam flow in highly permeable porous media aranda et al 2020 during strong foam fine textured foam flow in highly permeable porous media the foam displacement is quite stable and seems to be piston like aranda et al 2020 this means that p c s w in eq 11 tends towards zero in the van genuchten mualem model for the relative permeabilities eqs 16 and 17 m tends towards 1 chen et al 1999 mualem 1976 however we considered a constant and small value for the capillary diffusion coefficient dc 2 10 5 pa s see eq 10 to improve the model convergence the calculated parameters necessary to solve the above equations numerically are listed in table 2 the wetting phase viscosity and density are those of water at 20 c the non wetting phase is the foam foam is injected at a quality of 85 the estimated density using this gas volume fraction is 150 kg m 3 as seen previously its viscosity is that of gas multiplied by a mobility reduction factor mrf the permeability and porosity of the medium were measured in the laboratory the lateral injection velocity corresponds to the apparent velocity in the 2d tank set at 1 4 m day multiplied by the porosity darcy velocity in this model the lateral flow is reversed to match the experimental data obtained from the back of the 2d tank flow from right to left from the parameters presented in table 2 the viscosity of the invading fluid foam is much higher than the displaced fluid water however the invading fluid density is lower than the displaced fluid according to the stability of the two phase flow criterion glass and nicholl 1996 the intrusion of foam more viscous than water into a water saturated soil is conditionally stable for an upward flow the critical velocity of the fluid front propagation stability between foam and water interface can be written as glass and nicholl 1996 32 u c ρ n w ρ w g k i n t ϕ μ n w μ w from this equation we obtain u c 2 4 10 6 m s which is less than foam injection velocity u inj 7 8 10 5 m s therefore the foam water interface should be stable to stabilize the calculation in eq 10 the capillary diffusion dc was set at 2 10 5 pa s this capillary diffusion creates a capillary fringe at the foam water interface the value chosen is the lowest value leading to stabilization of the model for the optimal mesh according to the experimental results see also davarzani et al 2021 three main phenomena have an impact on the viscosity of the foam in highly permeable porous media the non newtonian behavior the critical capillary pressure and the surfactant concentration the objective is therefore to incorporate these three phenomena into the mrf model 4 2 1 1 non newtonian behavior the non newtonian behavior is modeled from the power law measured in aranda et al 2020 obtained for the same foam and porous media as below 33 μ a p p 5 7 γ 0 56 where μ app is the foam apparent viscosity pa s and γ the shear rate s 1 given that the primary variables are mixed pressure and saturation we introduce the non newtonian behavior in terms of the pressure gradient using the experimental data see appendix b 34 μ a p p 278 p 0 39 where p is the pressure gradient pa m 1 generated during the flow of foam in the column experiment aranda et al 2020 this law can be reformulated by expressing the apparent viscosity as a function of a reference case and the gas viscosity 35 μ a p p μ g m r f r e f p p r e f n p 1 μ g 1 m r f r e f p p r e f n p 1 where μ g is the viscosity of the gas pa s mrfref the reference mobility reduction coefficient at the pressure gradient pref pa m 1 and np the exponent of the power law associated with the pressure gradient equal to 0 61 the equality is valid because with the high foam viscosity m r f r e f p p r e f n p 1 is of the order of 105 1 finally a minimum pressure gradient pmin is introduced to prevent the viscosity from tending to infinity for low pressure gradients thus if p pmin the viscosity becomes constant with regard to the non newtonian behavior such as 36 μ a p p μ g 1 m r f r e f p m i n p r e f n p 1 4 2 1 2 impact of surfactant concentration the impact of the surfactant concentration could not be directly measured experimentally we estimated its effect based on the results obtained by wang et al 2012 the apparent viscosity is equal to that of the gas without the presence of surfactant and increases with concentration until its stabilization around the critical micelle concentration cmc wang et al 2012 the smoothed heaviside function related to the surfactant concentration fc plotted in fig 8 represents the influence of the surfactant concentration it is firstly composed of a ramp going from point 0 0 to point cmc 1 then a stabilization at 1 after the cmc the function is numerically smoothed to be differentiable twice at any point 4 2 1 3 impact of the critical capillary pressure the apparent viscosity drops when the capillary pressure exceeds the critical capillary pressure as the foam coalesces and becomes coarser as observed before this phenomenon can be responsible for stabilizing the injection pressure to represent this a smoothed heaviside function fp is introduced which is equal to 1 up to the critical capillary pressure fixed at the experimentally measured value of 195 mbar then 0 after this fig 9 for the needs of numerical stability this curve is numerically smoothed on a transition zone of p c 5 and is differentiable twice at any point 4 2 1 4 final mrf coefficient the complete mrf incorporating these three phenomena therefore takes the following form 37 if p p m i n m r f 1 m r f r e f p p r e f n p 1 f c c f p p if p pmin 38 m r f 1 m r f r e f p m i n p r e f n p 1 f c c f p p where mrfref is the reference mobility reduction factor to the reference pressure gradient pref pa m 1 p is the pressure gradient pa m 1 pmin the minimum pressure gradient to observe the non newtonian behavior pa m 1 np the exponent of the power law associated with the pressure gradient fc and fp two smoothed heaviside functions varying between 0 and 1 c the surfactant concentration mol m 3 and p the pressure pa the reference pressure gradient was first chosen equal to 1 7 105 pa m 1 which corresponds to a mrfref of 1 5 105 obtained experimentally using a 1d column see aranda et al 2020 however this value was found to be insufficient to match the modeled injection pressure to the experimentally measured one it was necessary to adjust this parameter to match the measured injection pressure the adjusted mrfref value was 4 4 105 this difference can have multiple sources such as the 2d flow hypothesis however mrfref is always of the order of magnitude of 105 the minimum pressure gradient has been set at 1 104 pa m 1 which corresponds to a maximum apparent viscosity of the foam of 24 2 pa s table 1 lists all the parameters used to set up this model 4 2 2 numerical simulation boundary and initial conditions the objective was to model only the behavior of the strong foam the free gas rise and weak foam were not modeled the chosen mesh refined in terms of foam injection and the outlet of the flows makes it possible to obtain a stable model we used comsol multiphysics to solve two phase flow in porous media based on the mixture model however the two phase darcy s law module of comsol does not use the same equations as wang and beckermann s 1993 formulation therefore we modified these equations to be fully matched to the chosen formulation see appendix a we used second order elements for the velocity components and linear elements for the pressure field p2 p1 to discretize the two phase darcy s law equation linear elements were used for the concentration to discretize the diffusion advection equation the simulation domains were discretized by triangular meshes with 7 848 elements under the constraint of maximum and minimum element sizes of 0 01 m and 2 25 10 5 m respectively the mesh is refined at the foam injection boundary and the right border of the domain to a maximum element size of 0 005 m to enhance the model convergence and avoid numerical artifacts the maximum element growth rate was 1 05 we used the backward differentiation formula bdf time stepping method with the free time stepping option free time stepping allows the solver to take larger or smaller time steps as required to satisfy the specified tolerances the solvers will try to take as large a time step as possible but will reduce the time step size when necessary if the solution starts to vary rapidly in time the selected boundary conditions that fulfill the experimental setup conditions for two phase flow are presented in fig 10 on the lower excluding injection segment and upper borders of the geometry we consider that the normal flow velocity is zero in the direction normal to the border the experimental results presented before indeed show that the interface between the unsaturated porous medium and the saturated porous medium is not modified during the experiment therefore there is no normal flow at this interface 39 n ρ u 0 for the left border and the foam injection segment the boundary conditions correspond to a fluid inlet the value of the saturation is imposed as well as that of the pressure indirectly by a velocity this inlet boundary condition reads 40 n ρ u s w ρ w s n w ρ n w u 0 where u 0 is the total injection velocity of the two phases m s 1 the values of sw and u 0 are defined according to the considered border finally the right boundary condition corresponds to the outlet boundary condition of the fluids according to experiments in the 2d tank the pressure is therefore imposed to atmospheric pressure and the contribution of capillary diffusion in the direction normal to the wall is zero n d c s w 0 41 p p a t m where patm pa is the atmospheric pressure the initial saturation and pressure conditions correspond to the tank completely saturated with water and to a zero pressure field in the absence of flow and neglecting gravity 42 s w t 0 1 p t 0 p a t m solute transport is governed by the differential advection diffusion equation in porous media the selected boundary conditions according to the experimental conditions are presented in fig 11 on the lower except the injection segment and upper borders there is no flow in the normal direction there is also no diffusion in this direction a no flux boundary condition was imposed in these boundaries as 43 n d eff c 0 on the injection segment boundary a surfactant concentration was provided by the foam injection a constant flow of concentration on this boundary is therefore imposed this is an inflow boundary condition 44 n d eff c u c n u c i n on the left border the flow of pure water does not provide surfactant the limiting conditions are thus the same as previously but in the form of 45 n d eff c u c 0 on the right border the surfactant can freely flow out of the domain this is a convective boundary condition or outflow 46 n d eff c 0 4 2 3 comparison with experimental results we compared the results obtained by numerical simulation saturation and pressure fields with the results obtained experimentally as the modeling concerns only the flow of the strong foam only the experimental results concerning this situation were analyzed 4 2 3 1 foam propagation shape and blocking effect fig 12 shows the foam saturation field as well as the flow streamlines at t 10 h and t 20 h respectively the capillary diffusion fringe is visible but our interest is focused on the shape of the strong foam represented by a foam saturation equal to 1 foam quality of 85 following the results observed experimentally the foam forms a half disk centered on the injection point the streamlines show that the lateral flow is indeed diverted by the foam flow as shown by the experimental tracing tests davarzani et al 2021 these results show that the implemented equations correctly model the shape of the foam and its ability to divert water flows fig 13 compares the change of the radius of influence roi obtained numerically with the radius of influence measured during the experiment the radius of influence of the foam can be defined as the geometric mean of the lateral radius rh and the vertical radius rh as r o i r h r v the radius of influence obtained by modeling corresponds to the radius at which the foam saturation becomes less than 1 start of the capillary fringe at the beginning of the injection the numerically calculated radius of influence is slightly less than that obtained experimentally this is due to the loss of mass through the numerical capillary fringe it has been observed experimentally that there is very little coalescence at the start of the injection and therefore almost all of the injected mass flows in the form of a strong foam in numerical modeling part of the mass diffuses into the capillary fringe because of the non zero capillary diffusion coefficient for this same reason the numerically calculated radius of influence becomes larger than that measured experimentally at the end of the injection where the coalescence becomes greater while the numerical capillary diffusion remains constant the slight delay before increasing the radius of influence is due to non newtonian behavior in the first moments the pressure gradient is very high at the level of the injection segment and as a result the viscosity is greatly reduced we did not observe this phenomenon experimentally the experimental and numerical fields for roi are quite similar which supports the two dimensional approach hypothesis the maximum measured error is 15 these results also show the limits of such a model where the coalescence at the foam water interface during the injection phase is not modeled 4 2 3 2 pressure fields fig 14 compares the injection pressure obtained from the numerical model with the experimental measurements the decrease in viscosity when the critical pressure is reached function fp in the mrf gives a numeric injection pressure which stabilizes quickly the pressure measured experimentally is subject to further variation this can be explained by complex foam flow behavior in porous media compared to a simplified empiric model e g the compressibility omirbekov et al 2020b avalanches of coalescence events höhler and cohen addad 2005 or preferential foam flow paths the precise simulation of the foam behavior needs the mechanistic approach e g bubble population balance models to accurately assess bubble formation destruction and propagation although our model cannot precisely predict the pressure behavior it does allow us to predict the general behavior of foam flow in porous media e g pressure stabilization from this result we calibrate the rref parameter so that the critical injection pressure is reached almost simultaneously experimentally and by modeling the slight delay at the start of the injection for model results is due to the non newtonian behavior as stated previously fig 15 represents the pressure fields from modeling and the measurements by pressure sensors in the 2d tank the pressure fields from the experiment are established from 26 point measurements and therefore the data are interpolated or extrapolated to get the pressure field hydrostatic pressure has been calculated and subtracted from all measurements we notice that the pressure fields obtained from modeling have a more progressive change over time while the experimental fields hardly show changes after t 20 h the experimental results show a higher gradient contours are more closely packed away from the injection point compared to the model results this can be because of the compressibility effect in a transient regime and the interpolation precision modeling shows that the high pressure zone is very localized at the injection point this area is probably overestimated by the interpolation of the experimental measurements the modeling shows a slight asymmetry in the pressure field from the 2d tank central axis because of the water lateral flow this is partially confirmed by the experimental data the lack of data in the bottom 2d tank boundary may explain the deviation of the experimental pressure field from the half disk form 5 conclusions we studied how foam flows in highly permeable porous media numerically and experimentally in a meter scale 2d tank the pre generated foam was injected through the center bottom of the 2d tank foam propagation was monitored using the light reflected method thanks to the tank s transparent front glass and pressure and time domain reflectometer tdr sensors installed in the rear of the tank the experiments allowed us to study the behavior of the foam flowing in a highly permeable porous medium made of 1 mm glass beads under lateral water flow during the foam injection the pressure increased according to a logarithmic law which is the usual behavior of the pressure profile for radial fluid flow wu and pruess 2000 even if the injection continued the pressure increase diminished and became a quasi plateau this phenomenon can be related to foam coalescence close to the foam propagation front and increasing the local capillary pressure to its critical value near the injection point the fact that the pressure generated by foam can be stabilized during the injection is of great interest for foam injection at the field scale the saturation profile obtained from imaging and tdr sensors showed that the foam propagation was spherical with an asymmetric extension on the left side due to the lateral flow tdr sensors were able to predict the shape of the foam propagation with good precision including strong and weak foam zones the saturation field obtained using the imaging technique identified areas of strong and weak foam zones and also the border of foam propagation however the main advantage of using tdr probes is that they can be used in real cases of field monitoring interpolating the pressure data over the entire 2d tank surface did not produce the correct image of the foam flow propagation shape this low prediction precision is mainly because of the precision of the pressure sensors that does not allow for the detection of the weak foam zones these results will allow the selection of a suitable method for monitoring foam flow in highly permeable porous media in future laboratory scale experiments and field scale tests our model incorporates the main parameters influencing foam flow behavior in highly permeable porous media through a reduction in gas phase mobility non newtonian behavior was introduced as a power law relationship obtained experimentally the concentration of surfactant wang et al 2012 and critical pressure khatib et al 1988 which play an important role in foam coalescence and consequently in how foam viscosity varies were also taken into acount the numerical model can correctly capture the shape and propagation of strong foam and its ability to divert water flows which is already confirmed by the tracing tests the mobility reduction factor we chose allowed us to capture the pressure variation behavior observed experimentally the model predicts the pressure values measured experimentally well the experimental results show a higher pressure gradient from the injection point with a more conical shape than the model results the higher pressure gradient in experimental data may be because of the compressibility which is not taken into account in the model one other possible reason for this small discrepancy can be related to the interpolation precision the difference between the shapes of the experimental and modeling pressure fields is due to the lack of pressure sensors on the bottom boundary of the 2d tank and therefore the low precision of the interpolation in this zone therefore this model can be used to predict foam injection processes in highly permeable porous media such as for soil remediation applications credit authorship contribution statement

115,foam injection is a promising option for soil remediation applications however predicting how it will propagate in highly permeable aquifers under groundwater flow is challenging here we have studied pressure and saturation variations during foam propagation a 2d tank packed with 1 mm glass beads was used to study foam injection in highly permeable porous media under lateral flow specifically we evaluated the efficiency of pressure and time domain reflectometer tdr sensors to predict foam propagation using an imaging technique a numerical model coupling two phase flow and surfactant transport was developed to simulate the experimental results this model takes into account the effect of non newtonian behavior of foam surfactant concentration and critical capillary pressure through the definition of the mobility reduction factor mrf the experimental results show that the foam injection pressure first increases with a logarithmic law and then stabilizes this pressure stabilization can be related to the state of pseudo equilibrium between foam generation and destruction we observed an asymmetrical foam propagation due to water lateral flow comparisons of the liquid saturation fields calculated by analysis of tdr probes and estimated by imaging show that the tdr sensors monitor foam propagation well in saturated porous media they can predict the shape of the injected foam contrary to pressure sensors it is possible to capture weak foam behavior using tdr sensors finally the numerical model we have developed correctly captures the shape of foam propagation and its ability to divert water flows this model produces the propagation of the strong foam well and predicts the saturation and pressure fields with good precision keywords non newtonian fluid foam monitoring highly permeable porous media 2d tank numerical simulation 1 introduction foam injection technology has recently been used in porous media for contaminated aquifer remediation processes varying the foam properties liquid content bubble size viscosity interfacial tension capillarity makes it suitable for different applications as a blocking agent it lowers the soil s relative permeability to water in highly permeable layers and diverts the fluid flow to lower permeability layers aranda et al 2020 bertin et al 2017 kovscek and bertin 2003 omirbekov et al 2020b blocking foams can also be used to confine a contaminated area aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020a portois et al 2018 moreover the injected treatment using foam can follow the highly permeable zone and leave the contaminants in the poorly permeable zones glass et al 1988 zhang et al 2009 where the surfactant or traditional water based amendment delivery techniques are not efficient because of the preferential flow as a vectorization agent foam can be used to transport additives and enhance redox reactions additives such as chemicals zhong et al 2011 gases maire et al 2019 bacteria choi et al 2009 and nanoparticles shen et al 2011 as a mobilization agent plug effect desorption foams can be used to desorb and push the pollutant towards a recovery well couto et al 2009 jeong and corapcioglu 2003 longpré girard et al 2016 its non newtonian behavior can mitigate the heterogeneity of the medium and improve remediation yield and rate therefore remediation efficiency is increased in heterogeneous media most porous media faced in soil contamination and remediation applications have a high permeability compared to those usually studied in petroleum reservoir engineering therefore the application of foam flow to highly permeable porous media still faces specific challenges in particular its propagation and stability in highly permeable porous media under groundwater flow is still challenging contrary to foam flow in rock in very highly permeable porous media foam flow depends on the bubble size when the bubble size is much smaller than the pore size foam behaves as a non newtonian shear thinning fluid however increasing the bubble size will drastically decrease the foam s apparent viscosity within a newtonian behavior followed by a gradual transition to shear thinning behavior for higher flow omirbekov et al 2020a in this condition foam flow occurs first with a weak foam regime and then with a strong foam flow regime aranda et al 2020 in the case of highly permeable porous media it is recommended to inject the pre generated foam using a finer porous media to increase the number of foam bubbles and therefore switch faster to the strong regime flow with higher non newtonian behavior aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020a some authors have studied foam injection and propagation in experimental 2d tank setups most of these studies have focused on how heterogeneity and the presence of pollutant or surfactant type and its concentration influence foam behavior bertin et al 2017 bouzid et al 2018 forey et al 2021 longpré girard et al 2016 longpré girard et al 2016 used a small 2d tank to study foam application for mobility control and lnapl recovery they reported a better sweep indicating better mobility control using foam longpré girard et al 2016 bertin et al 2017 used a decametric metallic 2d tank with two lateral glass panes to study foam flow in heterogeneous porous media they showed that foam is generated in the high permeability layer and will divert flow towards the low permeability region bertin et al 2017 a 2d tank setup was used to study the delivery of an oxidant solution into the unsaturated layered porous media with success bouzid et al 2018 forey et al 2021 used a 2d tank equipped with absolute pressure sensors and imaging to study foam reinforced with colloidal particles formation and propagation in the presence of oil using a co injection process they found that solid silica particles can significantly reduce the destruction of foam in contact with oil the interpolation of the pressure sensors allowed them to better analyze the foam formation and propagation forey et al 2021 more recently davarzani et al 2021 performed a series of experiments on decimetric 2d tanks filled with 1 mm glass beads to investigate the blocking effect of foam for soil remediation applications the pre generated foam was injected at the bottom center of the tank they observed the semi circular propagation of the strong foam followed by an asymmetrical weak foam propagation around it the presence of the weak foam means that only few lamellae are stable meaning in turn that resistance to flow is low in this zone moreover they found that foam can completely divert the groundwater flow just after injection however the foam s stability depends significantly on the groundwater flow mainly due to surfactant dilution in the water because of dispersion the results showed that foam can also serve as a means for gas transport more homogeneously in porous media especially for soil remediation applications davarzani et al 2021 real time in situ monitoring and modeling of how foam travels after injection into aquifers is needed to optimize the new remediation process using foam but still missing using pressure and time domain reflectometry tdr sensors could fill this gap wu et al 2012 tested three different cases of pure foam injection foam injection into a silica sand column and foam injection into a column filled with sediment from a real site they performed complex resistivity electrical conductivity and tdr measurements for all these cases in a centimeter scale column they reported the sensitivity of the electrical and tdr signal for monitoring foam flow in unsaturated porous media tdr can capture increasing water content related to the presence of foam in the unsaturated zone the authors concluded that tdr measurements are useful for estimating the water content but they are not sufficiently sensitive to record the small changes in water redistribution at the pore scale wu et al 2012 moreover the presence of the air in unsaturated porous media can disturb the measurements of the tdr in the presence of the foam turning to foam modeling we see two main approaches to modeling flow in porous media zhang et al 2009 mechanistic solve partial differential equations to compute foam texture and empirical modify the gas viscosity to calculate foam mobility the mechanistic approach uses bubble population balance models to accurately assess bubble formation destruction and propagation géraud et al 2017 the population balance models are based on the definition of the number of lamellae as a variable coupled with the equation of two phase flow in porous media the gas mobility can be expressed as a function of the bubble density water saturation and other parameters the dynamic change in foam texture can be captured in the unsteady state regime many different existing formulations are developed to relate the foam viscosity or gas mobility to the bubble density kam and rossen 2003 described bubble generation as a function of the time averaged pressure gradient kam and rossen 2003 most population balance models are based on the lamella creation by the capillary snap off bertin et al 1998 kovscek and radke 1994 myers and radke 2000 ettinger and radke 1992 used the same rate expression to describe the rate of bubble division the second mechanism for creating foam ettinger and radke 1992 recently almajid et al 2021 developed a mechanistic model with the constitutive relation depending on the local pressure gradient permeability and bubble density coming from the pore scale flow properties almajid et al 2021 this can model low and high quality regimes in porous media many other models have been developed to simulate foam flow in porous media like the bubble population balance model falls et al 1988 fergui et al 1998 kovscek and radke 1994 the fractional flow theory zhang et al 2009 the catastrophe theory kam 2008 the percolation theory models rossen 1990 and filtration theory wan et al 2001 most of these models simulate the phenomenon at a pore scale and need a lot of computer power they are useful at small scale to understand the mechanisms and their dependence on some parameters but are difficult to use at the field scale the complexity of the mechanistic model is not necessary if it is known that strong foam will be created kam et al 2007 the fractional flow model is not suitable for some foam flows due to the number of assumptions needed zhang et al 2009 moreover it is difficult to obtain the model parameters from experimental data because of the extrapolation needed empirical models represent the mechanisms of foam formation and destruction on a macroscopic scale and require few parameters compared to mechanistic models such as the population balance models a mobility reduction factor mrf is used to adjust the gas mobility related to foam generation and destruction some studies focused on modifying only the gas viscosity to drive foam mobility they consider the effect of surfactant concentration water saturation gas velocity marfoe 1987 or oil saturation chang et al 1990 islam 1988 on the foam apparent viscosity mohammadi et al 1995 proposed to modify the gas relative permeability to derive foam mobility depending on the surfactant concentration and pressure gradient mohammadi et al 1995 in porous media capillary pressure is a key element in determining foam texture foam texture includes descriptions of bubble size shape and distribution khatib et al 1988 have experimentally shown that there is a transition from strong foam to weak foam at a critical capillary pressure p c it is also possible to link this critical capillary pressure to a critical saturation the value of the critical saturation depends on several parameters such as the permeability of the porous medium the surfactant type and its concentration or the nature of the fluid surrounding the foam this value must therefore be measured experimentally when the pressure exceeds the critical capillary pressure p c it is assumed that the foam is destroyed drastically affecting its mobility a steady state model for the foam water system called the fixed p c model was developed by zhou and rossen 1995 where the limiting capillary pressure is independent of gas and liquid flow zhou et al 1995 in this model the gas mobility at critical capillary pressure p c is a function of the foam quality and the critical water saturation rossen et al 1999 extended the fixed p c model to calculate mrf taking into account the surfactant concentration and this critical saturation rossen et al 1999 cheng et al 2000 modified the proposed equation to include the non newtonian behavior of foam according to gas flow rate cheng et al 2000 this model was modified by dholkawala 2007 adding the phenomenon of foam generation and coalescence dholkawala et al 2007 the reader can look at hematpur et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 for a detailed formulation of the different foam flows in porous media models and their comparisons the best way to model foam flow depends on the available experimental data objectives and available modeling tools as the phenomena studied in this work are at the darcy scale and due to the weaknesses of fractional flow theories we propose an empirical mrf model with mechanistic generalized darcy s law to simulate foam flow in porous media here the mrf model was built upon an existing empirical approach used by cheng et al 2000 considering the effect of the non newtonian behavior surfactant concentration and critical capillary pressure on the foam flow mobility the main advantage of this empiric model for calculating the mrf is needing fewer physical fitting parameters compared to a population balance based model taking into account the most important physical phenomena influencing foam mobility surfactant concentration plays a crucial role in foam stability and also in the mrf value wang et al 2012 therefore it is essential to take into account surfactant transport when modeling foam flow in porous media the surfactant transport in porous media is modeled using the diffusion and advection equations taking into account the dispersion the velocity field for the advection term comes from the solution of darcy s law gas mobility in darcy s law is also a function of the surfactant concentration we propose therefore a strongly coupled model our work gives a better understanding of foam flow in highly permeable aquifers using experimental and numerical approaches the main focus was on pressure and saturation variations during foam propagation a meter scale 2d tank setup filled with 1 mm glass beads was used to model foam injection in highly permeable porous media this 2d tank is a larger and improved version of that described in davarzani et al 2021 with the large scale 2d tank used in this study we could better investigate foam propagation the setup gave us the saturation directly from the imaging thanks to the transparent glass of the tank front the pressure and tdr sensor network proposed in this new 2d tank installed in the rear measured water saturation and pressure the experimental data obtained in this study was used to evaluate the potential of tdr and pressure gauges as tools for monitoring foam injection in the saturated zone the lack of gas in this zone can help to better evaluate the presence of the foam and how it flows in porous media comparing these with saturation fields obtained using imaging can help to better assess the potential of other monitoring techniques the saturation using the tdr sensors and imaging technique and pressure data can be then served to validate the model results the water flow was generated horizontally to model a more realistic foam injection case in the aquifer the pre generated foam was injected at the bottom center of the tank to our knowledge there is a lack of knowledge in the literature concerning the study of foam flow under water flow in a metric scale 2d setup a numerical model coupling two phase foam and water flow and surfactant transport was developed using comsol multiphysics to simulate the experimental results 2 theoretical consideration and numerical model formulation the mathematical formulations we used to simulate foam flow in porous media are as follows we used wang s mixture model wang and beckermann 1993 coupled with an empirical model to represent foam mobility the solute transport equations were used to simulate surfactant transport during foam injection this choice was motivated by the fact that we studied the problem at the two dimensional darcy scale the mixture model is the simplest to be solved numerically because the coupling between the equations is not strong 2 1 two phase flow formulation the conservation of the mass of the mixture can be written as 1 ϕ ρ t ρ u 0 where u is the mixture darcy s velocity m s 1 φ porosity and ρ kg m 3 is the mixture density calculated as below 2 ρ s w ρ w s n w ρ n w 3 ρ u ρ w u w ρ n w u nw where si ui and ρ i are the fluid saturation velocity and density of i w nw phase respectively the mean dynamic viscosity of the two phase mixture pa s is defined as 4 μ ρ ρ w k r w μ w ρ n w k r n w μ n w where k r i refers to the relative permeability of phase i w nw to handle these physical quantities more easily the relative mobility λ r i of phase i is defined as λ r i μ k r i μ i with i w n w 5 λ r w λ r n w 1 darcy s two phase flow equations for isotropic porous media can be written as below 6 u i k int k r i μ i p i ρ i g w i t h i w n w where k int m2 refers to the intrinsic permeability tensor which can be reduced to a scalar permeability k int m2 for an isotropic medium u i m s 1 is the darcy velocities of phase i μ i pa s the fluid dynamic viscosity pi pa its pressure ρ i kg m 3 its density g m s 2 the standard gravitational acceleration the pseudo mixing pressure which was formulated by chavent 1976 reads 7 p λ r w p w λ r n w p n w then we can deduce the mixture darcy s law as 8 u k i n t μ p ρ k g where ρ k kg m 3 the kinetic density of the mixture that is defined by 9 ρ k λ r w ρ w λ r n w ρ n w the mass balance related to the wetting saturation phase sw becomes 10 ϕ s w ρ w t λ w ρ u d c s w ρ k i n t μ λ w λ n w δ ρ g where dc pa s is the capillary diffusion coefficient defined as 11 d c ρ k i n t μ λ w λ n w p c s w since the porosity is constant and the two immiscible fluids jointly fill the void space the sum of the phase saturations must be equal to one 12 s w s nw 1 the effective wetting saturation is usually defined as 13 s e w s w s r w 1 s r w where s r w is the residual wetting phase saturation the difference between the non wetting and wetting pressure is known as the capillary pressure and can be defined as a function of the normalized wetting fluid saturation 14 p c s e w p n w p w we used the van genuchten mualem model to relate the capillary pressure and relative permeability to the wetting phase saturation mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 15 s e w 1 α p c n m where α m 1 and n are the van genuchten soil parameters with m 1 1 n the relative permeability for the wetting and non wetting phase can be written respectively as 16 k r w s e w l 1 1 s e w 1 m m 2 17 k rnw 1 s e w l 1 s e w 1 m 2 m the parameter l has been considered equal to 0 5 which is commonly accepted in this type of porous medium chen et al 1999 mualem 1976 eq 10 describes the two phase flow in association with the equation for conservation of the mass of the mixture eq 1 with three unknowns sw p and pc the system is closed thanks to the constitutive relationships for the capillary pressure and relative permeability eqs 12 17 using the definition of pseudo mixing pressure eq 7 and the definition of capillary pressure it is possible to calculate the pressure gradients of each phase as below 18 p w p λ r n w p c 19 p n w p λ r w p c once the governing equations related to the two phase flows in porous media have been established we must model the behavior of the foam in porous media the following hypotheses are necessary to model foam flow at the darcy scale i foam is considered as a single gas phase zhou et al 1995 ii the mobility of water depends on the water saturation whether or not there is foam zhou et al 1995 and finally iii the mobility of the gas is controlled by the texture of the foam falls et al 1989 foam has a high viscosity that varies depending on how it is generated and destroyed it is therefore necessary to integrate these properties into the equations thus the foam will not be modeled as a two phase structure but as a single non wetting phase affected by a variable mobility reduction factor mrf modifying the phase mobility in the equations the wetting phase will represent only the water around the foam and not the surfactant solution that is part of the foam the gas phase of the foam is considered continuous and the effect of the lamellae is presented by the mrf the mrf is applied to the gas mobility to obtain that of the foam as 20 λ f m λ g m r f where λ fm is foam mobility pa 1 s 1 and λ g gas mobility pa 1 s 1 the resistance factor rf represents the reduction in foam mobility compared to a single phase flow of water therefore the two factors are related as 21 m r f r f μ w μ g mrf is determined experimentally from foam flow in porous columns it is known to depend on several parameters such as porous media petro physical properties surfactant type and concentration and flow condition it is a commonly used key parameter that determines the foam flow regime in porous media the mrf can vary from a few tens for foams with a coarse texture weak foam to hundreds of thousands for foams with a fine texture lee 2014 the case where mrf 1 corresponds to a conventional gas phase flow without foam here we considered that the mrf varies as a function of the multiplication of the maximum mobility reduction and different factors that vary between 0 and 1 this concept has been successfully widely used in different commercial reservoir simulators such as stars cmg eclipse schlumberger company and utchem university of texas at austin 2 2 surfactant transport formulation solute transport is governed by the classic differential advection dispersion equation in porous media 22 ϕ s w c t u c d eff c q s where c is the surfactant concentration mol m 3 d eff the effective diffusion coefficient tensor m2 s 1 u the mixture darcy velocity field m s 1 and qs mol m 3 s 1 a sink or source term since aos is anionic it is assumed that adsorption is negligible on glass beads qs 0 the effective diffusion coefficient tensor includes the contributions of molecular diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion by the effect of flow velocity the values of the effective diffusion coefficient tensor depend on the solute transport regime to evaluate this regime it is necessary to calculate the péclet number as 23 p e d p u d m where dp is the pore mean size of the porous media m dm is the molecular binary diffusion coefficient of aos m2 s 1 in water and u m s 1 the infiltration velocity the péclet number for a water flow applied in this study is in the order of 102 this péclet value shows that the pure mechanical dispersion phenomenon 300 pe 105 is dominant therefore a classical expression was used to calculate the longitudinal and transversal dispersion coefficients delgado 2007 24 d e f f l d m 1 τ 1 8 p e 25 d e f f t d m 1 τ 0 025 p e where d eff l and d eff t are the longitudinal and transversal dispersion coefficients m² s 1 respectively τ is the tortuosity of the medium estimated by the millington and quirk relationship in a saturated medium millington and quirk 1961 τ φ 1 3 26 the molecular diffusion coefficient of aos was deduced from azmi et al 2019 movchan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 and we suggest an average value of dm 10 10 m2 s 1 3 experimental study 3 1 materials and fluids we used 1 mm glass beads to fill the 2d tank the main reason is that the same type and size of glass beads were used in our previous studies aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020a 2020b the measured permeability and porosity of porous media made of these glass beads were 8 4 10 10 m² and 0 37 using beads made of glass means good transparency properties and better visualization of flows and saturation by imaging following the results in aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020a 2020b we used a solution of alpha olefin sulfonate surfactant aos concentrated at 4 cmc for the experiments n2 purity 99 99 and carbon dioxide purity 99 7 were used to generate the foam and reduce the air trapping in the porous column respectively 3 2 experimental setup and procedure 3 2 1 foam generator and 2d tank setup the experimental setup is presented in fig 1 this setup includes a porous column to generate foam the pre generated foam is then injected into the center bottom of a 2d tank filled with glass beads and saturated with water we used a pvc column 10 cm long filled with very fine glass beads 0 1 mm diameter to generate foam this generates a stronger foam with a sharper interface than foam generated using a co injection technique aranda et al 2020 the permeability and porosity of this porous column were 1 1 10 11 m² and 0 38 respectively the aos surfactant solution and n2 gas were co injected using a tee connector into the pre generator to generate foam we used a mass flow controller brooks delta smart ii 0 7 of rate and 0 2 f s to control the gas flow the volume of the surfactant solution was regulated using a peristaltic pump ismatec reglo icc 1 reading the 2d tank length 1 m height 0 6 m and width 0 085 m is composed of a central porous reservoir and two side cavities fig 1 the front part of the 2d tank is made of transparent glass to photograph the foam flow using the light reflected method that transparent glass also allowed us to visualize using photography the rear of the tank was made with a special polymer to plug a network of pressure and tdr time domain reflectometry sensors time domain reflectometry is the most widely used non destructive method to determine the water content of porous media the cavities are separated from the central reservoir using a perforated metal plate the cavities distribute pressure homogeneously across the cavities foam is injected from a center bottom hole 3 125 cm five side connection points help to generate the lateral water flow given the tank depth and the size of the foam inlet small 3d effects near the nozzle may occur but philippe et al 2021 using a smaller 2d tank have shown that this effect can be neglected even for a less stable two phase flow philippe et al 2021 we followed the same experimental protocol as davarzani et al 2021 and as shown in fig 1 we used a primary circuit to inject foam from the bottom the secondary and tertiary circuits were used to create the lateral flow of water and to pump out excess water from the cavities respectively two absolute pressure sensors keller pa 33x accuracy 1 5 pa were placed upstream of the pre generator all circuit pipes were made of pvc and had an inside diameter of 1 4 inch we used the secondary circuit to inject deionized water into the left cavity using a peristaltic pump ismatec reglo icc we injected water at two points into the cavity to obtain a more homogeneous lateral flow two other pipes were used to pump water from the right side cavity these two pipes were installed at the same level as the left cavity s pipes the pumping and injection flow rates were the same in all pipes to ensure a homogeneous and constant lateral flow after injecting foam through the central hole the water level inside the tank increased to keep the water level constant the excess water was pumped using two pipes tertiary circuit installed in each cavity at the saturated zone surface the pumped water weight was measured using a mass balance sartorius mse8201s precision 0 1 g from this we calculated the volume of foam injected into the 2d tank we used a photography system installed in a darkroom this system includes a high resolution camera of 45 7 megapixels of brilliant resolution with a 105 mm focal length lens and a spotlight to photograph the foam injection process installed in a darkroom a standard grey scale that was attached to the tank surface allowed the images to be calibrated a set of 25 tdr probes and 25 absolute pressure sensors are inserted in the back part of the tank to measure the saturation and pressure fields inside the porous media in the 2d tank tdr devices are electronic and transmit the wave by two parallel embedded metal rods waveguides these waveguides are connected to the tdr via a coaxial cable tdr works based on the travel time of high frequency electromagnetic signals into the medium the dielectric permittivity of the medium is then calculated using the reflected signals dielectric permittivity is a physical property that characterizes the degree of electrical polarization of material under the influence of an external electric field a tdr device directly measures the relative permittivity which is defined as the ratio of the real effective dielectric permittivity and the free space permittivity relative permittivity is the ability of a material to obtain intrinsic polarization the tdr probes used for this device were ech2o 5te manufactured by meter group 1 from 1 to 40 15 measurement from 40 to 80 with dimensions of 10 cm 3 2 cm waveguides 5 cm long and 0 5 cm wide and a range between 1 air and 80 water these probes use a wave of frequency 70 mhz and the value of the relative permittivity measured corresponds to an average over a square mesh with 5 cm sides centered on the probe the complex dielectric permittivity consists of two parts a real and an imaginary part however at high frequencies the imaginary part is negligible glover 2015 heimovaara et al 1994 the permittivity of a porous medium is strongly related to polar molecules like water due to electric polarization and dipolar polarization of the water molecule the relative permittivity dielectric constant of water is about 80 while most of the soil particles have relative permittivity values between 2 and 7 and that of air is equal to 1 consequently the relative permittivity of porous media can be used to estimate the water saturation the tdr device should be calibrated to determine the relationship between the measured porous media s effective relative permittivity and the water saturation the existing empirical formulations can also be used to estimate the water saturation in some cases using empirical relationships e g topp et al 1980 or theoretical models such as the complex refractive index model crim birchak et al 1974 endres and knight 1992 roth and attinger 1990 the absolute pressure sensors are of the keller pr 21 y type with an accuracy of 7 5 mbar the locations of the probes in the 2d tank are shown in fig 2 the first and second digits of the sensor name correspond to its row counting from the top of the tank and its column starting from the left of the tank respectively 3 2 2 experimental procedures the 2d tank was filled up completely with 1 mm glass beads deionized water was then injected through the center bottom injection point with a very low flow rate 2 0 ml min this low flow rate injection ensures stable water flow upward and avoids air being trapped in pores we left a small unsaturated zone in the 2d tank to avoid any water spill from the top see fig 1 a lateral flow of 1 4 m day was created using the secondary circuit a blue dye was injected from the left cavity to verify the homogeneity of the lateral flow the foam generator was first filled with 0 1 mm glass beads to avoid any air trapping co2 was injected before injecting water and then surfactant cs 4 cmc into the column finally n2 gas and the surfactant solution were co injected into the column with a foam quality of 85 and a total flow rate of 4 ml min as soon as we observed the strong foam at the column outlet and the pressure signal before the foam generator becomes stable the foam was directed to the 2d tank at the same time the tertiary pipes evacuated any water excess before and during the experiment photographs were also taken before and during the foam injection permittivity and pressure values were recorded every 30 s using a campbell scientific data logger cr6 3 3 data analysis 3 1 1 image analysis we used light reflection methods lrm see alazaiza et al 2016 to obtain the relationship between light intensity and liquid saturation a linear relationship between the optical density and liquid saturation in foam can be considered davarzani et al 2021 27 s w α o d β where coefficients α and β are then calculated from two calibration images where the saturations are known we used an image of foam zone near the injection point sw 0 05 and a second image before foam injection sw 1 to find these coefficients values the transmitted light can be related to the sum of the measured reflected light intensity ir and the light intensity reflected by a perfectly white surface ii flores et al 2011 kechavarzi et al 2000 schincariol et al 1993 stimson 1974 28 o d lo g 10 i r i i once the saturation was calculated all meshes were colored according to their gray intensity then the intensity and saturation fields could be discretized the saturation slices of 0 0 1 0 1 0 3 0 3 0 5 0 5 0 7 0 7 0 9 0 9 1 were selected and a color scale linked the saturation values to a range of color from white to blue for more details on image analysis the reader can refer to davarzani et al 2021 for foam flow and colombano et al 2020 2021 luciano et al 2010 o carroll et al 2004 philippe et al 2020 2021 for non aqueous phase liquid flow 3 3 2 tdr data acquisition and calibration in this study an empirical relationship was used to obtain the water content θ w from the relative permittivity data topp et al 1980 29 ε θ 3 57 31 7 θ 114 θ 2 68 2 θ 3 where θ is the volumetric liquid content and ε the relative permittivity of the bulk system measured using a tdr sensor by performing a 3rd order polynomial regression on the inverse of this function for θ w 0 0 4 we get r 2 0 9998 30 θ w ε 1 06 10 5 ε 3 7 54 10 4 ε 2 2 95 10 2 ε 9 11 10 2 each probe was then calibrated independently by performing a linear relationship from two measurements where the liquid content is known θ 0 dry porous medium and θ ϕ porous medium saturated with water since the values depend on the arrangement of the glass beads this calibration was done before each experiment 4 results and discussions 4 1 experimental results demonstration this section discusses how pressure changes at the injection point and the pressure and saturation fields the saturation fields measured by tdr are compared with those estimated using image analysis 4 1 1 injection pressure the foam was injected under the same conditions throughout the experiment fig 3 shows how injection pressure changes as a function of time we observed a steady increase in pressure followed by signal stabilization this phenomenon can be explained in two complementary ways aging of the foam at the level of the displacement front which causes a local decrease in the apparent viscosity and a reduction in water saturation at the level of the injection zone which leads to an increase in local capillary pressure to its critical value if we consider that the aging of the foam at the level of the displacement front is weak then from measuring the pressure field we can evaluate the critical capillary pressure this depends on the formulation of the foam its quality and the properties of the porous medium since all of our experiments were carried out with the same parameters it is possible to deduce the critical capillary pressure p c as 31 p c p f o a m p l where p f o a m is the stabilizing pressure of the foam during the experiments and pl is the pressure of the liquid depending on the hydrostatic pressure in the tank because there is no water flow at the injection level thus it is possible to conclude that the critical capillary pressure of this foam in a porous medium of 1 mm glass beads is approximately 195 mbar this value is in the same order of magnitude found in the literature for unconsolidated porous media khatib et al 1988 during the early stages of the injection the pressure development follows a logarithmic law see fig 3 this is the behavior that should be observed in the case of the injection of a viscous fluid together with propagation in the form of a perfect half disk these measurements are therefore in agreement with the observations showing that the shape of the strong foam is a half disk 4 1 2 saturation and pressure fields fig 4 shows how the liquid saturation changes over time on line 3 of the tdr probes line 3 contains five tdr probes and is in the middle of the tank values greater than 1 and less than 0 are due to measurement accuracy which is around 0 1 for the saturation related to the permittivity measurement precision 1 the initial permittivity values glass beads fully saturated by water were varied between 16 and 20 according to the position of the sensors in the 2d tank and could fall to a value close to 3 e g for sensor 5 3 after foam injection once the foam reaches and fills the measurement radius of a probe the saturation value decreases until it reaches a value close to 0 since measurement precision is 0 1 we conclude that the liquid saturation after passing the foam is between 0 and 0 1 these values are in good agreement with the measurements carried out in columns aranda et al 2020 where the liquid saturation ranged between 0 03 and 0 1 after a steady state foam flow was reached these values also show the shape of the foam propagation quite well the center tdr probe at 3 3 is the first to measure a decrease in saturation and to reach the final value of liquid saturation then the saturation falls respectively in sensors 3 2 3 4 then 3 1 probe 3 5 is hardly affected by the foam flow this is coherent with the spherical shape of the foam propagation with an asymmetric extension on the left side due to the lateral flow which has been already observed by photographs and by calculating the aspect ratio see davarzani et al 2021 the rapid and smooth decrease in the saturation on the 3 3 probe shows that the foam flows as a strong foam with a defined front the 3 1 sensor shows behavior more like a mixture of weak foam and gas the decrease in saturation is slower and marked by sudden variations this is due to the arrival of a train of gas bubbles in the area of the probe which abruptly reduces the liquid saturation since the weak foam front propagates more diffusely than the strong foam the decrease observed is slow however the saturation decreases until it reaches a value close to those measured for the strong foam the displacement of water by the weak foam is therefore comparable to that achieved by the strong foam in a slower regime we show in fig 5 the saturation and pressure fields in the 2d tank after t 10 h 20 h and 29 h of injection using data from the 25 probes pressure fields are calculated by subtracting the hydrostatic pressure so that only the pressure variations due to foam injection and lateral flow are shown spatial interpolation between probes was performed using the kriging method davis and sampson 1986 implemented in tecplot a commercial software package these fields are compared to the photographs in the background consistent with what has been observed with the injection pressures presented above the pressure field inside the 2d tank also remains stable even if the front propagation continues to progress since the critical capillary pressure is reached at the injection point which corresponds to the maximum pressure of the tank the pressure field stabilizes in accordance with this value these fields also show that the pressure generated by the lateral flow is negligible compared to the pressure generated by the foam flow it can therefore be concluded that the pressure field will not change in the case of a prolonged injection weak foam will be generated in greater quantity to compensate for the increased radius by a loss of viscosity and thus keep the pressure constant because of the distance between the pressure sensors and interpolation precision it is not possible to capture the circular form of the foam using the pressure field interpolating the data over the entire spatial domain does not accurately calculate the position of the front because of the distance between the sensors the kriging interpolation method therefore creates a gradient between the two values aside from the precise location of the front the array of probes provides a correct picture of the reality of foam propagation the saturation values in the strong foam are less than 0 1 saturation is also very low in weak foam with values ranging between 0 1 and 0 3 which are particularly visible in this figure contrary to the pressure sensors it is possible to capture the weak foam behavior using tdr sensors finally the value of liquid saturation decreases very little in areas where the only upward flow of free gas occurs above the zone of strong foam the values are approximately 0 9 in these areas 4 1 3 comparison between tdr measurements and photographic analysis in order to compare and validate the results obtained by the tdr probes and by the photographic analysis the average liquid saturation values on a 5 cm square mesh centered on the position of each tdr probe were calculated by imaging the parameters for the linear relation between optical density and water saturation after image calibration were α 1 54 β 2 98 and iref 19 fig 6 shows these results for row 3 of the 2d tank the saturations calculated from the tdr probes are shown in solid lines and the saturations calculated from the photographic analysis are shown in dotted lines with marks the saturation dynamics were the same with both methods however the values calculated by imaging are slightly shifted in time compared to those measured by tdrs this could be explained by greater sensitivity in the imaging to the movements of free gas that precedes the arrival of the foam front or to a possible 3d edge effect by which the gas bubbles would first move towards the 2d tank front glass in this way the gas would be fully captured by the photographic analysis while the tdr probe would only capture a little gas in its area of influence also the under prediction is more severe for probes 3 3 and 3 4 from the observation we believe that there is more free gas in the center and right side of the tank compared to the left side because of the flow direction these results therefore show the limits of these measurement methods which are very useful for monitoring saturation variations and relating them to the physical phenomena involved in fig 7 we present 2d saturation fields obtained by photographic analysis and tdr probes respectively the same colors are used to represent the same ranges of saturation as noted previously the saturation fields obtained using tdr probes do not allow very precise visualization of the foam front because of the limited quantity of sensors photographic analysis can identify areas of strong and weak foam and the transitions between these areas the advantage of tdr sensors is that they can be used in field monitoring this comparison highlights the fact that the liquid saturation is slightly lower on the bottom part of the tank around the injection point this observation is valid for both methods and shows the presence of the drainage phenomenon at these time and space scales the liquid phase flows down to the tank by gravity resulting in a foam that is wetter than the center of the tank 4 2 model parameters numerical simulation and results 4 2 1 two phase flow hypothesis and estimation of parameters it has been observed experimentally that viscous effects are dominant over capillary effects during foam flow in highly permeable porous media aranda et al 2020 during strong foam fine textured foam flow in highly permeable porous media the foam displacement is quite stable and seems to be piston like aranda et al 2020 this means that p c s w in eq 11 tends towards zero in the van genuchten mualem model for the relative permeabilities eqs 16 and 17 m tends towards 1 chen et al 1999 mualem 1976 however we considered a constant and small value for the capillary diffusion coefficient dc 2 10 5 pa s see eq 10 to improve the model convergence the calculated parameters necessary to solve the above equations numerically are listed in table 2 the wetting phase viscosity and density are those of water at 20 c the non wetting phase is the foam foam is injected at a quality of 85 the estimated density using this gas volume fraction is 150 kg m 3 as seen previously its viscosity is that of gas multiplied by a mobility reduction factor mrf the permeability and porosity of the medium were measured in the laboratory the lateral injection velocity corresponds to the apparent velocity in the 2d tank set at 1 4 m day multiplied by the porosity darcy velocity in this model the lateral flow is reversed to match the experimental data obtained from the back of the 2d tank flow from right to left from the parameters presented in table 2 the viscosity of the invading fluid foam is much higher than the displaced fluid water however the invading fluid density is lower than the displaced fluid according to the stability of the two phase flow criterion glass and nicholl 1996 the intrusion of foam more viscous than water into a water saturated soil is conditionally stable for an upward flow the critical velocity of the fluid front propagation stability between foam and water interface can be written as glass and nicholl 1996 32 u c ρ n w ρ w g k i n t ϕ μ n w μ w from this equation we obtain u c 2 4 10 6 m s which is less than foam injection velocity u inj 7 8 10 5 m s therefore the foam water interface should be stable to stabilize the calculation in eq 10 the capillary diffusion dc was set at 2 10 5 pa s this capillary diffusion creates a capillary fringe at the foam water interface the value chosen is the lowest value leading to stabilization of the model for the optimal mesh according to the experimental results see also davarzani et al 2021 three main phenomena have an impact on the viscosity of the foam in highly permeable porous media the non newtonian behavior the critical capillary pressure and the surfactant concentration the objective is therefore to incorporate these three phenomena into the mrf model 4 2 1 1 non newtonian behavior the non newtonian behavior is modeled from the power law measured in aranda et al 2020 obtained for the same foam and porous media as below 33 μ a p p 5 7 γ 0 56 where μ app is the foam apparent viscosity pa s and γ the shear rate s 1 given that the primary variables are mixed pressure and saturation we introduce the non newtonian behavior in terms of the pressure gradient using the experimental data see appendix b 34 μ a p p 278 p 0 39 where p is the pressure gradient pa m 1 generated during the flow of foam in the column experiment aranda et al 2020 this law can be reformulated by expressing the apparent viscosity as a function of a reference case and the gas viscosity 35 μ a p p μ g m r f r e f p p r e f n p 1 μ g 1 m r f r e f p p r e f n p 1 where μ g is the viscosity of the gas pa s mrfref the reference mobility reduction coefficient at the pressure gradient pref pa m 1 and np the exponent of the power law associated with the pressure gradient equal to 0 61 the equality is valid because with the high foam viscosity m r f r e f p p r e f n p 1 is of the order of 105 1 finally a minimum pressure gradient pmin is introduced to prevent the viscosity from tending to infinity for low pressure gradients thus if p pmin the viscosity becomes constant with regard to the non newtonian behavior such as 36 μ a p p μ g 1 m r f r e f p m i n p r e f n p 1 4 2 1 2 impact of surfactant concentration the impact of the surfactant concentration could not be directly measured experimentally we estimated its effect based on the results obtained by wang et al 2012 the apparent viscosity is equal to that of the gas without the presence of surfactant and increases with concentration until its stabilization around the critical micelle concentration cmc wang et al 2012 the smoothed heaviside function related to the surfactant concentration fc plotted in fig 8 represents the influence of the surfactant concentration it is firstly composed of a ramp going from point 0 0 to point cmc 1 then a stabilization at 1 after the cmc the function is numerically smoothed to be differentiable twice at any point 4 2 1 3 impact of the critical capillary pressure the apparent viscosity drops when the capillary pressure exceeds the critical capillary pressure as the foam coalesces and becomes coarser as observed before this phenomenon can be responsible for stabilizing the injection pressure to represent this a smoothed heaviside function fp is introduced which is equal to 1 up to the critical capillary pressure fixed at the experimentally measured value of 195 mbar then 0 after this fig 9 for the needs of numerical stability this curve is numerically smoothed on a transition zone of p c 5 and is differentiable twice at any point 4 2 1 4 final mrf coefficient the complete mrf incorporating these three phenomena therefore takes the following form 37 if p p m i n m r f 1 m r f r e f p p r e f n p 1 f c c f p p if p pmin 38 m r f 1 m r f r e f p m i n p r e f n p

non newtonian behavior pa m 1 np the exponent of the power law associated with the pressure gradient fc and fp two smoothed heaviside functions varying between 0 and 1 c the surfactant concentration mol m 3 and p the pressure pa the reference pressure gradient was first chosen equal to 1 7 105 pa m 1 which corresponds to a mrfref of 1 5 105 obtained experimentally using a 1d column see aranda et al 2020 however this value was found to be insufficient to match the modeled injection pressure to the experimentally measured one it was necessary to adjust this parameter to match the measured injection pressure the adjusted mrfref value was 4 4 105 this difference can have multiple sources such as the 2d flow hypothesis however mrfref is always of the order of magnitude of 105 the minimum pressure gradient has been set at 1 104 pa m 1 which corresponds to a maximum apparent viscosity of the foam of 24 2 pa s table 1 lists all the parameters used to set up this model 4 2 2 numerical simulation boundary and initial conditions the objective was to model only the behavior of the strong foam the free gas rise and weak foam were not modeled the chosen mesh refined in terms of foam injection and the outlet of the flows makes it possible to obtain a stable model we used comsol multiphysics to solve two phase flow in porous media based on the mixture model however the two phase darcy s law module of comsol does not use the same equations as wang and beckermann s 1993 formulation therefore we modified these equations to be fully matched to the chosen formulation see appendix a we used second order elements for the velocity components and linear elements for the pressure field p2 p1 to discretize the two phase darcy s law equation linear elements were used for the concentration to discretize the diffusion advection equation the simulation domains were discretized by triangular meshes with 7 848 elements under the constraint of maximum and minimum element sizes of 0 01 m and 2 25 10 5 m respectively the mesh is refined at the foam injection boundary and the right border of the domain to a maximum element size of 0 005 m to enhance the model convergence and avoid numerical artifacts the maximum element growth rate was 1 05 we used the backward differentiation formula bdf time stepping method with the free time stepping option free time stepping allows the solver to take larger or smaller time steps as required to satisfy the specified tolerances the solvers will try to take as large a time step as possible but will reduce the time step size when necessary if the solution starts to vary rapidly in time the selected boundary conditions that fulfill the experimental setup conditions for two phase flow are presented in fig 10 on the lower excluding injection segment and upper borders of the geometry we consider that the normal flow velocity is zero in the direction normal to the border the experimental results presented before indeed show that the interface between the unsaturated porous medium and the saturated porous medium is not modified during the experiment therefore there is no normal flow at this interface 39 n ρ u 0 for the left border and the foam injection segment the boundary conditions correspond to a fluid inlet the value of the saturation is imposed as well as that of the pressure indirectly by a velocity this inlet boundary condition reads 40 n ρ u s w ρ w s n w ρ n w u 0 where u 0 is the total injection velocity of the two phases m s 1 the values of sw and u 0 are defined according to the considered border finally the right boundary condition corresponds to the outlet boundary condition of the fluids according to experiments in the 2d tank the pressure is therefore imposed to atmospheric pressure and the contribution of capillary diffusion in the direction normal to the wall is zero n d c s w 0 41 p p a t m where patm pa is the atmospheric pressure the initial saturation and pressure conditions correspond to the tank completely saturated with water and to a zero pressure field in the absence of flow and neglecting gravity 42 s w t 0 1 p t 0 p a t m solute transport is governed by the differential advection diffusion equation in porous media the selected boundary conditions according to the experimental conditions are presented in fig 11 on the lower except the injection segment and upper borders there is no flow in the normal direction there is also no diffusion in this direction a no flux boundary condition was imposed in these boundaries as 43 n d eff c 0 on the injection segment boundary a surfactant concentration was provided by the foam injection a constant flow of concentration on this boundary is therefore imposed this is an inflow boundary condition 44 n d eff c u c n u c i n on the left border the flow of pure water does not provide surfactant the limiting conditions are thus the same as previously but in the form of 45 n d eff c u c 0 on the right border the surfactant can freely flow out of the domain this is a convective boundary condition or outflow 46 n d eff c 0 4 2 3 comparison with experimental results we compared the results obtained by numerical simulation saturation and pressure fields with the results obtained experimentally as the modeling concerns only the flow of the strong foam only the experimental results concerning this situation were analyzed 4 2 3 1 foam propagation shape and blocking effect fig 12 shows the foam saturation field as well as the flow streamlines at t 10 h and t 20 h respectively the capillary diffusion fringe is visible but our interest is focused on the shape of the strong foam represented by a foam saturation equal to 1 foam quality of 85 following the results observed experimentally the foam forms a half disk centered on the injection point the streamlines show that the lateral flow is indeed diverted by the foam flow as shown by the experimental tracing tests davarzani et al 2021 these results show that the implemented equations correctly model the shape of the foam and its ability to divert water flows fig 13 compares the change of the radius of influence roi obtained numerically with the radius of influence measured during the experiment the radius of influence of the foam can be defined as the geometric mean of the lateral radius rh and the vertical radius rh as r o i r h r v the radius of influence obtained by modeling corresponds to the radius at which the foam saturation becomes less than 1 start of the capillary fringe at the beginning of the injection the numerically calculated radius of influence is slightly less than that obtained experimentally this is due to the loss of mass through the numerical capillary fringe it has been observed experimentally that there is very little coalescence at the start of the injection and therefore almost all of the injected mass flows in the form of a strong foam in numerical modeling part of the mass diffuses into the capillary fringe because of the non zero capillary diffusion coefficient for this same reason the numerically calculated radius of influence becomes larger than that measured experimentally at the end of the injection where the coalescence becomes greater while the numerical capillary diffusion remains constant the slight delay before increasing the radius of influence is due to non newtonian behavior in the first moments the pressure gradient is very high at the level of the injection segment and as a result the viscosity is greatly reduced we did not observe this phenomenon experimentally the experimental and numerical fields for roi are quite similar which supports the two dimensional approach hypothesis the maximum measured error is 15 these results also show the limits of such a model where the coalescence at the foam water interface during the injection phase is not modeled 4 2 3 2 pressure fields fig 14 compares the injection pressure obtained from the numerical model with the experimental measurements the decrease in viscosity when the critical pressure is reached function fp in the mrf gives a numeric injection pressure which stabilizes quickly the pressure measured experimentally is subject to further variation this can be explained by complex foam flow behavior in porous media compared to a simplified empiric model e g the compressibility omirbekov et al 2020b avalanches of coalescence events höhler and cohen addad 2005 or preferential foam flow paths the precise simulation of the foam behavior needs the mechanistic approach e g bubble population balance models to accurately assess bubble formation destruction and propagation although our model cannot precisely predict the pressure behavior it does allow us to predict the general behavior of foam flow in porous media e g pressure stabilization from this result we calibrate the rref parameter so that the critical injection pressure is reached almost simultaneously experimentally and by modeling the slight delay at the start of the injection for model results is due to the non newtonian behavior as stated previously fig 15 represents the pressure fields from modeling and the measurements by pressure sensors in the 2d tank the pressure fields from the experiment are established from 26 point measurements and therefore the data are interpolated or extrapolated to get the pressure field hydrostatic pressure has been calculated and subtracted from all measurements we notice that the pressure fields obtained from modeling have a more progressive change over time while the experimental fields hardly show changes after t 20 h the experimental results show a higher gradient contours are more closely packed away from the injection point compared to the model results this can be because of the compressibility effect in a transient regime and the interpolation precision modeling shows that the high pressure zone is very localized at the injection point this area is probably overestimated by the interpolation of the experimental measurements the modeling shows a slight asymmetry in the pressure field from the 2d tank central axis because of the water lateral flow this is partially confirmed by the experimental data the lack of data in the bottom 2d tank boundary may explain the deviation of the experimental pressure field from the half disk form 5 conclusions we studied how foam flows in highly permeable porous media numerically and experimentally in a meter scale 2d tank the pre generated foam was injected through the center bottom of the 2d tank foam propagation was monitored using the light reflected method thanks to the tank s transparent front glass and pressure and time domain reflectometer tdr sensors installed in the rear of the tank the experiments allowed us to study the behavior of the foam flowing in a highly permeable porous medium made of 1 mm glass beads under lateral water flow during the foam injection the pressure increased according to a logarithmic law which is the usual behavior of the pressure profile for radial fluid flow wu and pruess 2000 even if the injection continued the pressure increase diminished and became a quasi plateau this phenomenon can be related to foam coalescence close to the foam propagation front and increasing the local capillary pressure to its critical value near the injection point the fact that the pressure generated by foam can be stabilized during the injection is of great interest for foam injection at the field scale the saturation profile obtained from imaging and tdr sensors showed that the foam propagation was spherical with an asymmetric extension on the left side due to the lateral flow tdr sensors were able to predict the shape of the foam propagation with good precision including strong and weak foam zones the saturation field obtained using the imaging technique identified areas of strong and weak foam zones and also the border of foam propagation however the main advantage of using tdr probes is that they can be used in real cases of field monitoring interpolating the pressure data over the entire 2d tank surface did not produce the correct image of the foam flow propagation shape this low prediction precision is mainly because of the precision of the pressure sensors that does not allow for the detection of the weak foam zones these results will allow the selection of a suitable method for monitoring foam flow in highly permeable porous media in future laboratory scale experiments and field scale tests our model incorporates the main parameters influencing foam flow behavior in highly permeable porous media through a reduction in gas phase mobility non newtonian behavior was introduced as a power law relationship obtained experimentally the concentration of surfactant wang et al 2012 and critical pressure khatib et al 1988 which play an important role in foam coalescence and consequently in how foam viscosity varies were also taken into acount the numerical model can correctly capture the shape and propagation of strong foam and its ability to divert water flows which is already confirmed by the tracing tests the mobility reduction factor we chose allowed us to capture the pressure variation behavior observed experimentally the model predicts the pressure values measured experimentally well the experimental results show a higher pressure gradient from the injection point with a more conical shape than the model results the higher pressure gradient in experimental data may be because of the compressibility which is not taken into account in the model one other possible reason for this small discrepancy can be related to the interpolation precision the difference between the shapes of the experimental and modeling pressure fields is due to the lack of pressure sensors on the bottom boundary of the 2d tank and therefore the low precision of the interpolation in this zone therefore this model can be used to predict foam injection processes in highly permeable porous media such as for soil remediation applications credit authorship contribution statement

116,the adsorption of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos on sediments is thought to be enhanced by the salting out effect soe which reduces contaminant solubility as water salinity increases the process of salting out has been observed for pfos in surface estuaries and likely operates in subterranean estuaries where tide induced groundwater circulation creates a dynamic saltwater freshwater mixing zone in the aquifer adjacent to the ocean the presence of this dynamic interface between dense seawater and fresh groundwater modifies the flow path of land derived organic contaminants however it is unclear how soe combined with tidal forcing of salt water affects the transport and fate of these contaminants in a subterranean estuary numerical studies of groundwater dynamics in a coastal aquifer are carried out using a modified version of sutra to investigate the behavior of pfos as it moves through an aquifer ocean interface three adsorption scenarios are investigated no adsorption and linear adsorption with a constant coefficient kd and a salinity dependent kd due to soe without adsorption point injected pfos moves and spreads as a plume around the margin of the tide induced upper saline plume usp this is in agreement with previous studies showing that a contaminant plume follows the freshwater discharge path and exits the aquifer around the usp in the intertidal zone the increase of tidal amplitude enlarges the usp forcing the discharge points of freshwater and pfos seaward in the case of a constant kd pfos concentration decreases in the groundwater as expected with an increase of pfos residence time in the aquifer the spatial distribution of the contaminant plume is similar to that of the no adsorption case in the case with the soe which enhances the solute adsorption in the saltwater zone pfos tends to be intercepted by the usp concentrated at its center and subsequently discharged with the tide induced saltwater circulation soe reduces both peak pfos discharge rate and plume dispersion in addition the pfos flow path moves upward and the pfos discharges above the usp the findings highlight the potential importance of investigating the soe of

guelfo and higgins 2013 mcguire et al 2014 weber et al 2017 however few investigations focused specifically on adsorptive transport in coastal aquifers the distribution of contaminants in coastal aquifers is dependent on their physical and chemical properties with concentration dependent aqueous phase density zhang et al 2001 oxidation condition uchiyama et al 2000 and adsorption capacity oh

higgins and luthy 2006 giesy et al 2010 ahrens 2011 brusseau 2018 the capacity of pfos adsorption is found to be affected by a range of factors such as solution ph competitive adsorption salting out characteristics of adsorbent and adsorbate temperature presence of organic matter zhang et al 2019a as well as ionic strength li et al 2021 the solid water distribution coefficient kd defined as the ratio of contaminant concentration associated with the solid phase to the aqueous phase concentration for linear adsorption in soils and aquifers at equilibrium is often used to indicate the adsorption capacity of a chemical zheng and bennett 2002 the relationship between solid with various percentages of sand silt and clay and aqueous phase pfos concentrations has been described by linear freundlich and langmuir model under isothermal conditions johnson et al 2007 ferrey et al 2012 milinovic et al 2015 persson and andersson 2016 using a linear adsorption model demonstrated the importance of kd on pfos plume dispersion and residence time in a simple groundwater model as expected larger kd values corresponds with reduced dispersion and higher residence times in soils and sediments pfos kd is highly dependent on organic carbon content higgins and luthy 2006 johnson et al 2007 ph ferrey et al 2012 and salinity jeon et al 2010 you et al 2010 chen et al 2012 gerold and henry 2018 nguyen et al 2020 pan and you 2010 calculated pfos kd for bottom sediments in the yangtze river estuary china and found that kd increased by an order of magnitude with the estuarine water salinity of the sampling sites which ranged from 0 1 to 3 3 part per thousand ppt this phenomenon of kd increasing with water salinity known as the salting out effect soe could be attributed to the reduction of aqueous solubility of pfos as inorganic ion concentration increases zhang et al 2019a giesy et al 2010 reported the solubility of pfos is 680 mgl 1 in pure water while only 12 4 mgl 1 in saltwater 35 ppt although the influence of soe on organic contaminant transport was significant in laboratory experiments dror et al 2003 it is unclear how the soe could alter the pfos transport and fate at the aquifer ocean interface previous work in surface estuaries pointed out that the soe is one of the most important mechanisms as pfos could be largely scavenged to the sediment due to the dramatic change in salinity pan and you 2010 wang et al 2013 implying that the soe could be one of the most important mechanisms influencing pfos transport in subterranean estuaries where fresh groundwater mixes with saline groundwater newell et al 2021 turner and rawling 2001 developed an exponential equation to describe the relationship between water salinity 0 3 to 27 ppt and kd for an organic chemical tetrachlorobiphenyl in estuarine bottom sediments of the river dart uk they suggested the equation could be used for many chemicals in estuarine environments however the mechanism of the soe on chemical adsorption remains unclear turner 2003 as well as the tidal effects and their coupling effect as the soe was observed for pfos giesy et al 2010 pan and you 2010 the equation was later applied to estimate pfas including pfos adsorbed on algae in tongyoung estuary jeon et al 2010 and in the suspended solids of the youngsan and nakdong estuaries hong et al 2013 korea in low energy coastal environments such as bays and estuaries suspended solids naturally deposit along the shoreline forming unconsolidated aquifers and ultimately subterranean estuaries the soe observed in suspended estuarine sediments is also likely to be associated with groundwater flow through these aquifers weir 2019 obtained salinity dependent pfos adsorption kd for sandy aquifer sediment materials near a tidal flat adjacent to the mouth of the brisbane river queensland weir 2019 it is important for remediation and management of pfos contaminated sites to understand pfos transport and fate in the subsurface estuary and thus the influence of the soe this study numerically investigates how the salinity dependence of kd affects transport and distribution of land derived pfos in coastal aquifers where groundwater dynamics are affected by density gradients and tides pfos was chosen as a representative pfas contaminant as out of the pfas which have been studied its adsorption is most sensitive to salinity hong et al 2013 and it is also the key contaminant in soil and associated with historic contamination with firefighting activities to characterize the effect of tide adsorption capacity and salting out on pfos transport the following adsorption scenarios associated with tidal fluctuations were analyzed 1 no adsorption 2 linear adsorption with constant kd and 3 linear adsorption with salinity dependent kd pfos residence time transport pathway and mass flux across the aquifer ocean interface were quantitatively assessed in the study soe modelled in this study is only one of the potential mechanisms of pfos adsorption but we suspect that it might be the dominant effect in subterranean estuaries 2 numerical simulations 2 1 groundwater flow and solute transport model sutra ms joseph and sanford 2004 was used to simulate 2 d variable density groundwater flow and transport of salt and pfos in an unconfined homogeneous and isotropic sandy coastal aquifer in sutra ms the governing equation for pfos transport with adsorption is 1 ρ θ s w c p f o s t 1 θ ρ s c p f o s s t ρ c p f o s k φ ρ θ s w d c p f o s q p c p f o s where cpfos is the pfos

set to be a no flow boundary such that precipitation and evapotranspiration are ignored however it should be noted that the latter might affect the salinity distribution in the aquifer for example evaporation may lead to salt accumulation above the water table forming a hypersaline zone geng and boufadel 2017 the seaward boundary de is a no flow boundary because previous studies indicated that implementing a tide induced transient boundary on de has little effect on flow and solute distribution in the aquifer robinson et al 2007a a hydrostatic head of 11 m was assigned to ab leaving a 1 m

seepage face boundary was implemented when the boundary nodes were saturated in the previous time step and above the tidal boundary water level according to the method proposed by wilson and gardner 2006 seawater salinity is set to be 35 ppt before the injection of pfos the model was allowed to reach a quasi steady state driven by tide and the freshwater inflow from the landward boundary robinson et al 2009 a solution with pfos concentration of c 0 and free of salt was then released with a pulse injection in the aquifer upstream of the usp at a coordinate of 30m 10m with an injection rate of 10 3 m3d 1 the injection event lasted for one day with a total amount of 1000 mg i e 1000 mgl 1 pfos released which generates a pfos concentration beneath the ground around 1 mgl 1 as reported in previous field data e g houtz et al 2013 barzen hanson and field 2015 2 2 salinity dependent adsorption model a salinity dependent linear adsorption model for pfos was integrated into sutra ms with kd dependent on local pore water salinity sutra ms has previously been modified to include a salinity dependent kd for a study of radium transport near the dead sea israel kiro et al 2012 in that case kd had a linear dependence on salinity for the soe we introduce the exponential equation to describe the increase of kd with salinity turner and rawling 2001 3 c p f o s s k d ρ c p f o s 4 k d k d 0 e 0

distribution in the aquifer will eventually reach a quasi steady state e g kuan et al 2012 in that case the variation of salinity over time at each location is negligible lenkopane et al 2009 and the salinity dependent adsorption model for pfos can be written as 6 c p f o s s t k d 0 e 0 0352 δ c s a l t ρ c p f o s t eq 6 is included in the simulation when the salting out effect is considered where csalt is calculated at the current time step results for salinity dependent kd will be compared with those for a constant kd to evaluate the importance of soe when a constant kd is considered the adsorption model assumes pore water density to be constant and equal to freshwater density ρ0 ml 3 and so δ is zero hence eq 3 and 6 can be reduced to the linear isotherm model 7 c p f o s s k d 0

coastal aquifers e g shen et al 2019 xin et al 2009 cases without pfos adsorption with transport driven by fresh groundwater input and tide only were considered first to provide a benchmark in order

choice of δ reflects previously determined solubility values of pfos hong et al 2013 munoz et al 2017b the simulation domain was discretized by 6351 nodes and 6192 elements this discretization was

adsorption effect of tidal magnitude the simulated stable salt distribution and development of the pfos plume without adsorption are shown in fig 3 with the increase of tidal amplitude the size of the usp enlarged while the width of the fdz reduced and its exit point moved seaward to the intertidal zone fig 4 and the toe of the sw retreated back towards the sea fig 3 a1 e1 in the case with a tidal amplitude of 0 25 m the contaminant plume formed after the injection moved seaward along the water table and exited the aquifer near the msl fig 3 a2 a4 as tidal amplitude increased the plume tended to transport around the boundary of the usp as well as mix with it following the route of the fdz the contaminant exited the aquifer with freshwater in the intertidal zone near the low tide mark as indicated by the centroid trajectory of the contaminant plume shown in fig 4 the increase of tidal amplitude caused the plume to migrate further seaward and deviate from the intertidal zone while showing a significant increase in residence time table 2 3 2 effect of constant kd adsorption on pfos transport fig 5 a and 5b show the distribution of the total concentration ct defined as the ratio of the mass of pfos in both aqueous and solid forms to its accommodating bulk soil volume and the aqueous phase concentration cw over time estimated for the case with a constant kd k d 0 3 0 lkg 1 and a tidal amplitude of 0 75 m in this case the shape and the development of the aqueous contaminant plume fig 5 b1 b4 was similar to that in the case with the same tidal signal but without adsorption fig 3 c2 c4 however the time required by pfos to be discharged to the ocean was extended significantly from about 197 d in the no adsorption case to about 5000 d in the adsorption case fig 6 shows the changes in the mass of total and dissolved pfos in the aquifer and the discharge rate of aqueous pfos through the beach over time estimated by the simulation cases with the same tidal amplitude t 0 75 m with different k d 0 0 1 3 0 and 10 0 lkg 1 as expected the mass fraction of aqueous pfos was significantly reduced with the increase of adsorption given the same amount of contaminant release in the aquifer the increase of k d 0 significantly reduced the peak of pfos outflux through the aquifer ocean interface as a result the residence time of pfos was prolonged by an order of magnitude in the aquifer fig 6 3 3 pfos transport with salinity dependent adsorption fig 5c and 5d show the distribution of contaminant in terms of its total concentration ct and aqueous concentration cw over time estimated for a salinity dependent adsorption k d 0 3 0 lkg 1 δ 2 0 lmol 1 and a tidal amplitude of 0 75 m before interception by the usp the contaminant remained within the freshwater and therefore the plumes estimated by the cases with a constant and a salinity dependent kd appeared to be similar fig 5a1 and 5c1 after pfos mixing with the usp the distributions of the contaminant described by the two methods deviated fig 5 a2 4 and c2 4 in the case of constant kd both the total and aqueous pfos tended to spread evenly around the lower boundary of the usp i e the width of the plume was relatively constant and the highest concentration overlapped with the 10 ppt salt contour line as pfos continued to discharge predominantly through the exit point of the fdz the concentration around the usp declined in a uniform manner however in the case with the salinity dependent kd the contaminant in both solid and aqueous form concentrated at the center of the usp where salinity was high forming a lobe shaped plume fig 5c2 driven by tidal circulation the contaminant spread widely within the usp and eventually discharged from the beach landward of the exit point of the fdz similar to the plume spread behaviour of ct the transport of aqueous contaminant cw was characterised by formation of a highly concentrated plume however the main part of the aqueous plume tended to follow the pathway of the fdz routing around the usp fig 5 d2 d4 which is consistent with the pathway of the case with constant kd fig 3 b2 b4 the ct plume passed through the center of the usp this suggests that the hotspots of aqueous and adsorbed pfos may occur at different locations and therefore the monitoring of pfos requires both the aqueous and solid phases to be considered cf a reliance on aqueous sampling alone fig 7 shows various indicators of pfos in the coastal aquifer over time estimated by the two cases fig 5 using different adsorption models the results from the two cases illustrated by all the indicators mentioned above followed almost similar patterns in particular constant and then steady decreases of total and aqueous pfos masses fig 7a increase of total mass in the usp mass flux across the beach plume area and variances of pfos to their peaks followed by monotonic declines fig 7b 7e and seaward migration of plume mass in a direction parallel to the beach during the initial stage of transport followed by an upward turn before discharging perpendicular to the beach at the end of the transport pathway fig 7f despite these similarities some temporal and spatial variations of the contaminants in the aquifer ocean interface estimated by the two adsorption models were still apparently different in the case of the constant kd pfos tended to travel within the fdz forming a plume consistent with previous findings for other contaminants e g robinson et al 2007a with the soe included aqueous pfos was prone to be adsorbed and concentrated onto soils as solid phase in the usp where salinity is high this led to an earlier decrease of aqueous mass in the aquifer fig 7a higher accumulation of pfos in the usp fig 7b an later contraction of the spread area despite nearly identical peak plume spread fig 7d and reduced plume variances fig 7e as compared to the estimations by the case with the constant kd given freshwater transport in the fdz is faster than tide induced saltwater circulation in the usp the transition of pfos pathway from the fdz to the usp resulted in an extended contaminant residence time in the aquifer about 3000 d fig 7a discharge through the beach was further prolonged with lower intensity 0 4 mgd 1 fig 7c an uplift of the pfos centroid trajectory was observed followed by the landward shift of the discharging point from the fdz exit to the beach above the usp fig 7f 3 4 adsorption and tidal amplitude influence on residence time the residence times of all cases are shown in fig 8 to highlight the coupling influences of adsorption and tide on pfos transport in the coastal aquifer comparing with the residence times estimated from the cases applying constant kd k d 0 0 1 3 0 and 10 0 lkg 1 in fig 8 the increase of k d 0 in orders of magnitude could result in proportional lengthening of the residence time the increase rate of the residence time defined as the slope of the residence time versus tidal amplitude under the same k d 0 also increased with the increase of k d 0 although under the same kd the increase of tide could further extend the residence time such influence seems to be apparent only when kd is large e g 10 0 lkg 1 when comparing the residence times from the cases with a constant kd of 3 0 lkg 1 and that with a salinity dependent kd the tide seemed to affect the residence time a little when the amplitude was small e g 0 25 m however the residence time increase with increasing tidal amplitude and the rate of increase is proportional to the solubility of pfos i e δ in saltwater 4 discussion previous modelling studies that did not include adsorption and soe suggested that land derived contaminants predominantly travel through the land ocean interface via the fdz e g geng et al 2017 robinson et al 2009 however despite the slower transport the plume size spread remained similar in the case with a constant kd fig 5 b compared to that without adsorption fig 3 c2 c4 for the same tidal amplitude by including the soe this investigation revealed that the majority of the pfos migrated to the usp transported in a reduced concentration following the tide driven groundwater flow path and eventually discharged to the ocean at a section of the beach landward of the fdz discharging point during the transport process dissolved pfos moved through the area with saltwater i e salinity around 10 ppt while adsorbed pfos accumulated in the usp where the salinity is higher the distributions of pfos in the aqueous and solid phases were not co located to manage pfos risk in salt affected groundwater system such as coastal aquifers our research suggests a measurements of salinity and the dissolved contaminant concentration as well as the adsorbed contaminant are required furthermore this study confirmed the importance of kd mcguire et al 2014 and tide ahmed and chen 2012 when examining the residence time of pfos the changes to contaminant transport due to the soe present challenges for the prediction of pfos pathways specifically the pathway may deviate several meters from the prediction without soe and might provide effective remediation strategy in coastal aquifers where salt distribution varies spatiotemporally the findings from this study may have important ecological and environmental implications the actual adsorbed pfos concentration is expected to be higher than simulation predictions as they neglect adsorption especially within the saline usp as a result bioaccumulation of these toxic chemicals in benthic organisms e g worms molluscs and crabs munoz et al 2017a could be underestimated however the peak mass discharge fig 7c to the surrounding marine environment and impact on susceptible marine biota could potentially be significantly reduced due to the retardation in saline groundwater providing a peak shaving as a natural attenuation process newell et al 2021 given that a large proportion of pfos may reside in the aquifer as solid phase investigation of pfos adsorbed onto aquifer soils which is often ignored is likely to be critical when developing a mass balance of pfos in coastal systems zhang et al 2019b it is worth noting that although the range of kd in this study possibly represents the adsorption capacity of pfos in sandy soils hong et al 2013 ferrey et al 2012 johnson et al 2007 the kd values vary widely between different samples milinovic et al 2015 munoz et al 2017b thus it is important to determine the kd at specific sites before introducing the soe furthermore the exponential equation in this study was developed based on the linear isotherm model however laboratory experiments also indicate that freundlich and langmuir adsorption models johnson et al 2007 were also applicable for pfos adsorption and thus further investigation is warranted to describe the soe under these isotherm conditions the exponential relation between k d and salinity may be applicable to sand munoz et al 2017b while not to clay soils jeon et al 2011 the transport and distribution of bulk salt and contaminant could be more intricate in anisotropic and heterogeneous aquifers michael et al 2016 geng et al 2020 due to for example matrix diffusion e g adamson et al 2020 newell et al 2021 divalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 inorganic ions zhang et al 2019a which are not included in the current modelling study in this investigation rainfall induced leaching evaporation induced up flow geng et al 2017 and adsorption at the air water interface are ignored based on the argument that pfos are released below the groundwater table previous work suggests the air water interface adsorption of pfos in the unsaturated sand is significant due to its lower water content compared to other soils brusseau 2018 guo et al 2020 the importance of these processes in subterranean estuary systems still needs further examination finally it should be noted that the outcome of this study could not represent the fate and transport of all pfas in coastal aquifers as pfas comprises large number of chemical species with distinct adsorption characteristics 5 conclusion this study numerically examined the combined effects of tide and the soe on pfos behavior in a coastal sandy aquifer simulations without adsorption were first undertaken to single out the tidal effect on the transport of land derived pfos consistent with previous studies of conservative solutes we observed the plume expanded around the tide induced usp before exiting the aquifer following the route of the fdz near the intertidal zone with the increase in tidal amplitude the usp was larger in size and the exit point of the fdz deviated seaward from the intertidal zone under the same tide amplitude the shape of the contaminant plume in the cases of constant kd remains similar to that in the case without adsorption despite a relatively lower aqueous concentration with a larger amount of adsorbed contaminant the residence time of pfos was prolonged due to the decrease of mass flux across the beach when salinity dependent adsorption was included the tide induced usp caused salting out of pfos leading to a significant retardation of pfos transport through the aquifer ocean interface the trajectory of the pfos plume centroid was slightly elevated 2 m compared to the cases with constant kd indicating the soe shortened the contaminant pathway the residence time of pfos in such a coastal aquifer was controlled by its adsorption capacity in the aquifer material its solubility in saltwater as well as the tidal amplitude and hydraulic gradient the significant retardation of pfos transport due to soe suggests the possible formation of an organic contaminant sink in the coastal aquifer despite these findings it should be pointed out that there are many other factors that could influence the transport of pfos in coastal aquifers e g groundwater and soil chemistry heterogeneity of aquifer contaminant source location and release history which are not investigated in the current work further investigation is therefore needed especially with carefully controlled laboratory experiments to better quantify the salting out effect

116,the adsorption of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos on sediments is thought to be enhanced by the salting out effect soe which reduces contaminant solubility as water salinity increases the process of salting out has been observed for pfos in surface estuaries and likely operates in subterranean estuaries where tide induced groundwater circulation creates a dynamic saltwater freshwater mixing zone in the aquifer adjacent to the ocean the presence of this dynamic interface between dense seawater and fresh groundwater modifies the flow path of land derived organic contaminants however it is unclear how soe combined with tidal forcing of salt water affects the transport and fate of these contaminants in a subterranean estuary numerical studies of groundwater dynamics in a coastal aquifer are carried out using a modified version of sutra to investigate the behavior of pfos as it moves through an aquifer ocean interface three adsorption scenarios are investigated no adsorption and linear adsorption with a constant coefficient kd and a salinity dependent kd due to soe without adsorption point injected pfos moves and spreads as a plume around the margin of the tide induced upper saline plume usp this is in agreement with previous studies showing that a contaminant plume follows the freshwater discharge path and exits the aquifer around the usp in the intertidal zone the increase of tidal amplitude enlarges the usp forcing the discharge points of freshwater and pfos seaward in the case of a constant kd pfos concentration decreases in the groundwater as expected with an increase of pfos residence time in the aquifer the spatial distribution of the contaminant plume is similar to that of the no adsorption case in the case with the soe which enhances the solute adsorption in the saltwater zone pfos tends to be intercepted by the usp concentrated at its center and subsequently discharged with the tide induced saltwater circulation soe reduces both peak pfos discharge rate and plume dispersion in addition the pfos flow path moves upward and the pfos discharges above the usp the findings highlight the potential importance of investigating the soe of organic contaminants for benthic organisms when considering their transport and fate in tidally influenced coastal aquifers keywords pfos transport salting out effect freshwater saltwater interaction

driven flow numerical modelling shows that the tide causes the contaminant plume to spread around the usp with an increase in travel time compared to the simulation without tide robinson et al 2007a an increase of tidal amplitude leads to the expansion of the usp in the aquifer resulting in the lengthening of the fdz geng et al 2017 furthermore tidally driven recirculation generates an oxygen rich usp which can accelerate the aerobic biodegradation of organic pollutants li et al 2004 geng et al 2015 the action of surface water waves also enhances seawater infiltration in the saltwater freshwater mixing zone and facilitates the transformation of nutrients anwar et al 2014 previous studies have indicated the important role of adsorption in pfos transport through soils and aquifers guelfo and higgins 2013 mcguire et al 2014 weber et al 2017 however few investigations focused specifically on adsorptive transport in coastal aquifers the distribution of contaminants in coastal aquifers is dependent on their physical and chemical properties with concentration dependent aqueous phase density zhang et al 2001 oxidation condition uchiyama et al 2000 and adsorption capacity oh

higgins and luthy 2006 giesy et al 2010 ahrens 2011 brusseau 2018 the capacity of pfos adsorption is found to be affected by a range of factors such as solution ph competitive adsorption salting out characteristics of adsorbent and adsorbate temperature presence of organic matter zhang et al 2019a as well as ionic strength li et al 2021 the solid water distribution coefficient kd defined as the ratio of contaminant concentration associated with the solid phase to the aqueous phase concentration for linear adsorption in soils and aquifers at equilibrium is often used to indicate the adsorption capacity of a chemical zheng and bennett 2002 the relationship between solid with various percentages of sand silt and clay and aqueous phase pfos concentrations has been described by linear freundlich and langmuir model under isothermal conditions johnson et al 2007 ferrey et al 2012 milinovic et al 2015 persson and andersson 2016 using a linear adsorption model demonstrated the importance of kd on pfos plume dispersion and residence time in a simple groundwater model as expected larger kd values corresponds with reduced dispersion and higher residence times in soils and sediments pfos kd is highly dependent on organic carbon content higgins and luthy 2006 johnson et al 2007 ph ferrey et al 2012 and salinity jeon et al 2010 you et al 2010 chen et al 2012 gerold and henry 2018 nguyen et al 2020 pan and you 2010 calculated pfos kd for bottom sediments in the yangtze river estuary china and found that kd increased by an order of magnitude with the estuarine water salinity of the sampling sites which ranged from 0 1 to 3 3 part per thousand ppt this phenomenon of kd increasing with water salinity known as the salting out effect soe could be attributed to the reduction of aqueous solubility of pfos as inorganic ion concentration increases zhang et al 2019a giesy et al 2010 reported the solubility of pfos is 680 mgl 1 in pure water while only 12 4 mgl 1 in saltwater 35 ppt although the influence of soe on organic contaminant transport was significant in laboratory experiments dror et al 2003 it is unclear how the soe could alter the pfos transport and fate at the aquifer ocean interface previous work in surface estuaries pointed out that the soe is one of the most important mechanisms as pfos could be largely scavenged to the sediment due to the dramatic change in salinity pan and you 2010 wang et al 2013 implying that the soe could be one of the most important mechanisms influencing pfos transport in subterranean estuaries where fresh groundwater mixes with saline groundwater newell et al 2021 turner and rawling 2001 developed an exponential equation to describe the relationship between water salinity 0 3 to 27 ppt and kd for an organic chemical tetrachlorobiphenyl in estuarine bottom sediments of the river dart uk they suggested the equation could be used for many chemicals in estuarine environments however the mechanism of the soe on chemical adsorption remains unclear turner 2003 as well as the tidal effects and their coupling effect as the soe was observed for pfos giesy et al 2010 pan and you 2010 the equation was later applied to estimate pfas including pfos adsorbed on algae in tongyoung estuary jeon et al 2010 and in the suspended solids of the youngsan and nakdong estuaries hong et al 2013 korea in low energy coastal environments such as bays and estuaries suspended solids naturally deposit along the shoreline forming unconsolidated aquifers and ultimately subterranean estuaries the soe observed in suspended estuarine sediments is also likely to be associated with groundwater flow through these aquifers weir 2019 obtained salinity dependent pfos adsorption kd for sandy aquifer sediment materials near a tidal flat adjacent to the mouth of the brisbane river queensland weir 2019 it is important for remediation and management of pfos contaminated sites to understand pfos transport and fate in the subsurface estuary and thus the influence of the soe this study numerically investigates how the salinity dependence of kd affects transport and distribution of land derived pfos in coastal aquifers where groundwater dynamics are affected by density gradients and tides pfos was chosen as a representative pfas contaminant as out of the pfas which have been studied its adsorption is most sensitive to salinity hong et al 2013 and it is also the key contaminant in soil and associated with historic contamination with firefighting activities to characterize the effect of tide adsorption capacity and salting out on pfos transport the following adsorption scenarios associated with tidal fluctuations were analyzed 1 no adsorption 2 linear adsorption with constant kd and 3 linear adsorption with salinity dependent kd pfos residence time transport pathway and mass flux across the aquifer ocean interface were quantitatively assessed in the study soe modelled in this study is only one of the potential mechanisms of pfos adsorption but we suspect that it might be the dominant effect in subterranean estuaries 2 numerical simulations 2 1 groundwater flow and solute transport model sutra ms joseph and sanford 2004 was used to simulate 2 d variable density groundwater flow and transport of salt and pfos in an unconfined homogeneous and isotropic sandy coastal aquifer in sutra ms the governing equation for pfos transport with adsorption is 1 ρ θ s w c p f o s t 1 θ ρ s c p f o s s t ρ c p f o s k φ ρ θ s w d c p f o s q p c p f o s where cpfos is the pfos

set to be a no flow boundary such that precipitation and evapotranspiration are ignored however it should be noted that the latter might affect the salinity distribution in the aquifer for example evaporation may lead to salt accumulation above the water table forming a hypersaline zone geng and boufadel 2017 the seaward boundary de is a no flow boundary because previous studies indicated that implementing a tide induced transient boundary on de has little effect on flow and solute distribution in the aquifer robinson et al 2007a a hydrostatic head of 11 m was assigned to ab leaving a 1 m

seepage face boundary was implemented when the boundary nodes were saturated in the previous time step and above the tidal boundary water level according to the method proposed by wilson and gardner 2006 seawater salinity is set to be 35 ppt before the injection of pfos the model was allowed to reach a quasi steady state driven by tide and the freshwater inflow from the landward boundary robinson et al 2009 a solution with pfos concentration of c 0 and free of salt was then released with a pulse injection in the aquifer upstream of the usp at a coordinate of 30m 10m with an injection rate of 10 3 m3d 1 the injection event lasted for one day with a total amount of 1000 mg i e 1000 mgl 1 pfos released which generates a pfos concentration beneath the ground around 1 mgl 1 as reported in previous field data e g houtz et al 2013 barzen hanson and field 2015 2 2 salinity dependent adsorption model a salinity dependent linear adsorption model for pfos was integrated into sutra ms with kd dependent on local pore water salinity sutra ms has previously been modified to include a salinity dependent kd for a study of radium transport near the dead sea israel kiro et al 2012 in that case kd had a linear dependence on salinity for the soe we introduce the exponential equation to describe the increase of kd with salinity turner and rawling 2001 3 c p f o s s k d ρ c p f o s 4 k d k d 0 e 0

distribution in the aquifer will eventually reach a quasi steady state e g kuan et al 2012 in that case the variation of salinity over time at each location is negligible lenkopane et al 2009 and the salinity dependent adsorption model for pfos can be written as 6 c p f o s s t k d 0 e 0 0352 δ c s a l t ρ c p f o s t eq 6 is included in the simulation when the salting out effect is considered where csalt is calculated at the current time step results for salinity dependent kd will be compared with those for a constant kd to evaluate the importance of soe when a constant kd is considered the adsorption model assumes pore water density to be constant and equal to freshwater density ρ0 ml 3 and so δ is zero hence eq 3 and 6 can be reduced to the linear isotherm model 7 c p f o s s k d 0

coastal aquifers e g shen et al 2019 xin et al 2009 cases without pfos adsorption with transport driven by fresh groundwater input and tide only were considered first to provide a benchmark in order to assess contaminant transport under different tidal conditions five cases were considered tidal amplitude of 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and 1 25 m in order to assess the effect of kd three k d 0 values 0 1 3

dependent kd fig 2 b the value is set to 3 0 lkg 1 for freshwater while increases to 19 0 35 3 and finally 65 3 l kg 1 for seawater corresponding to δ equal to 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 lmol 1 respectively this choice of δ reflects previously determined solubility values of pfos hong et al 2013 munoz et al 2017b the simulation domain was discretized by 6351 nodes and 6192 elements this discretization was

ocean interface where the usp and sw are present δx 1 m δz 0 1 m grid independence tests were conducted to ensure convergence no significant differences were found in pfos residence time and outflow

adsorption effect of tidal magnitude the simulated stable salt distribution and development of the pfos plume without adsorption are shown in fig 3 with the increase of tidal amplitude the size of the usp enlarged while the width of the fdz reduced and its exit point moved seaward to the intertidal zone fig 4 and the toe of the sw retreated back towards the sea fig 3 a1 e1 in the case with a tidal amplitude of 0 25 m the contaminant plume formed after the injection moved seaward along the water table and exited the aquifer near the msl fig 3 a2 a4 as tidal amplitude increased the plume tended to transport around the boundary of the usp as well as mix with it following the route of the fdz the contaminant exited the aquifer with freshwater in the intertidal zone near the low tide mark as indicated by the centroid trajectory of the contaminant plume shown in fig 4 the increase of tidal amplitude caused the plume to migrate further seaward and deviate from the intertidal zone while showing a significant increase in residence time table 2 3 2 effect of constant kd adsorption on pfos transport fig 5 a and 5b show the distribution of the total concentration ct defined as the ratio of the mass of pfos in both aqueous and solid forms to its accommodating bulk soil volume and the aqueous phase concentration cw over time estimated for the case with a constant kd k d 0 3 0 lkg 1 and a tidal amplitude of 0 75 m in this case the shape and the development of the aqueous contaminant plume fig 5 b1 b4 was similar to that in the case with the same tidal signal but without adsorption fig 3 c2 c4 however the time required by pfos to be discharged to the ocean was extended significantly from about 197 d in the no adsorption case to about 5000 d in the adsorption case fig 6 shows the changes in the mass of total and dissolved pfos in the aquifer and the discharge rate of aqueous pfos through the beach over time estimated by the simulation cases with the same tidal amplitude t 0 75 m with different k d 0 0 1 3 0 and 10 0 lkg 1 as expected the mass fraction of aqueous pfos was significantly reduced with the increase of adsorption given the same amount of contaminant release in the aquifer the increase of k d 0 significantly reduced the peak of pfos outflux through the aquifer ocean interface as a result the residence time of pfos was prolonged by an order of magnitude in the aquifer fig 6 3 3 pfos transport with salinity dependent adsorption fig 5c and 5d show the distribution of contaminant in terms of its total concentration ct and aqueous concentration cw over time estimated for a salinity dependent adsorption k d 0 3 0 lkg 1 δ 2 0 lmol 1 and a tidal amplitude of 0 75 m before interception by the usp the contaminant remained within the freshwater and therefore the plumes estimated by the cases with a constant and a salinity dependent kd appeared to be similar fig 5a1 and 5c1 after pfos mixing with the usp the distributions of the contaminant described by the two methods deviated fig 5 a2 4 and c2 4 in the case of constant kd both the total and aqueous pfos tended to spread evenly around the lower boundary of the usp i e the width of the plume was relatively constant and the highest concentration overlapped with the 10 ppt salt contour line as pfos continued to discharge predominantly through the exit point of the fdz the concentration around the usp declined in a uniform manner however in the case with the salinity dependent kd the contaminant in both solid and aqueous form concentrated at the center of the usp where salinity was high forming a lobe shaped plume fig 5c2 driven by tidal circulation the contaminant spread widely within the usp and eventually discharged from the beach landward of the exit point of the fdz similar to the plume spread behaviour of ct the transport of aqueous contaminant cw was characterised by formation of a highly concentrated plume however the main part of the aqueous plume tended to follow the pathway of the fdz routing around the usp fig 5 d2 d4 which is consistent with the pathway of the case with constant kd fig 3 b2 b4 the ct plume passed through the center of the usp this suggests that the hotspots of aqueous and adsorbed pfos may occur at different locations and therefore the monitoring of pfos requires both the aqueous and solid phases to be considered cf a reliance on aqueous sampling alone fig 7 shows various indicators of pfos in the coastal aquifer over time estimated by the two cases fig 5 using different adsorption models the results from the two cases illustrated by all the indicators mentioned above followed almost similar patterns in particular constant and then steady decreases of total and aqueous pfos masses fig 7a increase of total mass in the usp mass flux across the beach plume area and variances of pfos to their peaks followed by monotonic declines fig 7b 7e and seaward migration of plume mass in a direction parallel to the beach during the initial stage of transport followed by an upward turn before discharging perpendicular to the beach at the end of the transport pathway fig 7f despite these similarities some temporal and spatial variations of the contaminants in the aquifer ocean interface estimated by the two adsorption models were still apparently different in the case of the constant kd pfos tended to travel within the fdz forming a plume consistent with previous findings for other contaminants e g robinson et al 2007a with the soe included aqueous pfos was prone to be adsorbed and concentrated onto soils as solid phase in the usp where salinity is high this led to an earlier decrease of aqueous mass in the aquifer fig 7a higher accumulation of pfos in the usp fig 7b an later contraction of the spread area despite nearly identical peak plume spread fig 7d and reduced plume variances fig 7e as compared to the estimations by the case with the constant kd given freshwater transport in the fdz is faster than tide induced saltwater circulation in the usp the transition of pfos pathway from the fdz to the usp resulted in an extended contaminant residence time in the aquifer about 3000 d fig 7a discharge through the beach was further prolonged with lower intensity 0 4 mgd 1 fig 7c an uplift of the pfos centroid trajectory was observed followed by the landward shift of the discharging point from the fdz exit to the beach above the usp fig 7f 3 4 adsorption and tidal amplitude influence on residence time the residence times of all cases are shown in fig 8 to highlight the coupling influences of adsorption and tide on pfos transport in the coastal aquifer comparing with the residence times estimated from the cases applying constant kd k d 0 0 1 3 0 and 10 0 lkg 1 in fig 8 the increase of k d 0 in orders of magnitude could result in proportional lengthening of the residence time the increase rate of the residence time defined as the slope of the residence time versus tidal amplitude under the same k d 0 also increased with the increase of k d 0 although under the same kd the increase of tide could further extend the residence time such influence seems to be apparent only when kd is large e g 10 0 lkg 1 when comparing the residence times from the cases with a constant kd of 3 0 lkg 1 and that with a salinity dependent kd the tide seemed to affect the residence time a little when the amplitude was small e g 0 25 m however the residence time increase with increasing tidal amplitude and the rate of increase is proportional to the solubility of pfos i e δ in saltwater 4 discussion previous modelling studies that did not include adsorption and soe suggested that land derived contaminants predominantly travel through the land ocean interface via the fdz e g geng et al 2017 robinson et al 2009 however despite the slower transport the plume size spread remained similar in the case with a constant kd fig 5 b compared to that without adsorption fig 3 c2 c4 for the same tidal amplitude by including the soe this investigation revealed that the majority of the pfos migrated to the usp transported in a reduced concentration following the tide driven groundwater flow path and eventually discharged to the ocean at a section of the beach landward of the fdz discharging point during the transport process dissolved pfos moved through the area with saltwater i e salinity around 10 ppt while adsorbed pfos accumulated in the usp where the salinity is higher the distributions of pfos in the aqueous and solid phases were not co located to manage pfos risk in salt affected groundwater system such as coastal aquifers our research suggests a measurements of salinity and the dissolved contaminant concentration as well as the adsorbed contaminant are required furthermore this study confirmed the importance of kd mcguire et al 2014 and tide ahmed and chen 2012 when examining the residence time of pfos the changes to contaminant transport due to the soe present challenges for the prediction of pfos pathways specifically the pathway may deviate several meters from the prediction without soe and might provide effective remediation strategy in coastal aquifers where salt distribution varies spatiotemporally the findings from this study may have important ecological and environmental implications the actual adsorbed pfos concentration is expected to be higher than simulation predictions as they neglect adsorption especially within the saline usp as a result bioaccumulation of these toxic chemicals in benthic organisms e g worms molluscs and crabs munoz et al 2017a could be underestimated however the peak mass discharge fig 7c to the surrounding marine environment and impact on susceptible marine biota could potentially be significantly reduced due to the retardation in saline groundwater providing a peak shaving as a natural attenuation process newell et al 2021 given that a large proportion of pfos may reside in the aquifer as solid phase investigation of pfos adsorbed onto aquifer soils which is often ignored is likely to be critical when developing a mass balance of pfos in coastal systems zhang et al 2019b it is worth noting that although the range of kd in this study possibly represents the adsorption capacity of pfos in sandy soils hong et al 2013 ferrey et al 2012 johnson et al 2007 the kd values vary widely between different samples milinovic et al 2015 munoz et al 2017b thus it is important to determine the kd at specific sites before introducing the soe furthermore the exponential equation in this study was developed based on the linear isotherm model however laboratory experiments also indicate that freundlich and langmuir adsorption models johnson et al 2007 were also applicable for pfos adsorption and thus further investigation is warranted to describe the soe under these isotherm conditions the exponential relation between k d and salinity may be applicable to sand munoz et al 2017b while not to clay soils jeon et al 2011 the transport and distribution of bulk salt and contaminant could be more intricate in anisotropic and heterogeneous aquifers michael et al 2016 geng et al 2020 due to for example matrix diffusion e g adamson et al 2020 newell et al 2021 divalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 inorganic ions zhang et al 2019a which are not included in the current modelling study in this investigation rainfall induced leaching evaporation induced up flow geng et al 2017 and adsorption at the air water interface are ignored based on the argument that pfos are released below the groundwater table previous work suggests the air water interface adsorption of pfos in the unsaturated sand is significant due to its lower water content compared to other soils brusseau 2018 guo et al 2020 the importance of these processes in subterranean estuary systems still needs further examination finally it should be noted that the outcome of this study could not represent the fate and transport of all pfas in coastal aquifers as pfas comprises large number of chemical species with distinct adsorption characteristics 5 conclusion this study numerically examined the combined effects of tide and the soe on pfos behavior in a coastal sandy aquifer simulations without adsorption were first undertaken to single out the tidal effect on the transport of land derived pfos consistent with previous studies of conservative solutes we observed the plume expanded around the tide induced usp before exiting the aquifer following the route of the fdz near the intertidal zone with the increase in tidal amplitude the usp was larger in size and the exit point of the fdz deviated seaward from the intertidal zone under the same tide amplitude the shape of the contaminant plume in the cases of constant kd remains similar to that in the case without adsorption despite a relatively lower aqueous concentration with a larger amount of adsorbed contaminant the residence time of pfos was prolonged due to the decrease of mass flux across the beach when salinity dependent adsorption was included the tide induced usp caused salting out of pfos leading to a significant retardation of pfos transport through the aquifer ocean interface the trajectory of the pfos plume centroid was slightly elevated 2 m compared to the cases with constant kd indicating the soe shortened the contaminant pathway the residence time of pfos in such a coastal aquifer was controlled by its adsorption capacity in the aquifer material its solubility in saltwater as well as the tidal amplitude and hydraulic gradient the significant retardation of pfos transport due to soe suggests the possible formation of an organic contaminant sink in the coastal aquifer despite these findings it should be pointed out that there are many other factors that could influence the transport of pfos in coastal aquifers e g groundwater and soil chemistry heterogeneity of aquifer contaminant source location and release history which are not investigated in the current work further investigation is therefore needed especially with carefully controlled laboratory experiments to better quantify the salting out effect

117,sediment mobility and memory effects distinguish transport and morphodynamics in fine sediment settings from sandy settings this paper focuses on the morphodynamic modeling of fine sediment systems and an adaptation of modeling procedures more commonly used in sand dominated systems an extensive dataset of short term transport and morphological trends along with ancillary data is used to support the development parameterization and calibration of a morphodynamic model of the lower passaic river usa the model is subsequently extended to include a morphological acceleration procedure in order to enable computationally efficient morphodynamic simulations the performance of the resulting model is first verified and subsequently validated using measured decadal scale morphological change subsequently the model is used to assess the current morphodynamic status and the long term response of the river to forcings such as shipping episodic storm events and climate change with results that are consistent with theoretical expectations keywords morphological acceleration morphodynamic modeling morfac fluff layer fine sediment 1 introduction the morphological evolution of estuaries is of consequence for problems such as contaminant fate and transport water quality siltation of navigation channels dredged material management impact of engineering works etc morphological change is a function of the bed water exchange processes of erosion and deposition and the water column transport processes of advection and dispersion these processes are often parameterized and simulated in process based numerical morphodynamic models for an assessment of morphological response to external forcings or to engineering works such morphodynamic models have been developed and applied more commonly in sand dominated 1 1 sand and fine sediment are nominally defined as particle sizes greater than and less than 63 μm respectively moreover we implicitly assume that fines exhibit cohesive behavior systems lesser et al 2004 roelvink 2006 than in fines dominated systems vested et al 2013 likely due to the site specific spatially variable and temporally variable nature of various fine sediment transport processes that typically requires extensive data for representation and parameterization in numerical models this paper focuses on the morphodynamic modeling of fine sediment systems and the adaptation of modeling procedures more commonly used in sand dominated systems however there are important differences between sand and fine sediment transport that require examination in the context of process based morphodynamic models sand transport is typically an equilibrium process characterized by capacity load conditions i e an equilibrium exists between the local sediment load and the transport capacity of the local turbulent flow velocity as this equilibrium is rapidly established under alluvial bed conditions morphological change in sandy settings is a function of gradients in transport and is generally calculated using equilibrium transport formulations van rijn 1993 although pick up functions for prescribing bed water exchange processes may be used as well in contrast fine sediment transport is typically characterized by non equilibrium conditions with respect to the carrying capacity of the flow the non equilibrium behavior can originate from beds comprised of a mixture of sands and fines thus limiting the erosion of fines beds with a vertical gradient in erodibility 2 2 erodibility in the context of this paper refers to the critical shear stress for erosion τcr the threshold bed shear stress required to be exceeded for surface erosion to occur following the partheniades erosion formulation partheniades 1965 an increase in the critical shear stress for erosion with depth represents a decrease in sediment erodibility with depth thus limiting erosion under given shear stress or systems where settling velocities are too low to achieve significant deposition of fines thus limiting sediment availability for erosion these are referred to as supply limited erosion limited or settling limited conditions respectively winterwerp et al 2021 such phenomena control local bed water exchange and consequently gross erosion and gross deposition have to be modeled explicitly through pick up and deposition functions rather than with equilibrium transport formulations related to the notion of erosion limited transport is the effect of armoring stratification and consolidation of the sediment bed in causing a decrease in erodibility with depth mehta 1988 sanford and maa 2001 this implies that the amount of mobile sediment i e sediment available for erosion under given flow regime and morphological response to a given event is not only a function of the event magnitude but also the time history of events vested et al 2013 mathew and winterwerp 2020 erosion limited transport can be manifest during non event e g tide dominated conditions when erosion may be limited to a thin layer thickness on the order of millimeters of easily erodible surficial sediments termed the fluff layer mathew and winterwerp 2017 during episodic events e g high river flow when erosion may extend deeper into the bed as well as during intermediate conditions e g low moderate river flows when erosion is limited to the fluff layer but transport from the head of tide is important for sediment supply considerations winterwerp et al 2021 mathew and winterwerp 2020 thus the system develops a memory represented by the availability of mobile sediment affected largely by past conditions and events that influences subsequent morphological development the sediment mobility and memory effects steer morphological development on short tidal time scales and long time scales many years by influencing erosion and deposition in case the eroded sediment were to be deposited elsewhere in the system consequently morphodynamics in fine sediment settings can be non linear i e becoming poorly related to the instantaneous event magnitude this poses challenges for the morphodynamic modeling of such systems beyond those encountered in sandy systems typically morphodynamic models for sandy systems are based on sediment transport models calibrated to site specific data for relatively short term periods and then used to perform long term simulations therefore the first objective of this paper is to investigate whether a similar procedure of developing a morphodynamic model calibrated over relatively short term periods may be applied in erosion limited fine sediment settings where memory effects are prominent we start from a mixed sands and fines sediment transport model calibrated over a range of hydrologic conditions and using various calibration metrics the model is then run in morphodynamic mode prescribing all hydrodynamic forcing in detail we refer to brute force morphodynamic simulations over the timescale of a few years with model performance assessed using measured morphological change this is similar to the setup of morphodynamic models for sandy systems further to morphodynamic modeling in sandy systems recent advances in this subject area include the morphological acceleration factor morfac technique for morphodynamic upscaling which enables morphological simulations over extended time scales in a computationally efficient fashion lesser et al 2004 roelvink 2006 ranasinghe et al 2011 lesser 2009 the morfac approach has been successfully applied in sandy systems over multi year to millennial time scales by various authors van der wegen and roelvink 2008 dam et al 2016 styles et al 2016 although not as extensively applied as for sandy systems the morfac approach has also been applied to fine sediment systems ganju et al 2009 george et al 2012 van der wegen and jaffe 2014 however as it is not obvious that the morfac approach can yield realistic results for fine sediment systems with memory effects at all time scales the second objective of this paper is to investigate the viability of the morfac approach for decadal scale morphodynamic simulations in erosion limited fine sediment settings subsequently the morphodynamic model using morfac is used to address specific research questions related to long term morphodynamics accordingly the paper is divided into three major parts the first part describes the development and calibration of the morphodynamic model over the timescale of a few years for the particular estuary presented here a calibrated model is necessary for the morfac approach described in the second part of the paper the second part includes a comparison of results from the morphodynamic model with morfac to the brute force simulations in order to test the applicability of the morfac approach in fine sediment settings as additional validation of the morfac approach over the long term the second part also compares the performance of the morphodynamic model with morfac to decadal scale data for morphological change finally the third part of the paper presents the application of the morphodynamic model with morfac to assess long term morphodynamic response to various system forcings that cannot otherwise be determined empirically these include the role of navigation which is specific to the particular estuary presented here the role of episodic storm events and the impact of climate change the following sections present an overview of morphodynamics in the particular estuary that is the subject of the model application presented here followed by the afore mentioned three major parts of the paper and a discussion 2 site overview and sediment dynamics the data presented in this manuscript come from the lower passaic river lpr an estuary that is part of new york harbor usa fig 1 the data presented here were collected as part of an ongoing environmental cleanup effort of the lpr the lpr stretches approximately 28 km long from its mouth in newark bay at river mile rm 0 to the head of tide at dundee dam rm 17 5 newark bay is connected to new york harbor and raritan bay and the atlantic ocean via the tidal inlets kill van kull and arthur kill respectively the width of the lpr ranges from approximately 600 m at its mouth declining to about 200 m at rm 1 4 150 m at rm 4 2 120 m at rm 6 7 90 m at rm 10 2 and 75 m at rm 13 5 i e locations about 1 5 km 6 km 10 km 15 5 km and 21 km respectively from the mouth of the river these were also the locations of months long october 10 2009 to december 16 2009 and march 22 2010 to july 24 2010 in situ measurements of salinity velocity water depth and suspended sediment concentrations ssc used to calibrate the numerical model presented here typical water depths along the thalweg in the lpr currently range between 5 and 7 m with respect to mean sea level msl the lpr is characterized by the remnants of a navigation channel dredged several decades ago design depths of about 10 m at the mouth and 4 m in the upper reaches but no longer actively maintained the hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics in the lpr were analyzed by mathew and winterwerp 2020 using the in situ data and are summarized here these dynamics represent the conceptual model of sediment transport used to support the development of the morphodynamic model in the following sections the primary hydrodynamic forcings within the lpr include barotropic and baroclinic circulation and river flow barotropic circulation includes the periodic tide as well as episodic coastal setup setdown events both of which result in volume fluxes into and out of the estuary driven by the along channel water level gradient semi diurnal tides period of 12 42 h corresponding to the dominant semi diurnal m2 constituent and tidal range of 0 9 to 2 1 m from neap to spring entering newark bay through the kill van kull and arthur kill propagate to the lpr and the head of tide at dundee dam baroclinic circulation is induced by along channel density gradients resulting from the mixing of freshwater from the head of tide and saline water from the ocean the resulting longitudinal salinity gradient induces residual near bottom currents directed up estuary and near surface currents directed down estuary salinity intrusion occurs under most river flows annual average river flow at dundee dam is about 34 m3 s with the saline water flushed out of the lpr at high river flows 200 m3 s return period of 2 years the extent of salinity intrusion as indicated by the location of the salt front also determines the location of the estuarine turbidity maximum etm a zone of elevated ssc and enhanced sediment trapping suspended sediment transport in the lpr varies over tidal time scales responding to the cyclic variations in tidal currents by eroding and replenishing by deposition the sediment inventory in the fluff layer the presence of the fluff layer in the lpr has been observed in erodibility measurements using a gust microcosm on shallow sediment cores as well as other lines of evidence mathew and winterwerp 2017 briefly the gust microcosm experimental setup consists of an enclosed chamber containing a sediment core overlaid by a layer of continually refreshed water a sequence of increasing shear stresses is imposed by varying the rotation speed of a disc positioned above the water and the sediment mass eroded at given shear stress is measured the erosion rate and shear stress measurements are subsequently analyzed to determine the profile of τ cr over a relatively shallow depth interval on the order of mm the data show a thin pool 2 4 mm thick of easily erodible sediments overlying less erodible strata and comprised of sediments that are resuspended twice every tidal cycle once during flood and again during ebb and redeposited around slack water increasing river flow alters these dynamics in two respects by preventing deposition around slack water i e preventing replenishment of the fluff layer and by causing erosion of the more consolidated sediments underneath the fluff layer consequently sediment transport as inferred from the tidally integrated net suspended sediment flux ssf is influenced by barotropic and baroclinic circulation with the magnitude and direction of ssf modulated by river flow during low river flow lag effects and tidal asymmetries induced by barotropic processes and baroclinic circulation induced by salinity intrusion and mixing result in net up estuary transport of sediment increasing river flow reduces the influence of these up estuary transport pathways delivers additional sediment loading from the head of tide causes erosion and results in net down estuary ssf conceptually sediment dynamics in the lpr follows one of three regimes depending on river flow at any given time importing flushing scouring mathew and winterwerp 2020 in general terms low river flow conditions are associated with net up estuary ssf and represent an importing regime regime i and conversely increasing river flow is associated with net down estuary ssf and export of sediment from the system the exporting regime can be further distinguished into two conditions distinguished by morphological impact flushing conditions thus referred to since only mainly the sediments within the fluff layer are eroded regime ii and scouring conditions thus referred to since the more consolidated layers underneath the fluff layer are eroded regime iii in other words during low to moderate river flows regimes i and ii erosion is limited to the fluff layer and only during high river flows nominally regime iii are shear stresses high enough to cause erosion of the less erodible strata underlying the fluff layer mathew and winterwerp 2020 although variable locally for the system as a whole the river flow rate thresholds between regimes i and ii and between regimes ii and iii are approximately 20 30 m3 s and 200 m3 s respectively this implies that sediment transport in the lpr is dominated by fluff layer dynamics i e erosion limited the majority of the time the availability of sediments in the fluff layer is responsible for the net transport of fine sediments by barotropic and baroclinic circulation against the direction of residual river flow therefore the infill of the estuary with fines from down estuary is governed by the fluff layer dynamics mathew and winterwerp 2020 which therefore needs to be accounted for in the morphodynamic model the general process of sediment import during low river flow periods and export during high river flow periods is also apparent in the morphological change measured in a series of inter annual multi beam bathymetric surveys performed in september 2007 november 2008 june 2010 october 2011 and september 2012 mathew and winterwerp 2020 the along channel cumulative volumetric change between consecutive surveys is shown in fig 2 along with the river flow rate during this five year period river flow ranged from a low of about 1 m3 s in october 2007 to highs of 450 m3 s in march 2010 and march 2011 return period of 25 years and 700 m3 s in august 2011 return period of 90 years the periods between the 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 surveys represent relatively low flow conditions with generally regimes i and ii events whereas the periods between the 2008 2010 and 2010 2011 surveys included several regime iii events and represent relatively high flow conditions the impact of the varying flow regimes is apparent in the measured morphological change with different behavior for the reaches seaward and landward of rm 2 landward of rm 2 the low flow periods 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 experienced deposition whereas the high flow periods 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 experienced erosion the 2010 2011 period experienced erosion at locations further seaward than the 2008 2010 period an observation that is consistent with the greater magnitude of river flow during the former period in addition effects of bed armoring are apparent in the morphological change over 2010 2011 specifically the reach landward of rm 7 does not show significant erosion during 2010 2011 which is in contrast to the significant erosion in this reach during 2008 2010 it is likely that a highly consolidated fine sediment layer and or armoring by coarser sediment exposed during the regime iii event in 2008 2010 prevented further erosion in 2010 2011 such erosion limited behavior therefore needs to be accounted for in the morphodynamic model in contrast the reach seaward of rm 2 experienced deposition during the high flow years because of the increasing river cross section and relatively low shear stress regime in these areas as compared to the relatively high shear stress regime in the more landward locations that experienced erosion and experienced erosion during the low flow years because of the impact of ongoing shipping mathew and winterwerp 2020 this reach contains several active shipping terminals u s army corps of engineers 2010 and as explained subsequently shipping induced scour maintains a state of dynamic morphological equilibrium that is different than would be expected under natural conditions review of bathymetry data in the vicinity of the shipping terminals shows accretion in these areas during high flow years followed by erosion and a return to a near equilibrium bathymetry under mean conditions the current morphodynamic status of the lpr is apparent from an assessment of two common morphodynamic relationships longitudinal convergence of river cross section and tidal prism to cross section relation winterwerp et al 2021 d alpaos et al 2010 as shown in fig 3 tidal prism is defined as the volume of water entering the estuary during the flood phase of the tide in the absence of any freshwater inflows this is the volume of water leaving the estuary during the ebb phase of the tide these relationships are also used subsequently to interpret the results of the prognostic assessments of the impacts of navigation episodic storm events and climate change between rm 2 and rm 15 the lpr currently conforms to the following trends an exponentially converging form given the cross sectional area ax at given location x and the relationship ax a 0exp x la the reference cross section at rm 2 a 0 is calculated as 615 m2 and convergence length la as 24 7 km this indicates that even though the river was modified in the past e g dredged for navigation shorelines hardened and inter tidal wetlands reclaimed it has regained an exponential cross section distribution a relationship between the cross section area and tidal prism given the cross sectional area ax and tidal prism at given location p t x and the relationship ax a 0 p t x p t 0 the reference cross section at rm 2 a 0 is calculated as 560 m2 and the exponent as 0 43 the exponent is typically in the range of 0 85 1 1 in tidal inlets d alpaos et al 2010 the reason for the lower value noted in the lpr is further explored subsequently seaward of rm 2 the river cross section increases and the relationship with tidal prism changes the reason for this is related to the morphological impact of shipping which is explored subsequently as mentioned previously the lpr was dredged for navigation purposes historically with the last major dredging events occurring in 1950 1951 between rm 0 and rm 6 7 and in 1983 between rm 0 and rm 1 5 u s army corps of engineers 2010 comparison of the post dredging and current cross sections in fig 3 shows the morphodynamic response of the river to the disequilibrium caused by dredging with significant infilling between rm 0 and rm 6 7 this infilling was likely a combination of sediment deposited during regime iii events and sediment transported up estuary during regime i and ii conditions the larger river cross sections historically also imply that sediment trapping efficiency has decreased over time in response to the evolving morphology the availability of data describing short term and long term morphological change along with data for parameterizing and calibrating a numerical model therefore provides opportunity for developing a morphodynamic model of the lpr calibrated to multiple lines of evidence the conceptual model of sediment dynamics the three transport regimes erosion limited transport fluff layer dynamics described in this section was therefore used as the basis of the morphodynamic model of the lpr and subsequently for development of the morfac approach 3 morphodynamic model the morphodynamic model presented here uses the estuarine coastal and ocean model ecomsed framework blumberg and mellor 1978 hydroqual inc 2010 which includes integrated hydrodynamic and sediment transport sub models as part of the environmental studies of the lpr ecomsed was used for a hydrodynamic application hydroqual 2008 as well as a sediment transport application moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 of the lpr model inputs and calibration parameters established as part of the hydrodynamic application were used in the present study although the sediment transport application used somewhat different formulations some inputs such as initial conditions erodibility inputs boundary conditions etc used in the present study are based on the model application of moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 the formulations and setup of the morphodynamic model is presented next followed by model performance 3 1 model setup the morphodynamic model involves a three dimensional time variable application over a domain that includes the lpr hackensack river newark bay arthur kill and kill van kull model domain shown in fig 1 the spatial domain is resolved using a shoreline fitted variable resolution curvilinear orthogonal grid grid resolution in the lpr ranges from seven cells across the river at rm 1 4 and decreasing to three cells across the river at rm 13 5 average grid resolution in the lpr is 35 m wide and 140 m long with a ten layer σ coordinate system in the water column briefly the three dimensional hydrodynamic model solves a system of equations describing the conservation of mass momentum heat and salt blumberg and mellor 1978 hydroqual inc 2010 vertical mixing is resolved using the second order turbulence closure scheme of mellor and yamada 1982 and sub grid scale horizontal mixing parameterized using smagorinsky 1963 boundary conditions for the hydrodynamic model include the measured river flow entering from the head of tide in the lpr and tributaries and the tide salinity and temperature at the marine boundaries kill van kull and arthur kill marine boundary conditions specified using the results of the regional scale hydrodynamic model hydroqual 2008 the hydrodynamic model was calibrated by adjusting bottom roughness and horizontal mixing to reproduce measured water level and three dimensional velocity temperature and salinity the calibration approach implicitly assumes that temporal changes in mud dynamics e g in response to dredging due to bed coarsening during storm events etc do not affect the hydrodynamics table 1 provides a tabulation of the major model parameter values the sediment transport module in ecomsed calculates the advection and dispersion of suspended sediments originating from the boundaries settling and the bed water exchange processes of erosion and deposition hydroqual inc 2010 the three dimensional advection dispersion equation for suspended sediment transport is 1 c t u c x v c y w w s z x a h c x y a h c y z k h c z where c is suspended sediment concentration u v and w represent velocities along the x y and z directions respectively ws is the settling velocity ah is the horizontal diffusivity and kh is the vertical eddy diffusivity eq 1 is subject to the boundary conditions k h c z 0 and w w s z 0 at the air water interface and k h c z e d and w w s z 0 at the sediment water interface where e is the erosion rate and d is the deposition flux as part of the present study two key modifications were introduced to ecomsed the first modification described in this section includes the representation of a stratified bed layering scheme with depth dependent erodibility that is key to sediment dynamics pertaining to erosion limited transport and memory effects the second modification described in the following section includes the implementation of morphological acceleration using morfac as discussed in the preceding section the lpr is characterized by erosion limited transport i e erosion is a function of the sediment substrate and stratigraphy accordingly the classical morphodynamic feedback loop commonly used in sandy settings was modified for application to fine sediment settings as shown in fig 4 the primary refinement is consideration of the availability of mobile sediment in the transport formulations note that the morphological acceleration factor included in fig 4 is applicable to the analyses in the following section the spatially and temporally varying erosion and deposition fluxes computed by the model in response to the non equilibrium transport formulations are used to compute the changing bed stratigraphy composition mass and consequently the bed thickness the resulting morphological change is used to update the bathymetry used for hydrodynamic calculations in the following timestep thus the hydrodynamic solution adapts and self adjusts in response to the evolving bathymetry during the simulation the conceptual description and quantitative parameterization of erosion limited transport in the model is based on erodibility measurements as mentioned previously the sediment bed is characterized by the presence of an easily erodible fluff layer overlying less erodible strata mathew and winterwerp 2017 within the fluff layer τ cr values increase by approximately an order of magnitude erodibility measurements using a sedflume device borrowman et al 2006 and analyzed by moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 show approximately an additional four fold increase in τ cr over the top 30 cm of the bed this conceptual description of depth dependent erodibility was used as the basis for a multi layer bed model fig 5 shows a schematic of the bed layering developed to represent the depth dependent erodibility along with a conceptual description of the hydrodynamic conditions that can potentially scour through the various strata the fluff layer is located at the bed water interface and is subject to erosion and deposition during erosional conditions e g the first half of the flood tide the fluff layer may be depleted and disappear during the following depositional condition e g the second half of the flood tide and high water slack depositing sediments first recreate the fluff layer when the fluff layer exceeds its pre determined maximum thickness the excess sediment is transferred to the underlying layer given the order of magnitude difference in erodibility between the fluff layer and the underlying less erodible layer the model includes an intermediate transition layer with same maximum allowable thickness as the fluff layer with intermediate strength when both the fluff and transitional layers reach their pre determined maximum thickness new layers are created underneath the transitional layer simulating consolidation under depositional conditions sediment is transferred from the fluff layer through the transitional layer and to the layer underneath under erosional conditions layer depletion proceeds in a logical sequence with the fluff layer eroded first followed by the underlying layers erosion rate for the fluff and transition layers follows a modification of the partheniades formulation for surface erosion 2 e m τ b τ c r f o r τ b τ c r where τ b is the turbulence mean bed shear stress and m is the erosion rate coefficient within the relatively deep channel parameters τ cr and m were specified using the approach of mathew and winterwerp 2017 and marginally adjusted within the estimated uncertainty limits during calibration however the sub tidal shallows outside the channel were parameterized as three times more erodible i e parameters τ cr and m reduced and increased respectively by a factor of three than the channel areas primarily by calibration though this model describes the vertical response of the bed to erosive forcing it basically parameterizes spatial variability within grid cells as elaborated by winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 the less erodible layers underneath the fluff and transitional layers are treated somewhat differently in order to enable efficient management of the bed layers mainly with respect to depth and time dependent erodibility these layers are formulated using the consolidation model of sanford 2008 briefly the consolidation model prescribes an equilibrium depth profile of bed density ρ eq as 3 ρ e q ρ ρ ρ 0 exp ϕ o where ρ0 is the density at the bed surface ρ is the asymptotic density at depth o is the mass of sediment above given depth in the bed referred to as the overmass and ϕ is an empirical parameter given the equilibrium density profile at any point in time t and depth within the bed the instantaneous density ρ approaches equilibrium following the first order approximation 4 ρ t r c ρ e q ρ h ρ e q ρ r s ρ e q ρ h ρ ρ e q where h is the heaviside step function h 1 when its argument is 0 and h 0 otherwise rc is the first order consolidation rate and rs is the first order swelling rate the instantaneous depth dependent density is related to the erosion rate using a power law formulation roberts et al 1998 5 e a τ b n ρ m where a n and m are empirical parameters finally the time and depth dependent τ cr is estimated by rearranging eq 5 such that τ cr is calculated as that shear stress which results in given critical threshold erosion rate ecr roberts et al 1998 it is noted that although the effect of the abiotic swelling process on sediment erodibility is explicitly represented in the model biological activity in the sediment e g bioturbation may also affect erodibility this is in part implicitly accounted for in the model parameterization established using the combination of empirical data and calibration described next parameters ϕ a n m and ecr in eqs 3 and 5 were determined by fitting the measured density erosion rate and τ cr profiles moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 borrowman et al 2006 parameter rc was estimated as 0 25 d 1 using the results of sedflume erosion experiments on cores reconstituted in settling columns and tested at different intervals after self weight consolidation sea engineering 2013 whereas parameter rs was defined as 0 01rc based on sanford 2008 although the application of the consolidation model involves the determination of several fitted parameters the resulting metrics of interest erosion rate τ cr and ρ are constrained by measured values the parameterization of the consolidation model results in equilibrium profiles with increasing density decreasing τ cr and decreasing erosion rate for given shear stress with depth in the bed the consolidation model also allows for the instantaneous profile of these metrics to deviate from the equilibrium profile as a function of the time history of erosion and deposition and eventually tending to the equilibrium profile in other words a less erodible layer exposed by erosion will swell and become more erodible over time a temporal trend that is conceptually reasonable and relevant for long term morphological simulations in dynamic settings furthermore the depth and time dependent erodibility parameterized in the bed layering via the fluff and transition layers and the consolidation model allows for representation of memory effects sediment mobility and the various time scales responsible for morphological evolution in fine sediment systems this is a key aspect of the modification to the classical morphodynamic loop presented in fig 4 it should be noted that only bed layers comprised of predominantly fine sediments fines fraction 15 winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 are treated as cohesive and subject to consolidation with erosion defined using eq 3 through 5 bed layers comprised predominantly of sand fines fraction 15 are not considered to be cohesive i e they do not consolidate and have τ cr that is independent of layer density erosion properties coefficients a and n in eq 5 for such non cohesive layers was defined using sedflume experiments on quartz particles roberts et al 1998 with erosion rates calculated using a simplified version of eq 5 that does not include the dependency with density the model includes six particle classes of which three are sand sized effective diameters 150 μm 750 μm and 4000 μm calculated using grain size distribution measured in sediment cores and three are fine sediment classes representing fines originating from freshwater sources head of tide from marine sources arthur kill and kill van kull and from the bed by erosion although flocculation is not modeled explicitly the impact of flocculation is parameterized in the model as discussed in the following paragraph the two larger sand fractions are found in only a small portion of the lpr predominantly towards its head with significant loadings of fine sand entering the lpr only during episodic events class specific τ cr was defined for sands using the shields curve van rijn 1993 with erosion of sands from cohesive layers occurring only when both the class specific and density dependent τ cr is exceeded in contrast erosion of sands from non cohesive layers occurs when the class specific τ cr is exceeded initial conditions corresponding to the mass fractions of the various classes in the sediment bed fines in bed at initialization were assigned to the bed fines class and dry density were defined using measurements on sediment cores from the lpr moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 and assigned as averages over large reaches the fluff and transition layers were also initialized at their maximum allowable thickness temporally varying ssc boundary conditions were defined at the head of tide varying in response to river flow and at the marine boundaries varying within the tidal cycle as a function of tidal currents using rating curves moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 the settling velocities of the sand classes were determined using the formulation of cheng 1997 the settling velocity of fines originating from the head of tide was calculated using cheng 1997 on the basis of an effective diameter measured with laser diffraction on deflocculated suspended sediment samples moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 effectively this assumes that fines originating from the freshwater sources are poorly flocculated an assumption verified during model performance assessment in contrast the settling velocities of fines originating from marine sources and from the bed were developed by calibration to ssc ssf and morphological change data these correspond to higher values than the fines from the head of tide likely reflecting the effect of floc formation in the water column and in the bed winterwerp 2002 tran and strom 2019 furthermore in an approximation of aggregation processes in the bed tran and strom 2019 fines from freshwater and marine sources that accumulate underneath the fluff and transition layers i e implicitly have been residing in the bed for one or more tidal cycles are instantaneously transferred to the bed fines class probability of deposition for the sand classes is defined using gessler 1967 whereas probability of deposition for the fines is set to 1 i e allowing deposition under all conditions see winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 table 1 provides a tabulation of the major model parameter values finally the effect of shipping at locations seaward of rm 2 was parameterized for simulations spanning the 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 bathymetry surveys by using the measured morphological change over these periods up to five ships on average transit this reach on a daily basis moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 with the scour expected to be related to factors such as the timing of transit related to the tide vessel draft power applied by the propellers at any given location etc however given data limitations such subtleties are ignored and the measured erosion was used to specify a constant rate of erosion at the locations of observed scour and the scoured mass assigned as a continuous and vertically uniform loading to the water column 3 2 model performance model performance was evaluated by comparison against measurements for various metrics over a range of river flows and time periods model data comparisons for small and large scale morphological change are presented here appendix a presents comparisons for currents salinity ssc ssf and cumulative morphological change along with a discussion of model limitations model performance was compared to the measured morphological change over 2007 2012 the morphodynamic model was used to perform four separate simulations spanning the periods of the various bathymetry surveys and initialized using measured bathymetry at the start of the particular period the measured and calculated morphological changes were averaged cross sectionally and longitudinally over 1 mile 1 6 km intervals for an assessment of large scale morphological changes and are shown in fig 6 overall the model reproduces the large scale flow dependent morphological trends apparent in the data results for the low flow periods 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 generally show infilling landward of rm 2 and the high flow periods 2008 2010 and 2010 2011 show erosion landward of rm 2 and deposition seaward of rm 2 in the model erosion scales with river flow rate for instance the 2008 2010 period included a 450 m3 s event whereas the 2010 2011 period included a 700 m3 s event and accordingly the model responds with more erosion during the latter period the data show such flow dependent erosion depths in some reaches e g between rm 2 and rm 6 however in other reaches specifically between rm 7 and rm 11 while the data shows evidence of armoring during the 2010 2011 period the model does not capture the armoring effects although the model reproduces the large scale flow dependent erosional and depositional trends and the large scale morphological changes it tends to under perform at local scales the model calculated river volume in the simulations covering the 2007 2012 period was also compared to the measured river volume as shown in fig 7 in addition the measured infill landward of rm 2 during the low flow years was examined analytically for an assessment of large scale morphodynamics using the volume of cut method winterwerp et al 2021 which describes the infill rate as d v d t v v e t with solution 6 v t v e v 0 v e exp t t where t is the time constant for the infill process and v is the cumulative submerged river volume calculated at msl landward of rm 2 with subscripts t e and 0 representing instantaneous equilibrium and initial quantities eq 6 was used to describe the infill process between the 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 surveys using the measured initial v 0 and final vt river volumes and the two unknowns ve and t calculated as 7 61 mm3 and 823 days respectively using least squares optimization the resulting trends in analytical model estimates of river volume shown in fig 7 are with some exceptions generally consistent with the results of the numerical model fig 7 also shows that the measured river volumes in 2007 and 2011 were only 0 7 and 2 7 greater respectively relative to ve and the measured river volumes in all five surveys is very similar to ve this indicates that as a whole the reach landward of rm 2 is at or near morphodynamic equilibrium with episodic regime iii events causing only a relatively small deviation from equilibrium this suggests possible explanations for the under performance of the model with respect to small scale spatial erosion and infill patterns specifically scour in erosion limited conditions is very sensitive to local variations in bed stratigraphy both with respect to the armoring effects of sand lenses as well as low erodibility consolidated layers model results are therefore limited by the lack of comprehensive data characterizing such spatially and depth varying properties similarly because the change in river volume by erosion is not significant enough to significantly enhance trapping efficiency in the following periods local patterns of infill are expected to be more sensitive to the availability of sediment at the mouth of the lpr and its synchronization with import mechanisms especially in the case of shipping induced scour for instance in locations where navigation is limited by water depth ship traffic may be limited to the period of the rising or flood tide which implies greater potential for sediment import into the lpr than if the scour is distributed equally over the entire tidal cycle as assumed in the numerical model however such limitations may impact model performance more over the short term such as the inter annual periods presented here than over the long term dam et al 2016 therefore the application of the morfac approach to the lpr presented in the next section also includes a validation of model performance over a multi decadal period 4 morphodynamic upscaling using morphological acceleration the morphodynamic model of the lpr was used in the development and application of the morfac approach for fine sediment settings the morfac approach derives from the following key concepts lesser et al 2004 roelvink 2006 ranasinghe et al 2011 lesser 2009 time scales of morphological change are typically greater than time scales of change in hydrodynamic forcings morphological change or net change in bed sediment mass e g in response to a repeated sequence of identical hydrodynamic forcings is assumed to be linear within the morphological timestep this implies that morphological change or net change in bed sediment mass calculated over a single tidal cycle can be upscaled to n tidal cycles using the morphological acceleration factor fmor n this gives rise to the notion of the morphological timestep δtmor 7 δ t m o r f m o r δ t h y d where δthyd is the hydrodynamic timestep which we implicitly assume equals the sediment transport timestep net change in bed sediment mass over the morphological timestep is calculated using erosion and deposition fluxes over the hydrodynamic timestep 8 δ s m o r f m o r d e δ t h y d where δsmor is the mass change in the bed over the morphological timestep in the lpr where the river flow regime is the primary determinant of sediment dynamics see fig a 3 and mathew and winterwerp 2020 morphological acceleration is achieved by upscaling the morphological response to given river flow rate in other words the net change in sediment mass in the bed associated with a given river flow that repeats over n tidal cycles is calculated by simulating a single tidal cycle for that river flow and scaling the resulting bed mass change to n tidal cycles using eq 8 note that although some authors have applied eq 8 i e morphological upscaling applied to bed mass change frings and ottevanger 2011 the classical approach to morphodynamic upscaling using the morfac approach consists of multiplying bed level changes with fmor to calculate bathymetry at the end of the morphological timestep roelvink 2006 ranasinghe et al 2011 as shown in the left panel of fig 4 the classical approach was tested initially as part of the current research briefly in this approach bed level change calculated over the hydrodynamic timestep δhhyd is multiplied by fmor to calculate the bed level change over the morphodynamic timestep δhmor see eq 9 9 δ h m o r f m o r δ h h y d application of eq 9 to perform morphological upscaling in the numerical model implies that morphological change will not be consistent with sediment mass change in the bed in contrast eq 8 results in bed mass change that is consistent with morphological change and allows for appropriate representation of memory effects and sediment mobility this is illustrated with an application of the two morphodynamic upscaling methods to a synthesized hydrograph in fig 8 the example application in fig 8 uses the same model application presented in the preceding section and includes a synthesized hydrograph starting at below average river flow of 10 m3 s and increasing to 450 m3 s the first 10 days of this simulation represent the hydrodynamic and sediment transport spin up and is simulated using fmor of 1 subsequently fmor increases to 7 as flow increases to 50 m3 s at which point fmor decreases to 1 the model was initialized with a bed comprised of the fluff and transition layers and sub surface layers comprised solely of the largest sand class included in the present application which has τcr 3 1 pa and is non erodible under the shear stresses imposed in this example model performance is shown on the left panels using the classical approach to morphodynamic upscaling eq 9 and on the right panels using the approach used in this paper eq 8 for a grid cell located at rm 1 4 in the lpr review of model performance for bed composition panels d and i and bed mass thickness and morphological change panels e and j shows the artifact associated with the classical morphodynamic upscaling approach in a setting affected by bed armoring the first 37 days of the simulation represent net depositional conditions with both simulations showing net morphological change of approximately 24 cm since the classical approach does not preserve bed mass the change in bed mass thickness is only about 6 cm and much lower than morphological change during this period this is also seen in the bed composition change over time with the depositing fines creating about 6 cm of new layers on top of the initial bed layers in contrast the simulation with morphodynamic upscaling applied to bed mass preserves bed mass change and morphological change with the depositing fines creating about 24 cm of new layers on top of the initial bed layers during the high shear stress conditions over days 37 40 the entire depth of newly deposited sediment is eroded because skin friction during this period exceeds the critical shear stress of the deposited fine sediment layers in the case of the simulation with morphodynamic upscaling applied to bed mass change net erosion during this period is about 24 cm with bathymetry reverting to the initial bathymetry following exposure of the armored bed layers however in the simulation with morphodynamic upscaling applied to bed level change erosion of the 6 cm of deposited fines exposes the armored bed layer and consequently net morphological change over the 47 day simulation is calculated as net accretion about 18 cm more deposition than the simulation with morphodynamic upscaling applied to bed mass change this artifact in performance is a consequence of the fact that the classical approach does not properly account for the factors leading to memory effects in the bed the same artifact is also introduced for a purely fine sediment setting where memory effects due to depth dependent erodibility can have a similar effect as armoring in this example the analysis indicates that the classical approach is appropriate only in settings where erosion limited transport is not a factor e g typically problems of sand transport in coastal settings morphodynamic upscaling in settings where memory effects are relevant for transport can be successfully achieved only by applying upscaling to the bed mass change the morfac approach involves input reduction for the hydrodynamic forcings which in the case of the lpr includes river flow and barotropic forcing briefly input reduction for the barotropic forcing seeks to replace the complex time series of tidal water level and current fluctuations occurring in nature with a simplified tide that produces the same residual sediment transport and morphological change patterns as the naturally varying tides lesser 2009 in the case of fine sediment systems the representative tide should also reproduce the effects of sediment availability and erosion limited transport on residual sediment transport the representative tide used for boundary conditions in the application of the morfac approach include the semi diurnal m2 and diurnal o1 and k1 constituents along with the m4 and m6 overtides with the representative tide tidal range of 1 5 m synthesized following the methods of lesser 2009 simulations using the representative tide were compared to simulations using the spring neap tidal cycle in order to ensure that the representative tide preserves the long term net sediment transport ssc boundary conditions at the marine boundaries were specified using the rating curve approach described previously and using tidal currents corresponding to the representative tide input reduction for river flow is discussed in the following section 4 1 considerations for morfac approach in fine sediment settings and specifically for application to the lpr section 1 includes discussion of phenomena specific to fine sediment transport specific formulations and careful selection of model inputs were required for appropriate representation of these phenomena within the context of the morfac approach these considerations maintain the assumption of linearity within the morphological timestep that is key to the morfac approach separate conditions when the assumption of linearity cannot be met and preserve the various time scales of morphological response in fine sediment systems these are summarized below residual sediment transport morphological change due to residual transport associated with barotropic and baroclinic circulation relevant during regimes i and ii scales as a function of time for instance a sediment particle located at the mouth of the river at the start of a flood tide will move a certain distance up estuary after one tidal cycle due to tidal asymmetries and lag effects assuming flood dominance and estuarine circulation during the following tidal cycle it will move some distance further up estuary in other words net sediment transport in a simulation of two tidal cycles with fmor 1 will not be identical to a simulation of one tidal cycle with fmor 2 this implies a practical upper bound on the value of fmor established by trial and error as 7 and applicable during regimes i and ii in the current application memory effects consider a time series of two identical erosional events occurring sequentially and in short order high shear stress during the first event can cause erosion of surficial sediments thus exposing a bed layer with τ cr greater than the maximum bed shear stress during the event therefore the second event which experiences the same time history and magnitude of bed shear stress as the first event would not be expected to cause any further erosion however a simulation of a single event with fmor 2 will overestimate the magnitude of erosion compared to a simulation of two sequential events with fmor 1 the latter will preserve the erosion limited morphological response in the lpr depth dependent erodibility is a factor in limiting erosion primarily under regime iii conditions river flow rate greater than 200 m3 s for the system as whole although this threshold decreases in the landward direction therefore in order to appropriately represent such memory effects for the current application morphological acceleration is not employed i e fmor 1 when river flow rate exceeds 50 m3 s which is a threshold established using maps of bed shear stress under different steady state river flow rates and is the estimated threshold above which erosion of the consolidated layers may occur mathew and winterwerp 2020 supply limited transport the supply of fine sediments from the head of tide generally tends to be event dominated i e episodic high flow events are responsible for a significant fraction of the annual sediment delivery to the river and affect sediment availability for redistribution during subsequent periods morphological acceleration under such conditions may not accurately reproduce sediment transport patterns for instance for a high flow event loading with a travel time of 10 days from the head of tide to the area of interest a one day simulation with fmor 10 will not capture transport to the area of interest therefore in order to appropriately represent such supply limited transport for the current application morphological acceleration is not employed i e fmor 1 when river flow rate exceeds 50 m3 s this threshold is also consistent with the rating curve used to define ssc boundary conditions at the head of tide which includes relatively constant ssc at river flow rate of less than 60 m3 s and increasing with increasing river flow fluff layer dynamics in order to preserve the intra tidal ssc and ssf dynamics which depend on sediment inventory in the fluff layer and is relevant for residual transport only the sediment flux over the hydrodynamic timestep i e d e δthyd is added to or sourced from the fluff layer sediment flux over the remainder of the morphological timestep i e fmor 1 d e δthyd is added to or sourced from subsurface layers this preserves the timing of erosion and deposition within the tidal cycle thus preserving residual transport over the tidal cycle and is important for maintaining the condition of linearity in morphological change during the morphological timestep that is key to morphological upscaling these considerations have resulted an approach that includes river flow dependent values of fmor with fmor of 7 or 1 when river flow rate is less than or greater than 50 m3 s i e regime i ii or regime ii iii conditions respectively the selected river flow threshold separates conditions where erosion is limited to the fluff layer river flows 50 m3 s from conditions where the consolidated layers underneath the fluff layer may be eroded this definition of conditions without morphological acceleration preserves erosion limited dynamics and preserves supply limited transport which are relevant during high river flows furthermore the selected fmor value of 7 in combination with the formulation described previously that preserves fluff layer dynamics helps preserve residual sediment transport which is a key driver of morphological change during regimes i ii the river flow boundary conditions are a synthesized sequence of flow rates designed to represent the river flow dependent location of the salt front and etm and effects of barotropic and baroclinic circulation on net sediment transport this was accomplished by sorting the measured river flows averaged over the period of two tidal cycles in order to account for the inequality in the semi diurnal representative tide followed by a fixed window average over seven two tide cycles of river flows for flow rates less than 50 m3 s for simulations covering the periods of the inter annual bathymetry surveys this sorting and sequencing was performed separately for periods before and after significant high flow events between two surveys with the synthesized river flow rate increasing from the start of the simulation up to the peak of the high flow event followed by decreasing river flow rate this preserves the timing of the high flow event in a fashion analogous to the brute force simulations ssc boundary conditions at the head of tide were defined using rating curves as described previously 4 2 model performance with the exception of the boundary conditions for tide river flow and ssc defined as described above the remainder of the model setup and parameterization for the morphodynamic model using morfac is identical to the setup presented in the preceding section the performance of the morphodynamic model using morfac is first compared against the brute force simulations over the period of the inter annual bathymetry surveys 2007 2012 this serves as test of the morfac approach in its ability to reproduce the results of the more computationally intensive approach subsequently as a validation the morphodynamic model using morfac is applied for a multi decadal hindcast simulation and compared against measured morphological change 4 2 1 model tests 2007 2012 the value of fmor used for periods simulated with morphological acceleration and the flow threshold used to separate periods with and without morphological acceleration were developed based on the results of morphological change in test simulations covering the period of the inter annual bathymetry surveys over 2007 2012 table 2 presents a quantitative model performance assessment for various parameter values for fmor and the threshold river flow the performance of the individual test simulations was assessed against the results of the brute force simulations using model results in individual grid cells using the brier skill score bss as defined by van rijn et al 2003 and sutherland et al 2004 10 b s s 1 y x 2 b x 2 where x can be the measured bed level or calculated bed level from brute force simulations y is the model calculated bed level in simulations using the morfac approach b is the initial bed level and the angled brackets denote an arithmetic mean for the assessment in this section x is the calculated bed level from the brute force simulations results presented in fig 6 and the bss is used to assess how well the simulations using morphological acceleration reproduce the brute force simulation results a bss of 1 indicates a perfect match whereas decreasing value of bss indicates increasing divergence between the two sets of model results the results in table 2 show progressively worsening results with 1 increasing value of fmor for the periods with morphological acceleration during regime i ii flows 2 morphological acceleration during regimes ii and iii and 3 increasing flow threshold used to separate periods with and without morphological acceleration these comparisons were used to determine selection of fmor 7 for periods simulated with morphological acceleration and the flow threshold of 50 m3 s in addition the results for the simulation without morphological acceleration i e fmor 1 during all flows also shows the impact of the representative tide and the synthesized flow sequencing applied as part of the morfac approach overall these simplifications of the boundary conditions do not significantly impact the results for morphological change i e the accuracy of the predictions fig 9 shows comparisons of model results for the brute force simulations and for simulations using morfac using fmor 7 for periods with morphological acceleration and flow threshold of 50 m3 s both graphical as well as quantitative comparisons indicate a high degree of similarity between the two sets of model results minor differences apparent in the comparisons are primarily related to factors not included in the simulations using morfac e g coincident spring tide during some of the high flow events impact of stochastic variations in river flow on residual sediment transport etc nonetheless overall the simulations using morfac reproduce the large scale as well as local scale with some minor exceptions performance of the brute force simulations therefore the morphodynamic model using morfac is concluded to be reasonably similar to the more computationally intensive approach and subject to the validation presented in the following sub section a valid approach for computationally efficient morphological simulations in fine sediment settings 4 2 2 model validation 1950 2007 the hindcast simulation used to validate the long term performance of the morphodynamic model using morfac involves the historical infill of the navigation channel in the lpr the last major dredging in the lpr occurred in 1950 1951 between rm 0 to rm 2 2 rm 2 2 to rm 4 2 and rm 4 2 to rm 6 7 to depths of 9 9 m 6 8 m and 5 6 m respectively depths relative to msl with maintenance dredging to depth of 9 9 m between rm 0 and rm 1 5 in 1983 u s army corps of engineers 2010 fig 3 also includes the cross section in 1950 1951 for comparison to the 2007 configuration significant deviations from the near equilibrium conditions in 2007 are apparent especially between rm 2 and rm 5 subsequent infill of the navigation channel ranges up to about 5 m in some locations therefore the morphodynamic model using morfac was applied for a simulation over the period 1950 2007 with the bathymetry in the navigation channel between rm 0 to rm 6 7 initialized at the design dredge depths and bathymetry between rm 0 to rm 1 5 reset to the design dredge depths in 1983 periodic changes in the geometry and morphology within newark bay u s army corps of engineers 2006 were also represented in the simulation input reduction for river flow at the head of tide was performed in annual cycles using the historic river flow data from 1950 2007 the impact of navigation in the channel between rm 0 and rm 2 was included by constraining deposition as a depth limited process in this reach with the limiting depth being the measured bathymetry in 2007 fig 10 shows the hydrograph during this period key observations include the extended period from the mid 1950s to late 1960s when river flow was relatively low mostly regime i i e infilling with only one regime iii event in contrast the remainder of this 58 year period experienced thirty two regime iii events fig 10 shows a comparison of the measured and model calculated bathymetry in 2007 overall the model reproduces various spatial and temporal trends apparent in the data these include the magnitude of infill at local scales trend of decreasing infill with distance in the landward direction and relatively lower infill in the vicinity of bends in the river quantitative assessment of the model calculated and measured bathymetry in 2007 shows bss value of 0 81 which represents an excellent model performance accordingly to the performance classification scheme of van rijn et al 2003 eq 10 was used to calculate bss with x representing the measured bed level in 2007 therefore this validation using multi decadal data provides demonstration of the applicability of the morfac approach for performing long term morphological simulations in fine sediment settings 5 model application the morphodynamic model using morfac was applied to answer a few specific and general questions regarding the current morphological status of the lpr and the morphological impact of specific forcings the specific question pertains to the impact of navigation seaward of rm 2 and the general questions pertain to the current morphological status of the lpr landward of rm 2 the role of episodic regime iii events and the impact of climate change the prognostic simulations used to address these issues were initialized using the measured bathymetry in 2007 the hydrograph over 1950 2007 is representative of the long term measured river flow over 1897 2020 therefore except as described later in the context of episodic regime iii events and climate change the prognostic simulations use the river flow hydrograph from 1950 to 2007 in addition the simulated 58 year duration is much larger than the approximately 2 year infill time scale estimated using the volume of cut method implying that the simulated duration is adequate for assessing questions related to morphological equilibrium of the system these simulations do not include shipping induced scour in the lpr 5 1 role of navigation and current morphological status several lines of evidence indicate that the reach between rm 0 and rm 2 in the lpr is impacted by shipping activities a change in the trend of current river cross section area with distance and with tidal prism at rm 2 as presented in fig 3 erosional trends between rm 0 to rm 2 during the low flow periods 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 in the inter annual morphological changes as presented in fig 2 and the consideration that the erosion cannot be caused by natural hydrodynamic forcings model calculated bed shear stresses during the periods of erosion are not high enough to cause the noted magnitude of erosion and local scale spatial patterns of erosion that are consistent with marine traffic data moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 collectively these lines of evidence indicate that this reach of the lpr is impacted by ongoing shipping activities therefore the impact of navigation was assessed using a prognostic simulation that does not include shipping induced scour fig 11 shows the resulting comparison of initial and calculated bathymetry at the end of the simulation and the cross section area and its relationship with tidal prism using the initial and final model calculated bathymetry the comparisons indicate that the reach between rm 0 and rm 2 which currently experiences shipping induced scour will infill by up to 2 3 m in some areas in the absence of navigation the infilling sediment is a combination of sediment scoured from landward locations during regime iii events as well as sediments transported from newark bay by the tide and estuarine circulation consequently the cross section adapts and seaward of rm 2 both the longitudinal profile of cross section area and the trend of cross section area with tidal prism tend towards a continuation of trends measured in 2007 at more landward locations these results are consistent with the hypothesis that this reach of the lpr is currently in a state of dynamic morphological equilibrium with the ongoing shipping activities in the absence of navigation substantial infill will occur reaching an equilibrium cross section that is similar to that expected based on morphodynamic relationships apparent in more landward reaches furthermore using the river morphology at the end of the prognostic simulation the convergence length la and exponent of 26 6 km and 0 42 respectively are only marginally different from values based on the current morphology presented in section 2 these results indicate that the reach landward of rm 2 is largely at morphodynamic equilibrium which consistent with the results of the analytical volume of cut method 5 2 impact of regime iii events episodic events causing significant erosion and export of sediments are considered to be the mechanism responsible for maintaining the long term morphological equilibrium in an estuary which may otherwise experience infilling due to import of sediments from both landward and seaward directions geyer et al 2001 meade 1969 in the context of the lpr regime iii events are considered to be representative of such erosional and exporting conditions mathew and winterwerp 2020 therefore in order to assess the significance of regime iii events on long term morphological behavior the results of a prognostic simulation using the measured river flow hydrograph were compared to a simulation where river flow was capped at 100 m3 s which is the local threshold for regime iii events for the reach landward of rm 8 mathew and winterwerp 2020 fig 12 shows the resulting comparison of initial and calculated bathymetry at the end of the simulation and the cross section area and its relationship with tidal prism using the initial and final model calculated bathymetry similar to the results presented in fig 11 which includes the impact of regime iii events the results in fig 12 show significant infilling in the reach seaward of rm 2 however in contrast to the results in fig 11 the results in fig 12 show infilling throughout the length of the estuary and most markedly in the upper reaches between rm 15 and rm 11 these results indicate a different equilibrium morphology in the absence of regime iii events with a shallower equilibrium bathymetry than in the presence of regime iii events these results tend to confirm the hypothesis of geyer et al 2001 and meade 1969 and the empirical observations of mathew and winterwerp 2020 on the role of regime iii events in the long term morphological equilibrium of estuaries this implies such regime iii events are critical in shaping the equilibrium morphology and should be included in morphological studies of such systems regime iii events also impact the morphodynamic relations of cross section profile and relationship with tidal prism in contrast with the values for the current morphology presented in section 2 the results in fig 12 show that in the absence of regime iii events the convergence length la and exponent decrease to 19 1 km and increase to 0 58 respectively the decrease in convergence length is consistent with the findings of dronkers 2017 who showed convergence length to be a positive function of river flow velocity accordingly a decrease in river flow rate e g due to the lack of regime iii events would result in a decrease in the convergence length which is consistent with the numerical model results the decrease in cross section area in the upper reaches also leads to the increase in the value of tending towards values more commonly observed for tidal inlets in the range of 0 85 1 1 d alpaos et al 2010 in other words in the absence of regime iii events river flow becomes a relatively less important forcing compared to the barotropic forcing in shaping the equilibrium morphology of the estuary therefore in addition to maintaining the long term morphological equilibrium regime iii events are also responsible for shaping the morphodynamic equilibrium profile of the estuary 5 3 impact of climate change broadly speaking the projected impact of climate change relevant for morphological development is two fold and includes sea level rise slr and changes in river flow rate slr in the lpr under an extreme scenario is projected to be about 1 3 m relative to the year 2000 by the year 2070 kopp et al 2019 although climate change impacts on river flow in the lpr are not known precisely projections from global climate models generally indicate an increase in total precipitation during storm events for instance in the lpr compared to the historical conditions total precipitation during a 4 day storm event with a return period of 100 years is projected to increase by about 20 by the year 2080 cdm smith 2019 therefore assuming linearity river flow rate in the future is expected to be higher than current conditions however slr and increasing river flow may have opposing morphological impacts specifically slr will cause a decrease in currents thus promoting infilling whereas increasing river flow will cause an increase in currents especially during storm events which could cause erosion and export of sediments from the estuary therefore the relative impact of slr and increasing river flow was assessed using two incremental prognostic simulations using 1 the projected slr and current river flow rates and 2 the projected slr and projected river flow rates calculated by enhancing current river flow by 20 as a crude approximation of the additional precipitation due to climate change fig 13 shows the comparison of initial bathymetry and calculated bathymetry at the end of the two incremental prognostic simulations these comparisons show significant infilling over nearly the entire length of the estuary primarily due to the decrease in currents associated with the increase in water depth due to slr and provided sediment loadings are not affected the results also indicate that slr rather than increased river flow rate has a greater impact on the morphological evolution of the estuary with the overall impact of climate change being infill possibly also the sediment load may increase with increasing river flows which would shorten the time scales to attain the new equilibrium since no predictions exist on changes in sediment loading due to climate change this subject was not addressed in this scenario furthermore the longitudinal profiles of river cross section and trend of cross section area with tidal prism shown in fig 13 indicate that the estuary adapts to the disequilibrium caused by slr by infilling and tending towards a morphodynamic profile similar to current conditions for the current morphology and current msl in most of the estuary however as seen from localized differences between the cross section at the end of the prognostic simulation and the cross section under the current msl the 58 year duration of the prognostic simulations is likely not sufficient to attain the equilibrium profile nonetheless the overall response of the system to slr is consistent with theoretical and historical response to slr meade 1969 6 discussion the lpr is characterized by predominantly fine sediment transport although the bed in places is mixed fines and sands consequently due to memory effects and sediment mobility limitations transport is below capacity conditions i e no equilibrium exists between the sediment load and the local hydraulic conditions the amount of mobile sediment actively forming the river s morphology is largely influenced by past hydrodynamic conditions in particular by episodic erosional events mathew and winterwerp 2020 the morphodynamic development of the lpr exhibits memory effects at various time scales from the tidal period to multi year periods spanning episodic erosional events at short to intermediate time scales the response to hydrodynamic forcing is characterized by three regimes mainly governed by the river flow and responsible for the morphological response infilling flushing and scouring while quantified for the lpr this type of system response i e the various transport regimes is characteristic of fine sediment dynamics in rivers characterized by erosion limited conditions winterwerp et al 2021 mathew and winterwerp 2020 the sediment dynamics and its dependency with sediment mobility memory effects and consequently the three transport regimes in the lpr are generally reproduced by the morphodynamic model presented here the model formulation specifically the bed schematization with an easily erodible fluff layer overlying less erodible parent bed subject to consolidation represents the memory effects on transport as apparent in the three transport regimes and flow dependent morphological response however the model response is less accurate at local scales especially for short term inter annual morphological change model performance is limited by the fact that bed composition and stratigraphy cannot be reproduced in detail because they depend on initial conditions and memory effects that are not known precisely nonetheless the model captures the long term decadal scale morphological trend specifically when the system was under a state of morphological disequilibrium caused by navigational dredging the results of the prognostic assessments of shipping regime iii events and climate change in the lpr indicate the impact of these forcings in shaping the equilibrium morphology of such systems propwash generated by ship propellers can cause erosion with the location and magnitude of scour dependent on factors such as vessel draft power applied by the propellers shipping intensity etc in the lpr this impact is apparent in the erosional signal measured in the reach seaward of rm 2 over the 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 periods as well as the projected infill of this reach in the prognostic assessment tending towards an equilibrium profile similar to more landward reaches therefore in the long term shipping represents an additional anthropogenic forcing that can influence the equilibrium morphology of such systems in contrast episodic regime iii events represents a natural erosional forcing that acts to scour and export sediments accumulating in more landward reaches under regimes i and ii in the lpr periods of elevated river flow resulting in higher bed shear stress represent such regime iii events although in other systems episodic wave events could act in a similar manner regime iii events shape the equilibrium morphology by maintaining a cross section that is otherwise deeper than expected based on theory for instance hydrologic changes in the case of the lpr that impact river flow rate represents an example of a change in regime iii events that can impact the equilibrium morphology of such systems finally climate change primarily slr is expected to represent a disequilibrium to the system by reducing the magnitude of currents consequently if sediment supply is maintained the lpr is projected to infill and tend towards the current equilibrium profile based on cross section area to tidal prism relationship overall the results of the prognostic assessments of the lpr are conceptually explainable consistent with theoretical expectations and indicate the general applicability of the morphodynamic modeling framework including morfac and results this implies that the modeling framework can be used to assess the long term and large scale impacts of issues such as hydrologic changes due to dam construction removal changes in navigation climate change etc the present study indicates that morphological upscaling may be deployed in fine sediment systems between episodic erosional events provided that morphological upscaling is applied to sediment mass in the bed in order to represent memory effects the response to episodic erosional events involving erosion of the parent bed underneath the fluff layer cannot be represented with the morfac approach as this response is too non linear because of non linear variations in the availability of mobile sediment this implies that the morphodynamic modeling of rivers under erosion limited conditions requires a thorough analysis of the hydrograph including the recurrence intervals and order of occurrence of the episodic erosional events these inherent uncertainties are reflected directly in the uncertainties of model predictions the results of which should therefore be interpreted accordingly when the system is in a state of morphodynamic disequilibrium the morfac approach is feasible over the long time scales needed to attain equilibrium the model framework presented here specifically the bed structure for parameterizing and representing erosion limited conditions is generally similar to numerical models of such fine sediment systems developed by other authors van maren et al 2015 the model framework is generally applicable to settings with erosion limited transport associated with either consolidation effects in the bed e g in a purely fine sediment system or due to armoring in mixed sediment systems furthermore both settings purely fine sediment and mixed may occur in the same system for instance between the thalweg and adjacent inter tidal areas however such non linearities driving the system response in fine sediment settings implies that appropriate representation of such systems in morphodynamic models requires a significant amount of site specific data describing spatial and temporal variations in key transport parameters these include the erodibility of sediments for the fluff layer and the parent bed sediment stratigraphy temporal trends in erodibility due to consolidation swelling and settling velocities for fine sediments in suspension in practical terms the relatively large data requirements imply that numerical models of fine sediment systems are almost invariably limited by the availability of data for model parameterization and calibration vested et al 2013 these considerations indicate the potential for limitations in numerical models of fine sediment systems while certain limitations e g more spatial discretization of the physical transport processes may be addressed computationally e g using smaller model grid cells others require extensive site specific data for instance conceptually a sediment bed formed by sedimentation in a dredged navigation channel is expected to be more erodible than an undisturbed bed created over millennial timescales similarly a newly deposited sediment bed is expected to consolidate and decrease in erodibility over time both effects can be parameterized by appropriate spatially and temporally comprehensive measurements of erodibility other limitations may require alternate formulations than traditionally implemented in numerical models for instance based on application to data from erosion experiments van prooijen and winterwerp 2010 propose a formulation that includes a gaussian distribution of turbulent bed shear stress a stochastic distribution of τ cr and using dozens of fine sediment classes in contrast typical model formulations characterize the turbulence mean shear stress at the bed water interface and parameterize the mean critical shear stress along with one or at most a few fine sediment classes finally another conceptual and philosophical aspect to consider is that models are schematized and simplified representations of reality model performance responds to the numerical parameterization of various processes that may introduce deviations from reality over the long term in other words the model has its own equilibrium which may or may not be identical to reality such limitations and related uncertainties require consideration when assessing model performance for the application presented in this paper the primary uncertainty is in its performance over the short term and over small spatial scales model performance over the long term and large spatial scales is comparable to data therefore the morphodynamic model framework including the morfac approach presented here is concluded to be suitable for assessing the long term and large scale morphodynamics in fine sediment settings where memory effects and sediment mobility have a strong influence on transport and morphological development however details such as the flow thresholds for periods with and without morphological acceleration the value of fmor etc are system specific and require careful assessment for appropriate representation 7 conclusions morphodynamics of fine sediment systems differ in several key respects from sandy systems in addition to being dependent upon the external forcings which is the case also in sandy systems morphodynamics in fine sediment systems are also a consequence of non equilibrium transport related to sediment mobility and memory effects induced by the time history of morphological development these processes were assessed empirically and used to develop a conceptual picture of sediment dynamics and transport regimes in the lpr mathew and winterwerp 2020 and generally reproduced by the morphodynamic model application presented in this paper furthermore morphological upscaling following the morfac approach and using formulations specifically adapted for fine sediment settings is shown to be an appropriate tool for computationally efficient long term morphodynamic modeling in such systems the morphodynamic model framework using morfac presented here provides a tool for assessing the long term morphodynamics in fine sediment systems for applications such as the design and impact of engineering interventions e g dredging river training works etc impact of climate change development of sediment management strategies etc credit

salinity ssc ssf and morphological change fig a 1 shows a comparison of model performance relative to the measured depth average velocity near bottom salinity and depth average ssc at the in situ moorings locations shown in fig 1 over october 14 15 2009 when river flow rate at dundee dam averaged 8 m3 s regime i infilling conditions during this period the model reproduces several key features apparent in the data tidal asymmetry flood dominance in currents the magnitude and intra tidal trends in salinity and ssc the location of the salt front generally in the reach between rm 6 7 and rm 10 2 increasing ssc in the up estuary direction with maximum ssc generally in the reach between rm 6 7 and rm 10 2 in combination with the location of the salt front in this reach this is indicative of the etm location and ssc dynamics within the etm the effect of tidal asymmetry on ssc primarily manifest as higher ssc during flood than during ebb relatively low ssc and relatively low intra tidal variability in ssc at the freshwater tidal station rm 13 5 which is an indication of solids with relatively lower settling velocity entering from the head of tide this is in contrast to the locations within the salt wedge rm 1 4 rm 4 2 rm 6 7 which experience higher intra tidal variability in ssc and indicative of solids with relatively higher settling velocity these spatially varying dynamics are reproduced by the model primarily by having higher settling velocity for solids originating from marine sources as compared to the freshwater sources model performance was also assessed using along channel transects of water depth salinity and ssc within the lpr and within the navigation channel in newark bay fig a 2 shows such a comparison for june 23 2005 and march 16 2010 when river flow rate at dundee dam averaged 8 m3 s regime i conditions and 450 m3 s regime iii return period of 25 years respectively within the lpr the model reproduces major features in the data such as the salt front and its location and the presence of the etm associated with the salt front in addition the model reproduces the difference in ssc values within the etm between the two events with higher ssc during the march 16 2010 event as compared to the june 23 2005 event the measurements of velocity and ssc at the in situ moorings were used to calculate the tidally integrated net ssf at these locations over the years 2009 and 2010 the resulting net ssf shows a relationship with river flow rate as seen from the left panels in fig a 3 a trend that is reproduced by the model as seen in the right panels of fig a 3 statistical metrics quantifying the model data comparisons are also included these include the root mean square error rmse a measure of the error between the model and data as expressed by a 1 r m s e s s f d a t a s s f m o d e l 2 n where ssfdata measured tidally integrated ssf ssfmodel model calculated tidally integrated ssf and n number of pairs of model and data another metric quantifying the model data performance is the relative rmse defined as the rmse relative to the data range the difference between the minimum and maximum measured value within the predominantly estuarine locations rm 1 4 rm 4 2 and rm 6 7 low river flows are associated with net up estuary ssf with net down estuary ssf as river flow increases in contrast net ssf at the freshwater tidal location rm 13 5 is consistently directed down estuary at rm 1 4 during river flows ranging between about 30 150 m3 s model performance is somewhat inconsistent with data the magnitude of net ssf tends to be biased low compared to the data assessment of model performance at rm 4 2 and rm 6 7 over this range of flow rates shows a similar bias at these locations as well this suggests that the model does not calculate enough erosion in the more landward reaches of the lpr this limitation in model performance may partly be related to the time history of events and the ability of the model to capture variations in sediment erodibility at small spatial and temporal scales this is one of the difficulties involved in modeling fine sediment transport in such erosion limited settings furthermore as indicated by mathew and winterwerp 2020 erosion during such conditions which are nominally representative of regime ii is limited to the fluff layer and the transition layer and is therefore less significant from a morphological perspective as compared to regimes i and iii the comparison of large scale flow dependent morphological trends is seen more clearly in fig a 4 which shows the measured and model calculated cumulative starting from the landward end volumetric morphological change over the various time periods overall trends are consistent between the model and data landward of rm 2 the model reproduces the depositional trends in 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 and the erosional trends in 2008 2010 and 2010 2011 similarly seaward of rm 2 the model reproduces the depositional trends in 2008 2010 and 2010 2011 as mentioned previously the erosional trend seaward of rm 2 during 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 is driven by the parameterized shipping scour process during the low flow periods 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 the model calculated magnitude of infill landward of rm 2 is comparable to the data however model performance of erosion landward of rm 2 during the high flow periods 2008 2010 and 2010 2011 is more variable with a bias towards under prediction during the former period and over prediction during the latter period eq a1 potential explanations why the model does not capture local scale changes over inter annual scales include limitations related to various model inputs and formulations bed initial conditions the core profile measurements used to define model initial conditions are somewhat sparse and do not capture the full range of spatial and depth dependent heterogeneity moreover they do not necessarily match the equilibrium solution of the model erodibility the available data for erodibility of the parent bed were conducive to the development of only a single set of erodibility inputs over the entire lpr which is likely to be a simplification of the spatial heterogeneity in reality moreover these may vary over time inducing the memory effects discussed in section 1 grid resolution the resolution of the model grid limited by computation time is not sufficient to resolve small scale features such as bridge support pillars shoreline structures etc which cause local scour during high river flow events with infill of the scoured areas during low river flow conditions shipping induced scour the exact timing and magnitude of this source term is unknown for the model simulations presented here the locations of scour and scour rate were parameterized using the measured bathymetry and the scour rate was assumed to be constant in time all of which are simplified representations of the process consolidation time scales consolidation time scales and their impact on erodibility are not very well characterized both generally as well as specifically in the case of the lpr for instance at initialization the model assumes that sediments in the bed to be fully consolidated and therefore less erodible whereas in reality some surficial sediments may be newly deposited and not fully consolidated i e more erodible flocculation effects although the model includes parameterized approximations of flocculation effects on settling velocity it does not capture the full range of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of this process neither in the sediment bed nor in the water column for example the model only includes two representative floc classes whereas in reality floc sizes and settling velocities are expected to vary over large range 
117,sediment mobility and memory effects distinguish transport and morphodynamics in fine sediment settings from sandy settings this paper focuses on the morphodynamic modeling of fine sediment systems and an adaptation of modeling procedures more commonly used in sand dominated systems an extensive dataset of short term transport and morphological trends along with ancillary data is used to support the development parameterization and calibration of a morphodynamic model of the lower passaic river usa the model is subsequently extended to include a morphological acceleration procedure in order to enable computationally efficient morphodynamic simulations the performance of the resulting model is first verified and subsequently validated using measured decadal scale morphological change subsequently the model is used to assess the current morphodynamic status and the long term response of the river to forcings such as shipping episodic storm events and climate change with results that are consistent with theoretical expectations keywords morphological acceleration morphodynamic modeling morfac fluff layer fine sediment 1 introduction the morphological evolution of estuaries is of consequence for problems such as contaminant fate and transport water quality siltation of navigation channels dredged material management impact of engineering works etc morphological change is a function of the bed water exchange processes of erosion and deposition and the water column transport processes of advection and dispersion these processes are often parameterized and simulated in process based numerical morphodynamic models for an assessment of morphological response to external forcings or to engineering works such morphodynamic models have been developed and applied more commonly in sand dominated 1 1 sand and fine sediment are nominally defined as particle sizes greater than and less than 63 μm respectively moreover we implicitly assume that fines exhibit cohesive behavior systems lesser et al 2004 roelvink 2006 than in fines dominated systems vested et al 2013 likely due to the site specific spatially variable and temporally variable nature of various fine sediment transport processes that typically requires extensive data for representation and parameterization in numerical models this paper focuses on the morphodynamic modeling of fine sediment systems and the adaptation of modeling procedures more commonly used in sand dominated systems however there are important differences between sand and fine sediment transport that require examination in the context of process based morphodynamic models sand transport is typically an equilibrium process characterized by capacity load conditions i e an equilibrium exists between the local sediment load and the transport capacity of the local turbulent flow velocity as this equilibrium is rapidly established under alluvial bed conditions morphological change in sandy settings is a function of gradients in transport and is generally calculated using equilibrium transport formulations van rijn 1993 although pick up functions for prescribing bed water exchange processes may be used as well in contrast fine sediment transport is typically characterized by non equilibrium conditions with respect to the carrying capacity of the flow the non equilibrium behavior can originate from beds comprised of a mixture of sands and fines thus limiting the erosion of fines beds with a vertical gradient in erodibility 2 2 erodibility in the context of this paper refers to the critical shear stress for erosion τcr the threshold bed shear stress required to be exceeded for surface erosion to occur following the partheniades erosion formulation partheniades 1965 an increase in the critical shear stress for erosion with depth represents a decrease in sediment erodibility with depth thus limiting erosion under given shear stress or systems where settling velocities are too low to achieve significant deposition of fines thus limiting sediment availability for erosion these are referred to as supply limited erosion limited or settling limited conditions respectively winterwerp et al 2021 such phenomena control local bed water exchange and consequently gross erosion and gross deposition have to be modeled explicitly through pick up and deposition functions rather than with equilibrium transport formulations related to the notion of erosion limited transport is the effect of armoring stratification and consolidation of the sediment bed in causing a decrease in erodibility with depth mehta 1988 sanford and maa 2001 this implies that the amount of mobile sediment i e sediment available for erosion under given flow regime and morphological response to a given event is not only a function of the event magnitude but also the time history of events vested et al 2013 mathew and winterwerp 2020 erosion limited transport can be manifest during non event e g tide dominated conditions when erosion may be limited to a thin layer thickness on the order of millimeters of easily erodible surficial sediments termed the fluff layer mathew and winterwerp 2017 during episodic events e g high river flow when erosion may extend deeper into the bed as well as during intermediate conditions e g low moderate river flows when erosion is limited to the fluff layer but transport from the head of tide is important for sediment supply considerations winterwerp et al 2021 mathew and winterwerp 2020 thus the system develops a memory represented by the availability of mobile sediment affected largely by past conditions and events that influences subsequent morphological development the sediment mobility and memory effects steer morphological development on short tidal time scales and long time scales many years by influencing erosion and deposition in case the eroded sediment were to be deposited elsewhere in the system consequently morphodynamics in fine sediment settings can be non linear i e becoming poorly related to the instantaneous event magnitude this poses challenges for the morphodynamic modeling of such systems beyond those encountered in sandy systems typically morphodynamic models for sandy systems are based on sediment transport models calibrated to site specific data for relatively short term periods and then used to perform long term simulations therefore the first objective of this paper is to investigate whether a similar procedure of developing a morphodynamic model calibrated over relatively short term periods may be applied in erosion limited fine sediment settings where memory effects are prominent we start from a mixed sands and fines sediment transport model calibrated over a range of hydrologic conditions and using various calibration metrics the model is then run in morphodynamic mode prescribing all hydrodynamic forcing in detail we refer to brute force morphodynamic simulations over the timescale of a few years with model performance assessed using measured morphological change this is similar to the setup of morphodynamic models for sandy systems further to morphodynamic modeling in sandy systems recent advances in this subject area include the morphological acceleration factor morfac technique for morphodynamic upscaling which enables morphological simulations over extended time scales in a computationally efficient fashion lesser et al 2004 roelvink 2006 ranasinghe et al 2011 lesser 2009 the morfac approach has been successfully applied in sandy systems over multi year to millennial time scales by various authors van der wegen and roelvink 2008 dam et al 2016 styles et al 2016 although not as extensively applied as for sandy systems the morfac approach has also been applied to fine sediment systems ganju et al 2009 george et al 2012 van der wegen and jaffe 2014 however as it is not obvious that the morfac approach can yield realistic results for fine sediment systems with memory effects at all time scales the second objective of this paper is to investigate the viability of the morfac approach for decadal scale morphodynamic simulations in erosion limited fine sediment settings subsequently the morphodynamic model using morfac is used to address specific research questions related to long term morphodynamics accordingly the paper is divided into three major parts the first part describes the development and calibration of the morphodynamic model over the timescale of a few years for the particular estuary presented here a calibrated model is necessary for the morfac approach described in the second part of the paper the second part includes a comparison of results from the morphodynamic model with morfac to the brute force simulations in order to test the applicability of the morfac approach in fine sediment settings as additional validation of the morfac approach over the long term the second part also compares the performance of the morphodynamic model with morfac to decadal scale data for morphological change finally the third part of the paper presents the application of the morphodynamic model with morfac to assess long term morphodynamic response to various system forcings that cannot otherwise be determined empirically these include the role of navigation which is specific to the particular estuary presented here the role of episodic storm events and the impact of climate change the following sections present an overview of morphodynamics in the particular estuary that is the subject of the model application presented here followed by the afore mentioned three major parts of the paper and a discussion 2 site overview and sediment dynamics the data presented in this manuscript come from the lower passaic river lpr an estuary that is part of new york harbor usa fig 1 the data presented here were collected as part of an ongoing environmental cleanup effort of the lpr the lpr stretches approximately 28 km long from its mouth in newark bay at river mile rm 0 to the head of tide at dundee dam rm 17 5 newark bay is connected to new york harbor and raritan bay and the atlantic ocean via the tidal inlets kill van kull and arthur kill respectively the width of the lpr ranges from approximately 600 m at its mouth declining to about 200 m at rm 1 4 150 m at rm 4 2 120 m at rm 6 7 90 m at rm 10 2 and 75 m at rm 13 5 i e locations about 1 5 km 6 km 10 km 15 5 km and 21 km respectively from the mouth of the river these were also the locations of months long october 10 2009 to december 16 2009 and march 22 2010 to july 24 2010 in situ measurements of salinity velocity water depth and suspended sediment concentrations ssc used to calibrate the numerical model presented here typical water depths along the thalweg in the lpr currently range between 5 and 7 m with respect to mean sea level msl the lpr is characterized by the remnants of a navigation channel dredged several decades ago design depths of about 10 m at the mouth and 4 m in the upper reaches but no longer actively maintained the hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics in the lpr were analyzed by mathew and winterwerp 2020 using the in situ data and are summarized here these dynamics represent the conceptual model of sediment transport used to support the development of the morphodynamic model in the following sections the primary hydrodynamic forcings within the lpr include barotropic and baroclinic circulation and river flow barotropic circulation includes the periodic tide as well as episodic coastal setup setdown events both of which result in volume fluxes into and out of the estuary driven by the along channel water level gradient semi diurnal tides period of 12 42 h corresponding to the dominant semi diurnal m2 constituent and tidal range of 0 9 to 2 1 m from neap to spring entering newark bay through the kill van kull and arthur kill propagate to the lpr and the head of tide at dundee dam baroclinic circulation is induced by along channel density gradients resulting from the mixing of freshwater from the head of tide and saline water from the ocean the resulting longitudinal salinity gradient induces residual near bottom currents directed up estuary and near surface currents directed down estuary salinity intrusion occurs under most river flows annual average river flow at dundee dam is about 34 m3 s with the saline water flushed out of the lpr at high river flows 200 m3 s return period of 2 years the extent of salinity intrusion as indicated by the location of the salt front also determines the location of the estuarine turbidity maximum etm a zone of elevated ssc and enhanced sediment trapping suspended sediment transport in the lpr varies over tidal time scales responding to the cyclic variations in tidal currents by eroding and replenishing by deposition the sediment inventory in the fluff layer the presence of the fluff layer in the lpr has been observed in erodibility measurements using a gust microcosm on shallow sediment cores as well as other lines of evidence mathew and winterwerp 2017 briefly the gust microcosm experimental setup consists of an enclosed chamber containing a sediment core overlaid by a layer of continually refreshed water a sequence of increasing shear stresses is imposed by varying the rotation speed of a disc positioned above the water and the sediment mass eroded at given shear stress is measured the erosion rate and shear stress measurements are subsequently analyzed to determine the profile of τ cr over a relatively shallow depth interval on the order of mm the data show a thin pool 2 4 mm thick of easily erodible sediments overlying less erodible strata and comprised of sediments that are resuspended twice every tidal cycle once during flood and again during ebb and redeposited around slack water increasing river flow alters these dynamics in two respects by preventing deposition around slack water i e preventing replenishment of the fluff layer and by causing erosion of the more consolidated sediments underneath the fluff layer consequently sediment transport as inferred from the tidally integrated net suspended sediment flux ssf is influenced by barotropic and baroclinic circulation with the magnitude and direction of ssf modulated by river flow during low river flow lag effects and tidal asymmetries induced by barotropic processes and baroclinic circulation induced by salinity intrusion and mixing result in net up estuary transport of sediment increasing river flow reduces the influence of these up estuary transport pathways delivers additional sediment loading from the head of tide causes erosion and results in net down estuary ssf conceptually sediment dynamics in the lpr follows one of three regimes depending on river flow at any given time importing flushing scouring mathew and winterwerp 2020 in general terms low river flow conditions are associated with net up estuary ssf and represent an importing regime regime i and conversely increasing river flow is associated with net down estuary ssf and export of sediment from the system the exporting regime can be further distinguished into two conditions distinguished by morphological impact flushing conditions thus referred to since only mainly the sediments within the fluff layer are eroded regime ii and scouring conditions thus referred to since the more consolidated layers underneath the fluff layer are eroded regime iii in other words during low to moderate river flows regimes i and ii erosion is limited to the fluff layer and only during high river flows nominally regime iii are shear stresses high enough to cause erosion of the less erodible strata underlying the fluff layer mathew and winterwerp 2020 although variable locally for the system as a whole the river flow rate thresholds between regimes i and ii and between regimes ii and iii are approximately 20 30 m3 s and 200 m3 s respectively this implies that sediment transport in the lpr is dominated by fluff layer dynamics i e erosion limited the majority of the time the availability of sediments in the fluff layer is responsible for the net transport of fine sediments by barotropic and baroclinic circulation against the direction of residual river flow therefore the infill of the estuary with fines from down estuary is governed by the fluff layer dynamics mathew and winterwerp 2020 which therefore needs to be accounted for in the morphodynamic model the general process of sediment import during low river flow periods and export during high river flow periods is also apparent in the morphological change measured in a series of inter annual multi beam bathymetric surveys performed in september 2007 november 2008 june 2010 october 2011 and september 2012 mathew and winterwerp 2020 the along channel cumulative volumetric change between consecutive surveys is shown in fig 2 along with the river flow rate during this five year period river flow ranged from a low of about 1 m3 s in october 2007 to highs of 450 m3 s in march 2010 and march 2011 return period of 25 years and 700 m3 s in august 2011 return period of 90 years the periods between the 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 surveys represent relatively low flow conditions with generally regimes i and ii events whereas the periods between the 2008 2010 and 2010 2011 surveys included several regime iii events and represent relatively high flow conditions the impact of the varying flow regimes is apparent in the measured morphological change with different behavior for the reaches seaward and landward of rm 2 landward of rm 2 the low flow periods 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 experienced deposition whereas the high flow periods 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 experienced erosion the 2010 2011 period experienced erosion at locations further seaward than the 2008 2010 period an observation that is consistent with the greater magnitude of river flow during the former period in addition effects of bed armoring are apparent in the morphological change over 2010 2011 specifically the reach landward of rm 7 does not show significant erosion during 2010 2011 which is in contrast to the significant erosion in this reach during 2008 2010 it is likely that a highly consolidated fine sediment layer and or armoring by coarser sediment exposed during the regime iii event in 2008 2010 prevented further erosion in 2010 2011 such erosion limited behavior therefore needs to be accounted for in the morphodynamic model in contrast the reach seaward of rm 2 experienced deposition during the high flow years because of the increasing river cross section and relatively low shear stress regime in these areas as compared to the relatively high shear stress regime in the more landward locations that experienced erosion and experienced erosion during the low flow years because of the impact of ongoing shipping mathew and winterwerp 2020 this reach contains several active shipping terminals u s army corps of engineers 2010 and as explained subsequently shipping induced scour maintains a state of dynamic morphological equilibrium that is different than would be expected under natural conditions review of bathymetry data in the vicinity of the shipping terminals shows accretion in these areas during high flow years followed by erosion and a return to a near equilibrium bathymetry under mean conditions the current morphodynamic status of the lpr is apparent from an assessment of two common morphodynamic relationships longitudinal convergence of river cross section and tidal prism to cross section relation winterwerp et al 2021 d alpaos et al 2010 as shown in fig 3 tidal prism is defined as the volume of water entering the estuary during the flood phase of the tide in the absence of any freshwater inflows this is the volume of water leaving the estuary during the ebb phase of the tide these relationships are also used subsequently to interpret the results of the prognostic assessments of the impacts of navigation episodic storm events and climate change between rm 2 and rm 15 the lpr currently conforms to the following trends an exponentially converging form given the cross sectional area ax at given location x and the relationship ax a 0exp x la the reference cross section at rm 2 a 0 is calculated as 615 m2 and convergence length la as 24 7 km this indicates that even though the river was modified in the past e g dredged for navigation shorelines hardened and inter tidal wetlands reclaimed it has regained an exponential cross section distribution a relationship between the cross section area and tidal prism given the cross sectional area ax and tidal prism at given location p t x and the relationship ax a 0 p t x p t 0 the reference cross section at rm 2 a 0 is calculated as 560 m2 and the exponent as 0 43 the exponent is typically in the range of 0 85 1 1 in tidal inlets d alpaos et al 2010 the reason for the lower value noted in the lpr is further explored subsequently seaward of rm 2 the river cross section increases and the relationship with tidal prism changes the reason for this is related to the morphological impact of shipping which is explored subsequently as mentioned previously the lpr was dredged for navigation purposes historically with the last major dredging events occurring in 1950 1951 between rm 0 and rm 6 7 and in 1983 between rm 0 and rm 1 5 u s army corps of engineers 2010 comparison of the post dredging and current cross sections in fig 3 shows the morphodynamic response of the river to the disequilibrium caused by dredging with significant infilling between rm 0 and rm 6 7 this infilling was likely a combination of sediment deposited during regime iii events and sediment transported up estuary during regime i and ii conditions the larger river cross sections historically also imply that sediment trapping efficiency has decreased over time in response to the evolving morphology the availability of data describing short term and long term morphological change along with data for parameterizing and calibrating a numerical model therefore provides opportunity for developing a morphodynamic model of the lpr calibrated to multiple lines of evidence the conceptual model of sediment dynamics the three transport regimes erosion limited transport fluff layer dynamics described in this section was therefore used as the basis of the morphodynamic model of the lpr and subsequently for development of the morfac approach 3 morphodynamic model the morphodynamic model presented here uses the estuarine coastal and ocean model ecomsed framework blumberg and mellor 1978 hydroqual inc 2010 which includes integrated hydrodynamic and sediment transport sub models as part of the environmental studies of the lpr ecomsed was used for a hydrodynamic application hydroqual 2008 as well as a sediment transport application moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 of the lpr model inputs and calibration parameters established as part of the hydrodynamic application were used in the present study although the sediment transport application used somewhat different formulations some inputs such as initial conditions erodibility inputs boundary conditions etc used in the present study are based on the model application of moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 the formulations and setup of the morphodynamic model is presented next followed by model performance 3 1 model setup the morphodynamic model involves a three dimensional time variable application over a domain that includes the lpr hackensack river newark bay arthur kill and kill van kull model domain shown in fig 1 the spatial domain is resolved using a shoreline fitted variable resolution curvilinear orthogonal grid grid resolution in the lpr ranges from seven cells across the river at rm 1 4 and decreasing to three cells across the river at rm 13 5 average grid resolution in the lpr is 35 m wide and 140 m long with a ten layer σ coordinate system in the water column briefly the three dimensional hydrodynamic model solves a system of equations describing the conservation of mass momentum heat and salt blumberg and mellor 1978 hydroqual inc 2010 vertical mixing is resolved using the second order turbulence closure scheme of mellor and yamada 1982 and sub grid scale horizontal mixing parameterized using smagorinsky 1963 boundary conditions for the hydrodynamic model include the measured river flow entering from the head of tide in the lpr and tributaries and the tide salinity and temperature at the marine boundaries kill van kull and arthur kill marine boundary conditions specified using the results of the regional scale hydrodynamic model hydroqual 2008 the hydrodynamic model was calibrated by adjusting bottom roughness and horizontal mixing to reproduce measured water level and three dimensional velocity temperature and salinity the calibration approach implicitly assumes that temporal changes in mud dynamics e g in response to dredging due to bed coarsening during storm events etc do not affect the hydrodynamics table 1 provides a tabulation of the major model parameter values the sediment transport module in ecomsed calculates the advection and dispersion of suspended sediments originating from the boundaries settling and the bed water exchange processes of erosion and deposition hydroqual inc 2010 the three dimensional advection dispersion equation for suspended sediment transport is 1 c t u c x v c y w w s z x a h c x y a h c y z k h c z where c is suspended sediment concentration u v and w represent velocities along the x y and z directions respectively ws is the settling velocity ah is the horizontal diffusivity and kh is the vertical eddy diffusivity eq 1 is subject to the boundary conditions k h c z 0 and w w s z 0 at the air water interface and k h c z e d and w w s z 0 at the sediment water interface where e is the erosion rate and d is the deposition flux as part of the present study two key modifications were introduced to ecomsed the first modification described in this section includes the representation of a stratified bed layering scheme with depth dependent erodibility that is key to sediment dynamics pertaining to erosion limited transport and memory effects the second modification described in the following section includes the implementation of morphological acceleration using morfac as discussed in the preceding section the lpr is characterized by erosion limited transport i e erosion is a function of the sediment substrate and stratigraphy accordingly the classical morphodynamic feedback loop commonly used in sandy settings was modified for application to fine sediment settings as shown in fig 4 the primary refinement is consideration of the availability of mobile sediment in the transport formulations note that the morphological acceleration factor included in fig 4 is applicable to the analyses in the following section the spatially and temporally varying erosion and deposition fluxes computed by the model in response to the non equilibrium transport formulations are used to compute the changing bed stratigraphy composition mass and consequently the bed thickness the resulting morphological change is used to update the bathymetry used for hydrodynamic calculations in the following timestep thus the hydrodynamic solution adapts and self adjusts in response to the evolving bathymetry during the simulation the conceptual description and quantitative parameterization of erosion limited transport in the model is based on erodibility measurements as mentioned previously the sediment bed is characterized by the presence of an easily erodible fluff layer overlying less erodible strata mathew and winterwerp 2017 within the fluff layer τ cr values increase by approximately an order of magnitude erodibility measurements using a sedflume device borrowman et al 2006 and analyzed by moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 show approximately an additional four fold increase in τ cr over the top 30 cm of the bed this conceptual description of depth dependent erodibility was used as the basis for a multi layer bed model fig 5 shows a schematic of the bed layering developed to represent the depth dependent erodibility along with a conceptual description of the hydrodynamic conditions that can potentially scour through the various strata the fluff layer is located at the bed water interface and is subject to erosion and deposition during erosional conditions e g the first half of the flood tide the fluff layer may be depleted and disappear during the following depositional condition e g the second half of the flood tide and high water slack depositing sediments first recreate the fluff layer when the fluff layer exceeds its pre determined maximum thickness the excess sediment is transferred to the underlying layer given the order of magnitude difference in erodibility between the fluff layer and the underlying less erodible layer the model includes an intermediate transition layer with same maximum allowable thickness as the fluff layer with intermediate strength when both the fluff and transitional layers reach their pre determined maximum thickness new layers are created underneath the transitional layer simulating consolidation under depositional conditions sediment is transferred from the fluff layer through the transitional layer and to the layer underneath under erosional conditions layer depletion proceeds in a logical sequence with the fluff layer eroded first followed by the underlying layers erosion rate for the fluff and transition layers follows a modification of the partheniades formulation for surface erosion 2 e m τ b τ c r f o r τ b τ c r where τ b is the turbulence mean bed shear stress and m is the erosion rate coefficient within the relatively deep channel parameters τ cr and m were specified using the approach of mathew and winterwerp 2017 and marginally adjusted within the estimated uncertainty limits during calibration however the sub tidal shallows outside the channel were parameterized as three times more erodible i e parameters τ cr and m reduced and increased respectively by a factor of three than the channel areas primarily by calibration though this model describes the vertical response of the bed to erosive forcing it basically parameterizes spatial variability within grid cells as elaborated by winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 the less erodible layers underneath the fluff and transitional layers are treated somewhat differently in order to enable efficient management of the bed layers mainly with respect to depth and time dependent erodibility these layers are formulated using the consolidation model of sanford 2008 briefly the consolidation model prescribes an equilibrium depth profile of bed density ρ eq as 3 ρ e q ρ ρ ρ 0 exp ϕ o where ρ0 is the density at the bed surface ρ is the asymptotic density at depth o is the mass of sediment above given depth in the bed referred to as the overmass and ϕ is an empirical parameter given the equilibrium density profile at any point in time t and depth within the bed the instantaneous density ρ approaches equilibrium following the first order approximation 4 ρ t r c ρ e q ρ h ρ e q ρ r s ρ e q ρ h ρ ρ e q where h is the heaviside step function h 1 when its argument is 0 and h 0 otherwise rc is the first order consolidation rate and rs is the first order swelling rate the instantaneous depth dependent density is related to the erosion rate using a power law formulation roberts et al 1998 5 e a τ b n ρ m where a n and m are empirical parameters finally the time and depth dependent τ cr is estimated by rearranging eq 5 such that τ cr is calculated as that shear stress which results in given critical threshold erosion rate ecr roberts et al 1998 it is noted that although the effect of the abiotic swelling process on sediment erodibility is explicitly represented in the model biological activity in the sediment e g bioturbation may also affect erodibility this is in part implicitly accounted for in the model parameterization established using the combination of empirical data and calibration described next parameters ϕ a n m and ecr in eqs 3 and 5 were determined by fitting the measured density erosion rate and τ cr profiles moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 borrowman et al 2006 parameter rc was estimated as 0 25 d 1 using the results of sedflume erosion experiments on cores reconstituted in settling columns and tested at different intervals after self weight consolidation sea engineering 2013 whereas parameter rs was defined as 0 01rc based on sanford 2008 although the application of the consolidation model involves the determination of several fitted parameters the resulting metrics of interest erosion rate τ cr and ρ are constrained by measured values the parameterization of the consolidation model results in equilibrium profiles with increasing density decreasing τ cr and decreasing erosion rate for given shear stress with depth in the bed the consolidation model also allows for the instantaneous profile of these metrics to deviate from the equilibrium profile as a function of the time history of erosion and deposition and eventually tending to the equilibrium profile in other words a less erodible layer exposed by erosion will swell and become more erodible over time a temporal trend that is conceptually reasonable and relevant for long term morphological simulations in dynamic settings furthermore the depth and time dependent erodibility parameterized in the bed layering via the fluff and transition layers and the consolidation model allows for representation of memory effects sediment mobility and the various time scales responsible for morphological evolution in fine sediment systems this is a key aspect of the modification to the classical morphodynamic loop presented in fig 4 it should be noted that only bed layers comprised of predominantly fine sediments fines fraction 15 winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 are treated as cohesive and subject to consolidation with erosion defined using eq 3 through 5 bed layers comprised predominantly of sand fines fraction 15 are not considered to be cohesive i e they do not consolidate and have τ cr that is independent of layer density erosion properties coefficients a and n in eq 5 for such non cohesive layers was defined using sedflume experiments on quartz particles roberts et al 1998 with erosion rates calculated using a simplified version of eq 5 that does not include the dependency with density the model includes six particle classes of which three are sand sized effective diameters 150 μm 750 μm and 4000 μm calculated using grain size distribution measured in sediment cores and three are fine sediment classes representing fines originating from freshwater sources head of tide from marine sources arthur kill and kill van kull and from the bed by erosion although flocculation is not modeled explicitly the impact of flocculation is parameterized in the model as discussed in the following paragraph the two larger sand fractions are found in only a small portion of the lpr predominantly towards its head with significant loadings of fine sand entering the lpr only during episodic events class specific τ cr was defined for sands using the shields curve van rijn 1993 with erosion of sands from cohesive layers occurring only when both the class specific and density dependent τ cr is exceeded in contrast erosion of sands from non cohesive layers occurs when the class specific τ cr is exceeded initial conditions corresponding to the mass fractions of the various classes in the sediment bed fines in bed at initialization were assigned to the bed fines class and dry density were defined using measurements on sediment cores from the lpr moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 and assigned as averages over large reaches the fluff and transition layers were also initialized at their maximum allowable thickness temporally varying ssc boundary conditions were defined at the head of tide varying in response to river flow and at the marine boundaries varying within the tidal cycle as a function of tidal currents using rating curves moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 the settling velocities of the sand classes were determined using the formulation of cheng 1997 the settling velocity of fines originating from the head of tide was calculated using cheng 1997 on the basis of an effective diameter measured with laser diffraction on deflocculated suspended sediment samples moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 effectively this assumes that fines originating from the freshwater sources are poorly flocculated an assumption verified during model performance assessment in contrast the settling velocities of fines originating from marine sources and from the bed were developed by calibration to ssc ssf and morphological change data these correspond to higher values than the fines from the head of tide likely reflecting the effect of floc formation in the water column and in the bed winterwerp 2002 tran and strom 2019 furthermore in an approximation of aggregation processes in the bed tran and strom 2019 fines from freshwater and marine sources that accumulate underneath the fluff and transition layers i e implicitly have been residing in the bed for one or more tidal cycles are instantaneously transferred to the bed fines class probability of deposition for the sand classes is defined using gessler 1967 whereas probability of deposition for the fines is set to 1 i e allowing deposition under all conditions see winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 table 1 provides a tabulation of the major model parameter values finally the effect of shipping at locations seaward of rm 2 was parameterized for simulations spanning the 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 bathymetry surveys by using the measured morphological change over these periods up to five ships on average transit this reach on a daily basis moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 with the scour expected to be related to factors such as the timing of transit related to the tide vessel draft power applied by the propellers at any given location etc however given data limitations such subtleties are ignored and the measured erosion was used to specify a constant rate of erosion at the locations of observed scour and the scoured mass assigned as a continuous and vertically uniform loading to the water column 3 2 model performance model performance was evaluated by comparison against measurements for various metrics over a range of river flows and time periods model data comparisons for small and large scale morphological change are presented here appendix a presents comparisons for currents salinity ssc ssf and cumulative morphological change along with a discussion of model limitations model performance was compared to the measured morphological change over 2007 2012 the morphodynamic model was used to perform four separate simulations spanning the periods of the various bathymetry surveys and initialized using measured bathymetry at the start of the particular period the measured and calculated morphological changes were averaged cross sectionally and longitudinally over 1 mile 1 6 km intervals for an assessment of large scale morphological changes and are shown in fig 6 overall the model reproduces the large scale flow dependent morphological trends apparent in the data results for the low flow periods 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 generally show infilling landward of rm 2 and the high flow periods 2008 2010 and 2010 2011 show erosion landward of rm 2 and deposition seaward of rm 2 in the model erosion scales with river flow rate for instance the 2008 2010 period included a 450 m3 s event whereas the 2010 2011 period included a 700 m3 s event and accordingly the model responds with more erosion during the latter period the data show such flow dependent erosion depths in some reaches e g between rm 2 and rm 6 however in other reaches specifically between rm 7 and rm 11 while the data shows evidence of armoring during the 2010 2011 period the model does not capture the armoring effects although the model reproduces the large scale flow dependent erosional and depositional trends and the large scale morphological changes it tends to under perform at local scales the model calculated river volume in the simulations covering the 2007 2012 period was also compared to the measured river volume as shown in fig 7 in addition the measured infill landward of rm 2 during the low flow years was examined analytically for an assessment of large scale morphodynamics using the volume of cut method winterwerp et al 2021 which describes the infill rate as d v d t v v e t with solution 6 v t v e v 0 v e exp t t where t is the time constant for the infill process and v is the cumulative submerged river volume calculated at msl landward of rm 2 with subscripts t e and 0 representing instantaneous equilibrium and initial quantities eq 6 was used to describe the infill process between the 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 surveys using the measured initial v 0 and final vt river volumes and the two unknowns ve and t calculated as 7 61 mm3 and 823 days respectively using least squares optimization the resulting trends in analytical model estimates of river volume shown in fig 7 are with some exceptions generally consistent with the results of the numerical model fig 7 also shows that the measured river volumes in 2007 and 2011 were only 0 7 and 2 7 greater respectively relative to ve and the measured river volumes in all five surveys is very similar to ve this indicates that as a whole the reach landward of rm 2 is at or near morphodynamic equilibrium with episodic regime iii events causing only a relatively small deviation from equilibrium this suggests possible explanations for the under performance of the model with respect to small scale spatial erosion and infill patterns specifically scour in erosion limited conditions is very sensitive to local variations in bed stratigraphy both with respect to the armoring effects of sand lenses as well as low erodibility consolidated layers model results are therefore limited by the lack of comprehensive data characterizing such spatially and depth varying properties similarly because the change in river volume by erosion is not significant enough to significantly enhance trapping efficiency in the following periods local patterns of infill are expected to be more sensitive to the availability of sediment at the mouth of the lpr and its synchronization with import mechanisms especially in the case of shipping induced scour for instance in locations where navigation is limited by water depth ship traffic may be limited to the period of the rising or flood tide which implies greater potential for sediment import into the lpr than if the scour is distributed equally over the entire tidal cycle as assumed in the numerical model however such limitations may impact model performance more over the short term such as the inter annual periods presented here than over the long term dam et al 2016 therefore the application of the morfac approach to the lpr presented in the next section also includes a validation of model performance over a multi decadal period 4 morphodynamic upscaling using morphological acceleration the morphodynamic model of the lpr was used in the development and application of the morfac approach for fine sediment settings the morfac approach derives from the following key concepts lesser et al 2004 roelvink 2006 ranasinghe et al 2011 lesser 2009 time scales of morphological change are typically greater than time scales of change in hydrodynamic forcings morphological change or net change in bed sediment mass e g in response to a repeated sequence of identical hydrodynamic forcings is assumed to be linear within the morphological timestep this implies that morphological change or net change in bed sediment mass calculated over a single tidal cycle can be upscaled to n tidal cycles using the morphological acceleration factor fmor n this gives rise to the notion of the morphological timestep δtmor 7 δ t m o r f m o r δ t h y d where δthyd is the hydrodynamic timestep which we implicitly assume equals the sediment transport timestep net change in bed sediment mass over the morphological timestep is calculated using erosion and deposition fluxes over the hydrodynamic timestep 8 δ s m o r f m o r d e δ t h y d where δsmor is the mass change in the bed over the morphological timestep in the lpr where the river flow regime is the primary determinant of sediment dynamics see fig a 3 and mathew and winterwerp 2020 morphological acceleration is achieved by upscaling the morphological response to given river flow rate in other words the net change in sediment mass in the bed associated with a given river flow that repeats over n tidal cycles is calculated by simulating a single tidal cycle for that river flow and scaling the resulting bed mass change to n tidal cycles using eq 8 note that although some authors have applied eq 8 i e morphological upscaling applied to bed mass change frings and ottevanger 2011 the classical approach to morphodynamic upscaling using the morfac approach consists of multiplying bed level changes with fmor to calculate bathymetry at the end of the morphological timestep roelvink 2006 ranasinghe et al 2011 as shown in the left panel of fig 4 the classical approach was tested initially as part of the current research briefly in this approach bed level change calculated over the hydrodynamic timestep δhhyd is multiplied by fmor to calculate the bed level change over the morphodynamic timestep δhmor see eq 9 9 δ h m o r f m o r δ h h y d application of eq 9 to perform morphological upscaling in the numerical model implies that morphological change will not be consistent with sediment mass change in the bed in contrast eq 8 results in bed mass change that is consistent with morphological change and allows for appropriate representation of memory effects and sediment mobility this is illustrated with an application of the two morphodynamic upscaling methods to a synthesized hydrograph in fig 8 the example application in fig 8 uses the same model application presented in the preceding section and includes a synthesized hydrograph starting at below average river flow of 10 m3 s and increasing to 450 m3 s the first 10 days of this simulation represent the hydrodynamic and sediment transport spin up and is simulated using fmor of 1 subsequently fmor increases to 7 as flow increases to 50 m3 s at which point fmor decreases to 1 the model was initialized with a bed comprised of the fluff and transition layers and sub surface layers comprised solely of the largest sand class included in the present application which has τcr 3 1 pa and is non erodible under the shear stresses imposed in this example model performance is shown on the left panels using the classical approach to morphodynamic upscaling eq 9 and on the right panels using the approach used in this paper eq 8 for a grid cell located at rm 1 4 in the lpr review of model performance for bed composition panels d and i and bed mass thickness and morphological change panels e and j shows the artifact associated with the classical morphodynamic upscaling approach in a setting affected by bed armoring the first 37 days of the simulation represent net depositional conditions with both simulations showing net morphological change of approximately 24 cm since the classical approach does not preserve bed mass the change in bed mass thickness is only about 6 cm and much lower than morphological change during this period this is also seen in the bed composition change over time with the depositing fines creating about 6 cm of new layers on top of the initial bed layers in contrast the simulation with morphodynamic upscaling applied to bed mass preserves bed mass change and morphological change with the depositing fines creating about 24 cm of new layers on top of the initial bed layers during the high shear stress conditions over days 37 40 the entire depth of newly deposited sediment is eroded because skin friction during this period exceeds the critical shear stress of the deposited fine sediment layers in the case of the simulation with morphodynamic upscaling applied to bed mass change net erosion during this period is about 24 cm with bathymetry reverting to the initial bathymetry following exposure of the armored bed layers however in the simulation with morphodynamic upscaling applied to bed level change erosion of the 6 cm of deposited fines exposes the armored bed layer and consequently net morphological change over the 47 day simulation is calculated as net accretion about 18 cm more deposition than the simulation with morphodynamic upscaling applied to bed mass change this artifact in performance is a consequence of the fact that the classical approach does not properly account for the factors leading to memory effects in the bed the same artifact is also introduced for a purely fine sediment setting where memory effects due to depth dependent erodibility can have a similar effect as armoring in this example the analysis indicates that the classical approach is appropriate only in settings where erosion limited transport is not a factor e g typically problems of sand transport in coastal settings morphodynamic upscaling in settings where memory effects are relevant for transport can be successfully achieved only by applying upscaling to the bed mass change the morfac approach involves input reduction for the hydrodynamic forcings which in the case of the lpr includes river flow and barotropic forcing briefly input reduction for the barotropic forcing seeks to replace the complex time series of tidal water level and current fluctuations occurring in nature with a simplified tide that produces the same residual sediment transport and morphological change patterns as the naturally varying tides lesser 2009 in the case of fine sediment systems the representative tide should also reproduce the effects of sediment availability and erosion limited transport on residual sediment transport the representative tide used for boundary conditions in the application of the morfac approach include the semi diurnal m2 and diurnal o1 and k1 constituents along with the m4 and m6 overtides with the representative tide tidal range of 1 5 m synthesized following the methods of lesser 2009 simulations using the representative tide were compared to simulations using the spring neap tidal cycle in order to ensure that the representative tide preserves the long term net sediment transport ssc boundary conditions at the marine boundaries were specified using the rating curve approach described previously and using tidal currents corresponding to the representative tide input reduction for river flow is discussed in the following section 4 1 considerations for morfac approach in fine sediment settings and specifically for application to the lpr section 1 includes discussion of phenomena specific to fine sediment transport specific formulations and careful selection of model inputs were required for appropriate representation of these phenomena within the context of the morfac approach these considerations maintain the assumption of linearity within the morphological timestep that is key to the morfac approach separate conditions when the assumption of linearity cannot be met and preserve the various time scales of morphological response in fine sediment systems these are summarized below residual sediment transport morphological change due to residual transport associated with barotropic and baroclinic circulation relevant during regimes i and ii scales as a function of time for instance a sediment particle located at the mouth of the river at the start of a flood tide will move a certain distance up estuary after one tidal cycle due to tidal asymmetries and lag effects assuming flood dominance and estuarine circulation during the following tidal cycle it will move some distance further up estuary in other words net sediment transport in a simulation of two tidal cycles with fmor 1 will not be identical to a simulation of one tidal cycle with fmor 2 this implies a practical upper bound on the value of fmor established by trial and error as 7 and applicable during regimes i and ii in the current application memory effects consider a time series of two identical erosional events occurring sequentially and in short order high shear stress during the first event can cause erosion of surficial sediments thus exposing a bed layer with τ cr greater than the maximum bed shear stress during the event therefore the second event which experiences the same time history and magnitude of bed shear stress as the first event would not be expected to cause any further erosion however a simulation of a single event with fmor 2 will overestimate the magnitude of erosion compared to a simulation of two sequential events with fmor 1 the latter will preserve the erosion limited morphological response in the lpr depth dependent erodibility is a factor in limiting erosion primarily under regime iii conditions river flow rate greater than 200 m3 s for the system as whole although this threshold decreases in the landward direction therefore in order to appropriately represent such memory effects for the current application morphological acceleration is not employed i e fmor 1 when river flow rate exceeds 50 m3 s which is a threshold established using maps of bed shear stress under different steady state river flow rates and is the estimated threshold above which erosion of the consolidated layers may occur mathew and winterwerp 2020 supply limited transport the supply of fine sediments from the head of tide generally tends to be event dominated i e episodic high flow events are responsible for a significant fraction of the annual sediment delivery to the river and affect sediment availability for redistribution during subsequent periods morphological acceleration under such conditions may not accurately reproduce sediment transport patterns for instance for a high flow event loading with a travel time of 10 days from the head of tide to the area of interest a one day simulation with fmor 10 will not capture transport to the area of interest therefore in order to appropriately represent such supply limited transport for the current application morphological acceleration is not employed i e fmor 1 when river flow rate exceeds 50 m3 s this threshold is also consistent with the rating curve used to define ssc boundary conditions at the head of tide which includes relatively constant ssc at river flow rate of less than 60 m3 s and increasing with increasing river flow fluff layer dynamics in order to preserve the intra tidal ssc and ssf dynamics which depend on sediment inventory in the fluff layer and is relevant for residual transport only the sediment flux over the hydrodynamic timestep i e d e δthyd is added to or sourced from the fluff layer sediment flux over the remainder of the morphological timestep i e fmor 1 d e δthyd is added to or sourced from subsurface layers this preserves the timing of erosion and deposition within the tidal cycle thus preserving residual transport over the tidal cycle and is important for maintaining the condition of linearity in morphological change during the morphological timestep that is key to morphological upscaling these considerations have resulted an approach that includes river flow dependent values of fmor with fmor of 7 or 1 when river flow rate is less than or greater than 50 m3 s i e regime i ii or regime ii iii conditions respectively the selected river flow threshold separates conditions where erosion is limited to the fluff layer river flows 50 m3 s from conditions where the consolidated layers underneath the fluff layer may be eroded this definition of conditions without morphological acceleration preserves erosion limited dynamics and preserves supply limited transport which are relevant during high river flows furthermore the selected fmor value of 7 in combination with the formulation described previously that preserves fluff layer dynamics helps preserve residual sediment transport which is a key driver of morphological change during regimes i ii the river flow boundary conditions are a synthesized sequence of flow rates designed to represent the river flow dependent location of the salt front and etm and effects of barotropic and baroclinic circulation on net sediment transport this was accomplished by sorting the measured river flows averaged over the period of two tidal cycles in order to account for the inequality in the semi diurnal representative tide followed by a fixed window average over seven two tide cycles of river flows for flow rates less than 50 m3 s for simulations covering the periods of the inter annual bathymetry surveys this sorting and sequencing was performed separately for periods before and after significant high flow events between two surveys with the synthesized river flow rate increasing from the start of the simulation up to the peak of the high flow event followed by decreasing river flow rate this preserves the timing of the high flow event in a fashion analogous to the brute force simulations ssc boundary conditions at the head of tide were defined using rating curves as described previously 4 2 model performance with the exception of the boundary conditions for tide river flow and ssc defined as described above the remainder of the model setup and parameterization for the morphodynamic model using morfac is identical to the setup presented in the preceding section the performance of the morphodynamic model using morfac is first compared against the brute force simulations over the period of the inter annual bathymetry surveys 2007 2012 this serves as test of the morfac approach in its ability to reproduce the results of the more computationally intensive approach subsequently as a validation the morphodynamic model using morfac is applied for a multi decadal hindcast simulation and compared against measured morphological change 4 2 1 model tests 2007 2012 the value of fmor used for periods simulated with morphological acceleration and the flow threshold used to separate periods with and without morphological acceleration were developed based on the results of morphological change in test simulations covering the period of the inter annual bathymetry surveys over 2007 2012 table 2 presents a quantitative model performance assessment for various parameter values for fmor and the threshold river flow the performance of the individual test simulations was assessed against the results of the brute force simulations using model results in individual grid cells using the brier skill score bss as defined by van rijn et al 2003 and sutherland et al 2004 10 b s s 1 y x 2 b x 2 where x can be the measured bed level or calculated bed level from brute force simulations y is the model calculated bed level in simulations using the morfac approach b is the initial bed level and the angled brackets denote an arithmetic mean for the assessment in this section x is the calculated bed level from the brute force simulations results presented in fig 6 and the bss is used to assess how well the simulations using morphological acceleration reproduce the brute force simulation results a bss of 1 indicates a perfect match whereas decreasing value of bss indicates increasing divergence between the two sets of model results the results in table 2 show progressively worsening results with 1 increasing value of fmor for the periods with morphological acceleration during regime i ii flows 2 morphological acceleration during regimes ii and iii and 3 increasing flow threshold used to separate periods with and without morphological acceleration these comparisons were used to determine selection of fmor 7 for periods simulated with morphological acceleration and the flow threshold of 50 m3 s in addition the results for the simulation without morphological acceleration i e fmor 1 during all flows also shows the impact of the representative tide and the synthesized flow sequencing applied as part of the morfac approach overall these simplifications of the boundary conditions do not significantly impact the results for morphological change i e the accuracy of the predictions fig 9 shows comparisons of model results for the brute force simulations and for simulations using morfac using fmor 7 for periods with morphological acceleration and flow threshold of 50 m3 s both graphical as well as quantitative comparisons indicate a high degree of similarity between the two sets of model results minor differences apparent in the comparisons are primarily related to factors not included in the simulations using morfac e g coincident spring tide during some of the high flow events impact of stochastic variations in river flow on residual sediment transport etc nonetheless overall the simulations using morfac reproduce the large scale as well as local scale with some minor exceptions performance of the brute force simulations therefore the morphodynamic model using morfac is concluded to be reasonably similar to the more computationally intensive approach and subject to the validation presented in the following sub section a valid approach for computationally efficient morphological simulations in fine sediment settings 4 2 2 model validation 1950 2007 the hindcast simulation used to validate the long term performance of the morphodynamic model using morfac involves the historical infill of the navigation channel in the lpr the last major dredging in the lpr occurred in 1950 1951 between rm 0 to rm 2 2 rm 2 2 to rm 4 2 and rm 4 2 to rm 6 7 to depths of 9 9 m 6 8 m and 5 6 m respectively depths relative to msl with maintenance dredging to depth of 9 9 m between rm 0 and rm 1 5 in 1983 u s army corps of engineers 2010 fig 3 also includes the cross section in 1950 1951 for comparison to the 2007 configuration significant deviations from the near equilibrium conditions in 2007 are apparent especially between rm 2 and rm 5 subsequent infill of the navigation channel ranges up to about 5 m in some locations therefore the morphodynamic model using morfac was applied for a simulation over the period 1950 2007 with the bathymetry in the navigation channel between rm 0 to rm 6 7 initialized at the design dredge depths and bathymetry between rm 0 to rm 1 5 reset to the design dredge depths in 1983 periodic changes in the geometry and morphology within newark bay u s army corps of engineers 2006 were also represented in the simulation input reduction for river flow at the head of tide was performed in annual cycles using the historic river flow data from 1950 2007 the impact of navigation in the channel between rm 0 and rm 2 was included by constraining deposition as a depth limited process in this reach with the limiting depth being the measured bathymetry in 2007 fig 10 shows the hydrograph during this period key observations include the extended period from the mid 1950s to late 1960s when river flow was relatively low mostly regime i i e infilling with only one regime iii event in contrast the remainder of this 58 year period experienced thirty two regime iii events fig 10 shows a comparison of the measured and model calculated bathymetry in 2007 overall the model reproduces various spatial and temporal trends apparent in the data these include the magnitude of infill at local scales trend of decreasing infill with distance in the landward direction and relatively lower infill in the vicinity of bends in the river quantitative assessment of the model calculated and measured bathymetry in 2007 shows bss value of 0 81 which represents an excellent model performance accordingly to the performance classification scheme of van rijn et al 2003 eq 10 was used to calculate bss with x representing the measured bed level in 2007 therefore this validation using multi decadal data provides demonstration of the applicability of the morfac approach for performing long term morphological simulations in fine sediment settings 5 model application the morphodynamic model using morfac was applied to answer a few specific and general questions regarding the current morphological status of the lpr and the morphological impact of specific forcings the specific question pertains to the impact of navigation seaward of rm 2 and the general questions pertain to the current morphological status of the lpr landward of rm 2 the role of episodic regime iii events and the impact of climate change the prognostic simulations used to address these issues were initialized using the measured bathymetry in 2007 the hydrograph over 1950 2007 is representative of the long term measured river flow over 1897 2020 therefore except as described later in the context of episodic regime iii events and climate change the prognostic simulations use the river flow hydrograph from 1950 to 2007 in addition the simulated 58 year duration is much larger than the approximately 2 year infill time scale estimated using the volume of cut method implying that the simulated duration is adequate for assessing questions related to morphological equilibrium of the system these simulations do not include shipping induced scour in the lpr 5 1 role of navigation and current morphological status several lines of evidence indicate that the reach between rm 0 and rm 2 in the lpr is impacted by shipping activities a change in the trend of current river cross section area with distance and with tidal prism at rm 2 as presented in fig 3 erosional trends between rm 0 to rm 2 during the low flow periods 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 in the inter annual morphological changes as presented in fig 2 and the consideration that the erosion cannot be caused by natural hydrodynamic forcings model calculated bed shear stresses during the periods of erosion are not high enough to cause the noted magnitude of erosion and local scale spatial patterns of erosion that are consistent with marine traffic data moffatt nichol and deltares 2019 collectively these lines of evidence indicate that this reach of the lpr is impacted by ongoing shipping activities therefore the impact of navigation was assessed using a prognostic simulation that does not include shipping induced scour fig 11 shows the resulting comparison of initial and calculated bathymetry at the end of the simulation and the cross section area and its relationship with tidal prism using the initial and final model calculated bathymetry the comparisons indicate that the reach between rm 0 and rm 2 which currently experiences shipping induced scour will infill by up to 2 3 m in some areas in the absence of navigation the infilling sediment is a combination of sediment scoured from landward locations during regime iii events as well as sediments transported from newark bay by the tide and estuarine circulation consequently the cross section adapts and seaward of rm 2 both the longitudinal profile of cross section area and the trend of cross section area with tidal prism tend towards a continuation of trends measured in 2007 at more landward locations these results are consistent with the hypothesis that this reach of the lpr is currently in a state of dynamic morphological equilibrium with the ongoing shipping activities in the absence of navigation substantial infill will occur reaching an equilibrium cross section that is similar to that expected based on morphodynamic relationships apparent in more landward reaches furthermore using the river morphology at the end of the prognostic simulation the convergence length la and exponent of 26 6 km and 0 42 respectively are only marginally different from values based on the current morphology presented in section 2 these results indicate that the reach landward of rm 2 is largely at morphodynamic equilibrium which consistent with the results of the analytical volume of cut method 5 2 impact of regime iii events episodic events causing significant erosion and export of sediments are considered to be the mechanism responsible for maintaining the long term morphological equilibrium in an estuary which may otherwise experience infilling due to import of sediments from both landward and seaward directions geyer et al 2001 meade 1969 in the context of the lpr regime iii events are considered to be representative of such erosional and exporting conditions mathew and winterwerp 2020 therefore in order to assess the significance of regime iii events on long term morphological behavior the results of a prognostic simulation using the measured river flow hydrograph were compared to a simulation where river flow was capped at 100 m3 s which is the local threshold for regime iii events for the reach landward of rm 8 mathew and winterwerp 2020 fig 12 shows the resulting comparison of initial and calculated bathymetry at the end of the simulation and the cross section area and its relationship with tidal prism using the initial and final model calculated bathymetry similar to the results presented in fig 11 which includes the impact of regime iii events the results in fig 12 show significant infilling in the reach seaward of rm 2 however in contrast to the results in fig 11 the results in fig 12 show infilling throughout the length of the estuary and most markedly in the upper reaches between rm 15 and rm 11 these results indicate a different equilibrium morphology in the absence of regime iii events with a shallower equilibrium bathymetry than in the presence of regime iii events these results tend to confirm the hypothesis of geyer et al 2001 and meade 1969 and the empirical observations of mathew and winterwerp 2020 on the role of regime iii events in the long term morphological equilibrium of estuaries this implies such regime iii events are critical in shaping the equilibrium morphology and should be included in morphological studies of such systems regime iii events also impact the morphodynamic relations of cross section profile and relationship with tidal prism in contrast with the values for the current morphology presented in section 2 the results in fig 12 show that in the absence of regime iii events the convergence length la and exponent decrease to 19 1 km and increase to 0 58 respectively the decrease in convergence length is consistent with the findings of dronkers 2017 who showed convergence length to be a positive function of river flow velocity accordingly a decrease in river flow rate e g due to the lack of regime iii events would result in a decrease in the convergence length which is consistent with the numerical model results the decrease in cross section area in the upper reaches also leads to the increase in the value of tending towards values more commonly observed for tidal inlets in the range of 0 85 1 1 d alpaos et al 2010 in other words in the absence of regime iii events river flow becomes a relatively less important forcing compared to the barotropic forcing in shaping the equilibrium morphology of the estuary therefore in addition to maintaining the long term morphological equilibrium regime iii events are also responsible for shaping the morphodynamic equilibrium profile of the estuary 5 3 impact of climate change broadly speaking the projected impact of climate change relevant for morphological development is two fold and includes sea level rise slr and changes in river flow rate slr in the lpr under an extreme scenario is projected to be about 1 3 m relative to the year 2000 by the year 2070 kopp et al 2019 although climate change impacts on river flow in the lpr are not known precisely projections from global climate models generally indicate an increase in total precipitation during storm events for instance in the lpr compared to the historical conditions total precipitation during a 4 day storm event with a return period of 100 years is projected to increase by about 20 by the year 2080 cdm smith 2019 therefore assuming linearity river flow rate in the future is expected to be higher than current conditions however slr and increasing river flow may have opposing morphological impacts specifically slr will cause a decrease in currents thus promoting infilling whereas increasing river flow will cause an increase in currents especially during storm events which could cause erosion and export of sediments from the estuary therefore the relative impact of slr and increasing river flow was assessed using two incremental prognostic simulations using 1 the projected slr and current river flow rates and 2 the projected slr and projected river flow rates calculated by enhancing current river flow by 20 as a crude approximation of the additional precipitation due to climate change fig 13 shows the comparison of initial bathymetry and calculated bathymetry at the end of the two incremental prognostic simulations these comparisons show significant infilling over nearly the entire length of the estuary primarily due to the decrease in currents associated with the increase in water depth due to slr and provided sediment loadings are not affected the results also indicate that slr rather than increased river flow rate has a greater impact on the morphological evolution of the estuary with the overall impact of climate change being infill possibly also the sediment load may increase with increasing river flows which would shorten the time scales to attain the new equilibrium since no predictions exist on changes in sediment loading due to climate change this subject was not addressed in this scenario furthermore the longitudinal profiles of river cross section and trend of cross section area with tidal prism shown in fig 13 indicate that the estuary adapts to the disequilibrium caused by slr by infilling and tending towards a morphodynamic profile similar to current conditions for the current morphology and current msl in most of the estuary however as seen from localized differences between the cross section at the end of the prognostic simulation and the cross section under the current msl the 58 year duration of the prognostic simulations is likely not sufficient to attain the equilibrium profile nonetheless the overall response of the system to slr is consistent with theoretical and historical response to slr meade 1969 6 discussion the lpr is characterized by predominantly fine sediment transport although the bed in places is mixed fines and sands consequently due to memory effects and sediment mobility limitations transport is below capacity conditions i e no equilibrium exists between the sediment load and the local hydraulic conditions the amount of mobile sediment actively forming the river s morphology is largely influenced by past hydrodynamic conditions in particular by episodic erosional events mathew and winterwerp 2020 the morphodynamic development of the lpr exhibits memory effects at various time scales from the tidal period to multi year periods spanning episodic erosional events at short to intermediate time scales the response to hydrodynamic forcing is characterized by three regimes mainly governed by the river flow and responsible for the morphological response infilling flushing and scouring while quantified for the lpr this type of system response i e the various transport regimes is characteristic of fine sediment dynamics in rivers characterized by erosion limited conditions winterwerp et al 2021 mathew and winterwerp 2020 the sediment dynamics and its dependency with sediment mobility memory effects and consequently the three transport regimes in the lpr are generally reproduced by the morphodynamic model presented here the model formulation specifically the bed schematization with an easily erodible fluff layer overlying less erodible parent bed subject to consolidation represents the memory effects on transport as apparent in the three transport regimes and flow dependent morphological response however the model response is less accurate at local scales especially for short term inter annual morphological change model performance is limited by the fact that bed composition and stratigraphy cannot be reproduced in detail because they depend on initial conditions and memory effects that are not known precisely nonetheless the model captures the long term decadal scale morphological trend specifically when the system was under a state of morphological disequilibrium caused by navigational dredging the results of the prognostic assessments of shipping regime iii events and climate change in the lpr indicate the impact of these forcings in shaping the equilibrium morphology of such systems propwash generated by ship propellers can cause erosion with the location and magnitude of scour dependent on factors such as vessel draft power applied by the propellers shipping intensity etc in the lpr this impact is apparent in the erosional signal measured in the reach seaward of rm 2 over the 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 periods as well as the projected infill of this reach in the prognostic assessment tending towards an equilibrium profile similar to more landward reaches therefore in the long term shipping represents an additional anthropogenic forcing that can influence the equilibrium morphology of such systems in contrast episodic regime iii events represents a natural erosional forcing that acts to scour and export sediments accumulating in more landward reaches under regimes i and ii in the lpr periods of elevated river flow resulting in higher bed shear stress represent such regime iii events although in other systems episodic wave events could act in a similar manner regime iii events shape the equilibrium morphology by maintaining a cross section that is otherwise deeper than expected based on theory for instance hydrologic changes in the case of the lpr that impact river flow rate represents an example of a change in regime iii events that can impact the equilibrium morphology of such systems finally climate change primarily slr is expected to represent a disequilibrium to the system by reducing the magnitude of currents consequently if sediment supply is maintained the lpr is projected to infill and tend towards the current equilibrium profile based on cross section area to tidal prism relationship overall the results of the prognostic assessments of the lpr are conceptually explainable consistent with theoretical expectations and indicate the general applicability of the morphodynamic modeling framework including morfac and results this implies that the modeling framework can be used to assess the long term and large scale impacts of issues such as hydrologic changes due to dam construction removal changes in navigation climate change etc the present study indicates that morphological upscaling may be deployed in fine sediment systems between episodic erosional events provided that morphological upscaling is applied to sediment mass in the bed in order to represent memory effects the response to episodic erosional events involving erosion of the parent bed underneath the fluff layer cannot be represented with the morfac approach as this response is too non linear because of non linear variations in the availability of mobile sediment this implies that the morphodynamic modeling of rivers under erosion limited conditions requires a thorough analysis of the hydrograph including the recurrence intervals and order of occurrence of the episodic erosional events these inherent uncertainties are reflected directly in the uncertainties of model predictions the results of which should therefore be interpreted accordingly when the system is in a state of morphodynamic disequilibrium the morfac approach is feasible over the long time scales needed to attain equilibrium the model framework presented here specifically the bed structure for parameterizing and representing erosion limited conditions is generally similar to numerical models of such fine sediment systems developed by other authors van maren et al 2015 the model framework is generally applicable to settings with erosion limited transport associated with either consolidation effects in the bed e g in a purely fine sediment system or due to armoring in mixed sediment systems furthermore both settings purely fine sediment and mixed may occur in the same system for instance between the thalweg and adjacent inter tidal areas however such non linearities driving the system response in fine sediment settings implies that appropriate representation of such systems in morphodynamic models requires a significant amount of site specific data describing spatial and temporal variations in key transport parameters these include the erodibility of sediments for the fluff layer and the parent bed sediment stratigraphy temporal trends in erodibility due to consolidation swelling and settling velocities for fine sediments in suspension in practical terms the relatively large data requirements imply that numerical models of fine sediment systems are almost invariably limited by the availability of data for model parameterization and calibration vested et al 2013 these considerations indicate the potential for limitations in numerical models of fine sediment systems while certain limitations e g more spatial discretization of the physical transport processes may be addressed computationally e g using smaller model grid cells others require extensive site specific data for instance conceptually a sediment bed formed by sedimentation in a dredged navigation channel is expected to be more erodible than an undisturbed bed created over millennial timescales similarly a newly deposited sediment bed is expected to consolidate and decrease in erodibility over time both effects can be parameterized by appropriate spatially and temporally comprehensive measurements of erodibility other limitations may require alternate formulations than traditionally implemented in numerical models for instance based on application to data from erosion experiments van prooijen and winterwerp 2010 propose a formulation that includes a gaussian distribution of turbulent bed shear stress a stochastic distribution of τ cr and using dozens of fine sediment classes in contrast typical model formulations characterize the turbulence mean shear stress at the bed water interface and parameterize the mean critical shear stress along with one or at most a few fine sediment classes finally another conceptual and philosophical aspect to consider is that models are schematized and simplified representations of reality model performance responds to the numerical parameterization of various processes that may introduce deviations from reality over the long term in other words the model has its own equilibrium which may or may not be identical to reality such limitations and related uncertainties require consideration when assessing model performance for the application presented in this paper the primary uncertainty is in its performance over the short term and over small spatial scales model performance over the long term and large spatial scales is comparable to data therefore the morphodynamic model framework including the morfac approach presented here is concluded to be suitable for assessing the long term and large scale morphodynamics in fine sediment settings where memory effects and sediment mobility have a strong influence on transport and morphological development however details such as the flow thresholds for periods with and without morphological acceleration the value of fmor etc are system specific and require careful assessment for appropriate representation 7 conclusions morphodynamics of fine sediment systems differ in several key respects from sandy systems in addition to being dependent upon the external forcings which is the case also in sandy systems morphodynamics in fine sediment systems are also a consequence of non equilibrium transport related to sediment mobility and memory effects induced by the time history of morphological development these processes were assessed empirically and used to develop a conceptual picture of sediment dynamics and transport regimes in the lpr mathew and winterwerp 2020 and generally reproduced by the morphodynamic model application presented in this paper furthermore morphological upscaling following the morfac approach and using formulations specifically adapted for fine sediment settings is shown to be an appropriate tool for computationally efficient long term morphodynamic modeling in such systems the morphodynamic model framework using morfac presented here provides a tool for assessing the long term morphodynamics in fine sediment systems for applications such as the design and impact of engineering interventions e g dredging river training works etc impact of climate change development of sediment management strategies etc credit

apparent in the data tidal asymmetry flood dominance in currents the magnitude and intra tidal trends in salinity and ssc the location of the salt front generally in the reach between rm 6 7 and rm 10 2 increasing ssc in the up estuary direction with maximum ssc generally in the reach between rm 6 7 and rm 10 2 in combination with the location of the salt front in this reach this is indicative of the etm location and ssc dynamics within the etm the effect of tidal asymmetry on ssc primarily manifest as higher ssc during flood than during ebb relatively low ssc and relatively low intra tidal variability in ssc at the freshwater tidal station rm 13 5 which is an indication of solids with relatively lower settling velocity entering from the head of tide this is in contrast to the locations within the salt wedge rm 1 4 rm 4 2 rm 6 7 which experience higher intra tidal variability in ssc and indicative of solids with relatively higher settling velocity these spatially varying dynamics are reproduced by the model primarily by having higher settling velocity for solids originating from marine sources as compared to the freshwater sources model performance was also assessed using along channel transects of water depth salinity and ssc within the lpr and within the navigation channel in newark bay fig a 2 shows such a comparison for june 23 2005 and march 16 2010 when river flow rate at dundee dam averaged 8 m3 s regime i conditions and 450 m3 s regime iii return period of 25 years respectively within the lpr the model reproduces major features in the data such as the salt front and its location and the presence of the etm associated with the salt front in addition the model reproduces the difference in ssc values within the etm between the two events with higher ssc during the march 16 2010 event as compared to the june 23 2005 event the measurements of velocity and ssc at the in situ moorings were used to calculate the tidally integrated net ssf at these locations over the years 2009 and 2010 the resulting net ssf shows a relationship with river flow rate as seen from the left panels in fig a 3 a trend that is reproduced by the model as seen in the right panels of fig a 3 statistical metrics quantifying the model data comparisons are also included these include the root mean square error rmse a measure of the error between the model and data as expressed by a 1 r m s e s s f d a t a s s f m o d e l 2 n where ssfdata measured tidally integrated ssf ssfmodel model calculated tidally integrated ssf and n number of pairs of model and data another metric quantifying the model data performance is the relative rmse defined as the rmse relative to the data range the difference between the minimum and maximum measured value within the predominantly estuarine locations rm 1 4 rm 4 2 and rm 6 7 low river flows are associated with net up estuary ssf with net down estuary ssf as river flow increases in contrast net ssf at the freshwater tidal location rm 13 5 is consistently directed down estuary at rm 1 4 during river flows ranging between about 30 150 m3 s model performance is somewhat inconsistent with data the magnitude of net ssf tends to be biased low compared to the data assessment of model performance at rm 4 2 and rm 6 7 over this range of flow rates shows a similar bias at these locations as well this suggests that the model does not calculate enough erosion in the more landward reaches of the lpr this limitation in model performance may partly be related to the time history of events and the ability of the model to capture variations in sediment erodibility at small spatial and temporal scales this is one of the difficulties involved in modeling fine sediment transport in such erosion limited settings furthermore as indicated by mathew and winterwerp 2020 erosion during such conditions which are nominally representative of regime ii is limited to the fluff layer and the transition layer and is therefore less significant from a morphological perspective as compared to regimes i and iii the comparison of large scale flow dependent morphological trends is seen more clearly in fig a 4 which shows the measured and model calculated cumulative starting from the landward end volumetric morphological change over the various time periods overall trends are consistent between the model and data landward of rm 2 the model reproduces the depositional trends in 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 and the erosional trends in 2008 2010 and 2010 2011 similarly seaward of rm 2 the model reproduces the depositional trends in 2008 2010 and 2010 2011 as mentioned previously the erosional trend seaward of rm 2 during 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 is driven by the parameterized shipping scour process during the low flow periods 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 the model calculated magnitude of infill landward of rm 2 is comparable to the data however model performance of erosion landward of rm 2 during the high flow periods 2008 2010 and 2010 2011 is more variable with a bias towards under prediction during the former period and over prediction during the latter period eq a1 potential explanations why the model does not capture local scale changes over inter annual scales include limitations related to various model inputs and formulations bed initial conditions the core profile measurements used to define model initial conditions are somewhat sparse and do not capture the full range of spatial and depth dependent heterogeneity moreover they do not necessarily match the equilibrium solution of the model erodibility the available data for erodibility of the parent bed were conducive to the development of only a single set of erodibility inputs over the entire lpr which is likely to be a simplification of the spatial heterogeneity in reality moreover these may vary over time inducing the memory effects discussed in section 1 grid resolution the resolution of the model grid limited by computation time is not sufficient to resolve small scale features such as bridge support pillars shoreline structures etc which cause local scour during high river flow events with infill of the scoured areas during low river flow conditions shipping induced scour the exact timing and magnitude of this source term is unknown for the model simulations presented here the locations of scour and scour rate were parameterized using the measured bathymetry and the scour rate was assumed to be constant in time all of which are simplified representations of the process consolidation time scales consolidation time scales and their impact on erodibility are not very well characterized both generally as well as specifically in the case of the lpr for instance at initialization the model assumes that sediments in the bed to be fully consolidated and therefore less erodible whereas in reality some surficial sediments may be newly deposited and not fully consolidated i e more erodible flocculation effects although the model includes parameterized approximations of flocculation effects on settling velocity it does not capture the full range of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of this process neither in the sediment bed nor in the water column for example the model only includes two representative floc classes whereas in reality floc sizes and settling velocities are expected to vary over large range 
118,this paper presents a method for constructing approximate semi analytical solutions for the radially symmetric generalized boussinesq equation also known as the porous medium equation pme this work is a further extension of analysis done by telyakovskiy et al 2016 that studied water injection governed by the boussinesq equation into an unconfined initially dry aquifer the newly derived approximate solution also has two parts one to approximate singular behavior near the well and a polynomial part to model far field behavior with the prescribed initial and boundary conditions the analyzed problem can be rewritten in terms of similarity variables resulting in a boundary value problem for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation using higher order physically significant moments of the solution a closed form expression for the position of the wetting front and the shape of the phreatic surface is obtained the introduced solution is valid over a wide range of injection regimes the time independent the power law injection function with positive exponents and exponential law of injection a highly accurate numerical solver similar to telyakovskiy et al 2016 is used to validate the presented approximate solutions plus comparison is made with the experimental data on prediction of the wetting front position for the special case of the boussinesq equation keywords generalized boussinesq equation similarity solutions approximate solutions axisymmetric flow unconfined flow 1 introduction in this paper we consider the generalized boussinesq equation which is also known as the porous medium equation pme in the one dimensional radial setting pme is a nonlinear diffusion equation where the diffusivity is a power law function of the unknown quantity under the dupuit assumption bear 1988 this equation models horizontal flow of water or gas in unconfined aquifers the porous medium equation also governs flows when hydraulic conductivity is a power law function of height rupp and selker 2005 although it is one of the simplest nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations there are multiple instances when the generalized boussinesq equation is used to describe flows through porous media a few potential usages are filtration of water through concretes lockington et al 1999 flows of water through forest soils beven 1982 and filtration of polytropic gases through porous media barenblatt 1952 vazquez 2007 for the radially symmetric case the generalized boussinesq equation can model recharge or drawdown through a well in unconfined aquifers barenblatt et al 1990 neglecting the radius of the well bore the well can be represented as a vertical line source at the boundary of a semi infinite domain in cylindrical coordinates the hydraulic head will have a singularity at a well barenblatt et al 1990 the injection of a fluid into an initially dry unconfined aquifer is studied in this paper in the cylindrically symmetric setting the generalized boussinesq equation was studied in barenblatt 1952 the case of the conventional boussinesq equation was analyzed in chen et al 1995 li et al 2005 mortensen et al 2008 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 and spherical symmetry was studied in mortensen et al 2012 one important feature of the resulting solution is that the wetting front propagates with finite speed as was shown in barenblatt 1952 and barenblatt and vishik 1956 it means our approximate solutions should reflect this fact since linearization techniques for this problem lead to the infinite speed of solution propagation crank 1975 our goal is to obtain approximate solutions to the generalized boussinesq equation for the considered initial and boundary conditions similarity variables can be introduced barenblatt 1952 and the number of independent variables can be reduced by one this results in a boundary value problem for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation our work represents an extension of the analysis done by telyakovskiy et al adv wat resour 96 2016 for the conventional boussinesq equation the approximate solution consists of two parts one part is to capture the singularity at a well and the other is a polynomial portion to replicate behavior near the wetting front to make the form of pme more alike to the boussinesq equation mathematician s pressure vazquez 2007 was introduced also method of moments was used to find the coefficients in the polynomial part earlier the method of moments was used in lockington 1997 prasad and salomon 2005 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 in our work the polynomial part of the solution is represented by quadratic and cubic polynomials the cubic approximation leads to substantially more accurate results and the quadratic approximation is of limited applicability due to higher error unlike telyakovskiy et al 2016 the constructed solution is semi analytical in nature since regression is needed to obtain the correct form of the well portion of the solution we also compare the position of the wetting front predicted by our approximate solution with the experimental results of lyle et al 2005 for the boussinesq equation experiments conducted in lyle et al 2005 were for different relative buoyancies and constant volume fluxes given that all experiments in lyle et al 2005 are similar we make our comparison with only one of them more complicated physical setups were considered in ciriello et al 2016 and di federico et al 2014 for newtonian and non newtonian fluids this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the physical and mathematical features of the problem are introduced along with the original problem being transformed into one which allows for an analytical solution to be developed in section 3 we construct the approximate solutions through the assignment of conditions that each of the two parts as described above must satisfy in section 4 two specific moments are selected and the mathematical equations are listed within section 5 we provide error calculations for the wetting front positions plots of phreatic surfaces using our approximations versus surrogate exact plots level set plot for the admissible region and do comparisons including a comparison with experimental data conclusions are in section 6 where also potential future work is outlined numerical procedure is outlined in appendix a it is a further modification of barenblatt et al 1990 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 method that produces the surrogate exact solution in appendix b exponential injection boundary condition bc is considered which is a limiting regime for the power law injection 2 problem formulation for our work we consider radial flow of fluid from a well bore into a homogeneous isotropic porous medium problem is radially symmetric and the well bore is modeled as a vertical line source since its size is insignificant to the scale of the problem under the dupuit assumptions bear 1988 given that we consider the case of cylindrical symmetry the governing equation will be 1 c h t 1 r r r h k r k 1 r 0 t 0 where c k ε μ ϕ ρ g here r denotes radial distance away from the line source t represents time and table 1 lists other physical parameters in this paper we analyze the recharge of an initially dry aquifer which mathematically implies 2 h r 0 0 r 0 recharge regime at the well is specified as a power law flux function of time such form includes the important case of the recharge happening at a constant rate the same type of boundary condition was considered in barenblatt 1952 in addition to being physically important it allows for the problem to be analyzed analytically the specific form of condition on flux is 3 lim r 0 2 π ϕ r k μ h k r τ t q τ 0 q 0 the injection regime defined by eq 3 is time dependent when q 0 and exponent q has no upper bound in our work the recharge is happening only through the well which implies 4 lim r h r t 0 t 0 the flux boundary condition given by eq 3 is equivalent to the total volume of fluid boundary condition used in di federico et al 2014 ghodgaonkar and christov 2019 and lyle et al 2005 in our notation the total volume of fluid v t will be 5 v t ρ g τ q 1 ε t q 1 the problem given by eqs 1 4 was analyzed earlier in barenblatt 1952 using dimensional analysis which allowed the reduction of the initial boundary value problem for pme to a boundary value problem for a nonlinear ode as a result problem 1 4 can be rewritten in terms of two dimensionless variables below are our choices for the similarity variable ξ and the scaling function g ξ they are consistent with the ones given in barenblatt 1952 6 ξ r 2 π ϕ k μ τ k 1 c q k 1 k k k t q 1 k k 1 2 k 7 g ξ 2 π ϕ k μ τ t q 1 k h r t using 6 7 eq 1 can be rewritten as 8 1 ξ d d ξ ξ d g k d ξ ξ 2 d g d ξ λ g 0 λ q k q k 1 the benefit of the above form is that λ is bounded as q describing the pumping regime increases in the considered interval for q eq 8 does not have an exact solution for the prescribed initial and boundary conditions although when q 1 there would be a solution corresponding to an instantaneous pulse at the origin barenblatt 1952 pratt 2018 this form of the equation is used in appendix b to analyze the limiting regime as q eq 8 is a nonlinear second order ode that requires two conditions to solve rewriting eqs 2 4 in terms of ξ and g ξ we obtain two boundary conditions for the pumping regime we have 9 lim ξ 0 ξ d g k d ξ 1 and for the far field behavior away from the well the condition is 10 lim ξ g ξ 0 it means that instead of problem 1 4 we can consider problem 8 10 in terms of ξ and g ξ there are power law nonlinearities in eqs 8 9 and in general k 1 is a non integer introducing mathematician s pressure see e g vazquez 2007 it is possible to convert 8 to an ode with integer exponents earlier this technique was used in olsen and telyakovskiy 2013 and the change of variables is the following g h 1 k 1 as a result 8 becomes 11 k k 1 h d 2 h d ξ 2 k k 1 k k 1 1 d h d ξ 2 k ξ k 1 h d h d ξ ξ 2 k 1 d h d ξ λ h 0 λ 0 1 k 1 the lower bound on λ corresponds to the time independent case q 0 whereas the upper bound is a limiting regime for the power law injection as found in appendix b the boundary conditions 9 and 10 in terms of h will be 12 lim ξ 0 ξ d h k k 1 d ξ 1 and 13 lim ξ h ξ 0 eq 11 is now an ode with integer exponents the techniques used earlier in lockington et al 2000 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 can be implemented in a manner that suits our problem only they need to be adjusted for the generalized boussinesq equation since before they were used when k 2 3 construction of the approximate solution we reduced the original problem given by eqs 1 4 to the boundary value problem eqs 11 13 using the similarity transformation 6 7 followed by the change of variables now we construct the approximate solution for eqs 11 13 our approach is similar to that of telyakovskiy et al 2016 so the approximation has a component w ξ that replicates the behavior near the well and a polynomial component f ξ to represent the behavior close to the propagation front we look for an approximate solution to the boundary value problem 11 13 in the form 14 h ξ w ξ f ξ in some sense it is like singularity removal approach see e g lowry et al 1989 such technique is commonly used for linear equations as we show later w ξ has singularity when ξ 0 and f ξ is a well behaved term we take two choices for polynomial part f the first when f is quadratic 15 f f q c 2 ξ 2 c 1 ξ c 0 for higher accuracy the second when f is cubic 16 f f c c 3 ξ 3 c 2 ξ 2 c 1 ξ c 0 w and f span the entire domain of ξ so they need to be developed in such a way that each part can model their respective behaviors while also not hindering the ability of the other part to accurately model its bc moreover their sum also needs to satisfy the bc s of the solution to illustrate while the well component w is responsible for replicating the behavior as ξ 0 it also should not violate the bc at the far field which f represents so that the approximating function h w f satisfies all bcs additionally we note that in barenblatt 1952 it was shown that solutions propagate with finite speed by using the method of characteristics later barenblatt and vishik 1956 provided a more rigorous proof it means that for the problem considered in this paper there exists a propagation front position ξ 0 beyond which the solution vanishes as determined by barenblatt 1952 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 mathematically this implies the following conditions on h ξ when ξ 0 17 h ξ 0 for 0 ξ ξ 0 h ξ 0 for ξ ξ 0 where the value of ξ 0 is not known ahead of time therefore in our work we need to focus only on the interval ξ 0 ξ 0 our method provides accurate estimates for the position of the wetting front ξ 0 this quantity is one of the benchmarks used to validate our approximate solutions using the highly accurate numerical solver described in appendix a and experimentally with the work of lyle et al 2005 3 1 derivation of well component of the solution w ξ now we analyze the structure of the solution near the well eq 12 indicates that there is a singularity in the solution as ξ 0 integrating 12 we obtain the asymptotic behavior near the well that will be the general form for the well component w ξ of the approximate solution 18 lim ξ 0 h ξ w ξ ln 1 ξ const k 1 k although the function w models the behavior at the well i e when ξ 0 we demand that it also matches the boundary condition at ξ ξ 0 since both w and f are used at all the points in ξ 0 ξ 0 given that we demand that w ξ 0 0 equation eq 18 that represents the well portion of the solution will become 19 w ξ ln ξ 0 ξ k 1 k the above equation replicates the proper asymptotic behavior at the well and reproduces the correct value w ξ 0 0 at the boundary ξ ξ 0 expression for w appearing here is a generalization to the one appearing in telyakovskiy et al 2016 similarly to telyakovskiy et al 2016 it can be shown that lim ξ ξ 0 d d ξ w ξ to make the derivative finite as ξ ξ 0 we modify the factor used in telyakovskiy et al 2016 so w will look like 20 w ξ ln ξ 0 ξ k 1 k 1 a ξ ξ 0 while in telyakovskiy et al 2016 a 1 and from eq 20 it follows that lim ξ ξ 0 d d ξ w ξ 0 the new form of the well term given by eq 20 satisfies the same boundary condition eq 12 this can be checked by direct substitution weighting factor a was developed using regression techniques with the highly accurate numerical solver providing the position of the wetting front ξ 0 for desired parameters k and λ in doing this regression one time yielded a that can be utilized over a wide range of physically meaningful parameters and it strengthens the semi analytical work of this study working backwards an ideal discrete value of a was obtained which weights the modifying factor of eq 20 to guarantee that our approximation eq 14 yields an appropriate wetting front position sampling several discrete values of a over parameters k and λ the regression led to the following form for a 21 a ln k 20 1 1 k λ while obtaining this form of a required solving the problem a number of times the end result given by eq 21 is simple easy to use and accurate over a wide range of parameters moreover as it will be seen in later sections this semi analytical solution is highly accurate and can be used in any physically meaningful application unlike telyakovskiy et al 2016 with the insertion of 21 to the modifying factor eq 20 it is possible that w ξ 0 for certain values of k and λ it is not a problem since the requirement that h ξ w ξ f ξ 0 holds for k and λ considered in this work when ξ 0 ξ 0 3 2 derivation of wetting front component of the solution f ξ the conditions placed upon the polynomials f ξ given by eqs 15 16 are similar to the ones in lockington et al 2000 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 these conditions are used to find the coefficients c 3 c 2 c 1 and c 0 of the approximating polynomials the component w replicates the behavior of the true solution as ξ 0 so the polynomial part f can be set equal to 0 at ξ 0 additionally to match the boundary condition at the front given by eq 17 the polynomial part f is also set equal to 0 at ξ ξ 0 therefore the boundary conditions at ξ 0 and ξ ξ 0 are 22 c1 f 0 0 23 c2 f ξ 0 0 the third condition is obtained by using eq 11 and considering ξ ξ 0 we obtain the value for d d ξ h ξ 0 this quantity characterizes the instantaneous change in h ξ at the propagation front from eq 11 it follows that d d ξ h ξ 0 is finite and we demand that the approximating polynomial replicates the correct value of the derivative at the front so by evaluating eq 11 when ξ ξ 0 we have 24 c3 d d ξ f ξ 0 d d ξ h ξ 0 ξ 0 k 1 2 k the above conditions c1 c3 defined by eqs 22 24 allow for the determination of the three coefficients c 2 c 1 and c 0 for eqs 15 16 utilizing conditions c1 c3 the approximations for f q f c are f q k 1 2 k ξ ξ 0 ξ 2 f c c 3 ξ ξ ξ 0 2 k 1 2 k ξ ξ 0 ξ 2 where c 3 and ξ 0 still need to be determined we observe that f c can be rewritten in terms of f q as 25 f c c 3 ξ ξ ξ 0 2 f q therefore the approximate solution where h ξ w f c will be 26 h ln ξ 0 ξ k 1 k 1 a ξ ξ 0 c 3 ξ ξ ξ 0 2 k 1 2 k ξ ξ 0 ξ 2 the above expression contains the unknown position of the propagation front ξ 0 and coefficient c 3 that need to be found it requires two additional conditions to obtain the quadratic approximation we simply set c 3 0 then just one more condition is needed to find ξ 0 4 moment equations the moment equations were used previously in barenblatt 1952 1954a and telyakovskiy et al 2016 to characterize the properties of the solutions here they are used to construct the approximate solutions by providing a way to obtain unknowns ξ 0 and c 3 in eq 26 first moment equation can be obtained by multiplying eq 11 by ξ and integrating over the domain 0 ξ 0 acting similarly higher order moment equations are obtained by multiplying the same ode eq 11 by ξ 1 m where m 1 is an integer then we again integrate over the domain 0 ξ 0 these higher order moments reflect other properties of the solution profile such as the moment of inertia and skewness depending on the selected value of m the equation for the higher order moments is 27 k k 1 ξ 1 m h d h d ξ ξ 0 1 2 k 1 ξ 2 m h ξ 0 m k k 1 0 ξ 0 ξ m h d h d ξ d ξ k k 1 k k 1 2 0 ξ 0 ξ 1 m d h d ξ 2 d ξ 2 m 2 k 1 λ 0 ξ 0 ξ 1 m h d ξ 0 it is advantageous to use lower moment equations in finding ξ 0 and c 3 since the integrals can be calculated easier due to the smaller powers of ξ in pratt 2018 appendices 11 3 11 5 it is shown that the first order moment has an invalid boundary term for values of k 2 whereas for the higher order moments the boundary terms are equal to zero therefore we select the specific values of m 1 2 to utilize the 2nd and 3rd order moment equations to find ξ 0 and c 3 the moment equations are 28 m2 k k 1 0 ξ 0 ξ h d h d ξ d ξ k k 1 k k 1 2 0 ξ 0 ξ 2 d h d ξ 2 d ξ 3 2 k 1 λ 0 ξ 0 ξ 2 h d ξ 0 m3 2 k k 1 0 ξ 0 ξ 2 h d h d ξ d ξ k k 1 k k 1 2 0 ξ 0 ξ 3 d h d ξ 2 d ξ 2 k 1 λ 0 ξ 0 ξ 3 h d ξ 0 setting c 3 0 in the approximating function eq 26 and substituting into m2 we are able to find the position of the wetting front ξ 0 using newly found ξ 0 in eq 26 gives the profile of the propagating substance when f is given by eq 15 if f is given by eq 16 we substitute eq 26 in both m2 and m3 it results in a system of equations for ξ 0 and c 3 using found parameters results in a cubic polynomial approximation for the profile and we show later that the cubic polynomial approximation is substantially more accurate compared to the quadratic although it is more difficult to derive the calculations pertinent to the substitution of eq 26 into moment equations eq 28 are available upon request 5 results using the highly accurate numerical solver developed in appendix a we obtain surrogate exact values for the position of the wetting front ξ 0 and the profile of the scaling function g ξ these numerical benchmarks give two ways to gauge the accuracy of the approximate solution presented in the prior section we calculate percentage errors in ξ 0 for different values of parameters and substituting ξ 0 and c 3 into the approximate scaling function we plot few figures to assess the accuracy of g ξ 5 1 effect of λ and k on ξ 0 and g ξ solution to our boundary value problem eqs 8 10 depends on two parameters the nonlinearity k of the equation and the pumping regime q together k and q form λ q k q k 1 see eq 8 and as discussed in appendix b λ 0 1 k 1 for purposes of analysis it is convenient to use k and λ on fig 1 we can see the changes in the form of the scaling function g ξ and shift in the position of the wetting front ξ 0 as k increases from k 1 5 to k 8 0 while λ stays fixed as expected the cubic approximate solution approximates the surrogate exact solution much better than the quadratic one both approximations are given by eq 26 and raised to the 1 k 1 power since we used mathematician s pressure vazquez 2007 defined earlier as g h 1 k 1 for the quadratic approximation c 3 0 while for the cubic c 3 0 another observation to be made is that the profile changes from concave up to concave down away from the well as nonlinearity k increases for λ 0 a concave up profile is present for k 1 2 whereas for k 2 a concave down profile forms near the propagation front the boussinesq equation case k 2 is studied in telyakovskiy et al 2016 and for this value of k the concavity switches table 2 compares the calculated position of the wetting front ξ 0 for different nonlinearity k values and fixed λ 0 the surrogate exact values are found using the modified numerical procedure of telyakovskiy et al 2016 extended to our case in appendix a this and more complicated problems can also be analyzed with the numerical procedure introduced in ghodgaonkar and christov 2019 in our case values of ξ 0 for quadratic and cubic approximations are obtained when the approximate solution given by eq 26 is substituted into m 2 and m 3 moment equations in eq 28 from table 2 we can see that the quadratic approximation for mid range values of k 2 produce adequate approximations for ξ 0 this approximation however is not able to accommodate for the highly concave up behavior away from the well for the low k 1 or highly concave down behavior as k increases the cubic approximation produces more accurate results with accuracy within 1 for k 1 5 30 0 when λ 0 we note that the cubic approximation is substantially more accurate and encompasses a wider range of k values it requires more complicated calculations but it is the recommended approach fig 2 shows the changes caused by varying the parameter λ for fixed k in our work we consider interval when λ 0 1 k 1 so plots in fig 2 are at the endpoints of the admissible λ interval when k 1 5 we again observe that the cubic approximation better matches the highly accurate numerical solution also from fig 2 we observe that as λ increases the wetting front position ξ 0 decreases while the profile gets steeper as ξ 0 similarly to table 2 in table 3 we present the calculated positions of the wetting front ξ 0 for different λ values and fixed k 1 5 the quadratic approximation is inaccurate when k is low whereas the cubic approximation maintains error within 1 over the entire range of λ 0 2 case of k 2 is considered in more detail in section 5 3 5 2 level sets for ξ 0 to further visualize the structure of the solutions we construct the level sets for ξ 0 i e curves in λ k plane where f λ k ξ 0 constant here the admissible region is specified by λ 0 1 k 1 and k 1 in fig 3 the level sets for ξ 0 1 50 1 65 1 90 2 25 are plotted plus this figure shows the region in terms of λ and k considered in this work the admissible region is bounded by k 1 λ 0 and λ 1 k 1 for pme it is required that k 1 since k 1 represents the linear diffusion equation here the region 0 λ 1 k 1 represents the power law flux boundary condition λ 0 is the time independent case and λ 1 k 1 is the exponential boundary condition case analyzed in appendix b as expected when k 1 values of ξ 0 increase since k 1 corresponds to the linear diffusion equation whose solutions have infinite speed of propagation i e ξ 0 solid line at k 2 corresponds to the boussinesq equation analyzed in telyakovskiy et al 2016 with asterisk at point λ k 0 5 2 the asterisk is the point at which level set curve for ξ 0 1 90 crosses k 2 and essentially the same value for ξ 0 was obtained in telyakovskiy et al 2016 when λ 0 5 5 3 comparisons our work is a further extension of the problem considered in telyakovskiy et al 2016 so it is natural to make comparison to the special pme case k 2 considered in telyakovskiy et al 2016 for the most part our approach is the same but there are some differences which allow for the approximations to be valid for all nonlinearities k 1 the first change comes from the ansantz term that modifies w ξ to prevent lim ξ ξ 0 d d ξ w ξ from happening in eq 26 in this work the a parameter defined by eq 21 depends on λ and k this allows for the approximating function to be weighted appropriately additionally in this work we use the higher order moments m 2 and m 3 defined by eq 28 instead of the first moment and the second moment used for calculations in telyakovskiy et al 2016 the relative error calculated by our quadratic approximation for k 2 is in the range 0 86 1 47 see table 4 this is an improvement compared to the range of 7 48 4 65 calculated in telyakovskiy et al 2016 for the cubic approximation the relative error was found to be within 0 478 2 473 in telyakovskiy et al 2016 and 0 59 1 06 with the calculations of this paper for λ 0 0 0 5 the work in telyakovskiy et al 2016 provides more accurate cubic approximations for ξ 0 while for λ 0 5 1 0 the present work is more accurate other approaches to construct approximate analytical solutions when k 2 can be found in di federico et al 2012 and li et al 2005 both papers make a different choice for similarity variable and scaling function compared with the present work in their work ξ 0 1 and it is possible to directly obtain numerical solution by integrating from wetting front that is at 1 towards 0 that selection of variables makes the moments of solution unknown quantities it is not surprising since we consider the free boundary problem and something should be unknown in our work the position of the front ξ 0 is unknown in di federico et al 2012 the singularity at the well is merged with series expansion at the wetting front through perturbation approach and an intermediate solution is obtained whereas in li et al 2005 solution is constructed in terms of the square of their scaling function again the series expansion at the front that is in terms of the square of their similarity variable is combined with singularity at well the main difference is that series is in terms of square of similarity variable and contribution of singularity at the front is subtracted while in this paper we augment the contribution of singularity by polynomial portion of solution that satisfies certain conditions at the boundaries and related moments the additional ansantz factor is needed to decrease the effect of singularity at the wetting front these are the main differences between this work and approaches in di federico et al 2012 and li et al 2005 from the authors of lyle et al 2005 we obtained data measuring the position of the wetting front for their experiment 3 experiment 3 is the case of the classical boussinesq equation with a constant pumping regime in our terms it would correspond to q 0 and k 2 in order to make the comparison with our approximate solution we set values for the following parameters ρ 1039 kg m 3 ϕ 6 9 1 0 9 m 2 ε 0 37 μ 0 001098 kg m s and τ 3 063 1 0 9 which can be found through using eq 5 additionally we use the reduced gravity equation g g δ ρ ρ 0 4 m s 2 to reflect saline fluid displacement of fresh water lyle et al 2005 regression on position of the wetting front from experimental data was performed and we obtained r t 0 0361 t 0 469 whereas the wetting front for our approximate solution eq 6 resulted in r t 0 0364 t 0 5 with r being in meters difference in exponent likely results from some phenomena that are unaccounted by simplified model like capillary forces lyle et al 2005 a more complicated setting was experimentally studied in ciriello et al 2016 6 conclusions we considered injection problems to an initially dry unconfined aquifer when the radially symmetric generalized boussinesq equation or pme is used to describe the shape of the phreatic surface under the dupuit assumption two new approximate solutions were constructed one is based on a quadratic approximation for the far field behavior while the second one relies on a cubic approximation presented solutions are valid for all power law nonlinearities appearing in pme and for a variety of injection regimes including the time independent case i e constant rate of injection the power law rate of injection and the limiting case of the exponential rate of injection analyzed problems allow for the introduction of self similar variables and reduction of the initial boundary value problem for the nonlinear generalized boussinesq equation to a boundary value problem for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation presented solutions consist of two parts one that models singular behavior at a well while the second one uses a polynomial approximation for the far field profile unlike the case of the conventional boussinesq equation analyzed in telyakovskiy et al 2016 the logarithmically asymptotic term representing behavior near the well needed to be weighted in a special way to account for the nonlinearity of pme and the pumping regime just like in telyakovskiy et al 2016 moment equations are used to find all the coefficients in the polynomial part of the solution only higher order moments are used to negate the boundary components that cause the solution to blow up see pratt 2018 both quadratic and cubic approximations give accurate results for the position of the wetting front and the form of the phreatic surface the accuracy of the quadratic approximation decreases as the nonlinearity diverge from the conventional boussinesq equation as expected the cubic approximation leads to higher accuracy in the position of the wetting front and the form of the phreatic surface testing over the wide range of nonlinearities in pme and a variety of pumping regimes we observed that the cubic approximation predicts the positions of the wetting front typically within 1 of the true values so the cubic approximation is recommended for any practical application over the quadratic approximation although the case of the boussinesq equation k 2 is modeled well by both approximations we also compared our approximate position of the wetting front for the boussinesq equation with experimental data of lyle et al 2005 comparison is favorable more accurate results can be obtained by taking higher degree polynomials like the fourth degree polynomial to model far field behavior but that would require the usage of one more moment equation it would also lead to a system of three equations and the additional computational cost would be substantial so the approximation will be harder to use further extension of this work could be the analysis of pme in fractal dimensions which would represent the flow of fluid in fracture networks such extension would involve the construction of an effective weighting factor in the singular part of the solution and assuring that the moment equations can be solved credit authorship contribution statement phillip a pratt methodology software validation writing original

procedure of barenblatt 1954a and barenblatt et al 1990 that was further improved in telyakovskiy et al 2016 the numerical solver was adjusted for general nonlinearities k 1 in pme similarly to telyakovskiy et al 2016 h a ξ is a solution to eq 11 in which the propagation front terminates at ξ 1 the solution h a ξ also has the derivative value of k 1 2 k at the front as follows from 24 plus h a 1 0 writing 11 as a system of first order equations runge kutta method can be applied starting from ξ 1 towards ξ 0 given that the system is singular at ξ 1 the taylor expansion is used to step away from ξ 1 as a result we obtain solution values for h a ξ in the direction of ξ 0 to recover the solution in terms of the original scaling function g ξ recall mathematician s pressure rescaling g a h a 1 k 1 as in barenblatt 1954a barenblatt et al 1990 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 the method presented below requires the calculation of a term denoted as n λ n λ represents an estimate to ξ d g a k d ξ as ξ 0 that is rescaled to match bc eq 9 for any k 1 direct calculations of n λ is strongly affected by the fact that g a is singular at ξ 0 to decrease the effect of the singularity eq 8 expressed in terms of g a is multiplied by ξ and integrated over z 1 taking the limit as z 0 results in the value of n λ a 1 n λ lim z 0 ξ d g a k ξ d ξ ξ z lim z 0 1 λ z 1 ξ g a ξ d ξ z 2 g a z 2 this approach was used earlier in telyakovskiy et al 2016 the integral on the right hand side is calculated using any basic integration technique additionally for all σ 0 eqs 8 and 10 are invariant under the following transformation see barenblatt 1952 a 2 g b ξ σ 2 k 1 g a σ ξ where g a is a solution of eq 8 that satisfies eq 10 using eq a 1 the above invariance equation and bc eq 9 we obtain a 3 lim ξ 0 ξ d g b k ξ d ξ lim ξ 0 σ 2 k k 1 σ ξ d g a k σ ξ d σ ξ σ 2 k k 1 n λ 1 so function g b satisfies bc eq 9 for all k 1 if we take a 4 σ n λ k 1 2 k the same scaling gives the actual value of ξ 0 by setting σ ξ 0 1 so for the propagation front we have a 5 ξ 0 1 σ n λ k 1 2 k it means that the final expression for the scaling function in eq a 2 is a 6 g ξ n λ 1 k g a ξ n λ k 1 2 k the value of ξ 0 given by eq a 5 is used as the surrogate exact value for the comparisons made in this paper likewise the presented graphs of the numerical solutions are obtained with the runge kutta procedure that were later scaled according to eq a 6 to satisfy boundary condition eq 9 appendix b exponential flux bc in section 2 it was noted that the exponent q appearing in the pumping regime in the original boundary condition eq 3 has no upper bound the limiting case when q corresponds to the original pme problem where the pumping regime is modeled by an exponential function versus the power law function see e g barenblatt 1954b barenblatt et al 1990 li et al 2005 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 the pme problem to be solved is b 1 c h t 1 r r r h k r k 1 r 0 t 0 lim r 0 2 π ϕ r k μ h k r r t h 0 e q t h 0 0 q 0 lim r h r t 0 t 0 h r 0 0 r 0 the application of dimensional analysis leads to three dimensionless variables this number is reduced to two dimensionless variables if in addition to the similarity reduction a time translation transformation is applied as outlined in barenblatt 1954b and barenblatt et al 1990 it allows for the introduction of similarity variable ξ 2 and scaling function g 2 ξ 2 as b 2 ξ 2 r 2 π ϕ k h 0 e q t μ k 1 q c k 1 k k 1 2 k b 3 g 2 ξ 2 2 π ϕ k h 0 e q t μ 1 k h r t substituting eqs b 2 b 3 in eq b 1 the initial boundary value problem becomes b 4 1 ξ

boundary value problem eqs 8 10 when λ λ m a x 1 k 1 and represents the pumping regime q we can see from table b 5 that as k representing nonlinearity of the problem increases the maximum λ approaches zero it is expected since we just have shown that λ m a x 1 k 1 to summarize the time independent regime corresponds to λ 0 for k 1 interval λ 0 1 k 1 represent polynomial law injection the exponential law injection regime is given by λ λ m a x 1 k 1 this means that the admissible range for parameter λ is λ 0 1 k 1 for k 1 and the polynomial based approximate solution eq 26 can be used for all these values 
118,this paper presents a method for constructing approximate semi analytical solutions for the radially symmetric generalized boussinesq equation also known as the porous medium equation pme this work is a further extension of analysis done by telyakovskiy et al 2016 that studied water injection governed by the boussinesq equation into an unconfined initially dry aquifer the newly derived approximate solution also has two parts one to approximate singular behavior near the well and a polynomial part to model far field behavior with the prescribed initial and boundary conditions the analyzed problem can be rewritten in terms of similarity variables resulting in a boundary value problem for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation using higher order physically significant moments of the solution a closed form expression for the position of the wetting front and the shape of the phreatic surface is obtained the introduced solution is valid over a wide range of injection regimes the time independent the power law injection function with positive exponents and exponential law of injection a highly accurate numerical solver similar to telyakovskiy et al 2016 is used to validate the presented approximate solutions plus comparison is made with the experimental data on prediction of the wetting front position for the special case of the boussinesq equation keywords generalized boussinesq equation similarity solutions approximate solutions axisymmetric flow unconfined flow 1 introduction in this paper we consider the generalized boussinesq equation which is also known as the porous medium equation pme in the one dimensional radial setting pme is a nonlinear diffusion equation where the diffusivity is a power law function of the unknown quantity under the dupuit assumption bear 1988 this equation models horizontal flow of water or gas in unconfined aquifers the porous medium equation also governs flows when hydraulic conductivity is a power law function of height rupp and selker 2005 although it is one of the simplest nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations there are multiple instances when the generalized boussinesq equation is used to describe flows through porous media a few potential usages are filtration of water through concretes lockington et al 1999 flows of water through forest soils beven 1982 and filtration of polytropic gases through porous media barenblatt 1952 vazquez 2007 for the radially symmetric case the generalized boussinesq equation can model recharge or drawdown through a well in unconfined aquifers barenblatt et al 1990 neglecting the radius of the well bore the well can be represented as a vertical line source at the boundary of a semi infinite domain in cylindrical coordinates the hydraulic head will have a singularity at a well barenblatt et al 1990 the injection of a fluid into an initially dry unconfined aquifer is studied in this paper in the cylindrically symmetric setting the generalized boussinesq equation was studied in barenblatt 1952 the case of the conventional boussinesq equation was analyzed in chen et al 1995 li et al 2005 mortensen et al 2008 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 and spherical symmetry was studied in mortensen et al 2012 one important feature of the resulting solution is that the wetting front propagates with finite speed as was shown in barenblatt 1952 and barenblatt and vishik 1956 it means our approximate solutions should reflect this fact since linearization techniques for this problem lead to the infinite speed of solution propagation crank 1975 our goal is to obtain approximate solutions to the generalized boussinesq equation for the considered initial and boundary conditions similarity variables can be introduced barenblatt 1952 and the number of independent variables can be reduced by one this results in a boundary value problem for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation our work represents an extension of the analysis done by telyakovskiy et al adv wat resour 96 2016 for the conventional boussinesq equation the approximate solution consists of two parts one part is to capture the singularity at a well and the other is a polynomial portion to replicate behavior near the wetting front to make the form of pme more alike to the boussinesq equation mathematician s pressure vazquez 2007 was introduced also method of moments was used to find the coefficients in the polynomial part earlier the method of moments was used in lockington 1997 prasad and salomon 2005 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 in our work the polynomial part of the solution is represented by quadratic and cubic polynomials the cubic approximation leads to substantially more accurate results and the quadratic approximation is of limited applicability due to higher error unlike telyakovskiy et al 2016 the constructed solution is semi analytical in nature since regression is needed to obtain the correct form of the well portion of the solution we also compare the position of the wetting front predicted by our approximate solution with the experimental results of lyle et al 2005 for the boussinesq equation experiments conducted in lyle et al 2005 were for different relative buoyancies and constant volume fluxes given that all experiments in lyle et al 2005 are similar we make our comparison with only one of them more complicated physical setups were considered in ciriello et al 2016 and di federico et al 2014 for newtonian and non newtonian fluids this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the physical and mathematical features of the problem are introduced along with the original problem being transformed into one which allows for an analytical solution to be developed in section 3 we construct the approximate solutions through the assignment of conditions that each of the two parts as described above must satisfy in section 4 two specific moments are selected and the mathematical equations are listed within section 5 we provide error calculations for the wetting front positions plots of phreatic surfaces using our approximations versus surrogate exact plots level set plot for the admissible region and do comparisons including a comparison with experimental data conclusions are in section 6 where also potential future work is outlined numerical procedure is outlined in appendix a it is a further modification of barenblatt et al 1990 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 method that produces the surrogate exact solution in appendix b exponential injection boundary condition bc is considered which is a limiting regime for the power law injection 2 problem formulation for our work we consider radial flow of fluid from a well bore into a homogeneous isotropic porous medium problem is radially symmetric and the well bore is modeled as a vertical line source since its size is insignificant to the scale of the problem under the dupuit assumptions bear 1988 given that we consider the case of cylindrical symmetry the governing equation will be 1 c h t 1 r r r h k r k 1 r 0 t 0 where c k ε μ ϕ ρ g here r denotes radial distance away from the line source t represents time and table 1 lists other physical parameters in this paper we analyze the recharge of an initially dry aquifer which mathematically implies 2 h r 0 0 r 0 recharge regime at the well is specified as a power law flux function of time such form includes the important case of the recharge happening at a constant rate the same type of boundary condition was considered in barenblatt 1952 in addition to being physically important it allows for the problem to be analyzed analytically the specific form of condition on flux is 3 lim r 0 2 π ϕ r k μ h k r τ t q τ 0 q 0 the injection regime defined by eq 3 is time dependent when q 0 and exponent q has no upper bound in our work the recharge is happening only through the well which implies 4 lim r h r t 0 t 0 the flux boundary condition given by eq 3 is equivalent to the total volume of fluid boundary condition used in di federico et al 2014 ghodgaonkar and christov 2019 and lyle et al 2005 in our notation the total volume of fluid v t will be 5 v t ρ g τ q 1 ε t q 1 the problem given by eqs 1 4 was analyzed earlier in barenblatt 1952 using dimensional analysis which allowed the reduction of the initial boundary value problem for pme to a boundary value problem for a nonlinear ode as a result problem 1 4 can be rewritten in terms of two dimensionless variables below are our choices for the similarity variable ξ and the scaling function g ξ they are consistent with the ones given in barenblatt 1952 6 ξ r 2 π ϕ k μ τ k 1 c q k 1 k k k t q 1 k k 1 2 k 7 g ξ 2 π ϕ k μ τ t q 1 k h r t using 6 7 eq 1 can be rewritten as 8 1 ξ d d ξ ξ d g k d ξ ξ 2 d g d ξ λ g 0 λ q k q k 1 the benefit of the above form is that λ is bounded as q describing the pumping regime increases in the considered interval for q eq 8 does not have an exact solution for the prescribed initial and boundary conditions although when q 1 there would be a solution corresponding to an instantaneous pulse at the origin barenblatt 1952 pratt 2018 this form of the equation is used in appendix b to analyze the limiting regime as q eq 8 is a nonlinear second order ode that requires two conditions to solve rewriting eqs 2 4 in terms of ξ and g ξ we obtain two boundary conditions for the pumping regime we have 9 lim ξ 0 ξ d g k d ξ 1 and for the far field behavior away from the well the condition is 10 lim ξ g ξ 0 it means that instead of problem 1 4 we can consider problem 8 10 in terms of ξ and g ξ there are power law nonlinearities in eqs 8 9 and in general k 1 is a non integer introducing mathematician s pressure see e g vazquez 2007 it is possible to convert 8 to an ode with integer exponents earlier this technique was used in olsen and telyakovskiy 2013 and the change of variables is the following g h 1 k 1 as a result 8 becomes 11 k k 1 h d 2 h d ξ 2 k k 1 k k 1 1 d h d ξ 2 k ξ k 1 h d h d ξ ξ 2 k 1 d h d ξ λ h 0 λ 0 1 k 1 the lower bound on λ corresponds to the time independent case q 0 whereas the upper bound is a limiting regime for the power law injection as found in appendix b the boundary conditions 9 and 10 in terms of h will be 12 lim ξ 0 ξ d h k k 1 d ξ 1 and 13 lim ξ h ξ 0 eq 11 is now an ode with integer exponents the techniques used earlier in lockington et al 2000 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 can be implemented in a manner that suits our problem only they need to be adjusted for the generalized boussinesq equation since before they were used when k 2 3 construction of the approximate solution we reduced the original problem given by eqs 1 4 to the boundary value problem eqs 11 13 using the similarity transformation 6 7 followed by the change of variables now we construct the approximate solution for eqs 11 13 our approach is similar to that of telyakovskiy et al 2016 so the approximation has a component w ξ that replicates the behavior near the well and a polynomial component f ξ to represent the behavior close to the propagation front we look for an approximate solution to the boundary value problem 11 13 in the form 14 h ξ w ξ f ξ in some sense it is like singularity removal approach see e g lowry et al 1989 such technique is commonly used for linear equations as we show later w ξ has singularity when ξ 0 and f ξ is a well behaved term we take two choices for polynomial part f the first when f is quadratic 15 f f q c 2 ξ 2 c 1 ξ c 0 for higher accuracy the second when f is cubic 16 f f c c 3 ξ 3 c 2 ξ 2 c 1 ξ c 0 w and f span the entire domain of ξ so they need to be developed in such a way that each part can model their respective behaviors while also not hindering the ability of the other part to accurately model its bc moreover their sum also needs to satisfy the bc s of the solution to illustrate while the well component w is responsible for replicating the behavior as ξ 0 it also should not violate the bc at the far field which f represents so that the approximating function h w f satisfies all bcs additionally we note that in barenblatt 1952 it was shown that solutions propagate with finite speed by using the method of characteristics later barenblatt and vishik 1956 provided a more rigorous proof it means that for the problem considered in this paper there exists a propagation front position ξ 0 beyond which the solution vanishes as determined by barenblatt 1952 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 mathematically this implies the following conditions on h ξ when ξ 0 17 h ξ 0 for 0 ξ ξ 0 h ξ 0 for ξ ξ 0 where the value of ξ 0 is not known ahead of time therefore in our work we need to focus only on the interval ξ 0 ξ 0 our method provides accurate estimates for the position of the wetting front ξ 0 this quantity is one of the benchmarks used to validate our approximate solutions using the highly accurate numerical solver described in appendix a and experimentally with the work of lyle et al 2005 3 1 derivation of well component of the solution w ξ now we analyze the structure of the solution near the well eq 12 indicates that there is a singularity in the solution as ξ 0 integrating 12 we obtain the asymptotic behavior near the well that will be the general form for the well component w ξ of the approximate solution 18 lim ξ 0 h ξ w ξ ln 1 ξ const k 1 k although the function w models the behavior at the well i e when ξ 0 we demand that it also matches the boundary condition at ξ ξ 0 since both w and f are used at all the points in ξ 0 ξ 0 given that we demand that w ξ 0 0 equation eq 18 that represents the well portion of the solution will become 19 w ξ ln ξ 0 ξ k 1 k the above equation replicates the proper asymptotic behavior at the well and reproduces the correct value w ξ 0 0 at the boundary ξ ξ 0 expression for w appearing here is a generalization to the one appearing in telyakovskiy et al 2016 similarly to telyakovskiy et al 2016 it can be shown that lim ξ ξ 0 d d ξ w ξ to make the derivative finite as ξ ξ 0 we modify the factor used in telyakovskiy et al 2016 so w will look like 20 w ξ ln ξ 0 ξ k 1 k 1 a ξ ξ 0 while in telyakovskiy et al 2016 a 1 and from eq 20 it follows that lim ξ ξ 0 d d ξ w ξ 0 the new form of the well term given by eq 20 satisfies the same boundary condition eq 12 this can be checked by direct substitution weighting factor a was developed using regression techniques with the highly accurate numerical solver providing the position of the wetting front ξ 0 for desired parameters k and λ in doing this regression one time yielded a that can be utilized over a wide range of physically meaningful parameters and it strengthens the semi analytical work of this study working backwards an ideal discrete value of a was obtained which weights the modifying factor of eq 20 to guarantee that our approximation eq 14 yields an appropriate wetting front position sampling several discrete values of a over parameters k and λ the regression led to the following form for a 21 a ln k 20 1 1 k λ while obtaining this form of a required solving the problem a number of times the end result given by eq 21 is simple easy to use and accurate over a wide range of parameters moreover as it will be seen in later sections this semi analytical solution is highly accurate and can be used in any physically meaningful application unlike telyakovskiy et al 2016 with the insertion of 21 to the modifying factor eq 20 it is possible that w ξ 0 for certain values of k and λ it is not a problem since the requirement that h ξ w ξ f ξ 0 holds for k and λ considered in this work when ξ 0 ξ 0 3 2 derivation of wetting front component of the solution f ξ the conditions placed upon the polynomials f ξ given by eqs 15 16 are similar to the ones in lockington et al 2000 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 these conditions are used to find the coefficients c 3 c 2 c 1 and c 0 of the approximating polynomials the component w replicates the behavior of the true solution as ξ 0 so the polynomial part f can be set equal to 0 at ξ 0 additionally to match the boundary condition at the front given by eq 17 the polynomial part f is also set equal to 0 at ξ ξ 0 therefore the boundary conditions at ξ 0 and ξ ξ 0 are 22 c1 f 0 0 23 c2 f ξ 0 0 the third condition is obtained by using eq 11 and considering ξ ξ 0 we obtain the value for d d ξ h ξ 0 this quantity characterizes the instantaneous change in h ξ at the propagation front from eq 11 it follows that d d ξ h ξ 0 is finite and we demand that the approximating polynomial replicates the correct value of the derivative at the front so by evaluating eq 11 when ξ ξ 0 we have 24 c3 d d ξ f ξ 0 d d ξ h ξ 0 ξ 0 k 1 2 k the above conditions c1 c3 defined by eqs 22 24 allow for the determination of the three coefficients c 2 c 1 and c 0 for eqs 15 16 utilizing conditions c1 c3 the approximations for f q f c are f q k 1 2 k ξ ξ 0 ξ 2 f c c 3 ξ ξ ξ 0 2 k 1 2 k ξ ξ 0 ξ 2 where c 3 and ξ 0 still need to be determined we observe that f c can be rewritten in terms of f q as 25 f c c 3 ξ ξ ξ 0 2 f q therefore the approximate solution where h ξ w f c will be 26 h ln ξ 0 ξ k 1 k 1 a ξ ξ 0 c 3 ξ ξ ξ 0 2 k 1 2 k ξ ξ 0 ξ 2 the above expression contains the unknown position of the propagation front ξ 0 and coefficient c 3 that need to be found it requires two additional conditions to obtain the quadratic approximation we simply set c 3 0 then just one more condition is needed to find ξ 0 4 moment equations the moment equations were used previously in barenblatt 1952 1954a and telyakovskiy et al 2016 to characterize the properties of the solutions here they are used to construct the approximate solutions by providing a way to obtain unknowns ξ 0 and c 3 in eq 26 first moment equation can be obtained by multiplying eq 11 by ξ and integrating over the domain 0 ξ 0 acting similarly higher order moment equations are obtained by multiplying the same ode eq 11 by ξ 1 m where m 1 is an integer then we again integrate over the domain 0 ξ 0 these higher order moments reflect other properties of the solution profile such as the moment of inertia and skewness depending on the selected value of m the equation for the higher order moments is 27 k k 1 ξ 1 m h d h d ξ ξ 0 1 2 k 1 ξ 2 m h ξ 0 m k k 1 0 ξ 0 ξ m h d h d ξ d ξ k k 1 k k 1 2 0 ξ 0 ξ 1 m d h d ξ 2 d ξ 2 m 2 k 1 λ 0 ξ 0 ξ 1 m h d ξ 0 it is advantageous to use lower moment equations in finding ξ 0 and c 3 since the integrals can be calculated easier due to the smaller powers of ξ in pratt 2018 appendices 11 3 11 5 it is shown that the first order moment has an invalid boundary term for values of k 2 whereas for the higher order moments the boundary terms are equal to zero therefore we select the specific values of m 1 2 to utilize the 2nd and 3rd order moment equations to find ξ 0 and c 3 the moment equations are 28 m2 k k 1 0 ξ 0 ξ h d h d ξ d ξ k k 1 k k 1 2 0 ξ 0 ξ 2 d h d ξ 2 d ξ 3 2 k 1 λ 0 ξ 0 ξ 2 h d ξ 0 m3 2 k k 1 0 ξ 0 ξ 2 h d h d ξ d ξ k k 1 k k 1 2 0 ξ 0 ξ 3 d h d ξ 2 d ξ 2 k 1 λ 0 ξ 0 ξ 3 h d ξ 0 setting c 3 0 in the approximating function eq 26 and substituting into m2 we are able to find the position of the wetting front ξ 0 using newly found ξ 0 in eq 26 gives the profile of the propagating substance when f is given by eq 15 if f is given by eq 16 we substitute eq 26 in both m2 and m3 it results in a system of equations for ξ 0 and c 3 using found parameters results in a cubic polynomial approximation for the profile and we show later that the cubic polynomial approximation is substantially more accurate compared to the quadratic although it is more difficult to derive the calculations pertinent to the substitution of eq 26 into moment equations eq 28 are available upon request 5 results using the highly accurate numerical solver developed in appendix a we obtain surrogate exact values for the position of the wetting front ξ 0 and the profile of the scaling function g ξ these numerical benchmarks give two ways to gauge the accuracy of the approximate solution presented in the prior section we calculate percentage errors in ξ 0 for different values of parameters and substituting ξ 0 and c 3 into the approximate scaling function we plot few figures to assess the accuracy of g ξ 5 1 effect of λ and k on ξ 0 and g ξ solution to our boundary value problem eqs 8 10 depends on two parameters the nonlinearity k of the equation and the pumping regime q together k and q form λ q k q k 1 see eq 8 and as discussed in appendix b λ 0 1 k 1 for purposes of analysis it is convenient to use k and λ on fig 1 we can see the changes in the form of the scaling function g ξ and shift in the position of the wetting front ξ 0 as k increases from k 1 5 to k 8 0 while λ stays fixed as expected the cubic approximate solution approximates the surrogate exact solution much better than the quadratic one both approximations are given by eq 26 and raised to the 1 k 1 power since we used mathematician s pressure vazquez 2007 defined earlier as g h 1 k 1 for the quadratic approximation c 3 0 while for the cubic c 3 0 another observation to be made is that the profile changes from concave up to concave down away from the well as nonlinearity k increases for λ 0 a concave up profile is present for k 1 2 whereas for k 2 a concave down profile forms near the propagation front the boussinesq equation case k 2 is studied in telyakovskiy et al 2016 and for this value of k the concavity switches table 2 compares the calculated position of the wetting front ξ 0 for different nonlinearity k values and fixed λ 0 the surrogate exact values are found using the modified numerical procedure of telyakovskiy et al 2016 extended to our case in appendix a this and more complicated problems can also be analyzed with the numerical procedure introduced in ghodgaonkar and christov 2019 in our case values of ξ 0 for quadratic and cubic approximations are obtained when the approximate solution given by eq 26 is substituted into m 2 and m 3 moment equations in eq 28 from table 2 we can see that the quadratic approximation for mid range values of k 2 produce adequate approximations for ξ 0 this approximation however is not able to accommodate for the highly concave up behavior away from the well for the low k 1 or highly concave down behavior as k increases the cubic approximation produces more accurate results with accuracy within 1 for k 1 5 30 0 when λ 0 we note that the cubic approximation is substantially more accurate and encompasses a wider range of k values it requires more complicated calculations but it is the recommended approach fig 2 shows the changes caused by varying the parameter λ for fixed k in our work we consider interval when λ 0 1 k 1 so plots in fig 2 are at the endpoints of the admissible λ interval when k 1 5 we again observe that the cubic approximation better matches the highly accurate numerical solution also from fig 2 we observe that as λ increases the wetting front position ξ 0 decreases while the profile gets steeper as ξ 0 similarly to table 2 in table 3 we present the calculated positions of the wetting front ξ 0 for different λ values and fixed k 1 5 the quadratic approximation is inaccurate when k is low whereas the cubic approximation maintains error within 1 over the entire range of λ 0 2 case of k 2 is considered in more detail in section 5 3 5 2 level sets for ξ 0 to further visualize the structure of the solutions we construct the level sets for ξ 0 i e curves in λ k plane where f λ k ξ 0 constant here the admissible region is specified by λ 0 1 k 1 and k 1 in fig 3 the level sets for ξ 0 1 50 1 65 1 90 2 25 are plotted plus this figure shows the region in terms of λ and k considered in this work the admissible region is bounded by k 1 λ 0 and λ 1 k 1 for pme it is required that k 1 since k 1 represents the linear diffusion equation here the region 0 λ 1 k 1 represents the power law flux boundary condition λ 0 is the time independent case and λ 1 k 1 is the exponential boundary condition case analyzed in appendix b as expected when k 1 values of ξ 0 increase since k 1 corresponds to the linear diffusion equation whose solutions have infinite speed of propagation i e ξ 0 solid line at k 2 corresponds to the boussinesq equation analyzed in telyakovskiy et al 2016 with asterisk at point λ k 0 5 2 the asterisk is the point at which level set curve for ξ 0 1 90 crosses k 2 and essentially the same value for ξ 0 was obtained in telyakovskiy et al 2016 when λ 0 5 5 3 comparisons our work is a further extension of the problem considered in telyakovskiy et al 2016 so it is natural to make comparison to the special pme case k 2 considered in telyakovskiy et al 2016 for the most part our approach is the same but there are some differences which allow for the approximations to be valid for all nonlinearities k 1 the first change comes from the ansantz term that modifies w ξ to prevent lim ξ ξ 0 d d ξ w ξ from happening in eq 26 in this work the a parameter defined by eq 21 depends on λ and k this allows for the approximating function to be weighted appropriately additionally in this work we use the higher order moments m 2 and m 3 defined by eq 28 instead of the first moment and the second moment used for calculations in telyakovskiy et al 2016 the relative error calculated by our quadratic approximation for k 2 is in the range 0 86 1 47 see table 4 this is an improvement compared to the range of 7 48 4 65 calculated in telyakovskiy et al 2016 for the cubic approximation the relative error was found to be within 0 478 2 473 in telyakovskiy et al 2016 and 0 59 1 06 with the calculations of this paper for λ 0 0 0 5 the work in telyakovskiy et al 2016 provides more accurate cubic approximations for ξ 0 while for λ 0 5 1 0 the present work is more accurate other approaches to construct approximate analytical solutions when k 2 can be found in di federico et al 2012 and li et al 2005 both papers make a different choice for similarity variable and scaling function compared with the present work in their work ξ 0 1 and it is possible to directly obtain numerical solution by integrating from wetting front that is at 1 towards 0 that selection of variables makes the moments of solution unknown quantities it is not surprising since we consider the free boundary problem and something should be unknown in our work the position of the front ξ 0 is unknown in di federico et al 2012 the singularity at the well is merged with series expansion at the wetting front through perturbation approach and an intermediate solution is obtained whereas in li et al 2005 solution is constructed in terms of the square of their scaling function again the series expansion at the front that is in terms of the square of their similarity variable is combined with singularity at well the main difference is that series is in terms of square of similarity variable and contribution of singularity at the front is subtracted while in this paper we augment the contribution of singularity by polynomial portion of solution that satisfies certain conditions at the boundaries and related moments the additional ansantz factor is needed to decrease the effect of singularity at the wetting front these are the main differences between this work and approaches in di federico et al 2012 and li et al 2005 from the authors of lyle et al 2005 we obtained data measuring the position of the wetting front for their experiment 3 experiment 3 is the case of the classical boussinesq equation with a constant pumping regime in our terms it would correspond to q 0 and k 2 in order to make the comparison with our approximate solution we set values for the following parameters ρ 1039 kg m 3 ϕ 6 9 1 0 9 m 2 ε 0 37 μ 0 001098 kg m s and τ 3 063 1 0 9 which can be found through using eq 5 additionally we use the reduced gravity equation g g δ ρ ρ 0 4 m s 2 to reflect saline fluid displacement of fresh water lyle et al 2005 regression on position of the wetting front from experimental data was performed and we obtained r t 0 0361 t 0 469 whereas the wetting front for our approximate solution eq 6 resulted in r t 0 0364 t 0 5 with r being in meters difference in exponent likely results from some phenomena that are unaccounted by simplified model like capillary forces lyle et al 2005 a more complicated setting was experimentally studied in ciriello et al 2016 6 conclusions we considered injection problems to an initially dry unconfined aquifer when the radially symmetric generalized boussinesq equation or pme is used to describe the shape of the phreatic surface under the dupuit assumption two new approximate solutions were constructed one is based on a quadratic approximation for the far field behavior while the second one relies on a cubic approximation presented solutions are valid for all power law nonlinearities appearing in pme and for a variety of injection regimes including the time independent case i e constant rate of injection the power law rate of injection and the limiting case of the exponential rate of injection analyzed problems allow for the introduction of self similar variables and reduction of the initial boundary value problem for the nonlinear generalized boussinesq equation to a boundary value problem for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation presented solutions consist of two parts one that models singular behavior at a well while the second one uses a polynomial approximation for the far field profile unlike the case of the conventional boussinesq equation analyzed in telyakovskiy et al 2016 the logarithmically asymptotic term representing behavior near the well needed to be weighted in a special way to account for the nonlinearity of pme and the pumping regime just like in telyakovskiy et al 2016 moment equations are used to find all the coefficients in the polynomial part of the solution only higher order moments are used to negate the boundary components that cause the solution to blow up see pratt 2018 both quadratic and cubic approximations give accurate results for the position of the wetting front and the form of the phreatic surface the accuracy of the quadratic approximation decreases as the nonlinearity diverge from the conventional boussinesq equation as expected the cubic approximation leads to higher accuracy in the position of the wetting front and the form of the phreatic surface testing over the wide range of nonlinearities in pme and a variety of pumping regimes we observed that the cubic approximation predicts the positions of the wetting front typically within 1 of the true values so the cubic approximation is recommended for any practical application over the quadratic approximation although the case of the boussinesq equation k 2 is modeled well by both approximations we also compared our approximate position of the wetting front for the boussinesq equation with experimental data of lyle et al 2005 comparison is favorable more accurate results can be obtained by taking higher degree polynomials like the fourth degree polynomial to model far field behavior but that would require the usage of one more moment equation it would also lead to a system of three equations and the additional computational cost would be substantial so the approximation will be harder to use further extension of this work could be the analysis of pme in fractal dimensions which would represent the flow of fluid in fracture networks such extension would involve the construction of an effective weighting factor in the singular part of the solution and assuring that the moment equations can be solved credit authorship contribution statement phillip a pratt methodology software validation writing original

quality of exposition and the associate editor and the editor graham sander for useful remarks appendix a numerical solver the high accuracy numerical solver in this paper follows the numerical procedure of barenblatt 1954a and barenblatt et al 1990 that was further improved in telyakovskiy et al 2016 the numerical solver was adjusted for general nonlinearities k 1 in pme similarly to telyakovskiy et al 2016 h a ξ is a solution to eq 11 in which the propagation front terminates at ξ 1 the solution h a ξ also has the derivative value of k 1 2 k at the front as follows from 24 plus h a 1 0 writing 11 as a system of first order equations runge kutta method can be applied starting from ξ 1 towards ξ 0 given that the system is singular at ξ 1 the taylor expansion is used to step away from ξ 1 as a result we obtain solution values for h a ξ in the direction of ξ 0 to recover the solution in terms of the original scaling function g ξ recall mathematician s pressure rescaling g a h a 1 k 1 as in barenblatt 1954a barenblatt et al 1990 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 the method presented below requires the calculation of a term denoted as n λ n λ represents an estimate to ξ d g a k d ξ as ξ 0 that is rescaled to match bc eq 9 for any k 1 direct calculations of n λ is strongly affected by the fact that g a is singular at ξ 0 to decrease the effect of the singularity eq 8 expressed in terms of g a is multiplied by ξ and integrated over z 1 taking the limit as z 0 results in the value of n λ a 1 n λ lim z 0 ξ d g a k ξ d ξ ξ z lim z 0 1 λ z 1 ξ g a ξ d ξ z 2 g a z 2 this approach was used earlier in telyakovskiy et al 2016 the integral on the right hand side is calculated using any basic integration technique additionally for all σ 0 eqs 8 and 10 are invariant under the following transformation see barenblatt 1952 a 2 g b ξ σ 2 k 1 g a σ ξ where g a is a solution of eq 8 that satisfies eq 10 using eq a 1 the above invariance equation and bc eq 9 we obtain a 3 lim ξ 0 ξ d g b k ξ d ξ lim ξ 0 σ 2 k k 1 σ ξ d g a k σ ξ d σ ξ σ 2 k k 1 n λ 1 so function g b satisfies bc eq 9 for all k 1 if we take a 4 σ n λ k 1 2 k the same scaling gives the actual value of ξ 0 by setting σ ξ 0 1 so for the propagation front we have a 5 ξ 0 1 σ n λ k 1 2 k it means that the final expression for the scaling function in eq a 2 is a 6 g ξ n λ 1 k g a ξ n λ k 1 2 k the value of ξ 0 given by eq a 5 is used as the surrogate exact value for the comparisons made in this paper likewise the presented graphs of the numerical solutions are obtained with the runge kutta procedure that were later scaled according to eq a 6 to satisfy boundary condition eq 9 appendix b exponential flux bc in section 2 it was noted that the exponent q appearing in the pumping regime in the original boundary condition eq 3 has no upper bound the limiting case when q corresponds to the original pme problem where the pumping regime is modeled by an exponential function versus the power law function see e g barenblatt 1954b barenblatt et al 1990 li et al 2005 and telyakovskiy et al 2016 the pme problem to be solved is b 1 c h t 1 r r r h k r k 1 r 0 t 0 lim r 0 2 π ϕ r k μ h k r r t h 0 e q t h 0 0 q 0 lim r h r t 0 t 0 h r 0 0 r 0 the application of dimensional analysis leads to three dimensionless variables this number is reduced to two dimensionless variables if in addition to the similarity reduction a time translation transformation is applied as outlined in barenblatt 1954b and barenblatt et al 1990 it allows for the introduction of similarity variable ξ 2 and scaling function g 2 ξ 2 as b 2 ξ 2 r 2 π ϕ k h 0 e q t μ k 1 q c k 1 k k 1 2 k b 3 g 2 ξ 2 2 π ϕ k h 0 e q t μ 1 k h r t substituting eqs b 2 b 3 in eq b 1 the initial boundary value problem becomes b 4 1 ξ 2 d d ξ 2 ξ 2 d g 2 k d ξ 2 ξ 2 2 d g 2 d ξ 2 λ m a x g 2 0 λ m a x 1 k 1 with the boundary conditions b 5 lim ξ 2 0 ξ 2 d g k d ξ 2 1 b 6 lim ξ 2 g ξ 2 0 eqs b 4 b 6 are the same as the nonlinear boundary value problem eqs 8 10 when λ λ m a x 1 k 1 and represents the pumping regime q we can see from table b 5 that as k representing nonlinearity of the problem increases the maximum λ approaches zero it is expected since we just have shown that λ m a x 1 k 1 to summarize the time independent regime corresponds to λ 0 for k 1 interval λ 0 1 k 1 represent polynomial law injection the exponential law injection regime is given by λ λ m a x 1 k 1 this means that the admissible range for parameter λ is λ 0 1 k 1 for k 1 and the polynomial based approximate solution eq 26 can be used for all these values 
119,assuming that the equilibrium geometry of river channels does not depend on their initial state but solely on boundary conditions several formulas have been derived that relate the channel depth and width to the river bankfull discharge and bed material however due to the existence of a threshold for sediment motion and the strong non linearity between sediment transport and flow rate this assumption might not be generally valid for gravel bed rivers this research clarifies the role of the initial conditions more specifically the initial channel width on the geometry of gravel bed rivers considering a variety of boundary conditions the approach includes laboratory experiments and two dimensional modeling reproducing the evolution of alluvial channels with different starting widths discharge regimes and sediment input rates the experiments represent the arc river france thus the characteristics of this river were used in the numerical model to obtain a realistic virtual case complementing the experiments different boundary and starting conditions resulted in either braided or single thread channels we found that the initial width strongly influences the evolution process and leaves a footprint on the river braid belt extension the active width of braided systems and the width of single thread channels do not depend on the starting condition they depend on sediment input rather than on discharge variability different initial widths result in different final bed levels this indicates that the initial channel width may affect the degree of channel incision or aggradation the results of this study justify the use of equilibrium formulas for single thread rivers keywords river channel formation gravel bed rivers delft3d morphodynamic modeling initial conditions boundary conditions active width braid belt extension 1 introduction stable channels having reach averaged geometry that can be considered constant belong to river reaches in morphodynamic equilibrium the geometry of stable river channels has been described using the regime theory kennedy 1895 lacey 1930 leopold and maddock 1953 parker et al 2007 extremal hypothesis griffiths 1984 singh 2003 and mechanistic approaches parker 1978b several empirical relations have been formulated to determine the reach averaged channel width and depth as a function of bankfull discharge leopold and maddock 1953 williams 1978 parker 1979 emmett and wolman 2001 or as the formative discharge having a certain return time normally 1 5 to 2 years e g vargas luna et al 2019 some formulas also include a dependency on sediment size and other physical features such as riparian vegetation characteristics e g millar 2005 bray 1982 garde et al 2001 millar 2005 parker et al 2007 and kaless et al 2014 derived formulas for gravel bed rivers wilkerson and parker 2011 for sand bed rivers whereas eaton and church 2007 and booker 2010 for both gravel bed and sand bed rivers among others a review is presented by gleason 2015 by relating the equilibrium channel geometry to discharge and other river characteristics these formulas assume that the equilibrium channel configuration solely depends on boundary conditions which means that it is unaffected by the conditions at the start of the morphological evolution however this might not be true especially for gravel bed rivers due to the presence of a clear threshold between sediment motion and non motion shields 1936 garcia 2008 and to the strong non linearity of bed load as a function of flow velocity particularly at the conditions close to initiation of motion meyer peter and müller 1948 starting from a narrow rather than wide channel could thus result in a totally different morphological evolution and probably also in a different long term river configuration different starting widths imply different water depths flow distributions and sediment transport rates affecting sediment outputs and thus also the sediment balance the flow width to depth ratio is the major factor influencing the formation of bars which in turn affect bank erosion and thus the channel width engelund 1970 crosato 2009 kleinhans et al 2011 the initial channel width is therefore crucial in defining sediment transport and channel characteristics at the beginning of the morphological evolution and might interact with the boundary conditions water and sediment inputs and outputs in a non linear way influencing the evolution path and the new equilibrium channel geometry blench 1969 mosselman 2004 various works studied the effect of boundary conditions on the geometry of gravel bed rivers the importance of sediment supply was first realized by schumm et al 1972 who demonstrated that sediment feed reduction causes incision and affects the planform of laboratory channels this was later confirmed by wickert et al 2013 pfeiffer et al 2017 métivier et al 2017 and vargas luna et al 2019 the effect of discharge was studied by parker et al 2003 van de lageweg et al 2013 blom et al 2017 schuurman et al 2018 and vargas luna et al 2019 who emphasized the role of flow variability for the width evolution of gravel bed river system works dealing with the effects of initial conditions are relatively less some work deals with tidal embayment e g van maanen et al 2013 in the case of rivers stecca et al 2022 studied the role of initial bed perturbations on the distribution of channels and shoals in braided systems however the effect of initial conditions on reach scale river geometry has not been analysed yet whereas it could be significant for gravel bed rivers it is thus not clear whether gravel bed rivers retain the footprint of their starting conditions in their morphology in such a case the formulas derived to assess the bankfull width and depth of stable gravel bed channels may present important limitations this study analyses the evolution of un vegetated gravel bed river systems towards equilibrium departing from different channel widths in combination with different flow regimes and sediment input rates the analysis focuses on the evolution of the reach averaged channel width and bed level as well as the river planform the work includes a set of laboratory experiments and the simulation of several scenarios with a two dimensional 2d morphodynamic model developed using the open source delft3d code the model reproduces the morphodynamic behavior of a realistic virtual gravel bed river derived by upscaling the experimental channels the larger freedom that numerical models offer has allowed complementing the experiments by including additional scenarios and expanding the domain considering for instance different sediment characteristics and longer time of evolution 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments six sets of laboratory experiments were conducted whose layouts and test duration were designed to specifically study the evolution of initially straight channels towards morphodynamic equilibrium starting from different widths with several discharge regimes and sediment input rates singh 2015 attention was paid in producing the typical sediment mobility of gravel bed rivers by selecting sediment and flow characteristics through a number of preliminary tests the experiments were carried out in the laboratory of fluid mechanics of the delft university of technology in a 5 m long 1 24 m wide and 0 4 m deep flume water was recirculated from outlet to the inlet of the flume whereas sediment was fed at the inlet at constant rates the flume was filled with non uniform sand having median grain size d50 equal to 1 mm fig 1 b and a straight rectangular channel 4 cm deep with longitudinal slope of 1 and width of 4 10 25 or 40 cm was excavated in the middle of the flume before the start of each test the first two widths are considered narrow resulting in initial conditions below the threshold for bar formation engelund 1970 colombini et al 1987 tubino and seminara 1990 crosato and mosselman 2009 and the last two are deemed wide above the threshold of bar formation the experiments followed the morphological adaptation of each channel as a response to different water and sediment inflow focusing on reach averaged width bed level and planform four discharge hydrographs including a constant flow hydrograph ue and two sediment input regimes were implemented hydrographs h1e and h2e only differed in amplitude whereas h3e representing a rather intense but short flow had high discharge of shorter duration the same volume of water was discharged in the constant flow and in the variable flow tests through the duration of entire high low flow cycles fig 1a video camera records taken from a nearly orthogonal position allowed following the channel evolution for the constant flow tests images were extracted from the videos at intervals of 30 min for the variable flow tests images were extracted at the end of each low and high flow stages highlighting the contours of the wet channel by coloured water fig 1c these images were then used to quantify the temporal variation of reach averaged wet channel width section 2 3 point 2 which was measured perpendicular to the channel centreline at intervals of 0 2 m in the central 3 m of the flume thus removing the first and the last meter of flume close to the boundaries note that if the channel was braided the wet width also included some dry areas corresponding to emerging bar tops fig 1c and for most cases it covered the lateral extent of the area where the morphological process had occurred cross section profiles were measured every 50 cm after 2 h and at the end of each test by laser scanning this required to briefly stop the water flow after 2 h table 1 summarizes the initial and boundary conditions of each of the 20 tests that were carried out the experiments had duration of 7 h the tests with variable discharge were carried out only for the initial widths of 10 and 40 cm for these the flow cycles shown in fig 1a were repeated 10 times in most cases with sediment supply the channel widened very rapidly and soon touched the side walls of the flume so that these tests had to be terminated earlier 2 2 numerical modeling the numerical simulations were carried out on virtual channels having reach scale characteristics similar to the arc river in france best resemblance to the experimental channels but not a scaled model starting with different widths in combination with various inflow conditions the objective was not to replicate or validate the experiments but to compliment them by extending the study at a real river scale unaffected by scale issues to design the virtual river the average final configuration of the experimental channels ue case was upscaled and compared with rivers described in the literature appendix a 2 2 1 model description the numerical simulations were carried out using the open source software delft3d www deltares nl this software allows performing morphodynamic computations by solving unsteady shallow water equations and sediment transport formulas to obtain bed level changes as well as changes in bed material characteristics singh et al 2017 the models built for this research are based on a two dimensional 2d depth averaged version of the basic equations parameterizing the effects of 3d flow features models in this form have been successfully used to investigate morphological developments at a reach scale by crosato and saleh 2011 schuurman et al 2013 singh et al 2017 among others a detailed description of the software and of the mathematical equations and corresponding numerical schemes are provided by deltares 2018 2 2 2 model setup the spatial domain of the models was represented by a straight alluvial corridor 1500 m long and 300 or 400 m wide depending on scenario with initial longitudinal bed slope of 0 6 and sediment either composed of cobbles with uniform size or graded table 2 the granulometric curve of the sediment was obtained from the upscaled value of the experimental d50 imposing a similar size distribution the uniform sediment size coincided with the median dimeter d50 of the graded sediment fig 2 b additional 1000 m were added upstream and downstream of the study reach to minimize numerical error propagation from the boundaries resulting in a 3500 m long model domain that was discretized in a rectangular computational grid having cell size of 5 m 2 5 m l x w the grid was finer in transverse direction to better represent bank erosion williams et al 2016 a trapezoidal shaped straight 6 m deep initial channel with a flatbed was carved in the middle of the alluvial corridor with side slope of 1v 1 67h the average bottom width of the excavated channel vaired accroding to scenario model parameters were selected to best represent the trends and processes observed in the experiments some through several sensitivity runs performed on a virtual channel um 30 whereas some using typical suitable values for modeling rivers the results of the sensitivity runs are presented in appendix b to parameterize the flow resistance due to 3d turbulence and horizontal motion the eddy viscosity vh was assigned the value of 0 1 m2 s whereas sediment transport was simulated using the formula of wong and parker 2006 provided in eq 1 1 q s 4 93 δ g d 50 3 θ θ c r 1 6 where qs represents volume rate of total bed load transport per unit width without pores m2 s δ represents the submerged specific gravity of sediment g is the acceleration due to gravity m2 s d50 the median sediment size m θ the shields parameter with θcr being the critical shields parameter taken as 0 047 in general the direction of bed load doesn t coincide with the computed direction of depth averaged flow velocity because of the effects of gravity on bed slopes commonly known as the bed slope effect baar et al 2019 in this study bagnold s 1966 was used to model the effects of longitudinal bed slope and the formulation of ikeda 1982 as in van rijn 1993 was used to model the effects of transverse bed slope eq 2 2 q n q s a b n θ c r θ z b n where qn is the additional bed load transport vector in n direction due to gravity on transverse bed slope m2 s per unit width qs is the magnitude of the bed load transport vector in s direction adjusted for longitudinal bed slope only m2 s abn is a calibration coefficient zb is the bed level m and n is the transverse coordinate perpendicular to the coordinate s m the sediment transport direction is also affected by the spiral flow that develops in river bends which tends to move the sediment particles towards the inner bend opposite to the bed slope effect which pushes the sediment particles towards the outer bend towards the pool schuurman et al 2013 to parameterize the effects of spiral flow this study adopted the formulation by struiksma et al 1985 the bed level changes were computed according to exner s principle i e assuming that the sediment transport immediately adapts to changes in flow velocity approach that is valid for bed load dominated channels typical of gravel bed rivers bank erosion was modeled though the dry cell wet cell algorithm available in delft 3d redistributing the near bank bed erosion based on the value imposed to a specific coefficient 0 8 in our case the algorithm establishes the portion of bed erosion that is computed for a wet cell at the channel margin to be assigned to the adjacent dry cell bank this algorithm somehow reflects the physical process that near bank bed erosion increases bank instability in the model wet and dry cells are identified based on a threshold water depth which for this study was set equal to 10 cm such scheme for bank erosion has been successfully implemented in schuurman et al 2013 williams et al 2016 among many others for the bed roughness the manning coefficient of 0 045 m 1 3 s ensured a chezy roughness coefficient ranging between 20 and 30 m1 2 s in agreement with both the experimental channels and the arc river jaballh et al 2015 the hydrodynamic time step for the computations was 1 2 s ensuring the stability of the model in delft 3d the morphological changes can be accelerated by means of a specified factor morfac to save computation time roelvink 2006 for the constant discharge scenarios a morfac of 5 was used after ensuring that it does not significantly alter the morphological process appendix b so for these cases a simulation of 10 days represents the morphological development of 50 computational days for the scenario with graded sediment the granulometric curve fig 2b was divided in three equal fractions in terms of volume delft3d calculates the mean sediment diameter of each fraction and applies the prescribed sediment transport formula separately the sediment continuity model proposed by hirano 1971 was applied dividing the bed in active and substrate layers of thickness 0 5 m and 1 87 m respectively following singh et al 2017 to mimic the hiding and exposure phenomenon the models used the formulation of parker et al 1982 where a correction factor applied to the sediment transport formula increases the critical shield number of the finer sediment fractions reducing their entrainment rates hiding and decreases the one of the coarser fractions increasing their entrainment rates exposure the total duration of the simulations was selected based on pre runs with the goal of achieving stable channels for the cases without sediment feed ending up as single thread channels the width of the channels presented very small changes after 50 days however at that point the average sediment transport and the bed slope were still decreasing at a consistent rate but their changes became negligible after 70 days for the cases with sediment feed ending up as braided channels the duration of the computations had to be increased to 100 days at that point the average sediment transport of the reach had achieved a dynamic equilibrium fluctuating around the input value note that in all cases the computational days cannot be linked to the real river time considering that the value of the model discharges corresponds to short duration high flows not selected on the basis of arc river s statistics this shortcoming is considered acceptable because the focus of the work is to assess whether the configuration of stable gravel bed rivers depends on initial conditions and not the temporal scales 2 2 3 model scenarios model scenarios were formulated with difference combination of starting widths and upstream boundary conditions table 2 for the upstream hydrodynamic boundary condition three idealized hydrographs fig 2a were formulated each one differing in amplitude but with the same duration and total volume of water inflow the sediment input from upstream was either constant nil or equilibrium amount of bed load with either the same size as the material forming the virtual channel and gravel plain or with a smaller size the downstream boundary conditions were a constant water level derived for the initial channel and the sediment output was computed at the end of the model domain the constant sediment feed rates in the model were proportional to the ones in the corresponding experiments derived using the relation presented in eq 3 3 s e t e s m t m where s represents the sediment feed at the upstream boundary and t represents the sediment transport capacity of the narrowest initial channel computed using eq 1 subscript e means experiment and m is for model for the equilibrium sediment input the bed load rate was equal to the transport capacity of the flow at the upstream boundary calculated by the model at the upstream boundary based on the prescribed sediment transport formula eq 1 the values of initial width to be imposed to the virtual channels were derived based on geometric proportionality between experimental and virtual channels the ratio between the average final width for the scenario ue i e 0 2 m and the respective initial widths of the experimental channels was applied to the width of the river arc downstream reach where the river due to upstream damming has a strongly reduced bedload input jaballah et al 2015 similar to the experiments the widths of 10 m and 30 m represented narrow initial channels i e below the threshold for bar formation while the initial widths of 60 m and 100 m represent the wide initial channels 2 2 4 analysis of the results for gravel bed river systems bertoldi et al 2009 indicate three different widths which was the basis of our analysis 1 the braid belt extension being the transverse extension of the morphologically active area howard 1996 limaye 2020 this is here taken as the lateral extent of the area in which the morphological changes have occurred 2 the wet river width defined as the lateral extent of the water surface at the bankfull condition parker et al 2007 or at another defined discharge which includes also emerging areas in between 3 the active channel width defined as the width of the portion of channel contributing to bed load transport this could not be measured in the laboratory channels for the study reach excluding the first and last 1000 m of the model domain widths were computed at each cross section 5 m apart and averaged to obtain reach averaged width width and bed adaptation interact and influence each other during channel evolution so the evolution of the virtual channels was also analyzed as a combination of relative changes in average width and bed level showing four distinct phases aggradation widening aggradation narrowing incision narrowing and incision widening the relative change in average width was computed as the difference between reach averaged evolved and initial width the change in average bed level with respect to initial value at each cross section was averaged to obtain relative change in bed level of the reach 3 results of the laboratory experiments 3 1 without sediment input fig 3 shows the width evolution of the channels having different discharge regimes constant and variable with the same average and total flow volumes without sediment feed at the upstream boundary despite starting from different initial widths all channels with constant flow ue scenarios table 1 evolved in single thread systems ending up with a reach averaged wet width of about 20 cm fig 3a however the initially narrower ue 0 04 and ue 0 1 and wider ue 0 25 and ue 0 4 channels presented different evolution paths the initially narrower channels started their evolution with rapid widening followed by widening at progressively smaller rates fast widening resulted in high sediment input bank erosion products to the channel and bed aggradation followed by bed incision as the widening rate slowed down during the latest stage of evolution among the initially wider channels ue 0 25 presented slow channel widening and bed aggradation for the first 4 5 h after achieving a width of about 30 cm the channel started to narrow due to localized bed erosion ue 0 4 had initially a shallow flow distributed over the entire width and started producing some concentrated bed erosion which gradually progressed downstream the eroded sediment initially was accumulated more downstream and was later partly removed by the flow channel narrowing by bed erosion was the dominant process towards the end of the experiment to study the effects of variable flow the tests included the evolution of two channels with initial widths of 10 cm and 40 cm figs 3b 3c and 3d starting with a channel of 10 cm the wet width development shows that the regimes with the highest flow peaks h3e 0 1 and h2e 0 1 presented similar width oscillations the wet width being a function of discharge to end up with a similar width of about 35 cm fig 3c and 3d gray lines corresponding to a 75 increase compared to the constant flow width the variable discharge regime with the smallest peak h1e had initial evolution similar to the constant flow case ue 0 1 but in h1e 0 1 the channel continued to widen and finally resulted in a 25 wider channel i e with a wet width of 25 cm instead of the 20 cm of the uniform flow scenarios figs 3a and 3b gray lines with a starting width of 40 cm figs 3b 3c and 3d black continuous lines the h1e 0 4 and h3e 0 4 scenarios had similar evolution trends and ended up with 140 wider channels 48 cm compared to the uniform flow scenarios 20 cm these hydrographs had low flows with similar discharges 0 3 and 0 28 l s but with different duration 20 and 28 5 min respectively they had strongly differed high stage flows 0 8 l s h3e for a duration of 10 min and 0 5 l s h1e for a duration of 20 min in the h2e 0 4 scenario with smaller low discharge 0 2 l s for 20 min and an intermediate high discharge of 0 6 l s for 20 min instead the channel slightly narrowed from 40 to 38 cm resulting in a 90 increase with respect to the final width of the uniform flow scenario 20 cm in general all channels having the same flow regime without sediment feed show a tendency towards a similar width if this is true the final width would be independent from the initial one and only dependent on flow regime extrapolating the width evolution curves we can observe that the final width of the cannels would fall between 20 and 50 cm for all flow regimes in all tests the high stage flows occupied almost the entire width of the channel whereas the low flows occupied only the deepest parts the low flows of hydrographs h1e and h3e had enough intensity and duration to rework the bars that formed during the high discharge stages and to locally erode the banks the next high discharge further reworked the bed and eroded the banks resulting in channel widening the higher flow peak with smaller duration of hydrograph h3e had effects that were similar to the lower but longer peak of hydrograph h1e instead the lower discharge of hydrograph h2e was not sufficient to rework the bars formed during the high stage discharge and eroded the channel bed only in its deeper parts further confining the low flow the next high discharge reworked the bed across the entire width of the channel but continued to erode also the deepest parts of the channel bed erosion started near the upstream boundary and advanced further downstream incision led to channel width reduction these results indicate that the channel width depended on both high and low discharges with the low flows having an important role in bar reworking and thalweg deepening 3 2 with constant sediment input the results of the experimental tests with a constant feed of sediment having the same granulometry as the alluvial corridor are shown in fig 4 these tests produced much wider channels compared to the respective experiments without sediment feed fig 3 final widths of approximately 50 to 75 cm compared to the 20 to 50 cm obtained without sediment feed the evolution of the channels with constant flow ue scenarios table 1 is shown in fig 4a the initially wider channels seem to converge to the width of 60 cm it is not possible to establish whether the initially narrower ones would also converge to the same width these channels ue 0 04 and ue 0 1 presented rapid widening and bed aggradation for the first 30 min bars started to appear after this period when the critical width to depth ratio for the formation of alternate bars exceeded bank erosion at pools produced sinuous and wider channels as the channels continued to widen complex mid channel bars formed a sign that at that point also the critical width to depth ratio for central bar formation had been reached these tests had to be terminated well before reaching morphodynamic equilibrium because the channel margins touched the sides of the flume the initially wider channels ue 0 25 and ue 0 4 started with higher width to depth ratios so the first 30 min were already characterized by the development of alternate bars followed by mid channel bars the growth of bars enhanced bank erosion resulting in wider multi thread channels similar phenomena of channel widening were also observed by ashmore 1982 in laboratory channels and by jang shimizu 2005 in numerical simulations as widening progressed multiple bars were observed to migrate in downstream direction initially ue 0 25 presented higher widening rates than ue 0 4 but after 4 h both channels evolved at similar widening rates both resulting in reach averaged widths of about 60 cm even though the final channel widths were similar ue 0 25 ended up with higher channel bed levels than ue 0 4 in general the channels having the same flow and sediment supply regime seem to converge towards a similar width independently from their initial one but the experiments were not long enough to exclude divergence in the final stages of morphological development variable discharges figs 4b 4c and 4d produces wider channels than constant flow but in general channel widening appears dominated by sediment input however many tests with variable discharge had to be terminated after 5 h because the channel touched the sides of the flume for the same reason the results of h3e 0 1 became not reliable after 3 h already 4 numerical model results the evolution of the initially straight channels passed through various phases the initial and final widths and the final planforms types are listed in table 3 the initial and final planforms are presented in the supplementary materials 4 1 without sediment input fig 5 shows the reach averaged width evolution of the channels that formed without sediment supply under different discharge regimes all channels evolved in single thread incised rivers with measurable differences in width mainly depending on flow hydrograph as expected variable flows resulted in expansion and contraction of wet areas the final width of the channels that formed under variable flow resulted systematically larger than with constant flow with higher flow variability resulting in a wider channel but only slightly this was also observed by vargas luna et al 2019 in their laboratory experiments for uniform sediment and either constant fig 5a or variable discharge fig 5c and 5d the channels clearly widened during the initial phases of the model runs and then narrowed with the channels starting with the larger widths of 60 m and 100 m systematically became narrower than the channels that started with the smaller widths of 10 m and 30 m instead with graded sediment and constant discharge fig 5b the larger initial channel ended up slightly wider than the channel that started with a smaller width this could be due to bed armouring that limited the morphological process of incision narrowing see fig 6 and relative discussion it should also be noticed that for the largest initial width sediment heterogeneity also resulted in the downstream part of the channel which was braided however in general the final channels of the scenarios with graded sediment are narrower than with uniform sediment compare fig 5a 5b and table 3 fig 6 shows the combined width and bed level evolutions of the channels if the bed sediment was uniform figs 6a 6c and 6d rapid widening governed the initial phase of the evolution of the channels that started with the smaller widths 10 m and 30 m distributed over an increasingly larger width the flow gradually lost part of its sediment carrying capacity which combined with a high sediment influx form the eroding banks resulted in bed aggradation when bank erosion stopped due to lack of sediment input from upstream the flow started eroding the channel bed initiating an incision phase for the initially wider channels the aggradation widening phase was much shorter due to limited bank erosion again when widening stopped lack of sediment input caused incision and channel narrowing fig 6b shows the evolution of the channels with graded sediment and constant inflow in this case the aggradation widening phase was much reduced compared to the scenarios with constant discharge and uniform sediment the channel starting with the largest width ended up with a higher bed level less incision compared to the one with uniform sediment which can be related to bed armouring due to sediment sorting sun et al 2015 instead the channel starting with the smaller width ended up being narrower with a lower bed level in this case the high sediment carrying capacity of the flow concentrated in the narrower channel transported away the finer fraction rather quickly deepening the channel in the areas with the highest flow rate here the high velocity resulted in full mobility of the coarsest fractions causing some extra channel incision regarding the effects of variable flow for the same initial width higher flow variability resulted in slightly higher widening and less incision 4 2 with sediment input fig 7 shows the reach averaged width evolution for different sediment input regimes at the upstream boundary under constant discharge the constant 265 kg s and the equilibrium sediment input computed as the sediment transport capacity of the flow at the upstream boundary with the same size as the channel bed and banks were larger than the transport capacity of the flow further downstream fig 7a and b as a result the channels widened significantly with high bed aggradation leading to a braided planform instead a constant input of 265 kg s with finer sediment of uniform size 2 cm was on average smaller than the sediment carrying capacity of the channels fig 7c and resulted in much narrower single thread incised channels figs 7a and 7b show that different starting channel widths resulted in different braid belt extensions for a constant sediment input rate of 265 kg s having the same size 8 cm as the channel bed and banks fig 7a the narrowest initial channel produced the largest braid belt um 10 this channel started widening immediately with high bank erosion rates the intense bed aggradation that followed initiated overbank flow and channel excavation though the alluvial corridor after the 40th day producing the widest braid belt similar morphological developments were observed by schuurman et al 2018 the other three starting widths fig 7a and 7b never presented overbank flow of these the widest initial channels um 100 and um e 100 produced also the widest braid belts the equilibrium sediment supply smaller than the constant input produced narrower channels in particular for the narrowest initial channel table 3 constant input of finer sediment fig 7c smaller than the initial sediment capacity of the flow resembles the case without sediment supply fig 5a after initial widening all three channels became incised and single thread with similar wet width the evolution of the active width of the braided channels i e the width of the flow contributing to bedload transport is shown in fig 8 even though the channels produced different braid belt extensions figs 7a and 7b the active widths tend to stabilize and converge to a similar value initial fluctuations were caused by the braiding activity of the channels fig 9 shows the combined width and bed evolution of the channels if the sediment input is larger than the average transport capacity of the flow fig 9a and 9b the channels remain always in the aggradation widening phase with narrower channels experiencing more relative width and bed level changes the narrowest initial channel um 10 presents the highest aggradation the amount of relative aggradation and widening increases with sediment input fig 9a and 9b with finer sediment input which was less than the average transport capacity of the channels the combined evolution is similar to the case with no sediment supply with uniform sediment figs 6a fig 10 shows the effects of variable discharge on the evolution of the reach averaged braid belt extension the scenarios are distinguished by discharge regime h1m and h2m but have the same constant sediment input of 265 kg s same size as alluvial corridor these cases were simulated for a shorter period compared to the constant discharge cases so they do not allow for a long term analysis nevertheless for both hydrographs the braid belt extensions seem to converge irrespective of initial width but they may diverge at a later stage as in the cases with constant discharge fig 7a and 7b 5 discussion 5 1 controls of planform irrespective of boundary conditions both the experimental and the virtual cases starting with the narrower widths shared similar trends at the start of their morphological evolution and so did the ones that started with the larger widths with or without sediment input the initial phase of the narrower systems was characterized by high sediment transport capacity due to flow concentration and high bank erosion resulting in rapid widening and channel aggradation due to the sediment input from bank erosion and in certain cases from the upstream boundary parker 1978a migrating alternate bars appeared after reaching the critical width to depth ratio for bar formation e g engelund 1970 further channel widening led to multiple bar formation resulting in a braided system leopold and wolman 1957 the channel starting with the smallest width 10 m experienced overbank flow because of excessive aggradation for um 10 it was in the form of sheet flow but eventually the flow concentrated into a single channel pitlick et al 2013 whereas for um 10 overbank flow interacted with the floodplain and produced chute channels which dominated the planform development schuurman et al 2018 the initial phase of the wider channels was characterized by low flow velocity not being enough to erode the banks as a consequence the channels did not widen much since the initial width to depth ratio was already larger than the critical one this phase was already characterized by bar development and the channels attained a braided planform relatively early these observations confirm the results of previous studies e g murray and paola 1994 bertoldi et al 2009 sun et al 2015 limaye 2020 for all cases during the last phase with further reduction of bank erosion and lateral sediment input if the sediment input at the upstream boundary was smaller than the carrying capacity of the flow bed erosion in the deepest parts of the channels propagated downstream initiating channel narrowing regardless of starting width this resulted in the final transformation from a wide and braided system to narrow incised single thread channel instead if the sediment input was larger than the carrying capacity of the flow the system remained braided and continued widening but at an increasingly slower rate ideally in the long run sediment mobility would reach the threshold value and channel widening would stop kleinhans et al 2015b limaye 2020 although the first phases of the morphological development were highly dependent on initial width sediment supply seems to be dominant factor for the final river planform this was already suggested by schumm et al 1972 and later by métivier et al 2017 pfeiffer et al 2017 and wickert et al 2013 5 2 controls of lateral extension and bed level single thread incised channels formed with sediment input rates smaller than the sediment transport capacity of the flow for the same boundary conditions these channels ended up with similar reach averaged widths with some differences not retaining the memory of its starting width note that for the scenarios with no sediment input and constant discharge at the upstream boundary the computed final width obtained starting from different values of channel width is similar to the actual width of the arc river 50 m as reported in table a 1 this river is dammed upstream and sediment input is occasional jaballh et al 2015 with constant discharge for the same starting widths higher sediment inputs resulted in wider channels whereas variable flow also resulted in wider channels than constant flow vargas luna et al 2019 but the difference among the variable flow regimes was small table 3 boundary conditions seems to govern the width of single thread channels and not the starting width braided systems formed with sediment input rates that were larger than the sediment transport capacity of the flow according to bertoldi et al 2009 blom et al 2017 schuurman et al 2018 and limaye 2020 the braid belt extension is primarily a function of discharge based on our results we believe that it is also governed by the initial channel width and by the sediment input from upstream we found that with a constant flow discharge the final braid belt extension increased if the initial width increased fig 7 a and b however this is not valid for the smallest initial width which produced the largest braid belt of all this was the only case that presented overbank flow excavating chute channels through the floodplain this process played a major role in the study of schuurman 2018 with overbank flow governed by peak discharges it is possible that the braid belt extension loses its dependency on initial width the final braid belt for um 30 was 25 5 m wider than ume 30 whereas for um 100 and ume 100 it was only 7 4 m thus a larger sediment feed produced a wider braid belt but effected the narrow initial channel more simulation with variable flow and sediment feed were only ran for 60 days shorter than constant discharge case so it we could only analize the medium term evolution the role of initial width is not as distinct as for constant discharge case at this point in evolution comparing the widths at the point where simulation for variable flow ended i e 60th day the widths of h1m 30 and h2m 30 are 19 m and 33 m wider than um 30 but widths of h1m 100 and h2m 100 are only 1 m and 5 m wider than um 100 variable flow resulted in wider braid belt than with constant flow van de lageweg et al 2013 blom et al 2017 schuurman et al 2018 but the effect seems to be more for narrow initial channels note that these results are based on the effects of channel widening through bank erosion since overbank flows did not occur for the 30 and 100 m initial channels about the active width described in section 2 3 bertoldi et al 2009 concluded that it is primarily a function of stream power product of discharge and slope this is supported by our model results showing that the active width converged to a similar value for all the scenarios with the same boundary conditions irrespective of initial conditions even if the final braid belt extension differed fig 8 with the same constant discharge the longitudinal slope of all our virtual channels increased from initial value of 0 6 to final values of around 0 7 this indicates the modelled systems always had a similar stream power and indeed resulted in a similar final active width the initial width is found to affect the final average bed level of the channel narrow initial widths resulted in higher final average bed levels than the wider initial widths true for both aggrading and incising channels which is primarily due to the high input of sediment from bank erosion figs 6 and 9 for single thread incised channel after intermediate widening and aggradation all the channels started to incise from their aggraded bed narrow initial channels had higher aggradation before incision begun so relative to the original bed level they presented higher final bed level than initial wider ones with graded bed material sediment sorting limited incision of initial wider one while increasing that of narrower one thus the channels ended up more or less at the same level also variable flow presented higher relative widening and aggradation thus having less channel incision than with a constant flow in all cases long term progression of the morphological evolution would result in re adaptation of the channel average bed level to the downstream boundary conditions jansen et al 1979 5 3 combined experimental and numerical observations the time scaling ratio suggested by parker et al 2003 and pitlick et al 2013 is 4 t e t m l where te is the experiental time tm is the model time and l is the lenght scale 215 in this case application of eq 4 indicates that 7 h in the experiments corresponded to 102 h 4 days in the numerical simulations the total duration of the model simulations was either 70 days or 100 days which means that in theory the simulations covered a much longer adaptation period the experiments were carried out using non uniform sand and sediment sorting was indeed observed during the evolution of the channels this means that the results of the laboratory study should be compared to the results of the graded sediment scenarios of the numerical investigation umgr which were carried out for the initial widths of 30 and 100 m with constant discharge and without sediment input fig 11 the evolution of the experimental and virtual channels followed similar trends fig 11 but the experiment covered about half the evolution compared to the model both experimental and virtual channels tend to attain a similar final wet width around 20 cm for the experimental channels and falling between 33 and 44 m for the virtual ones table 3 this gives confidence that the results of the numerical tests can indeed be used to complement the experimental ones although in a qualitative way the experiments considered scenarios with variable discharge and sediment feeding cases that were not reproduced with the numerical model for graded sediment the results indicate that the widths tended to converge figs 3 and 4 without sediment feed the final width appears governed by discharge variability being about 0 2 m with constant flow zero variability and falling between 0 25 and 0 45 m for the variable discharge regimes figs 3b 3c and 3d considering that the experiments with variable discharge ended well before reaching morphodynamic equilibrium if we qualitatively compare fig 4 to the model results of fig 5 although with uniform sediment we can observe that the discharge variability has a stronger effect during the evolution phase rather than on the final width this means that even for the case without sediment feed the effects of discharge variability are most probably less than the experiments would indicate moreover from the experiments it seems that the final width would be only slightly larger with the high peak regimes h2 and h3 than with the low peak regime h1 in combination with sediment feed the effects of discharge variability on wet width becomes visible only as an oscillation being the final width close to 0 6 m with constant flow and between 0 4 and 0 75 m with all the variable flow regimes figs 4b 4c and 4d with constant flow the introduction of sediment feed tripled the final channel width from 0 2 to 0 6 m compare figs 3a and 4a in case of variable flow the introduction of sediment feed less than doubled the channel width i e from 0 25 to 0 45 m to 0 4 0 75 m so the effects of having variable flow instead of constant flow remain important the peak flows rework bars and the low flows deepen the channels between the bars concentrating the sediment transport and reducing further channel widening it is important to note that overbank flow did not occur during the experiments since the channels quickly widened through bank erosion so that the flow remained confined 5 4 equilibrium channel width predictors if the sediment input rate is smaller than the initial sediment transport capacity of the flow the results of this investigation suggest that the equilibrium channel width solely depends on boundary conditions this is also true for the active width of the braided channels obtained with sediment supply larger than the initial transport capacity of the flow but not for their braid belt extension which depends on intermediate morphological evolutions this supports the use of equilibrium width predictors considering that they are designed for applications on single thread channels with the purpose of analyzing the performance of predictors the width of the experimental and virtual single thread channels was computed using the approaches of bray 1982 parker et al 2007 and millar 2005 note that these predictors consider the bankfull discharge as the formative one bray

diameter m g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 and v is the flow velocity m s since flow variability is found to increase the channel width the value of the discharge should be defined with care for this either the average discharge or the peak discharges as suggested by vargas luna et al 2019 are used for the experimental channels using the averaged discharge of 0 4 l s which is equal to the constant flow the predictors of bray 1982 parker et al 2007 and millar 2005 estimate an equilibrium width of 0 29 m 0 22 m and 0 29 m respectively representing the bankfull discharge by the peak discharge the estimated equilibrium widths become slightly larger 0 33 m 0 25 m and 0 34 m for hydrograph h1e fig 1 0 36 m 0 27 m and 0 39 m for hydrograph h2e and 0 41 m 0 31 m and 0 47 m for hydrograph h3e respectively the predictions overestimate the widths obtained in the laboratory with constant flow and no sediment feed 20 cm but underestimate the width of the channels with sediment feed and variable discharge 50 75 cm the underestimations can be partly justified since many experiments were terminated beforehand at the start of their incision narrowing phases before the widths converged moreover the experimental channels had unvegetated banks whereas the predictors of brey 1982 and parker et al 2007 were calibrated on existing rivers all presenting some type of riparian vegetation as well as some bank cohesion riparian vegetation controls the channel width in such a way that higher vegetation density results in narrower channels e g hey and thorne 1986 for the virtual channels using the average discharge of 300 m3 s bray 1982 parker et al 2007 and millar 2005 estimate equilibrium widths of 83 m 59 m and 104 m respectively using the peak discharges their estimates become 93 m and 102 m bray 65 m and 71 m parker et al 121 m and 138 m millar for the two hydrographs h1m and h2m respectively for comparison the computed final width of the single thread channels obtained with uniform sediment and input rates smaller than the initial transport capacity was 48 55 m with constant flow and 60 70 m with variable flow table 3 with graded sediment the computed channel width reduced to 33 44 m with sediment supply larger than the initial transport capacity of the flow all final channels were braided table 3 which means that the predictors cannot be applied for those cases however the active width of these channels was about 50 m in general all predictors tend to overestimate the width of the virtual channels this could be attributed to the model limitations in representing bank erosion particularly of incising channels section 5 5 in any case for both experimental and virtual channels predicted and computed widths have the same order of magnitude 5 5 model limitations bank erosion is a complex geotechnical process affected by soil type vegetation and ground water table among other and plays an important role in channel widening delft3d uses a relatively simple algorithm for simulating bank erosion based on partial re distribution of erosion from a wet cell to the adjacent dry cell this somehow mimics the fact that toe bed erosion increases bank instability a drawback of this scheme is that it does not work well as the water decreases and becomes lower than the bank top level during channel incision so even though the channel incised to a much deeper level the bank does retreat i e it does not become wet and thus does not become a part of the channel in the model these limitations in the bank erosion scheme might have affected the actual simulated morphological development the deviation of sediment transport direction due to gravity effects on a sloping bed is an important phenomenon shaping the two dimensional riverbed topography considering a sloping near bank river bed if the effects are overestimated the result is excessive channel widening due to excess of sediment displaced from the bank to the adjacent river bed and an unrealistically flat bed topography whereas if the value is underestimated the results is unrealistic channel incision and lower channel widening in our research we opted for a medium bed slope effect which gave sufficient representation of the process considering these two factors affecting bank retreat the computational algorithm for bank erosion and the gravity effect we conclude that the quantitative results present inaccuracy leading to uncertainty nevertheless we believe that the model captures well the morphological trends and is able to distinguish the simulated scenarios 5 6 applicability of the results the results of this study present some practical aspects such as the importance of initial width for the intermediate morphological evolutions of river channels most real rivers find themselves in this intermediate situation since they are not in morphodynamic equilibrium focusing on single thread channels the initially narrower ones experience an important widening aggradation phase followed by incision with reduced width adjustments slight widening or narrowing before reaching their equilibrium configuration the initially wider channels present a short phase with some widening and aggradation but their main evolution trend is incision narrowing the final width of single thread channels appears to depend on boundary conditions water and sediment inflow rather than on initial conditions since the 1980s many rivers are now re naturalized by removal of bank protection works for instance in europe and u s a e g kondolf et al 2013 friedl et al 2015 schmitt et al 2018 onema 2018 european center for river restoration www ecrr org the river restoration center http www therrc co uk these rivers were once narrowed and at the moment of bank protection removal find themselves in the situation of the initially narrower channels re naturalized rivers show indeed an initial widening phase which might create worries to local managers due to the extent of widening and subsequent loss of valuable land e g duró et al 2020 this study shows that after the initial widening phase accompanied by bed aggradation there will be an incision phase with much reduced channel widening or even narrowing our study cannot give any indications on relative bed level changes because both the experiments and the virtual rivers started with an imposed bed level which was not the result of morphological adaptation i e the initial river channels were not in an equilibrium state however the results of our study indicate that the narrower initial channels end up with higher bed levels compared to the initially wider ones all this is supported by theory jansen et al 1979 duró et al 2016 another application regards dammed rivers that after having their channels adapted to sediment shortage normally by incision and narrowing start to receive regular sediment by dam flushing kondolf et al 2014 dahal et al 2021 in this case rivers are often in the situation of having a sediment input that is larger than the initial sediment transport capacity of their flow and at the same time have narrow channels for these rivers our study indicates an evolutionary trend towards braiding with the development of a braid belt that is larger for the initially narrower channels and bed aggradation 6 conclusions the work describes the morphological evolution of initial straight channels carved in cohesionless unvegetated gravel beds with different widths and sediment characteristics under the forcing of combinations of flow regime and sediment input the goal is to establish whether the reach averaged width of gravel bed rivers might depend on the conditions at the start of their morphological evolution for braided systems the analysis distinguishes the active channel width where sediment transport occurs from the braid belt extension indicating the width of the reworked floodplain for single thread channels the analysis considers the wet width the work includes a set of laboratory experiments and the simulation of several scenarios with a two dimensional morphodynamic model derived by upscaling the experiments with the goal of replicating and extending the laboratory investigation but at the scale of a real river braided systems formed if the sediment supply was larger than the average transport capacity of the initial channel their braid belt extension was found to depend on their initial width the larger the initial channel the larger the braid belt but with one exception the channel starting with the smallest width produced the largest braid belt of all this was the only case in which overbank flow occurred and reworked the floodplain chute channel formation rather than channel widening through bank erosion appears here to be the most important factor affecting the braid belt extension so the dependency on initial width might only be valid in the absence of overbank flow and chute channel excavation the results of both model and flume experiments show that the sediment supply governs the final planform of gravel bed rivers higher sediment supply resulted in larger braid belts the initially narrow channels being more sensitive towards the amount of sediment supply than the initially wider ones about the sediment transport width the results of this work confirm bertoldi et al 2009 conclusion that the active width of braided systems is dominated by the stream power i e discharge and slope single thread channels formed if the sediment supply at the upstream boundary was below the average transport capacity of the channels for the same boundary conditions these channels ended up with similar reach averaged widths discharge variability seems to have a much stronger effect during the channel evolution phase than on final width the application of width predictors to the experimental and virtual single thread channels show that the ones proposed by bray 1982 parker et al 2007 and millar 2005 overestimate the width of the virtual channels and of the experimental channels with constant discharge and without sediment feed instead they underestimate the width of the experimental channels with sediment feed and variable discharge in any case the predicted and measured computed widths have the same order of magnitude and the differences can be explained by the experimental settings and model limitations this work therefore supports the use of width predictors for single thread gravel bed rivers the initial widths affected the final average bed levels the narrower initial channels became on average higher indicating that the initial channel width may affect the degree of channel incision or aggradation it is likely though that on the long term the bed level of all the channels adjusts to the downstream boundary conditions the results of this work showing how the river width evolves before reaching its final value can be useful for river restoration

allowed describing the type of rivers that was reproduced in the flume e g garcia 2008 establishing the characteristics of the hypothetical real river represented by the flume experiments was done on the average final configuration of the channels belonging to scenario ue table 1 the artificially imposed starting width and straight alignment did not allow to do this in the design phase of the experiments assuming turbulent flow similar flow and sediment mobility are obtained if the froude and the shields numbers have the same values geometric similarity is necessary to well represent depth dependent processes like the deviation of sediment transport direction by transverse bed slope and bank erosion in addition imposing the same width to depth ratio is necessary to obtain a similar 2d morphodynamic behavior since bar characteristics primarily depend on this ratio tubino and seminara 1990 as an alternative similarity in 2d morphodynamic can be obtained by imposing the same value of the interaction parameter struiksma et al 1985 kleinhans et al 2015a or of the bar mode crosato and mosselman 2009 which are both dependent on width to depth ratio and sediment mobility the experiments were upscaled using the principles described above imposing to the upscaled channel the same longitudinal slope bed roughness froude and shields numbers interaction parameter and bar mode of the experiment and the geometric scale of 215 chosen to represent a typical mountain river size following the approach of le et al 2018 the obtained hypothetical river characteristics were then compared to the ones of existing river reaches reported in the literature table a 1 to establish the level of realism of the experiment and to select the most resembling real river case for the setup of the morphodynamic model the downstream reach of the river arc france described by jaballah et al 2015 is the real case with the highest resemblance to the upscaled experimental channel both have relatively steep bed slopes around 0 6 but the arc river has smaller median sediment size although still in the range of cobbles for both the upscaled channel and the arc river the shields parameter falls between 0 01 and 0 2 which according to garcia 2008 is typical of gravel bed rivers at conditions close to initiation of sediment motion or comparatively low mobility the discharge of 300 m3 s corresponding to a 10 year return period flood of the arc river is comparable to the upscaled constant discharge this indicates that the constant flow experiments represented rivers with continuous high flow conditions the low flow stages of the experiments with variable discharge represented medium stages of real rivers in mountain rivers high discharges are responsible for most morphological changes vargas luna et al 2019 however our experiments have indicated that medium flow stages are important for thalweg forming and bar reworking using relatively high discharges is therefore acceptable bearing in mind the scope of this investigation which focuses on the long term evolution of trends and processes governing the channel formation of gravel bed rivers towards equilibrium without considering the time scale for these changes to occur appendix b sensitivity analyses several sensitivity runs were performed on the virtual channel of um 30 to select the suitable model parameters during the test parameters of interest was varied by holding other parameters constant two commonly used formulations in delft3d to represent the transverse bed slope effect are formulation of ikeda 1982 as in van rijn 1993 and the formulation of koch flokstra s 1980 extended by talmon et al 1995 knf fig b 1 a shows the comparison between these two formulations focusing on channel width evolution small transverse bed slope effect produced small bars narrow channels with high incision and less channel widening while high bed slope effect had the opposite effect with much higher channel widening schuurman et al 2018 represented by two typical sets of parameters singh et al 2017 with knf formulation fig b 1a for our virtual channels the parametrization with ikeda formulation abn 1 5 default value in delft 3d seemed suitable with respect to the extent of channel widening and incision as compared to knf formulation the default value of horizontal eddy viscosity 10 m2 s did not satisfy the model stability criteria as described in deltares 2018 mainly due to the fine grid size of the models the value of 1 m2 s underestimated channel widening and sediment transport rates and resulted in an increase of flow velocity in shallow areas and a decrease in the deeper parts the values of 0 1 m2 s and 0 01 m2 s resulted in similar acceptable velocity distributions and width development fig b 1b so a value of 0 1 m2 s was chosen for the horizontal eddy viscosity the virtual river represented a gravel bed river dominated by bed load transport three sediment transport formulas particularly suitable for the computation of coarse sand and gravel transport rates mayer peter muller 1948 mpm ashida and michiue 1972 anm and wong parker 2006 wp were compared based on channel width evolution fig b 1c the formula by wong parker 2006 eq 1 was the one that best represented the sediment transport in the experimental channel as well as in the river arc mpm produced no widening due to form factor which affects the sediment mobility schuurman et al 2013 anm and wp produced similar widening but anm resulted in much higher incision fig b 1d compares the channel width evolution obtained using a morphological accelerator equal to 5 morfac 5 a way to save computational time roelvink 2006 and the channel width obtained without morphological accelerator morfac 1 the results show that for the scenarios with constant discharge the morphological development could be accelerated by a factor of 5 without losing important information so for these cases a simulation of 10 days represents the morphological development of 50 computational days with the selected set of parameters the trends in morphological evolution of the virtual river were similar to the ones observed in the experimental channel and were used to set up the model supplementary materials supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi 10 1016 j

119,assuming that the equilibrium geometry of river channels does not depend on their initial state but solely on boundary conditions several formulas have been derived that relate the channel depth and width to the river bankfull discharge and bed material however due to the existence of a threshold for sediment motion and the strong non linearity between sediment transport and flow rate this assumption might not be generally valid for gravel bed rivers this research clarifies the role of the initial conditions more specifically the initial channel width on the geometry of gravel bed rivers considering a variety of boundary conditions the approach includes laboratory experiments and two dimensional modeling reproducing the evolution of alluvial channels with different starting widths discharge regimes and sediment input rates the experiments represent the arc river france thus the characteristics of this river were used in the numerical model to obtain a realistic virtual case complementing the experiments different boundary and starting conditions resulted in either braided or single thread channels we found that the initial width strongly influences the evolution process and leaves a footprint on the river braid belt extension the active width of braided systems and the width of single thread channels do not depend on the starting condition they depend on sediment input rather than on discharge variability different initial widths result in different final bed levels this indicates that the initial channel width may affect the degree of channel incision or aggradation the results of this study justify the use of equilibrium formulas for single thread rivers keywords river channel formation gravel bed rivers delft3d morphodynamic modeling initial conditions boundary conditions active width braid belt extension 1 introduction stable channels having reach averaged geometry that can be considered constant belong to river reaches in morphodynamic equilibrium the geometry of stable river channels has been described using the regime theory kennedy 1895 lacey 1930 leopold and maddock 1953 parker et al 2007 extremal hypothesis griffiths 1984 singh 2003 and mechanistic approaches parker 1978b several empirical relations have been formulated to determine the reach averaged channel width and depth as a function of bankfull discharge leopold and maddock 1953 williams 1978 parker 1979 emmett and wolman 2001 or as the formative discharge having a certain return time normally 1 5 to 2 years e g vargas luna et al 2019 some formulas also include a dependency on sediment size and other physical features such as riparian vegetation characteristics e g millar 2005 bray 1982 garde et al 2001 millar 2005 parker et al 2007 and kaless et al 2014 derived formulas for gravel bed rivers wilkerson and parker 2011 for sand bed rivers whereas eaton and church 2007 and booker 2010 for both gravel bed and sand bed rivers among others a review is presented by gleason 2015 by relating the equilibrium channel geometry to discharge and other river characteristics these formulas assume that the equilibrium channel configuration solely depends on boundary conditions which means that it is unaffected by the conditions at the start of the morphological evolution however this might not be true especially for gravel bed rivers due to the presence of a clear threshold between sediment motion and non motion shields 1936 garcia 2008 and to the strong non linearity of bed load as a function of flow velocity particularly at the conditions close to initiation of motion meyer peter and müller 1948 starting from a narrow rather than wide channel could thus result in a totally different morphological evolution and probably also in a different long term river configuration different starting widths imply different water depths flow distributions and sediment transport rates affecting sediment outputs and thus also the sediment balance the flow width to depth ratio is the major factor influencing the formation of bars which in turn affect bank erosion and thus the channel width engelund 1970 crosato 2009 kleinhans et al 2011 the initial channel width is therefore crucial in defining sediment transport and channel characteristics at the beginning of the morphological evolution and might interact with the boundary conditions water and sediment inputs and outputs in a non linear way influencing the evolution path and the new equilibrium channel geometry blench 1969 mosselman 2004 various works studied the effect of boundary conditions on the geometry of gravel bed rivers the importance of sediment supply was first realized by schumm et al 1972 who demonstrated that sediment feed reduction causes incision and affects the planform of laboratory channels this was later confirmed by wickert et al 2013 pfeiffer et al 2017 métivier et al 2017 and vargas luna et al 2019 the effect of discharge was studied by parker et al 2003 van de lageweg et al 2013 blom et al 2017 schuurman et al 2018 and vargas luna et al 2019 who emphasized the role of flow variability for the width evolution of gravel bed river system works dealing with the effects of initial conditions are relatively less some work deals with tidal embayment e g van maanen et al 2013 in the case of rivers stecca et al 2022 studied the role of initial bed perturbations on the distribution of channels and shoals in braided systems however the effect of initial conditions on reach scale river geometry has not been analysed yet whereas it could be significant for gravel bed rivers it is thus not clear whether gravel bed rivers retain the footprint of their starting conditions in their morphology in such a case the formulas derived to assess the bankfull width and depth of stable gravel bed channels may present important limitations this study analyses the evolution of un vegetated gravel bed river systems towards equilibrium departing from different channel widths in combination with different flow regimes and sediment input rates the analysis focuses on the evolution of the reach averaged channel width and bed level as well as the river planform the work includes a set of laboratory experiments and the simulation of several scenarios with a two dimensional 2d morphodynamic model developed using the open source delft3d code the model reproduces the morphodynamic behavior of a realistic virtual gravel bed river derived by upscaling the experimental channels the larger freedom that numerical models offer has allowed complementing the experiments by including additional scenarios and expanding the domain considering for instance different sediment characteristics and longer time of evolution 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments six sets of laboratory experiments were conducted whose layouts and test duration were designed to specifically study the evolution of initially straight channels towards morphodynamic equilibrium starting from different widths with several discharge regimes and sediment input rates singh 2015 attention was paid in producing the typical sediment mobility of gravel bed rivers by selecting sediment and flow characteristics through a number of preliminary tests the experiments were carried out in the laboratory of fluid mechanics of the delft university of technology in a 5 m long 1 24 m wide and 0 4 m deep flume water was recirculated from outlet to the inlet of the flume whereas sediment was fed at the inlet at constant rates the flume was filled with non uniform sand having median grain size d50 equal to 1 mm fig 1 b and a straight rectangular channel 4 cm deep with longitudinal slope of 1 and width of 4 10 25 or 40 cm was excavated in the middle of the flume before the start of each test the first two widths are considered narrow resulting in initial conditions below the threshold for bar formation engelund 1970 colombini et al 1987 tubino and seminara 1990 crosato and mosselman 2009 and the last two are deemed wide above the threshold of bar formation the experiments followed the morphological adaptation of each channel as a response to different water and sediment inflow focusing on reach averaged width bed level and planform four discharge hydrographs including a constant flow hydrograph ue and two sediment input regimes were implemented hydrographs h1e and h2e only differed in amplitude whereas h3e representing a rather intense but short flow had high discharge of shorter duration the same volume of water was discharged in the constant flow and in the variable flow tests through the duration of entire high low flow cycles fig 1a video camera records taken from a nearly orthogonal position allowed following the channel evolution for the constant flow tests images were extracted from the videos at intervals of 30 min for the variable flow tests images were extracted at the end of each low and high flow stages highlighting the contours of the wet channel by coloured water fig 1c these images were then used to quantify the temporal variation of reach averaged wet channel width section 2 3 point 2 which was measured perpendicular to the channel centreline at intervals of 0 2 m in the central 3 m of the flume thus removing the first and the last meter of flume close to the boundaries note that if the channel was braided the wet width also included some dry areas corresponding to emerging bar tops fig 1c and for most cases it covered the lateral extent of the area where the morphological process had occurred cross section profiles were measured every 50 cm after 2 h and at the end of each test by laser scanning this required to briefly stop the water flow after 2 h table 1 summarizes the initial and boundary conditions of each of the 20 tests that were carried out the experiments had duration of 7 h the tests with variable discharge were carried out only for the initial widths of 10 and 40 cm for these the flow cycles shown in fig 1a were repeated 10 times in most cases with sediment supply the channel widened very rapidly and soon touched the side walls of the flume so that these tests had to be terminated earlier 2 2 numerical modeling the numerical simulations were carried out on virtual channels having reach scale characteristics similar to the arc river in france best resemblance to the experimental channels but not a scaled model starting with different widths in combination with various inflow conditions the objective was not to replicate or validate the experiments but to compliment them by extending the study at a real river scale unaffected by scale issues to design the virtual river the average final configuration of the experimental channels ue case was upscaled and compared with rivers described in the literature appendix a 2 2 1 model description the numerical simulations were carried out using the open source software delft3d www deltares nl this software allows performing morphodynamic computations by solving unsteady shallow water equations and sediment transport formulas to obtain bed level changes as well as changes in bed material characteristics singh et al 2017 the models built for this research are based on a two dimensional 2d depth averaged version of the basic equations parameterizing the effects of 3d flow features models in this form have been successfully used to investigate morphological developments at a reach scale by crosato and saleh 2011 schuurman et al 2013 singh et al 2017 among others a detailed description of the software and of the mathematical equations and corresponding numerical schemes are provided by deltares 2018 2 2 2 model setup the spatial domain of the models was represented by a straight alluvial corridor 1500 m long and 300 or 400 m wide depending on scenario with initial longitudinal bed slope of 0 6 and sediment either composed of cobbles with uniform size or graded table 2 the granulometric curve of the sediment was obtained from the upscaled value of the experimental d50 imposing a similar size distribution the uniform sediment size coincided with the median dimeter d50 of the graded sediment fig 2 b additional 1000 m were added upstream and downstream of the study reach to minimize numerical error propagation from the boundaries resulting in a 3500 m long model domain that was discretized in a rectangular computational grid having cell size of 5 m 2 5 m l x w the grid was finer in transverse direction to better represent bank erosion williams et al 2016 a trapezoidal shaped straight 6 m deep initial channel with a flatbed was carved in the middle of the alluvial corridor with side slope of 1v 1 67h the average bottom width of the excavated channel vaired accroding to scenario model parameters were selected to best represent the trends and processes observed in the experiments some through several sensitivity runs performed on a virtual channel um 30 whereas some using typical suitable values for modeling rivers the results of the sensitivity runs are presented in appendix b to parameterize the flow resistance due to 3d turbulence and horizontal motion the eddy viscosity vh was assigned the value of 0 1 m2 s whereas sediment transport was simulated using the formula of wong and parker 2006 provided in eq 1 1 q s 4 93 δ g d 50 3 θ θ c r 1 6 where qs represents volume rate of total bed load transport per unit width without pores m2 s δ represents the submerged specific gravity of sediment g is the acceleration due to gravity m2 s d50 the median sediment size m θ the shields parameter with θcr being the critical shields parameter taken as 0 047 in general the direction of bed load doesn t coincide with the computed direction of depth averaged flow velocity because of the effects of gravity on bed slopes commonly known as the bed slope effect baar et al 2019 in this study bagnold s 1966 was used to model the effects of longitudinal bed slope and the formulation of ikeda 1982 as in van rijn 1993 was used to model the effects of transverse bed slope eq 2 2 q n q s a b n θ c r θ z b n where qn is the additional bed load transport vector in n direction due to gravity on transverse bed slope m2 s per unit width qs is the magnitude of the bed load transport vector in s direction adjusted for longitudinal bed slope only m2 s abn is a calibration coefficient zb is the bed level m and n is the transverse coordinate perpendicular to the coordinate s m the sediment transport direction is also affected by the spiral flow that develops in river bends which tends to move the sediment particles towards the inner bend opposite to the bed slope effect which pushes the sediment particles towards the outer bend towards the pool schuurman et al 2013 to parameterize the effects of spiral flow this study adopted the formulation by struiksma et al 1985 the bed level changes were computed according to exner s principle i e assuming that the sediment transport immediately adapts to changes in flow velocity approach that is valid for bed load dominated channels typical of gravel bed rivers bank erosion was modeled though the dry cell wet cell algorithm available in delft 3d redistributing the near bank bed erosion based on the value imposed to a specific coefficient 0 8 in our case the algorithm establishes the portion of bed erosion that is computed for a wet cell at the channel margin to be assigned to the adjacent dry cell bank this algorithm somehow reflects the physical process that near bank bed erosion increases bank instability in the model wet and dry cells are identified based on a threshold water depth which for this study was set equal to 10 cm such scheme for bank erosion has been successfully implemented in schuurman et al 2013 williams et al 2016 among many others for the bed roughness the manning coefficient of 0 045 m 1 3 s ensured a chezy roughness coefficient ranging between 20 and 30 m1 2 s in agreement with both the experimental channels and the arc river jaballh et al 2015 the hydrodynamic time step for the computations was 1 2 s ensuring the stability of the model in delft 3d the morphological changes can be accelerated by means of a specified factor morfac to save computation time roelvink 2006 for the constant discharge scenarios a morfac of 5 was used after ensuring that it does not significantly alter the morphological process appendix b so for these cases a simulation of 10 days represents the morphological development of 50 computational days for the scenario with graded sediment the granulometric curve fig 2b was divided in three equal fractions in terms of volume delft3d calculates the mean sediment diameter of each fraction and applies the prescribed sediment transport formula separately the sediment continuity model proposed by hirano 1971 was applied dividing the bed in active and substrate layers of thickness 0 5 m and 1 87 m respectively following singh et al 2017 to mimic the hiding and exposure phenomenon the models used the formulation of parker et al 1982 where a correction factor applied to the sediment transport formula increases the critical shield number of the finer sediment fractions reducing their entrainment rates hiding and decreases the one of the coarser fractions increasing their entrainment rates exposure the total duration of the simulations was selected based on pre runs with the goal of achieving stable channels for the cases without sediment feed ending up as single thread channels the width of the channels presented very small changes after 50 days however at that point the average sediment transport and the bed slope were still decreasing at a consistent rate but their changes became negligible after 70 days for the cases with sediment feed ending up as braided channels the duration of the computations had to be increased to 100 days at that point the average sediment transport of the reach had achieved a dynamic equilibrium fluctuating around the input value note that in all cases the computational days cannot be linked to the real river time considering that the value of the model discharges corresponds to short duration high flows not selected on the basis of arc river s statistics this shortcoming is considered acceptable because the focus of the work is to assess whether the configuration of stable gravel bed rivers depends on initial conditions and not the temporal scales 2 2 3 model scenarios model scenarios were formulated with difference combination of starting widths and upstream boundary conditions table 2 for the upstream hydrodynamic boundary condition three idealized hydrographs fig 2a were formulated each one differing in amplitude but with the same duration and total volume of water inflow the sediment input from upstream was either constant nil or equilibrium amount of bed load with either the same size as the material forming the virtual channel and gravel plain or with a smaller size the downstream boundary conditions were a constant water level derived for the initial channel and the sediment output was computed at the end of the model domain the constant sediment feed rates in the model were proportional to the ones in the corresponding experiments derived using the relation presented in eq 3 3 s e t e s m t m where s represents the sediment feed at the upstream boundary and t represents the sediment transport capacity of the narrowest initial channel computed using eq 1 subscript e means experiment and m is for model for the equilibrium sediment input the bed load rate was equal to the transport capacity of the flow at the upstream boundary calculated by the model at the upstream boundary based on the prescribed sediment transport formula eq 1 the values of initial width to be imposed to the virtual channels were derived based on geometric proportionality between experimental and virtual channels the ratio between the average final width for the scenario ue i e 0 2 m and the respective initial widths of the experimental channels was applied to the width of the river arc downstream reach where the river due to upstream damming has a strongly reduced bedload input jaballah et al 2015 similar to the experiments the widths of 10 m and 30 m represented narrow initial channels i e below the threshold for bar formation while the initial widths of 60 m and 100 m represent the wide initial channels 2 2 4 analysis of the results for gravel bed river systems bertoldi et al 2009 indicate three different widths which was the basis of our analysis 1 the braid belt extension being the transverse extension of the morphologically active area howard 1996 limaye 2020 this is here taken as the lateral extent of the area in which the morphological changes have occurred 2 the wet river width defined as the lateral extent of the water surface at the bankfull condition parker et al 2007 or at another defined discharge which includes also emerging areas in between 3 the active channel width defined as the width of the portion of channel contributing to bed load transport this could not be measured in the laboratory channels for the study reach excluding the first and last 1000 m of the model domain widths were computed at each cross section 5 m apart and averaged to obtain reach averaged width width and bed adaptation interact and influence each other during channel evolution so the evolution of the virtual channels was also analyzed as a combination of relative changes in average width and bed level showing four distinct phases aggradation widening aggradation narrowing incision narrowing and incision widening the relative change in average width was computed as the difference between reach averaged evolved and initial width the change in average bed level with respect to initial value at each cross section was averaged to obtain relative change in bed level of the reach 3 results of the laboratory experiments 3 1 without sediment input fig 3 shows the width evolution of the channels having different discharge regimes constant and variable with the same average and total flow volumes without sediment feed at the upstream boundary despite starting from different initial widths all channels with constant flow ue scenarios table 1 evolved in single thread systems ending up with a reach averaged wet width of about 20 cm fig 3a however the initially narrower ue 0 04 and ue 0 1 and wider ue 0 25 and ue 0 4 channels presented different evolution paths the initially narrower channels started their evolution with rapid widening followed by widening at progressively smaller rates fast widening resulted in high sediment input bank erosion products to the channel and bed aggradation followed by bed incision as the widening rate slowed down during the latest stage of evolution among the initially wider channels ue 0 25 presented slow channel widening and bed aggradation for the first 4 5 h after achieving a width of about 30 cm the channel started to narrow due to localized bed erosion ue 0 4 had initially a shallow flow distributed over the entire width and started producing some concentrated bed erosion which gradually progressed downstream the eroded sediment initially was accumulated more downstream and was later partly removed by the flow channel narrowing by bed erosion was the dominant process towards the end of the experiment to study the effects of variable flow the tests included the evolution of two channels with initial widths of 10 cm and 40 cm figs 3b 3c and 3d starting with a channel of 10 cm the wet width development shows that the regimes with the highest flow peaks h3e 0 1 and h2e 0 1 presented similar width oscillations the wet width being a function of discharge to end up with a similar width of about 35 cm fig 3c and 3d gray lines corresponding to a 75 increase compared to the constant flow width the variable discharge regime with the smallest peak h1e had initial evolution similar to the constant flow case ue 0 1 but in h1e 0 1 the channel continued to widen and finally resulted in a 25 wider channel i e with a wet width of 25 cm instead of the 20 cm of the uniform flow scenarios figs 3a and 3b gray lines with a starting width of 40 cm figs 3b 3c and 3d black continuous lines the h1e 0 4 and h3e 0 4 scenarios had similar evolution trends and ended up with 140 wider channels 48 cm compared to the uniform flow scenarios 20 cm these hydrographs had low flows with similar discharges 0 3 and 0 28 l s but with different duration 20 and 28 5 min respectively they had strongly differed high stage flows 0 8 l s h3e for a duration of 10 min and 0 5 l s h1e for a duration of 20 min in the h2e 0 4 scenario with smaller low discharge 0 2 l s for 20 min and an intermediate high discharge of 0 6 l s for 20 min instead the channel slightly narrowed from 40 to 38 cm resulting in a 90 increase with respect to the final width of the uniform flow scenario 20 cm in general all channels having the same flow regime without sediment feed show a tendency towards a similar width if this is true the final width would be independent from the initial one and only dependent on flow regime extrapolating the width evolution curves we can observe that the final width of the cannels would fall between 20 and 50 cm for all flow regimes in all tests the high stage flows occupied almost the entire width of the channel whereas the low flows occupied only the deepest parts the low flows of hydrographs h1e and h3e had enough intensity and duration to rework the bars that formed during the high discharge stages and to locally erode the banks the next high discharge further reworked the bed and eroded the banks resulting in channel widening the higher flow peak with smaller duration of hydrograph h3e had effects that were similar to the lower but longer peak of hydrograph h1e instead the lower discharge of hydrograph h2e was not sufficient to rework the bars formed during the high stage discharge and eroded the channel bed only in its deeper parts further confining the low flow the next high discharge reworked the bed across the entire width of the channel but continued to erode also the deepest parts of the channel bed erosion started near the upstream boundary and advanced further downstream incision led to channel width reduction these results indicate that the channel width depended on both high and low discharges with the low flows having an important role in bar reworking and thalweg deepening 3 2 with constant sediment input the results of the experimental tests with a constant feed of sediment having the same granulometry as the alluvial corridor are shown in fig 4 these tests produced much wider channels compared to the respective experiments without sediment feed fig 3 final widths of approximately 50 to 75 cm compared to the 20 to 50 cm obtained without sediment feed the evolution of the channels with constant flow ue scenarios table 1 is shown in fig 4a the initially wider channels seem to converge to the width of 60 cm it is not possible to establish whether the initially narrower ones would also converge to the same width these channels ue 0 04 and ue 0 1 presented rapid widening and bed aggradation for the first 30 min bars started to appear after this period when the critical width to depth ratio for the formation of alternate bars exceeded bank erosion at pools produced sinuous and wider channels as the channels continued to widen complex mid channel bars formed a sign that at that point also the critical width to depth ratio for central bar formation had been reached these tests had to be terminated well before reaching morphodynamic equilibrium because the channel margins touched the sides of the flume the initially wider channels ue 0 25 and ue 0 4 started with higher width to depth ratios so the first 30 min were already characterized by the development of alternate bars followed by mid channel bars the growth of bars enhanced bank erosion resulting in wider multi thread channels similar phenomena of channel widening were also observed by ashmore 1982 in laboratory channels and by jang shimizu 2005 in numerical simulations as widening progressed multiple bars were observed to migrate in downstream direction initially ue 0 25 presented higher widening rates than ue 0 4 but after 4 h both channels evolved at similar widening rates both resulting in reach averaged widths of about 60 cm even though the final channel widths were similar ue 0 25 ended up with higher channel bed levels than ue 0 4 in general the channels having the same flow and sediment supply regime seem to converge towards a similar width independently from their initial one but the experiments were not long enough to exclude divergence in the final stages of morphological development variable discharges figs 4b 4c and 4d produces wider channels than constant flow but in general channel widening appears dominated by sediment input however many tests with variable discharge had to be terminated after 5 h because the channel touched the sides of the flume for the same reason the results of h3e 0 1 became not reliable after 3 h already 4 numerical model results the evolution of the initially straight channels passed through various phases the initial and final widths and the final planforms types are listed in table 3 the initial and final planforms are presented in the supplementary materials 4 1 without sediment input fig 5 shows the reach averaged width evolution of the channels that formed without sediment supply under different discharge regimes all channels evolved in single thread incised rivers with measurable differences in width mainly depending on flow hydrograph as expected variable flows resulted in expansion and contraction of wet areas the final width of the channels that formed under variable flow resulted systematically larger than with constant flow with higher flow variability resulting in a wider channel but only slightly this was also observed by vargas luna et al 2019 in their laboratory experiments for uniform sediment and either constant fig 5a or variable discharge fig 5c and 5d the channels clearly widened during the initial phases of the model runs and then narrowed with the channels starting with the larger widths of 60 m and 100 m systematically became narrower than the channels that started with the smaller widths of 10 m and 30 m instead with graded sediment and constant discharge fig 5b the larger initial channel ended up slightly wider than the channel that started with a smaller width this could be due to bed armouring that limited the morphological process of incision narrowing see fig 6 and relative discussion it should also be noticed that for the largest initial width sediment heterogeneity also resulted in the downstream part of the channel which was braided however in general the final channels of the scenarios with graded sediment are narrower than with uniform sediment compare fig 5a 5b and table 3 fig 6 shows the combined width and bed level evolutions of the channels if the bed sediment was uniform figs 6a 6c and 6d rapid widening governed the initial phase of the evolution of the channels that started with the smaller widths 10 m and 30 m distributed over an increasingly larger width the flow gradually lost part of its sediment carrying capacity which combined with a high sediment influx form the eroding banks resulted in bed aggradation when bank erosion stopped due to lack of sediment input from upstream the flow started eroding the channel bed initiating an incision phase for the initially wider channels the aggradation widening phase was much shorter due to limited bank erosion again when widening stopped lack of sediment input caused incision and channel narrowing fig 6b shows the evolution of the channels with graded sediment and constant inflow in this case the aggradation widening phase was much reduced compared to the scenarios with constant discharge and uniform sediment the channel starting with the largest width ended up with a higher bed level less incision compared to the one with uniform sediment which can be related to bed armouring due to sediment sorting sun et al 2015 instead the channel starting with the smaller width ended up being narrower with a lower bed level in this case the high sediment carrying capacity of the flow concentrated in the narrower channel transported away the finer fraction rather quickly deepening the channel in the areas with the highest flow rate here the high velocity resulted in full mobility of the coarsest fractions causing some extra channel incision regarding the effects of variable flow for the same initial width higher flow variability resulted in slightly higher widening and less incision 4 2 with sediment input fig 7 shows the reach averaged width evolution for different sediment input regimes at the upstream boundary under constant discharge the constant 265 kg s and the equilibrium sediment input computed as the sediment transport capacity of the flow at the upstream boundary with the same size as the channel bed and banks were larger than the transport capacity of the flow further downstream fig 7a and b as a result the channels widened significantly with high bed aggradation leading to a braided planform instead a constant input of 265 kg s with finer sediment of uniform size 2 cm was on average smaller than the sediment carrying capacity of the channels fig 7c and resulted in much narrower single thread incised channels figs 7a and 7b show that different starting channel widths resulted in different braid belt extensions for a constant sediment input rate of 265 kg s having the same size 8 cm as the channel bed and banks fig 7a the narrowest initial channel produced the largest braid belt um 10 this channel started widening immediately with high bank erosion rates the intense bed aggradation that followed initiated overbank flow and channel excavation though the alluvial corridor after the 40th day producing the widest braid belt similar morphological developments were observed by schuurman et al 2018 the other three starting widths fig 7a and 7b never presented overbank flow of these the widest initial channels um 100 and um e 100 produced also the widest braid belts the equilibrium sediment supply smaller than the constant input produced narrower channels in particular for the narrowest initial channel table 3 constant input of finer sediment fig 7c smaller than the initial sediment capacity of the flow resembles the case without sediment supply fig 5a after initial widening all three channels became incised and single thread with similar wet width the evolution of the active width of the braided channels i e the width of the flow contributing to bedload transport is shown in fig 8 even though the channels produced different braid belt extensions figs 7a and 7b the active widths tend to stabilize and converge to a similar value initial fluctuations were caused by the braiding activity of the channels fig 9 shows the combined width and bed evolution of the channels if the sediment input is larger than the average transport capacity of the flow fig 9a and 9b the channels remain always in the aggradation widening phase with narrower channels experiencing more relative width and bed level changes the narrowest initial channel um 10 presents the highest aggradation the amount of relative aggradation and widening increases with sediment input fig 9a and 9b with finer sediment input which was less than the average transport capacity of the channels the combined evolution is similar to the case with no sediment supply with uniform sediment figs 6a fig 10 shows the effects of variable discharge on the evolution of the reach averaged braid belt extension the scenarios are distinguished by discharge regime h1m and h2m but have the same constant sediment input of 265 kg s same size as alluvial corridor these cases were simulated for a shorter period compared to the constant discharge cases so they do not allow for a long term analysis nevertheless for both hydrographs the braid belt extensions seem to converge irrespective of initial width but they may diverge at a later stage as in the cases with constant discharge fig 7a and 7b 5 discussion 5 1 controls of planform irrespective of boundary conditions both the experimental and the virtual cases starting with the narrower widths shared similar trends at the start of their morphological evolution and so did the ones that started with the larger widths with or without sediment input the initial phase of the narrower systems was characterized by high sediment transport capacity due to flow concentration and high bank erosion resulting in rapid widening and channel aggradation due to the sediment input from bank erosion and in certain cases from the upstream boundary parker 1978a migrating alternate bars appeared after reaching the critical width to depth ratio for bar formation e g engelund 1970 further channel widening led to multiple bar formation resulting in a braided system leopold and wolman 1957 the channel starting with the smallest width 10 m experienced overbank flow because of excessive aggradation for um 10 it was in the form of sheet flow but eventually the flow concentrated into a single channel pitlick et al 2013 whereas for um 10 overbank flow interacted with the floodplain and produced chute channels which dominated the planform development schuurman et al 2018 the initial phase of the wider channels was characterized by low flow velocity not being enough to erode the banks as a consequence the channels did not widen much since the initial width to depth ratio was already larger than the critical one this phase was already characterized by bar development and the channels attained a braided planform relatively early these observations confirm the results of previous studies e g murray and paola 1994 bertoldi et al 2009 sun et al 2015 limaye 2020 for all cases during the last phase with further reduction of bank erosion and lateral sediment input if the sediment input at the upstream boundary was smaller than the carrying capacity of the flow bed erosion in the deepest parts of the channels propagated downstream initiating channel narrowing regardless of starting width this resulted in the final transformation from a wide and braided system to narrow incised single thread channel instead if the sediment input was larger than the carrying capacity of the flow the system remained braided and continued widening but at an increasingly slower rate ideally in the long run sediment mobility would reach the threshold value and channel widening would stop kleinhans et al 2015b limaye 2020 although the first phases of the morphological development were highly dependent on initial width sediment supply seems to be dominant factor for the final river planform this was already suggested by schumm et al 1972 and later by métivier et al 2017 pfeiffer et al 2017 and wickert et al 2013 5 2 controls of lateral extension and bed level single thread incised channels formed with sediment input rates smaller than the sediment transport capacity of the flow for the same boundary conditions these channels ended up with similar reach averaged widths with some differences not retaining the memory of its starting width note that for the scenarios with no sediment input and constant discharge at the upstream boundary the computed final width obtained starting from different values of channel width is similar to the actual width of the arc river 50 m as reported in table a 1 this river is dammed upstream and sediment input is occasional jaballh et al 2015 with constant discharge for the same starting widths higher sediment inputs resulted in wider channels whereas variable flow also resulted in wider channels than constant flow vargas luna et al 2019 but the difference among the variable flow regimes was small table 3 boundary conditions seems to govern the width of single thread channels and not the starting width braided systems formed with sediment input rates that were larger than the sediment transport capacity of the flow according to bertoldi et al 2009 blom et al 2017 schuurman et al 2018 and limaye 2020 the braid belt extension is primarily a function of discharge based on our results we believe that it is also governed by the initial channel width and by the sediment input from upstream we found that with a constant flow discharge the final braid belt extension increased if the initial width increased fig 7 a and b however this is not valid for the smallest initial width which produced the largest braid belt of all this was the only case that presented overbank flow excavating chute channels through the floodplain this process played a major role in the study of schuurman 2018 with overbank flow governed by peak discharges it is possible that the braid belt extension loses its dependency on initial width the final braid belt for um 30 was 25 5 m wider than ume 30 whereas for um 100 and ume 100 it was only 7 4 m thus a larger sediment feed produced a wider braid belt but effected the narrow initial channel more simulation with variable flow and sediment feed were only ran for 60 days shorter than constant discharge case so it we could only analize the medium term evolution the role of initial width is not as distinct as for constant discharge case at this point in evolution comparing the widths at the point where simulation for variable flow ended i e 60th day the widths of h1m 30 and h2m 30 are 19 m and 33 m wider than um 30 but widths of h1m 100 and h2m 100 are only 1 m and 5 m wider than um 100 variable flow resulted in wider braid belt than with constant flow van de lageweg et al 2013 blom et al 2017 schuurman et al 2018 but the effect seems to be more for narrow initial channels note that these results are based on the effects of channel widening through bank erosion since overbank flows did not occur for the 30 and 100 m initial channels about the active width described in section 2 3 bertoldi et al 2009 concluded that it is primarily a function of stream power product of discharge and slope this is supported by our model results showing that the active width converged to a similar value for all the scenarios with the same boundary conditions irrespective of initial conditions even if the final braid belt extension differed fig 8 with the same constant discharge the longitudinal slope of all our virtual channels increased from initial value of 0 6 to final values of around 0 7 this indicates the modelled systems always had a similar stream power and indeed resulted in a similar final active width the initial width is found to affect the final average bed level of the channel narrow initial widths resulted in higher final average bed levels than the wider initial widths true for both aggrading and incising channels which is primarily due to the high input of sediment from bank erosion figs 6 and 9 for single thread incised channel after intermediate widening and aggradation all the channels started to incise from their aggraded bed narrow initial channels had higher aggradation before incision begun so relative to the original bed level they presented higher final bed level than initial wider ones with graded bed material sediment sorting limited incision of initial wider one while increasing that of narrower one thus the channels ended up more or less at the same level also variable flow presented higher relative widening and aggradation thus having less channel incision than with a constant flow in all cases long term progression of the morphological evolution would result in re adaptation of the channel average bed level to the downstream boundary conditions jansen et al 1979 5 3 combined experimental and numerical observations the time scaling ratio suggested by parker et al 2003 and pitlick et al 2013 is 4 t e t m l where te is the experiental time tm is the model time and l is the lenght scale 215 in this case application of eq 4 indicates that 7 h in the experiments corresponded to 102 h 4 days in the numerical simulations the total duration of the model simulations was either 70 days or 100 days which means that in theory the simulations covered a much longer adaptation period the experiments were carried out using non uniform sand and sediment sorting was indeed observed during the evolution of the channels this means that the results of the laboratory study should be compared to the results of the graded sediment scenarios of the numerical investigation umgr which were carried out for the initial widths of 30 and 100 m with constant discharge and without sediment input fig 11 the evolution of the experimental and virtual channels followed similar trends fig 11 but the experiment covered about half the evolution compared to the model both experimental and virtual channels tend to attain a similar final wet width around 20 cm for the experimental channels and falling between 33 and 44 m for the virtual ones table 3 this gives confidence that the results of the numerical tests can indeed be used to complement the experimental ones although in a qualitative way the experiments considered scenarios with variable discharge and sediment feeding cases that were not reproduced with the numerical model for graded sediment the results indicate that the widths tended to converge figs 3 and 4 without sediment feed the final width appears governed by discharge variability being about 0 2 m with constant flow zero variability and falling between 0 25 and 0 45 m for the variable discharge regimes figs 3b 3c and 3d considering that the experiments with variable discharge ended well before reaching morphodynamic equilibrium if we qualitatively compare fig 4 to the model results of fig 5 although with uniform sediment we can observe that the discharge variability has a stronger effect during the evolution phase rather than on the final width this means that even for the case without sediment feed the effects of discharge variability are most probably less than the experiments would indicate moreover from the experiments it seems that the final width would be only slightly larger with the high peak regimes h2 and h3 than with the low peak regime h1 in combination with sediment feed the effects of discharge variability on wet width becomes visible only as an oscillation being the final width close to 0 6 m with constant flow and between 0 4 and 0 75 m with all the variable flow regimes figs 4b 4c and 4d with constant flow the introduction of sediment feed tripled the final channel width from 0 2 to 0 6 m compare figs 3a and 4a in case of variable flow the introduction of sediment feed less than doubled the channel width i e from 0 25 to 0 45 m to 0 4 0 75 m so the effects of having variable flow instead of constant flow remain important the peak flows rework bars and the low flows deepen the channels between the bars concentrating the sediment transport and reducing further channel widening it is important to note that overbank flow did not occur during the experiments since the channels quickly widened through bank erosion so that the flow remained confined 5 4 equilibrium channel width predictors if the sediment input rate is smaller than the initial sediment transport capacity of the flow the results of this investigation suggest that the equilibrium channel width solely depends on boundary conditions this is also true for the active width of the braided channels obtained with sediment supply larger than the initial transport capacity of the flow but not for their braid belt extension which depends on intermediate morphological evolutions this supports the use of equilibrium width predictors considering that they are designed for applications on single thread channels with the purpose of analyzing the performance of predictors the width of the experimental and virtual single thread channels was computed using the approaches of bray 1982 parker et al 2007 and millar 2005 note that these predictors consider the bankfull discharge as the formative one bray

diameter m g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 and v is the flow velocity m s since flow variability is found to increase the channel width the value of the discharge should be defined with care for this either the average discharge or the peak discharges as suggested by vargas luna et al 2019 are used for the experimental channels using the averaged discharge of 0 4 l s which is equal to the constant flow the predictors of bray 1982 parker et al 2007 and millar 2005 estimate an equilibrium width of 0 29 m 0 22 m and 0 29 m respectively representing the bankfull discharge by the peak discharge the estimated equilibrium widths become slightly larger 0 33 m 0 25 m and 0 34 m for hydrograph h1e fig 1 0 36 m 0 27 m and 0 39 m for hydrograph h2e and 0 41 m 0 31 m and 0 47 m for hydrograph h3e respectively the predictions overestimate the widths obtained in the laboratory with constant flow and no sediment feed 20 cm but underestimate the width of the channels with sediment feed and variable discharge 50 75 cm the underestimations can be partly justified since many experiments were terminated beforehand at the start of their incision narrowing phases before the widths converged moreover the experimental channels had unvegetated banks whereas the predictors of brey 1982 and parker et al 2007 were calibrated on existing rivers all presenting some type of riparian vegetation as well as some bank cohesion riparian vegetation controls the channel width in such a way that higher vegetation density results in narrower channels e g hey and thorne 1986 for the virtual channels using the average discharge of 300 m3 s bray 1982 parker et al 2007 and millar 2005 estimate equilibrium widths of 83 m 59 m and 104 m respectively using the peak discharges their estimates become 93 m and 102 m bray 65 m and 71 m parker et al 121 m and 138 m millar for the two hydrographs h1m and h2m respectively for comparison the computed final width of the single thread channels obtained with uniform sediment and input rates smaller than the initial transport capacity was 48 55 m with constant flow and 60 70 m with variable flow table 3 with graded sediment the computed channel width reduced to 33 44 m with sediment supply larger than the initial transport capacity of the flow all final channels were braided table 3 which means that the predictors cannot be applied for those cases however the active width of these channels was about 50 m in general all predictors tend to overestimate the width of the virtual channels this could be attributed to the model limitations in representing bank erosion particularly of incising channels section 5 5 in any case for both experimental and virtual channels predicted and computed widths have the same order of magnitude 5 5 model limitations bank erosion is a complex geotechnical process affected by soil type vegetation and ground water table among other and plays an important role in channel widening delft3d uses a relatively simple algorithm for simulating bank erosion based on partial re distribution of erosion from a wet cell to the adjacent dry cell this somehow mimics the fact that toe bed erosion increases bank instability a drawback of this scheme is that it does not work well as the water decreases and becomes lower than the bank top level during channel incision so even though the channel incised to a much deeper level the bank does retreat i e it does not become wet and thus does not become a part of the channel in the model these limitations in the bank erosion scheme might have affected the actual simulated morphological development the deviation of sediment transport direction due to gravity effects on a sloping bed is an important phenomenon shaping the two dimensional riverbed topography considering a sloping near bank river bed if the effects are overestimated the result is excessive channel widening due to excess of sediment displaced from the bank to the adjacent river bed and an unrealistically flat bed topography whereas if the value is underestimated the results is unrealistic channel incision and lower channel widening in our research we opted for a medium bed slope effect which gave sufficient representation of the process considering these two factors affecting bank retreat the computational algorithm for bank erosion and the gravity effect we conclude that the quantitative results present inaccuracy leading to uncertainty nevertheless we believe that the model captures well the morphological trends and is able to distinguish the simulated scenarios 5 6 applicability of the results the results of this study present some practical aspects such as the importance of initial width for the intermediate morphological evolutions of river channels most real rivers find themselves in this intermediate situation since they are not in morphodynamic equilibrium focusing on single thread channels the initially narrower ones experience an important widening aggradation phase followed by incision with reduced width adjustments slight widening or narrowing before reaching their equilibrium configuration the initially wider channels present a short phase with some widening and aggradation but their main evolution trend is incision narrowing the final width of single thread channels appears to depend on boundary conditions water and sediment inflow rather than on initial conditions since the 1980s many rivers are now re naturalized by removal of bank protection works for instance in europe and u s a e g kondolf et al 2013 friedl et al 2015 schmitt et al 2018 onema 2018 european center for river restoration www ecrr org the river restoration center http www therrc co uk these rivers were once narrowed and at the moment of bank protection removal find themselves in the situation of the initially narrower channels re naturalized rivers show indeed an initial widening phase which might create worries to local managers due to the extent of widening and subsequent loss of valuable land e g duró et al 2020 this study shows that after the initial widening phase accompanied by bed aggradation there will be an incision phase with much reduced channel widening or even narrowing our study cannot give any indications on relative bed level changes because both the experiments and the virtual rivers started with an imposed bed level which was not the result of morphological adaptation i e the initial river channels were not in an equilibrium state however the results of our study indicate that the narrower initial channels end up with higher bed levels compared to the initially wider ones all this is supported by theory jansen et al 1979 duró et al 2016 another application regards dammed rivers that after having their channels adapted to sediment shortage normally by incision and narrowing start to receive regular sediment by dam flushing kondolf et al 2014 dahal et al 2021 in this case rivers are often in the situation of having a sediment input that is larger than the initial sediment transport capacity of their flow and at the same time have narrow channels for these rivers our study indicates an evolutionary trend towards braiding with the development of a braid belt that is larger for the initially narrower channels and bed aggradation 6 conclusions the work describes the morphological evolution of initial straight channels carved in cohesionless unvegetated gravel beds with different widths and sediment characteristics under the forcing of combinations of flow regime and sediment input the goal is to establish whether the reach averaged width of gravel bed rivers might depend on the conditions at the start of their morphological evolution for braided systems the analysis distinguishes the active channel width where sediment transport occurs from the braid belt extension indicating the width of the reworked floodplain for single thread channels the analysis considers the wet width the work includes a set of laboratory experiments and the simulation of several scenarios with a two dimensional morphodynamic model derived by upscaling the experiments with the goal of replicating and extending the laboratory investigation but at the scale of a real river braided systems formed if the sediment supply was larger than the average transport capacity of the initial channel their braid belt extension was found to depend on their initial width the larger the initial channel the larger the braid belt but with one exception the channel starting with the smallest width produced the largest braid belt of all this was the only case in which overbank flow occurred and reworked the floodplain chute channel formation rather than channel widening through bank erosion appears here to be the most important factor affecting the braid belt extension so the dependency on initial width might only be valid in the absence of overbank flow and chute channel excavation the results of both model and flume experiments show that the sediment supply governs the final planform of gravel bed rivers higher sediment supply resulted in larger braid belts the initially narrow channels being more sensitive towards the amount of sediment supply than the initially wider ones about the sediment transport width the results of this work confirm bertoldi et al 2009 conclusion that the active width of braided systems is dominated by the stream power i e discharge and slope single thread channels formed if the sediment supply at the upstream boundary was below the average transport capacity of the channels for the same boundary conditions these channels ended up with similar reach averaged widths discharge variability seems to have a much stronger effect during the channel evolution phase than on final width the application of width predictors to the experimental and virtual single thread channels show that the ones proposed by bray 1982 parker et al 2007 and millar 2005 overestimate the width of the virtual channels and of the experimental channels with constant discharge and without sediment feed instead they underestimate the width of the experimental channels with sediment feed and variable discharge in any case the predicted and measured computed widths have the same order of magnitude and the differences can be explained by the experimental settings and model limitations this work therefore supports the use of width predictors for single thread gravel bed rivers the initial widths affected the final average bed levels the narrower initial channels became on average higher indicating that the initial channel width may affect the degree of channel incision or aggradation it is likely though that on the long term the bed level of all the channels adjusts to the downstream boundary conditions the results of this work showing how the river width evolves before reaching its final value can be useful for river restoration

allowed describing the type of rivers that was reproduced in the flume e g garcia 2008 establishing the characteristics of the hypothetical real river represented by the flume experiments was done on the average final configuration of the channels belonging to scenario ue table 1 the artificially imposed starting width and straight alignment did not allow to do this in the design phase of the experiments assuming turbulent flow similar flow and sediment mobility are obtained if the froude and the shields numbers have the same values geometric similarity is necessary to well represent depth dependent processes like the deviation of sediment transport direction by transverse bed slope and bank erosion in addition imposing the same width to depth ratio is necessary to obtain a similar 2d morphodynamic behavior since bar characteristics primarily depend on this ratio tubino and seminara 1990 as an alternative similarity in 2d morphodynamic can be obtained by imposing the same value of the interaction parameter struiksma et al 1985 kleinhans et al 2015a or of the bar mode crosato and mosselman 2009 which are both dependent on width to depth ratio and sediment mobility the experiments were upscaled using the principles described above imposing to the upscaled channel the same longitudinal slope bed roughness froude and shields numbers interaction parameter and bar mode of the experiment and the geometric scale of 215 chosen to represent a typical mountain river size following the approach of le et al 2018 the obtained hypothetical river characteristics were then compared to the ones of existing river reaches reported in the literature table a 1 to establish the level of realism of the experiment and to select the most resembling real river case for the setup of the morphodynamic model the downstream reach of the river arc france described by jaballah et al 2015 is the real case with the highest resemblance to the upscaled experimental channel both have relatively steep bed slopes around 0 6 but the arc river has smaller median sediment size although still in the range of cobbles for both the upscaled channel and the arc river the shields parameter falls between 0 01 and 0 2 which according to garcia 2008 is typical of gravel bed rivers at conditions close to initiation of sediment motion or comparatively low mobility the discharge of 300 m3 s corresponding to a 10 year return period flood of the arc river is comparable to the upscaled constant discharge this indicates that the constant flow experiments represented rivers with continuous high flow conditions the low flow stages of the experiments with variable discharge represented medium stages of real rivers in mountain rivers high discharges are responsible for most morphological changes vargas luna et al 2019 however our experiments have indicated that medium flow stages are important for thalweg forming and bar reworking using relatively high discharges is therefore acceptable bearing in mind the scope of this investigation which focuses on the long term evolution of trends and processes governing the channel formation of gravel bed rivers towards equilibrium without considering the time scale for these changes to occur appendix b sensitivity analyses several sensitivity runs were performed on the virtual channel of um 30 to select the suitable model parameters during the test parameters of interest was varied by holding other parameters constant two commonly used formulations in delft3d to represent the transverse bed slope effect are formulation of ikeda 1982 as in van rijn 1993 and the formulation of koch flokstra s 1980 extended by talmon et al 1995 knf fig b 1 a shows the comparison between these two formulations focusing on channel width evolution small transverse bed slope effect produced small bars narrow channels with high incision and less channel widening while high bed slope effect had the opposite effect with much higher channel widening schuurman et al 2018 represented by two typical sets of parameters singh et al 2017 with knf formulation fig b 1a for our virtual channels the parametrization with ikeda formulation abn 1 5 default value in delft 3d seemed suitable with respect to the extent of channel widening and incision as compared to knf formulation the default value of horizontal eddy viscosity 10 m2 s did not satisfy the model stability criteria as described in deltares 2018 mainly due to the fine grid size of the models the value of 1 m2 s underestimated channel widening and sediment transport rates and resulted in an increase of flow velocity in shallow areas and a decrease in the deeper parts the values of 0 1 m2 s and 0 01 m2 s resulted in similar acceptable velocity distributions and width development fig b 1b so a value of 0 1 m2 s was chosen for the horizontal eddy viscosity the virtual river represented a gravel bed river dominated by bed load transport three sediment transport formulas particularly suitable for the computation of coarse sand and gravel transport rates mayer peter muller 1948 mpm ashida and michiue 1972 anm and wong parker 2006 wp were compared based on channel width evolution fig b 1c the formula by wong parker 2006 eq 1 was the one that best represented the sediment transport in the experimental channel as well as in the river arc mpm produced no widening due to form factor which affects the sediment mobility schuurman et al 2013 anm and wp produced similar widening but anm resulted in much higher incision fig b 1d compares the channel width evolution obtained using a morphological accelerator equal to 5 morfac 5 a way to save computational time roelvink 2006 and the channel width obtained without morphological accelerator morfac 1 the results show that for the scenarios with constant discharge the morphological development could be accelerated by a factor of 5 without losing important information so for these cases a simulation of
