3965,infrared ir is an important data source for satellite quantitative precipitation estimation and has been widely applied in the fields of meteorology hydrology and agriculture in the past decades a series of ir retrieval algorithms have been developed to support the production of ir based and ir microwave merged precipitation products recently deep learning techniques such as the convolutional neural network cnn show great potential in obtaining ir precipitation estimates with higher accuracy than traditional retrieval algorithms in this study we present an upgraded version of ir precipitation estimation using cnn ipec i e ipec version 2 ipec v2 with a new end to end manner ipec v2 is used to generate a precipitation dataset based on ir data from china s fengyun fy geostationary satellites fy 2f 2g and 4a to overcome the difficulty of model training in regions with sparse observations ipec v2 models are firstly pre trained over the data rich continental us conus using ir data from the geostationary operational environment satellite goes the models are then transferred to china through re training with multi band ir signals from fy satellites finally a long term record of high resolution fy ir precipitation estimates is produced during the period from november 9 2012 to february 28 2021 which is named as ipec fy ipec fy shows better performance than the baseline precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs with 76 2 gain in pearson s correlation coefficient and 18 4 gain in root mean squared error in china this study shows that transfer learning is an effective way to build cnn models in regions without enough observations and the high quality ipec fy can act as an alternative precipitation dataset for research in china keywords infrared precipitation cnn fengyun 1 introduction satellite infrared ir sensors are an essential source of global precipitation observations due to their superiority in terms of spatiotemporal coverages and resolutions behrangi et al 2009 representative global ir based precipitation products include precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu et al 1997 persiann cloud classification system persiann ccs hong et al 2004 and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2014 in addition ir precipitation estimates are widely applied to fill the gap of passive microwave sensors enabling the production of ir microwave merged precipitation products such as the tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2015 ir signals are transferred to surface precipitation rates with traditional statistical and machine learning techniques typical examples include random forest rf supporting vector machine svm artificial neural network ann and so on hong et al 2004 hsu et al 1997 k√ºhnlein et al 2014 min et al 2018 sehad et al 2017 among existing ir based algorithms and products the persiann family developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs in the university of california irvine uci is the most prestigious one first hsu et al 1997 proposed the persiann algorithm which utilizes the powerful ability of ann to establish relationship between cloud top brightness temperature and surface precipitation rates hong et al 2004 developed persiann ccs which uses an unsupervised self organizing feature map sofm to classify clouds into 400 groups and then assigns clouds of each group with precipitation rates through different power law equations ashouri et al 2015 combined persiann with ground observations to generate a long term climatic precipitation dataset named persiann climate data record persiann cdr using the same paradigm sadeghi et al 2019b combined persiann ccs with ground observations and produce persiann ccs climate data record persiann ccs cdr among these products persiann ccs is recognized as state of the art satellite ir product at hourly scale and selected to be the ir component in imerg which merges ir and microwave information to produce the most advanced precipitation product at present huffman et al 2015 thus persiann ccs is often selected as the baseline when developing new ir precipitation retrieval algorithms tao et al 2016 2017 2018 kuligowski et al 2016 mahrooghy et al 2012 recently deep learning methods are proved to be powerful in ir precipitation estimation tao et al 2016 2017 2018 develop a series of models based on a two layer stacked denoising auto encoders sdae which achieves better statistical performance than persiann ccs over central continental united states conus in the light of the powerful ability of convolutional operators to extract spatial and layer wise features of images automatically sadeghi et al 2019a and hayatbini et al 2019 replace the sdae module with convolutional neural network cnn and conditional generative adversarial network gan cgan respectively to achieve better results wang et al 2020a construct a two staged model for infrared precipitation estimation using cnn ipec based on residual blocks as well as a fine designed five channel input which produces better precipitation estimates than persiann ccs and possess good spatial and temporal generalization abilities xue et al 2021 apply cnn for near real time precipitation estimation using satellite ir information from fengyun fy 2 over xinjiang china moraux et al 2019 propose an encoder decoder cnn for estimating instantaneous precipitation rate from ir information ehsani et al 2021 use cloudsat radar information and machine learning for snowfall retrieval in high latitudes sadeghi et al 2020 develop a software for near real time ir precipitation estimation using cnn and auxiliary geographical information though many ir precipitation estimation algorithms based on deep learning are developed and fully evaluated there is no work to apply these algorithms to generate practical products of large areas ir sensors are onboard geostationary satellites such as the geostationary operational environment satellite goes by usa meteosat by europe himawari by japan and fy by china fy 4a is the most recent and advanced geostationary satellite operated by china which was launched on december 11 2016 zhang et al 2019 compared to its predecessors i e fy 2 series fy 4a has better weather and environmental monitoring capabilities equipped with hyperspectral geostationary interferometric infrared sounder giirs di et al 2018 and advanced geosynchronous radiation imager agri lai et al 2019 giirs is good at detecting atmospheric vertical temperature and humidity and agri has 14 spectral bands with high spatial resolution fy 4a can provide a full disk observation every 15 min or less and has optional and customizable mode for fast regional scanning and mesoscale observation in operation yang et al 2017 the ir imager onboard fy 4a i e agri has similar spectral characteristics to other advanced imagers such as advanced baseline imager abi onboard goes r schmit et al 2005 schmit et al 2017 flexible combined imager fci onboard meteosat third generation mtg durand et al 2015 and advanced himawari imager ahi on board himawari bessho et al 2016 ir data from fy satellites have been widely used to produce precipitation estimates in china wang et al 2020b xue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 xu et al 2019 and lu et al 2020 show that fy 2g precipitation estimates have higher accuracy than imerg estimates in hourly and daily scales in china which however is because the fy 2g datasets used in the two studies have experienced bias correction based on dense gauge networks gao et al 2020 evaluates fy 4a raw estimates without bias correction imreg global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap and persiann ccs using the ground china merged precipitation analysis cmpa over southern china in the summer of 2019 this study finds that fy 4a shows much lower accuracy compared to the other products including persiann ccs in daily and hourly scales fy 4a estimates show severe overestimation and cannot capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of summertime precipitation over southern china therefore despite the advance in the instrument the retrieval algorithms used by fy 4a need substantial improvement high quality precipitation products by fy satellites are of great significance to support the monitoring and forecast of natural hazards e g floods and landslides and can also supplement global ir microwave merged products such as imerg in the future the objective of this study is to 1 develop a new ir precipitation estimation algorithm on the basis of ipec named as ipec v2 and 2 develop a high quality ir precipitation dataset from 2012 to 2021 based on data from fy 2 and fy 4 satellites named as ipec fy in china since ground observations are scarce in most part of china we adopt the transfer learning method which first trains ipec v2 models over data rich conus using goes ir data and ground radar precipitation observations and then transfers conus models to china with additional local training for the application on fy 2 and fy 4 data ipec fy shows high accuracy compared to the baseline precipitation product and will have great potential in hydrometeorological applications in china the following parts of this paper are organized as section 2 introduces the study regions and data sets section 3 describes the methodology section 4 evaluates the quality of ipec fy and compares it to state of the art persiann ccs section 5 is summary conclusions and future prospects 2 study areas and data sets 2 1 study areas as shown in fig 1 the two study areas are conus 25 50 n 65 125 w where the ipec v2 model is pre trained and greater china 15 53 n 70 140 e where the pre trained ipec v2 model is transferred and re trained and the ipec fy product is developed the elevation of conus is high in the western part and low in the eastern part divided by the rocky mountains fig 1a the climate conditions of conus are complicated including mediterranean subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest desert and steppe temperate marine desert and deciduous broad leaved forest plateau mountain and some other climate types national assessment synthesis team 2001 the average precipitation over conus is lower in the western part than in the east part wang et al 2018 the elevation of mainland china decreases from the west i e tibetan plateau to the east i e coastal plains the climate conditions of china are also complicated and largely regulated by the monsoon systems ma et al 2015 the precipitation over mainland china shows obvious variability in both time and space scales i e most precipitation occurs in summer and over southeastern regions wang et al 2018 the nested map in fig 1b shows the distribution of more than 30 000 rain gauges over mainland china and the red box outlines the southeast china sec where rain gauges are highly dense and used to re train ipec v2 models 2 2

satellites including fy 2f 2g and 4a to cover the recent decade for fy 2f and 2g only band 4 10 8 Œºm designed to detect ctt is suitable for precipitation estimation and selected as the input to ipec v2 it is noted that persiann ccs also uses the band of about 10 8 Œºm as the input for fy 4a we use band 9 6 3 Œºm band 12 10 7 Œºm and band 14 13 5 Œºm which are close to bands 3 4 and 6 of goes 13 respectively the original resolution of fy 2 series is about 5 km and 1 h and the resolution of fy 4a is about 4 km and 1 h fy data could be downloaded from the national satellite meteorological center nsmc http satellite nsmc org cn of china meteorological administration cma the ground observed precipitation data over china is provided by cmpa shen et al 2014 cmpa is a gridded precipitation product with 0 1 and 1 h resolution which is generated based on data from more than 30 000 rain gauges and cmorph satellite precipitation products the production process of cmpa is as follows 1 the cmorph product is resampled from about 8 km and 0 5 h to 0 1 and 1 h and 2 gauge observations and the resampled cmorph estimates are merged using the optimal interpolation oi method xie and xiong 2011 as grids with gauges are considered to have high confidence we only choose grids with at least one gauge fig 1b cmpa is provided by the national meteorological information centre nmic http data cma cn

the comparison with ipec fy tao et al 2016 2017 2018 kuligowski et al 2016 mahrooghy et al 2012 the resolution of persiann ccs is 0 04 and 1 h persiann ccs applies ir data of 10 7 Œºm as the input and uses a four step algorithm to estimate precipitation rates mainly based on ann persiann ccs could be downloaded from the chrs website http chrsdata eng uci edu all data are resampled into 0 04 0 04 latitude and longitude grids using the linear interpolation and accumulated through every 1 hour time window to ensure pixels of various datasets are matched 3 method 3 1 the overall framework fig 2 shows the overall framework about how to produce fy ir precipitation products which includes three main steps as follows first we pre train the ipec v2 model over conus where both ir and ground precipitation data are abundant and of high quality the brightness temperature derived by three bands of goes 13 and stage iv precipitation data are used to construct the model with data from the summer june july and august in 2012 to train the model and data from the summer june july and august in 2014 to test the model in the aim of selecting an optimal one because different fy satellites have different overlaps with goes 13 in terms of spectral bands the ipec v2 models for fy 2f 2g and fy 4a are driven by a one channel and five channel input respectively wang et al 2020a the detailed information of input combinations is described in section 3 2 for convenience the one channel input and five channel input models obtained over conus are named as ipec conus one and ipec conus five respectively second we transfer the optimal pre trained models over conus to sec the transfer process means re training ipec conus models with data from fy satellites and cmpa precipitation observations over sec which is necessary in order to make the model capable of extracting features from fy ir imageries and adapt to the local terrain weather and climate conditions in sec we only re train parts of the ipec conus model by freezing parameters of the first few layers of cnn which is sufficient for re training as well as saving the computational cost han et al 2021 re training ipec conus over the whole china is unpractical because of the limited availability of ground stations shen et al 2014 guo et al 2016 in the transfer procedure ipec conus models are re trained with fy data in the summer june july and august of 2018 and tested in the summer june july and august of 2019 in specific ipec conus one is re trained with fy 2f and 2g respectively and ipec sec 2f and ipec sec 2g are obtained similarly ipec sec 4a for fy 4a is obtained finally the ipec sec models are applied to the entire china during the past decade to generate long term precipitation estimates i e ipec fy in specific the periods of fy 2f 2g and 4a are from november 9 2012 to june 2 2015 from june 3 2015 to march 11 2018 and from march 12 2018 to february 28 2021 respectively it should be noted that ipec sec models only trained in summer are also applicable in winter wang et al 2020a rainfall and snowfall have similar cloud top infrared signals for certain types of precipitation systems which explains that the model trained based on rainfall data can also be applied in winter the rectangle region of greater china is divided into several adjacent and non overlapping patches with the size of 160 160 for each patch the precipitation estimation is derived through the ipec sec model with a 320 320 input that is centered as the 160 160 patch the design of ipec v2 framework is displayed in fig 3 ipec v2 is suitable for both goes 13 and fy ir data that are resampled into 0 04 0 04 latitude longitude grids and 1 hour temporal resolution and clipped to patches of 320 320 no matter of the number of input channels the biggest difference between ipec v1 and ipec v2 is that ipec v2 uses an end to end manner i e the size of the model output is the same as the input which is more efficient than the end to pixel manner of ipec v1 without the sacrifice of accuracy details of ipec v2 architecture are in section 3 2 3 2 the architecture of ipec v2 1 basic knowledge of cnn cnn is widely applied in the domain of computer vision e g object recognition detection and image segmentation object recognition aims to classify images or videos which means the output is a category krizhevsky et al 2012 parkhi et al 2015 karpathy et al 2014 object detection aims to judge the region of interest within an image and mark it out which means the output is a pixel wise binary classification russakovsky et al 2015 ouyang and wang 2013 zhu et al 2016 zhu and ramanan 2012 image segmentation is a higher level task which aims to make multi classification judgments for each pixel farabet et al 2012 noh et al 2015 luo et al 2012 liang et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 the ir precipitation estimation problem is defined as an object recognition task in ipec v1 which means given a satellite ir imagery the precipitation rate of the center pixel is obtained in ipec v2 the problem is re defined as an image segmentation problem which means given a satellite ir imagery the corresponding precipitation estimation map could be directly obtained it makes the large scale application of ipec model more efficient please refer to wang et al 2020a for more information about the mathematical principle of cnn 2 model inputs the input combination of ipec v2 is the same with ipec v1 wang et al 2020a and the detailed information is shown in table 1 over conus satellite ir data are provided by goes 13 ipec conus one uses ctt as the predictor which is represented by ir10 7 ipec conus five uses ctt represented by ir10 7 and three other predictors including cloud top height cth represented by ir13 3 and Œ¥t6 5 10 7 wv6 5 ir10 7 cloud phase cp represented by Œ¥t10 7 13 3 ir10 7 ir13 3 and wv represented by wv6 5 thies et al 2008a b c k√ºhnlein et al 2014 wang et al 2020a over china satellite ir data are provided by fy 2f 2g and 4a for fy 2f and 2g band 4 ir10 8 is selected as the input to re train ipec conus one over sec to obtain ipec sec one for fy 4a ipec conus five is re trained using the same cloud parameters to obtain ipec sec five 3 network structure fig 4 shows the detailed network structure of ipec v2 which applies the end to end segmentation manner and is based on the classical u net ronneberger et al 2015 the networks of one channel and five channel input only differ in terms of the channel number of the input the input is firstly down sampled by six times and then up sampled by six times and the down sampling layers are skip connected tong et al 2017 into the corresponding up sampling layers for feature aggregation the filter numbers of each down sampling layer are 8 8 16 32 64 128 respectively and the filter numbers of each up sampling layer are 128 64 32 16 8 1 respectively the size of both the input and output is 320 320 during the re training process the first three layers of down sampling layers are frozen 4 loss function a loss function combined of euclidean distance and kullback leibler kl divergence kullback 1997 with a weight coefficient w is used to optimize the network which is the same as that used in ipec v1 wang et al 2020a tao et al 2016 wang et al 2021 1 l w l kl l eu the optimal w is set to 1000 by trial and error ipec v2 models are optimized using the stochastic gradient descent sgd optimizer and learning rates when models are trained over conus and sec are set to be 0 001 and 0 0001 respectively through optimality selection and remain unchanged during the training process the learning rate during the re training stage is lower than that in the pre training stage to retain the feature extraction ability acquired in the pre training stage the batch size is set to 32 after a series of experiments all models are implemented with tensorflow abadi et al 2016 and run in the graphics processing unit gpu of titan x 5 evaluation metrics three classical evaluation metrics tang et al 2020 including pearson correlation coefficient cc mean error me and root mean squared error rmse three categorical metrics wang et al 2020a including probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi and a novel evaluation index named entropy etr gupta et al 2021 are used to quantify the performance of various precipitation estimates 4 results 4 1 the performance of the transfer learning strategy table 2 summarizes the evaluation metrics cc me and rmse of persiann ccs and various ipec models including three in the pre training stage using data from june to august 2014 over conus and nine in the re training stage using data from june to august 2019 over sec in the pre training stage over conus ipec conus five has the best statistical metrics featuring with cc of 0 55 me of 0 01 mm h and rmse of 1 17 mm h followed by ipec conus one with cc of 0 49 me of 0 02 mm h and rmse of 1 23 mm h this indicates that the five channel input can provide more feature information than the one channel input wang et al 2020a both ipec conus models show better performance than persiann ccs with cc of 0 38 me of 0 04 mm h and rmse of 1 38 mm h which demonstrates the advantage of convolutional structures in estimating satellite precipitation rates over sec ipec conus one and ipec conus five have worse statistical performance than persiann ccs in terms of all the three metrics because the two models are not re trained using fy and cmpa data it s primarily caused by the differences of many factors such as satellite ir data natural geographical conditions and precipitation characteristics between conus and sec after model re training the performances of ipec sec models ipec sec 2f ipec sec 2g and ipec sec 4a are improved dramatically for example cc me and rmse for ipec sec 4a are 0 45 0 02 mm h and 0 98 mm h respectively which are much better compared to ipec conus five with cc of 0 22 me of 0 07 mm h and rmse of 1 26 mm h ipec sec 4a also obviously exceeds persiann ccs which has cc of 0 30 me of 0 03 mm h and rmse of 1 19 mm h to further investigate the benefits of the transfer learning strategy we directly trained ipec models over sec and obtained ipec one 2f ipec one 2g and ipec five 4a table 2 the directly trained models are compared to re trained ipec sec models results show that ipec sec models show all round better performance than the directly trained models probably because the transfer learning provides models with much reasonable initial conditions parameters and thus can reduce the computation cost and increase training performance this experiment shows that the transfer learning strategy has great potential in improving the performance of deep learning models in regions with insufficient training data 4 2 the spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation fig 5 shows an example consisting of fy 4a band 12 10 7 Œºm imagery precipitation estimation by persiann ccs and ipec fy and precipitation observation by cmpa during 10 00 11 00 utc june 5 2019 the regions of cold colors in fy 4a band 12 imagery indicate where clouds are covered and the regions of warm colors in the precipitation snapshots indicate where high intensity precipitation happens from the figure we can see that ipec fy matches with cmpa better than persiann ccs in terms of precipitation regions in particular there is an obvious and wide precipitation region over the central china which is successfully estimated by ipec fy but missed by persiann ccs in statistics mean precipitation intensities estimated by persiann ccs ipec fy and cmpa are 0 42 0 73 and 0 57 mm h respectively ipec fy overestimates the precipitation which is also indicated by me 0 16 for ipec fy and 0 13 for persiann ccs ipec fy has higher cc 0 56 vs 0 17 lower rmse 2 03 vs 2 62 and closer etr 0 69 vs 0 95 to cmpa 0 72 compared to persiann ccs it should be noted that ipec fy estimations appear to be blurry which is a common issue of deep learning based applications tao et al 2018 wang et al 2020 fig 6 displays a time series of the average precipitation of three precipitation products persiann ccs ipec fy and cmpa across china and sec ranging from 00 00 utc june 2 to 00 00 utc june 7 2019 only grids where all three products have data are included to calculate the average precipitation the missing values are because cmpa is not available at some time steps cmpa shows significant variabilities of average precipitation which reaches the peak value in the daytime of june 5 in sec fig 6b ipec fy captures the low and high precipitation much better than persiann ccs with higher cc 0 96 vs 0 77 and lower rmse 0 13 vs 0 26 ipec fy slightly overestimates precipitation peaks the me is 0 06 while persiann ccs substantially underestimates precipitation peaks the me is 0 11 the etr of ipec fy over sec is 0 41 which is closer to that of cmpa 0 58 than persiann ccs 0 95 in the entire china ipec fy agrees better with cmpa than persiann ccs for low precipitation for precipitation peaks ipec fy still shows better performance but has large overestimation around 00 00 utc june 5 and 12 00 utc june 6 this is because ipec fy is only trained over sec instead of the entire china in this study and the performance of ipec fy is slightly degraded in the evaluation over china in terms of specific statistical indicators ipec fy has better cc 0 94 rmse 0 09 and etr 0 59 the etr of cmpa is 0 73 and worse me 0 05 than persiann ccs cc is 0 69 rmse is 0 12 etr is 1 17 and me is 0 04 it is expected that the transfer learning strategy can also improve model performance in china although china only has limited ground observations as a whole which could be a future study 4 3 statistical metrics of long term estimates table 3 summarizes the average statistical metrics cc me and rmse of persiann ccs and ipec fy including ipec fy 2f ipec fy 2g and ipec fy 4a according to the satellite used to estimate precipitation rates over china from november 9 2012 to february 28 2021 as well as the performance gain of ipec fy compared to persiann ccs overall ipec fy has better statistical performance than persiann ccs with obviously better cc and rmse and slight worse me the slight retrogression of me is mainly caused by ipec fy 2g estimates probably because the fy 2g has lower data quality it should also be noted that the transfer learning only re trains ipec conus models over sec in one summer and is then directly applied to china from 2012 to 2021 besides ipec fy is generally better than persiann ccs in terms of the ability to identify rain or no rain events with higher pod 0 77 vs 0 18 worse far 0 83 vs 0 68 and higher csi 0 16 vs 0 13 the etr of ipec fy 1 29 is also closer to that of cmpa 1 23 than persiann ccs 1 08 table 4 is the same with table 3 but for sec from this table we can see that ipec fy is statistically better than persiann ccs in terms of all three fy satellites which further demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning comparison of the evaluation results over sec and entire china indicates that there should be more adaptive re training procedures for further improving the quality of ipec fy over china which could be a future research direction 4 4 the spatial distribution of metrics fig 7 shows the spatial distribution map of statistic metrics cc me and rmse for persiann ccs and ipec fy over china from november 9 2012 to february 28 2021 only grids with cmpa gauges are included in the evaluation cc is worse in the western and northern regions where high elevation complicated weather and climate conditions bring large challenges to satellite precipitation estimation dinku et al 2007 tang et al 2018 and better in the southeastern parts rmse is larger in southern china due to the higher precipitation intensity for cc ipec fy is better than persiann ccs over most regions especially over southeastern regions for me the overestimation and underestimation of persiann ccs are about divided by the latitude of 33 n and ipec fy overestimates the average precipitation more severely in north china but corrects the underestimation condition in south china where the ipec models are re trained ipec fy improves greatly in terms of rmse especially in the central and southern china and persiann ccs has an obvious diagonal line with high rmse values within the region of about 25 40 n 110 115 e the production procedure of persiann ccs is based on patches and sliding windows which is the same as that of ipec fy fig 3 the diagonal line with high rmses of persiann ccs is probably the connection area of two patches this problem should be further investigated in future studies 5 conclusion this study developed an improved cnn based ir precipitation estimation method i e ipec v2 and produced a precipitation dataset i e ipec fy over greater china using data from china s fy satellites ipec v2 is firstly pre trained over conus using goes 13 ir data and stage iv precipitation observations then a transfer learning strategy is adopted by re training ipec conus models over sec using fy satellite data and cmpa ground precipitation observations finally based on the re trained models and ir data from fy 2f 2g and 4a we generated the ipec fy dataset over greater china 15 53 n 70 140 e from november 9 2012 to february 28 2021 with high spatiotemporal resolution of 0 04 and 1 h the evaluation results show that the transfer learning procedure is effective for constructing ipec models over china where training data is insufficient for most part of the territory the product ipec fy has higher accuracy than persiann ccs according to the spatial and temporal evaluation for example cc me and rmse of hourly ipec fy estimates over china are 0 28 0 03 mm h and 0 82 mm h respectively while the values are 0 16 0 02 mm h 1 00 mm h for persiann ccs respectively overall this study provides a paradigm of applying transfer learning in deep learning models and generating long term precipitation datasets using cnn techniques there are several directions that should be investigated in future studies to further improve the quality of the algorithm and dataset including but not limited to 1 better patch merging strategies should be developed for promoting the spatial consistence of large scale precipitation estimation 2 models should have better spatial generalization ability by considering terrain and climate factors and 3 the model structure should be upgraded to be compatible of incomplete inputs so that models could be re trained over larger regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

3965,infrared ir is an important data source for satellite quantitative precipitation estimation and has been widely applied in the fields of meteorology hydrology and agriculture in the past decades a series of ir retrieval algorithms have been developed to support the production of ir based and ir microwave merged precipitation products recently deep learning techniques such as the convolutional neural network cnn show great potential in obtaining ir precipitation estimates with higher accuracy than traditional retrieval algorithms in this study we present an upgraded version of ir precipitation estimation using cnn ipec i e ipec version 2 ipec v2 with a new end to end manner ipec v2 is used to generate a precipitation dataset based on ir data from china s fengyun fy geostationary satellites fy 2f 2g and 4a to overcome the difficulty of model training in regions with sparse observations ipec v2 models are firstly pre trained over the data rich continental us conus using ir data from the geostationary operational environment satellite goes the models are then transferred to china through re training with multi band ir signals from fy satellites finally a long term record of high resolution fy ir precipitation estimates is produced during the period from november 9 2012 to february 28 2021 which is named as ipec fy ipec fy shows better performance than the baseline precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs with 76 2 gain in pearson s correlation coefficient and 18 4 gain in root mean squared error in china this study shows that transfer learning is an effective way to build cnn models in regions without enough observations and the high quality ipec fy can act as an alternative precipitation dataset for research in china keywords infrared precipitation cnn fengyun 1 introduction satellite infrared ir sensors are an essential source of global precipitation observations due to their superiority in terms of spatiotemporal coverages and resolutions behrangi et al 2009 representative global ir based precipitation products include precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu et al 1997 persiann cloud classification system persiann ccs hong et al 2004 and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2014 in addition ir precipitation estimates are widely applied to fill the gap of passive microwave sensors enabling the production of ir microwave merged precipitation products such as the tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2015 ir signals are transferred to surface precipitation rates with traditional statistical and machine learning techniques typical examples include random forest rf supporting vector machine svm artificial neural network ann and so on hong et al 2004 hsu et al 1997 k√ºhnlein et al 2014 min et al 2018 sehad et al 2017 among existing ir based algorithms and products the persiann family developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs in the university of california irvine uci is the most prestigious one first hsu et al 1997 proposed the persiann algorithm which utilizes the powerful ability of ann to establish relationship between cloud top brightness temperature and surface precipitation rates hong et al 2004 developed persiann ccs which uses an unsupervised self organizing feature map sofm to classify clouds into 400 groups and then assigns clouds of each group with precipitation rates through different power law equations ashouri et al 2015 combined persiann with ground observations to generate a long term climatic precipitation dataset named persiann climate data record persiann cdr using the same paradigm sadeghi et al 2019b combined persiann ccs with ground observations and produce persiann ccs climate data record persiann ccs cdr among these products persiann ccs is recognized as state of the art satellite ir product at hourly scale and selected to be the ir component in imerg which merges ir and microwave information to produce the most advanced precipitation product at present huffman et al 2015 thus persiann ccs is often selected as the baseline when developing new ir precipitation retrieval algorithms tao et al 2016 2017 2018 kuligowski et al 2016 mahrooghy et al 2012 recently deep learning methods are proved to be powerful in ir precipitation estimation tao et al 2016 2017 2018 develop a series of models based on a two layer stacked denoising auto encoders sdae which achieves better statistical performance than persiann ccs over central continental united states conus in the light of the powerful ability of convolutional operators to extract spatial and layer wise features of images automatically sadeghi et al 2019a and hayatbini et al 2019 replace the sdae module with convolutional neural network cnn and conditional generative adversarial network gan cgan respectively to achieve better results wang et al 2020a construct a two staged model for infrared precipitation estimation using cnn ipec based on residual blocks as well as a fine designed five channel input which produces better precipitation estimates than persiann ccs and possess good spatial and temporal generalization abilities xue et al 2021 apply cnn for near real time precipitation estimation using satellite ir information from fengyun fy 2 over xinjiang china moraux et al 2019 propose an encoder decoder cnn for estimating instantaneous precipitation rate from ir information ehsani et al 2021 use cloudsat radar information and machine learning for snowfall retrieval in high latitudes sadeghi et al 2020 develop a software for near real time ir precipitation estimation using cnn and auxiliary geographical information though many ir precipitation estimation algorithms based on deep learning are developed and fully evaluated there is no work to apply these algorithms to generate practical products of large areas ir sensors are onboard geostationary satellites such as the geostationary operational environment satellite goes by usa meteosat by europe himawari by japan and fy by china fy 4a is the most recent and advanced geostationary satellite operated by china which was launched on december 11 2016 zhang et al 2019 compared to its predecessors i e fy 2 series fy 4a has better weather and environmental monitoring capabilities equipped with hyperspectral geostationary interferometric infrared sounder giirs di et al 2018 and advanced geosynchronous radiation imager agri lai et al 2019 giirs is good at detecting atmospheric vertical temperature and humidity and agri has 14 spectral bands with high spatial resolution fy 4a can provide a full disk observation every 15 min or less and has optional and customizable mode for fast regional scanning and mesoscale observation in operation yang et al 2017 the ir imager onboard fy 4a i e agri has similar spectral characteristics to other advanced imagers such as advanced baseline imager abi onboard goes r schmit

satellites have been widely used to produce precipitation estimates in china wang et al 2020b xue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 xu et al 2019 and lu et al 2020 show that fy 2g precipitation estimates have higher accuracy than imerg estimates in hourly and daily scales in china which however is because the fy 2g datasets used in the two studies have experienced bias correction based on dense gauge networks gao et al 2020 evaluates fy 4a raw estimates without bias correction imreg global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap and persiann ccs using the ground china merged precipitation analysis cmpa over southern china in the summer of 2019 this study finds that fy 4a shows much lower accuracy compared to the other products including persiann ccs in daily and hourly scales fy 4a estimates show severe overestimation and cannot capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of summertime precipitation over southern china therefore despite the advance in the instrument the retrieval algorithms used by fy 4a need substantial improvement high quality precipitation products by fy satellites are of great significance to support the monitoring and forecast of natural hazards e g floods and landslides and can also supplement global ir microwave merged products such as imerg in the future the objective of this study is to 1 develop a new ir precipitation estimation algorithm on the basis of ipec named as ipec v2 and 2 develop a high quality ir precipitation dataset from 2012 to 2021 based on data from fy 2 and fy 4 satellites named as ipec fy in china since ground observations are scarce in most part of china we adopt the transfer learning method which first trains ipec v2 models over data rich conus using goes ir data and ground radar precipitation observations and then transfers conus models to china with additional local training for the application on fy 2 and fy 4 data ipec fy shows high accuracy compared to the baseline precipitation product and will have great potential in hydrometeorological applications in china the following parts of this paper are organized as section 2 introduces the study regions and data sets section 3 describes the methodology section 4 evaluates the quality of ipec fy and compares it to state of the art persiann ccs section 5 is summary conclusions and future prospects 2 study areas and data sets

conditions of conus are complicated including mediterranean subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest desert and steppe temperate marine desert and deciduous broad leaved forest plateau mountain and some other climate types national assessment synthesis team 2001 the average precipitation over conus is lower in the western part than in the east part wang et al 2018 the elevation of mainland china decreases from the west i e tibetan plateau to the east i e coastal plains the climate conditions of china are also complicated and largely regulated by the monsoon systems ma et al 2015 the precipitation over mainland china shows obvious variability in both time and space scales i e most precipitation occurs in summer and over southeastern regions wang et al 2018 the nested map in fig 1b shows the distribution of more than 30 000 rain gauges over mainland china and the red box outlines the southeast china sec where rain gauges are highly dense and used to re train ipec v2 models 2 2

satellites including fy 2f 2g and 4a to cover the recent decade for fy 2f and 2g only band 4 10 8 Œºm designed to detect ctt is suitable for precipitation estimation and selected as the input to ipec v2 it is noted that persiann ccs also uses the band of about 10 8 Œºm as the input for fy 4a we use band 9 6 3 Œºm band 12 10 7 Œºm and band 14 13 5 Œºm which are close to bands 3 4 and 6 of goes 13 respectively the original resolution of fy 2 series is about 5 km and 1 h and the resolution of fy 4a is about 4 km and 1 h fy data could be downloaded from the national satellite meteorological center nsmc http satellite nsmc org cn of china meteorological administration cma the ground observed precipitation data over china is provided by cmpa shen et al 2014 cmpa is a gridded precipitation

cmorph product is resampled from about 8 km and 0 5 h to 0 1 and 1 h and 2 gauge observations and the resampled cmorph estimates are merged using the optimal interpolation oi method xie and xiong 2011

uses a four step algorithm to estimate precipitation rates mainly based on ann persiann ccs could be downloaded from the chrs website http chrsdata eng uci edu all data are resampled into 0 04 0 04 latitude and longitude grids using the linear interpolation and accumulated through every 1 hour time window to ensure pixels of various datasets are matched 3 method 3 1 the overall framework fig 2 shows the overall framework about how to produce fy ir precipitation products which includes three main steps as follows first we pre train the ipec v2 model over conus where both ir and ground precipitation data are abundant and of high quality the brightness temperature derived by three bands of goes 13 and stage iv precipitation data are used to construct the model with data from the summer june july and august in 2012 to train the model and data from the summer june july and august in 2014 to test the model in the aim of selecting an optimal one because different fy satellites have different overlaps with goes 13 in terms of spectral bands the ipec v2 models for fy 2f 2g and fy 4a are driven by a one channel and five channel input respectively wang et al 2020a the detailed information of input combinations is described in section 3 2 for convenience the one channel input and five channel input models obtained over conus are named as ipec conus one and ipec conus five respectively second we transfer the optimal pre trained models over conus to sec the transfer process means re training ipec conus models with data from fy satellites and cmpa precipitation observations over sec which is necessary in order to make the model capable of extracting features from fy ir imageries and adapt to the local terrain weather and climate conditions in sec we only re train parts of the ipec conus model by freezing parameters of the first few layers of cnn which is sufficient for re training as well as saving the computational cost han et al 2021 re training ipec conus over the whole china is unpractical because of the limited availability of ground stations shen et al 2014 guo et al 2016 in the transfer procedure ipec conus models are re trained with fy data in the summer june july and august of 2018 and tested in the summer june july and august of 2019 in specific ipec conus one is re trained with fy 2f and 2g respectively and ipec sec 2f and ipec sec 2g are obtained similarly ipec sec 4a for fy 4a is obtained finally the ipec sec models are applied to the entire china during the past decade to generate long term precipitation estimates i e ipec fy in specific the periods of fy 2f 2g and 4a are from november 9 2012 to june 2 2015 from june 3 2015 to march 11 2018 and from march 12 2018 to february 28 2021 respectively it should be noted that ipec sec models only trained in summer are also applicable in winter wang et al 2020a rainfall and snowfall have similar cloud top infrared signals for certain types of precipitation systems which explains that the model trained based on rainfall data can also be applied in winter the rectangle region of greater china is divided into several adjacent and non overlapping patches with the size of 160 160 for each patch the precipitation estimation is derived through the ipec sec model with a 320 320 input that is centered as the 160 160 patch the design of ipec v2 framework is displayed in fig 3 ipec v2 is suitable for both goes 13 and fy ir data that are resampled into 0 04 0 04 latitude longitude grids and 1 hour temporal resolution and clipped to patches of 320 320 no matter of the number of input channels the biggest difference between ipec v1 and ipec v2 is that ipec v2 uses an end to end manner i e the size of the model output is the same as the input which is more efficient than the end to pixel manner of ipec v1 without the sacrifice of accuracy details of ipec v2 architecture are in section 3 2 3 2 the architecture of ipec v2 1 basic knowledge of cnn cnn is widely applied in the domain of computer vision e g object recognition detection and image segmentation object recognition aims to classify images or videos which means the output is a category krizhevsky et al 2012 parkhi et al 2015 karpathy et al 2014 object detection aims to judge the region of interest within an image and mark it out which means the output is a pixel wise binary classification russakovsky et al 2015 ouyang and wang 2013 zhu et al 2016 zhu and ramanan 2012 image segmentation is a higher level task which aims to make multi classification judgments for each pixel farabet et al 2012 noh et al 2015 luo et al 2012 liang et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 the ir precipitation estimation problem is defined as an object recognition task in ipec v1 which means given a satellite ir imagery the precipitation rate of the center pixel is obtained in ipec v2 the problem is re defined as an image segmentation problem which means given a satellite ir imagery the corresponding precipitation estimation map could be directly obtained it makes the large scale application of ipec model more efficient please refer to wang et al 2020a for more information about the mathematical principle of cnn 2 model inputs the input combination of ipec v2 is the same with ipec v1 wang et al 2020a and the detailed information is shown in table 1 over conus satellite ir data are provided by goes 13 ipec conus one uses ctt as the predictor which is represented by ir10 7 ipec conus five uses ctt represented by ir10 7 and three other predictors including cloud top height cth represented by ir13 3 and Œ¥t6 5 10 7 wv6 5 ir10 7 cloud phase cp represented by Œ¥t10 7 13 3 ir10 7 ir13 3 and wv represented by wv6 5 thies et al 2008a b c k√ºhnlein et al 2014 wang et al 2020a over china satellite ir data are provided by fy 2f 2g and 4a for fy 2f and 2g band 4 ir10 8 is selected as the input to re train ipec conus one over sec to obtain ipec sec one for fy 4a ipec conus five is re trained using the same cloud parameters to obtain ipec sec five 3 network structure fig 4 shows the detailed network structure of ipec v2 which applies the end to end segmentation manner and is based on the classical u net ronneberger et al 2015 the networks of one channel and five channel input only differ in terms of the channel number of the input the input is firstly down sampled by six times and then up sampled by six times and the down sampling layers are skip connected tong et al 2017 into the corresponding up sampling layers for feature aggregation the filter numbers of each down sampling layer are 8 8 16 32 64 128 respectively and the filter numbers of each up sampling layer are 128 64 32 16 8 1 respectively the size of both the input and output is 320 320 during the re training process the first three layers of down sampling layers are frozen 4 loss function a loss function combined of euclidean distance and kullback leibler kl divergence kullback 1997 with a weight coefficient w is used to optimize the network which is the same as that used in ipec v1 wang et al 2020a tao et al 2016 wang et al 2021 1 l w l kl l eu the optimal w is set to 1000 by trial and error ipec v2 models are optimized using the stochastic gradient descent sgd optimizer and learning rates when models are trained over conus and sec are set to be 0 001 and 0 0001 respectively through optimality selection and remain unchanged during the training process the learning rate during the re training stage is lower than that in the pre training stage to retain the feature extraction ability acquired in the pre training stage the batch size is set to 32 after a series of experiments all models are implemented with tensorflow abadi et al 2016 and run in the graphics processing unit gpu of titan x 5 evaluation metrics three classical evaluation metrics tang et al 2020 including pearson correlation coefficient cc mean error me and root mean squared error rmse three categorical metrics wang et al 2020a including probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi and a novel evaluation index named entropy etr gupta et al 2021 are used to quantify the performance of various precipitation estimates 4 results 4 1 the performance of the transfer learning strategy table 2 summarizes the evaluation metrics cc me and rmse of persiann ccs and various ipec models including three in the pre training stage using data from june to august 2014 over conus and nine in the re training stage using data from june to august 2019 over sec in the pre training stage over conus ipec conus five has the best statistical metrics featuring with cc of 0 55 me of 0 01 mm h and rmse of 1 17 mm h followed by ipec conus one with cc of 0 49 me of 0 02 mm h and rmse of 1 23 mm h this indicates that the five channel input can provide more feature information than the one channel input wang et al 2020a both ipec conus models show better performance than persiann ccs with cc of 0 38 me of 0 04 mm h and rmse of 1 38 mm h which demonstrates the advantage of convolutional structures in estimating satellite precipitation rates over sec ipec conus one and ipec conus five have worse statistical performance than persiann ccs in terms of all the three metrics because the two models are not re trained using fy and cmpa data it s primarily caused by the differences of many factors such as satellite ir data natural geographical conditions and precipitation characteristics between conus and sec after model re training the performances of ipec sec models ipec sec 2f ipec sec 2g and ipec sec 4a are improved dramatically for example cc me and rmse for ipec sec 4a are 0 45 0 02 mm h and 0 98 mm h respectively which are much better compared to ipec conus five with cc of 0 22 me of 0 07 mm h and rmse of 1 26 mm h ipec sec 4a also obviously exceeds persiann ccs which has cc of 0 30 me of 0 03 mm h and rmse of 1 19 mm h to further investigate the benefits of the transfer learning strategy we directly trained ipec models over sec and obtained ipec one 2f ipec one 2g and ipec five 4a table 2 the directly trained models are compared to re trained ipec sec models results show that ipec sec models show all round better performance than the directly trained models probably because the transfer learning provides models with much reasonable initial conditions parameters and thus can reduce the computation cost and increase training performance this experiment shows that the transfer learning strategy has great potential in improving the performance of deep learning models in regions with insufficient training data 4 2 the spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation fig 5 shows an example consisting of fy 4a band 12 10 7 Œºm imagery precipitation estimation by persiann ccs and ipec fy and precipitation observation by cmpa during 10 00 11 00 utc june 5 2019 the regions of cold colors in fy 4a band 12 imagery indicate where clouds are covered and the regions of warm colors in the precipitation snapshots indicate where high intensity precipitation happens from the figure we can see that ipec fy matches with cmpa better than persiann ccs in terms of precipitation regions in particular there is an obvious and wide precipitation region over the central china which is successfully estimated by ipec fy but missed by persiann ccs in statistics mean precipitation intensities estimated by persiann ccs ipec fy and cmpa are 0 42 0 73 and 0 57 mm h respectively ipec fy overestimates the precipitation which is also indicated by me 0 16 for ipec fy and 0 13 for persiann ccs ipec fy has higher cc 0 56 vs 0 17 lower rmse 2 03 vs 2 62 and closer etr 0 69 vs 0 95 to cmpa 0 72 compared to persiann ccs it should be noted that ipec fy estimations appear to be blurry which is a common issue of deep learning based applications tao et al 2018 wang et al 2020 fig 6 displays a time series of the average precipitation of three precipitation products persiann ccs ipec fy and cmpa across china and sec ranging from 00 00 utc june 2 to 00 00 utc june 7 2019 only grids where all three products have data are included to calculate the average precipitation the missing values are because cmpa is not available at some time steps cmpa shows significant variabilities of average precipitation which reaches the peak value in the daytime of june 5 in sec fig 6b ipec fy captures the low and high precipitation much better than persiann ccs with higher cc 0 96 vs 0 77 and lower rmse 0 13 vs 0 26 ipec fy slightly overestimates precipitation peaks the me is 0 06 while persiann ccs substantially underestimates precipitation peaks the me is 0 11 the etr of ipec fy over sec is 0 41 which is closer to that of cmpa 0 58 than persiann ccs 0 95 in the entire china ipec fy agrees better with cmpa than persiann ccs for low precipitation for precipitation peaks ipec fy still shows better performance but has large overestimation around 00 00 utc june 5 and 12 00 utc june 6 this is because ipec fy is only trained over sec instead of the entire china in this study and the performance of ipec fy is slightly degraded in the evaluation over china in terms of specific statistical indicators ipec fy has better cc 0 94 rmse 0 09 and etr 0 59 the etr of cmpa is 0 73 and worse me 0 05 than persiann ccs cc is 0 69 rmse is 0 12 etr is 1 17 and me is 0 04 it is expected that the transfer learning strategy can also improve model performance in china although china only has limited ground observations as a whole which could be a future study 4 3 statistical metrics of long term estimates table 3 summarizes the average statistical metrics cc me and rmse of persiann ccs and ipec fy including ipec fy 2f ipec fy 2g and ipec fy 4a according to the satellite used to estimate precipitation rates over china from november 9 2012 to february 28 2021 as well as the performance gain of ipec fy compared to persiann ccs overall ipec fy has better statistical performance than persiann ccs with obviously better cc and rmse and slight worse me the slight retrogression of me is mainly caused by ipec fy 2g estimates probably because the fy 2g has lower data quality it should also be noted that the transfer learning only re trains ipec conus models over sec in one summer and is then directly applied to china from 2012 to 2021 besides ipec fy is generally better than persiann ccs in terms of the ability to identify rain or no rain events with higher pod 0 77 vs 0 18 worse far 0 83 vs 0 68 and higher csi 0 16 vs 0 13 the etr of ipec fy 1 29 is also closer to that of cmpa 1 23 than persiann ccs 1 08 table 4 is the same with table 3 but for sec from this table we can see that ipec fy is statistically better than persiann ccs in terms of all three fy satellites which further demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning comparison of the evaluation results over sec and entire china indicates that there should be more adaptive re training procedures for further improving the quality of ipec fy over china which could be a future research direction 4 4 the spatial distribution of metrics fig 7 shows the spatial distribution map of statistic metrics cc me and rmse for persiann ccs and ipec fy over china from november 9 2012 to february 28 2021 only grids with cmpa gauges are included in the evaluation cc is worse in the western and northern regions where high elevation complicated weather and climate conditions bring large challenges to satellite precipitation estimation dinku et al 2007 tang et al 2018 and better in the southeastern parts rmse is larger in southern china due to the higher precipitation intensity for cc ipec fy is better than persiann ccs over most regions especially over southeastern regions for me the overestimation and underestimation of persiann ccs are about divided by the latitude of 33 n and ipec fy overestimates the average precipitation more severely in north china but corrects the underestimation condition in south china where the ipec models are re trained ipec fy improves greatly in terms of rmse especially in the central and southern china and persiann ccs has an obvious diagonal line with high rmse values within the region of about 25 40 n 110 115 e the production procedure of persiann ccs is based on patches and sliding windows which is the same as that of ipec fy fig 3 the diagonal line with high rmses of persiann ccs is probably the connection area of two patches this problem should be further investigated in future studies 5 conclusion this study developed an improved cnn based ir precipitation estimation method i e ipec v2 and produced a precipitation dataset i e ipec fy over greater china using data from china s fy satellites ipec v2 is firstly pre trained over conus using goes 13 ir data and stage iv precipitation observations then a transfer learning strategy is adopted by re training ipec conus models over sec using fy satellite data and cmpa ground precipitation observations finally based on the re trained models and ir data from fy 2f 2g and 4a we generated the ipec fy dataset over greater china 15 53 n 70 140 e from november 9 2012 to february 28 2021 with high spatiotemporal resolution of 0 04 and 1 h the evaluation results show that the transfer learning procedure is effective for constructing ipec models over china where training data is insufficient for most part of the territory the product ipec fy has higher accuracy than persiann ccs according to the spatial and temporal evaluation for example cc me and rmse of hourly ipec fy estimates over china are 0 28 0 03 mm h and 0 82 mm h respectively while the values are 0 16 0 02 mm h 1 00 mm h for persiann ccs respectively overall this study provides a paradigm of applying transfer learning in deep learning models and generating long term precipitation datasets using cnn techniques there are several directions that should be investigated in future studies to further improve the quality of the algorithm and dataset including but not limited to 1 better patch merging strategies should be developed for promoting the spatial consistence of large scale precipitation estimation 2 models should have better spatial generalization ability by considering terrain and climate factors and 3 the model structure should be upgraded

surface has been the subject of numerous studies youngs 1986 lall and santini 1989 strack 2017a which have a lot in common with developments related to the delineation of the seawater freshwater interface in stratified coastal aquifers strack and ausk 2015 rathore et al 2020 for both mathematical problems analytical models have been derived for predicting flow in layered aquifers with the flow either assumed horizontal youngs 1966 lall and santini 1989 strack 2017a or more realistically parallel to the sloping bed yates et al 1985 youngs and rushton 2009 chiach√≠o et al 2018 or over a curved bedrock profile the influence of stochastic heterogeneity of the porous media on the behavior of phreatic aquifers with respect to free surface position and total discharge was studied by revelli and ridolfi 2000 the results achieved although limited to a case of the absence of infiltration are representative of characteristic behavior of the phreatic surface and show the important effect of heterogeneity in another study meng and li 2019 performed numerical experiments which were focused on the unconfined flow in conditions of random hydraulic conductivity and recharge compared with the case of constant recharge the hydraulic head varies in a larger scale and more uncertainties are involved the results of experiments indicated that the random field is affected by the conductivity and recharge independently serrano 1995 extended dupuit forchheimer analysis to two dimensional plan view heterogeneous random phreatic aquifers although this analysis was limited by ignoring the influence of vertical variations of hydraulic conductivity some regional trends in the behavior of phreatic aquifers were discovered such as functional dependence of the longitudinal groundwater flow velocity on distance scale aquifer recharge and aquifer heterogeneity several mathematical approaches both analytical and numerical have been developed to solve the equations of unconfined flow and transport which is the subject of the present work the most general approach implies the formulation of the problem in terms of a discharge potential representing the vertically integrated specific discharge vector as a function of spatial coordinates over the saturated thickness of the aquifer girinskii 1946 youngs 1966 bear 1972 haitjema 1995a strack and ausk 2015 strack 2017a analytical approaches based on the traditional discharge potential are often limited to problems with simple fixed geometry and trivial boundary conditions recent advances in semi analytical series solution approaches have relaxed these constraints on geometry craig 2008 wong and craig 2010 they have been successfully applied in a variety of realistic configurations even when the modeled domain has stratigraphic layers that are discontinuous and or contain normal faults wong and craig 2010 they have been successfully applied in a variety of realistic configurations even when the modeled domain has stratigraphic layers that are discontinuous and or contain normal faults wong and craig 2010 nevertheless many analytical efforts have still focused on solving the problem of flow in stratified aquifers in a more traditional manner in terms of thehydraulic head by using the dupuit forchheimer approximation chesnaux et al 2005 rathore et al 2018 rathore et al 2020 although this approach is lesscommon and in some respect more challenging useful and unique results can be obtained without conversion of the governing flow equations to the discharge potential domain as it will be shown below in the published works the majority of flow models provide analytical solutions for the water table profiles and less attention is paid to the flow net pattern and the temporal characteristics of chemical species movement in particular such characteristic as the transit time distribution ttd the effect of stratification and anisotropy of permeability on groundwater flow patterns was studied first using the analytical approach by freeze and witherspoon 1966 that was supported by the numerical method freeze and witherspoon 1967 zijl 1999 zlotnik et al 2011 and wang et al 2011 all presented analytical solutions on the effect of anisotropy of permeability on groundwater flow patterns setting the top boundary as a sloped water table or a water table with the configuration of a sine curve the main regional trends in groundwater flow through layered medium have been established in particular the existence of hierarchically nested regional flow systems where groundwater is driven by gravity t√≥th 1963 an assumption regarding a prescribed head boundary condition given head variation at the upper aquifer boundary was utilized later in many analytical models allowing one to study the effect of periodic undulation in water table in the subsurface flow and the flow with the land surface interaction zlotnik et al 2014 zlotnik et al 2011 jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 in real aquifer systems the groundwater flow is controlled by recharge rather than the configuration of water table the position of which depends on the groundwater flow regime and is a priori unknown therefore hydrodynamic conceptualization of the upper aquifer boundary as a recharge specified condition seems more reasonable for the prevailing class of hydrogeological problems compared to the above head specified approach solomon and sudicky 1991 liang et al 2013 goderniaux et al 2013 bresciani et al 2016 rumynin et al 2019 however the relationships of flow net pattern with the type of function of hydraulic conductivity with depth k z under the recharge condition have been characterized mostly in case of confined regional groundwater flow systems solomon et al 2006 rumynin et al 2019 rumynin et al 2020 to our knowledge there are also a few publications analyzing the ttd with respect to k z under unconfined flow conditions in stratified formations rice and raats 1980 luther and haitjema 1998 strack 2017b the purpose of this paper is to develop existing flow theory for wider hydrogeological context namely accounting for an arbitrary variation in the hydraulic conductivity with depth in particular to check the applicability of the classical exponential models of ttd which were originally developed for confined homogeneous groundwater systems in the first part of this paper our main focus is on searching for analytical representations of both the water table height function and the streamline pattern controlled by the areal recharge which serves as a basis for the ttd analysis represented in the concluding part of the paper in such developments we tried to account for specific conditions for both stratified of sedimentary type and hard rock granite gneiss watershed aquifer systems with emphasis on the latter it is conceptualized that the fractured rock formations have typical weathering profiles characterized by a progressive gradual or sharp decrease in the hydraulic conductivity with depth i e the unconfined water flow is considered occurring in a shallow weathered rock aquifer with vertically varying permeability overlying a much less permeable bed such groundwater systems are considered to be subjected to a constant recharge resulting in steady state dupuit forchheimer flow in its shallow and deeper parts with the water table drawn down to the dirichlet discharge boundary however there are certain limitations on the practical use of the suggested model the present model concept ignores the possible lateral heterogeneity of aquifer material in particular the presence of highly localized zones of increased hydraulic conductivity hydrologic windows in confining units are known to occur in unconsolidated aquifer systems and represent areas of focused recharge gentry et al 2006 ivey et al 2008a b the presence of such areas is expected to reduce residence time and age for infiltration causing increased mobility of chemicals and their ability to move in downward direction thus raising the risk of groundwater contamination focused recharge may be caused by surface runoff into shallow topographic depressions b√∂hlke 2002 which also results in spatial variations in the penetration depth of chemicals and complicates the travel time distribution obtained for laterally discontinuous geological bodies this aspect is also not considered in the model setup finally this work was motivated by recent findings rumynin et al 2019 rumynin et al 2020 that showed in particular that there are needs to develop appropriate analytical approaches contributing to the safety assessments for the disposal of radioactive waste in the bedrock formations within the watersheds during the conceptual or preliminary design stages when the uncertainty concerning the geological setting due to a lack of field data and prior knowledge exists the suggested analytical approach can be suitable for screening assessments relevant examples of such applications may be found also in the study of the shallow aquifer contamination problems within agricultural areas contaminant transport at waste residue sites as well as groundwater age assessments with isotope techniques 2 a phreatic surface profile in an unconfined stratified aquifer 2 1 mathematical framework and basic analytical solutions it is commonly believed that water table shape and the height of the phreatic zone as well as the flow pattern are affected by the recharge by atmosphericprecipitation and by the heterogeneity of sediments rocks in particular the variability of the hydraulic conductivity k with depth z in this conceptualization the profile under consideration is a stratified unconfined aquifer the impermeable bed of the aquifer z 0 lies below the drainage base level z di the plane z 0 is also the reference level for the head h h x l each layer has its own hydraulic conductivity k i the layers are numbered from bottom to top and i 1 corresponds to the first layer the base of which lies at the elevation z d 1 z d i is the base of the ith layer this multi layer concept of an unconfined aquifer fits both the stratified type of sediments and hard rock formations affected by weathering in a fractured crystalline rock the deeper part of the aquifer z d 1 is often represented by fresh fractured rock where the permeability is mostly related to tectonic fractures while the upper part of the overlaying rock z d 1 shows a high degree of weathering and provides the transmissive function of the aquifer the flow forms through the recharge by uniform infiltration r 0 lt 1 the aquifer is limited from the right x l by an impermeable boundary representing water divide in mathematics neumann boundary condition h x 0 a constant head dirichlet boundary condition was used to specify the outlet flow condition on the basis of drainage x 0 h d 1 or h d ib i e we assume no seepage surface above the free water level see further comments in the conclusive remarks to this section the total flow discharge per unit width of the aquifer q l2t 1 in any cross section can be given by darcy s law after adopting dupuit forchheimer approximation neglecting the vertical component of the flow youngs 1965 polubarinova kochina 1952 bear 1972 2 1 q r l x t h dh dx

of can be assigned a conventional subscript i equal to the number of such layer for which we have x i x i where x i is the coordinate of the point of intersection of the depression surface with the base of the layer the total transmissivity is the sum of the transmissivities in three flow zones 2 4 t h t j 1 i 1 t j k i h d i here t k b d 1 is the transmissivity below elevation of the horizon

potential is continuous across interzonal boundaries x i to solve the governing equation for the nonlinear free surface flow 2 5 with respect to the potential the boundary conditions must be expressed in terms of the potential as well using discharge potentials for stratified aquifers simplifies the mathematical setup to the point that the equations for the potentials and discharge in terms of position are independent of stratification strack 2017a despite the advantages of the above approach in the present work we will remain within the framework of the study of the governing equation in terms of the hydraulic head which is mathematically close to those presented in rathore et al 2020 and which allows us to gain some critical insights into the stratification effects on the potentiometric surface and the specific discharge distribution in an unconfined aquifer let x i l x i then integrating 2 5 we obtain a general solution of the problem in the form 2 8 x i 2 2 h r t j 1

constant can be found from that of the previous i 1 th constant to find the first constant i 1 c 1 we use the dirichlet boundary condition on the left boundary of the model domain fig 1 assuming for definiteness 2 11 x x 1 0 h d 1 this boundary condition ignores the existence of a seepage surface where water exits from the soil above the elevation z d 1 youngs 1971 in this case x 1 2 l 2 and the

d i b fig 1 the expressions 2 16 and 2 20 are a quadratic equation the coefficients of which depend on the number of the layer i in which the head is to be determined appendix a the number of this layer can be determined by special iteration procedures the obtained solutions can underlay the study of groundwater flows either in stratified strata or in bedrock formations sects 2 2 3 and 4 2 2 an illustrative example this example demonstrates the applicability and calculation efficiency of the above approach an unconfined aquifer l 1000 m is represented by a series of layers of equal thickness di 1 di 5 m with relatively high and low permeability the hydraulic conductivities of the layers ki i 1 6 range from 0 02 m d to 5 m d table while the hydraulic conductivity of the base drainage layer is constant kb 0 1 m d the recharge rate was assumed to be 5 10 4 m d the total confined transmissivity t œÉ remains the same in all three variants table 1 as it was expected water table height h x calculated based on the model solution eq 2 16 is rather sensitive to the order of the layers fig 2 the water table height h as a function of the distance from the watershed position l x differs from the ideal ellipse shape which is expected for flow in a homogeneous aquifer it is obvious that the maximum water table height at x l hmax can t be calculated basing on the effective total transmissivity but requires calculating the entire phreatic surface starting with the outflow boundary x 0 the result differs from what one expects to get in the case of a confined aquifer indeed as the total transmissivity of the stratified confined aquifer does not depend on the order of the layers the water table shape also does not change the applicability of the model eq 2 16 and the dupuit forchheimer approximation were checked by using a numerical solution of 2d flow equation with modflow code mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 allowing a more realistic physical boundary condition accounting for seepage face effect to be specified as can be seen in fig 2 the analytical and numerical solutions are in good agreement dupuit forchheimer approach slightly underestimates the true water table height in the vicinity of the outflow boundary due to the presence of the seepage zone above the water level at x 0 as it was shown earlier youngs 1990 thus the presented comparative analysis showed that the dupuit forchheimer approximation is quite accurate even when the underlying confined layers are close to the stream bed and there are remarkable variations in hydraulic conductivity in vertical direction that may greatly modify the groundwater table profile the analysis extends the earlier work by luther and haitjema 1998 and some other authors 3 equations for the phreatic surface of an aquifer with a continuous vertically nonuniform hydraulic conductivity profile k z 3 1 the geological factors determining the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in fractured rock aquifers the decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth is a general trend in geological media which plays an important role in subsurface fluid flow and solute transport in particular in crystalline bedrock aquifers within watershed areas freeze and cherry 1979 brace 1980 singhal and gupta 2010 condon et al 2020 the observed trend can be explained first by an increase of the overburden pressure which tends to decrease the apertures of joints or fractures thus reducing the permeability louis 1974 bredehoeft et al 1983 saar and manga 2004 and second by a downward decrease of the weathering degree of the parent rock dewandel et al 2017 resulting in a decrease of the number of connected fractures and hence in a decrease of the hydraulic conductivity value chesnaux 2013 although the relationship between weathering processes and the permeability is complex and variable and the relationship between k and depth can be inverse wright 1992 in limestone and chalk aquifers with carbonate lithology and karst development higher hydraulic conductivity values are often associated with the upper zone of fluctuation of the water table jackson 2002 various empirical models have been proposed to describe the functional relationship between the permeability and depth for bedrock generally there are two major categories of models the models of the first category assume that k can decrease exponentially or logarithmically with depth the second category includes power law models such models have finite values of permeability at the ground surface but these values decrease too fast sometimes leading to unrealistically low permeability values at large depth saar and manga 2004 kuang and jiao 2014 hence the overestimation of the role of the shallow flow this means that the traditionalmodels are not always relevant to real geological settings and need to be revised and modified in granite and gneiss watershed aquifers which are the primary interest of this paper the main hydraulically active zone is associated with shallow weathered layers with increased fracture density overlaying the less densely fractured zone of the crystalline basement the contact of these zones is controlled by the paleo surface at the time of weathering processes dewandel et al 2017 or and the location of the modern drainage base thus a bedrock aquifer consisting of two zones with distinctly different hydraulic conductivity distributions with depth can often be recognized moreover the boundary between these zones may separate two distinct hydrogeological regimes a topographic flow regime and deeper local or regional groundwater loops maamar et al 2015 the shallow part of the bedrock aquifer exhibits unconfined conditions and a dependence of the hydraulic conductivity on depth which can often be given byan exponential or power lawfunction most changes in the water level and storage volume occur in the shallow part of the aquifer in contrast the deep part of such aquifer exhibits substantially lesser variations of hydraulic conductivity with depth as noted by many authors below a certain depth associated with the depth of weathering the hydraulic conductivity appears to plateau at a low value making the crystalline bedrock below this depth quasi impermeable in comparison with the shallower bedrock above chesnaux 2013 rumynin et al 2020 thus to describe the change in hydraulic conductivity with depth at a particular point in the chalk aquifer the aquifer profile was defined by two sections jackson 2002 in the lower section hydraulic conductivity is constant in the upper section hydraulic conductivity increases linearly with elevation the two zone concept used in the following analysis recognizes the fact that the water table of an unconfined aquifer lies at different elevations z in a rock formation characterized by a specified distribution of the hydraulic conductivity k z the potentiometric surface h x enters the discharge boundary x 0 at elevation z d 1 fig 3 for simplicity it is assumed that z d 1 corresponds to the lower boundary of the shallow zone of the aquifer as mentioned above power and exponential models are most often used to approximate the function k z these functions will be the focus of our study 3 2 the power law model for variations of hydraulic conductivity in the shallow part of a bedrock aquifer the model can be presented as the function 3 1 k z k b k d k b z d 1 d n d 1 z d k z k b 0 z d 1 assuming that there is a critical depth d l below which the conductivity does not change k k b const fig 3a at n 0 we have a case of a two layer bed with a jump in permeability at the contact between the layers z d 1 k k b 0 z d 1 k k d z d 1 d equation 3 1 is an extended version of the rupp and selker 2005 model for the hydraulic conductivity function k z in the original version it is assumed d 1 0 substituting 3 1 into the expression under integral sign 2 18 and integrating we obtain an exact implicit solution in x 3 2 l x 2 l 2 2 k d k b h d 1 2 r n 1 n 2 h d 1 d n k b r h 2 d 1 2 with n 0 two layer bed we have 3 2a l x 2 l 2 2 k b d 1 r h d 1 k d r h d 1 2 in the dimensionless form we obtain 3 2b 1 x 2 1 2 k d k b d 2 n 1 n 2 h d 1 d n 2 k b h 2 d 1 2 where x x l h h l d 1 d 1 l d d l k d k d r k b k b r at k d k b k homogeneous bed k const the solution to 3 2a becomes simpler 3 3 l x 2 l 2 k r h 2 d 1 2 and now corresponds to the well known fundamental solution for an unconfined aquifer bear 1972 3 3 the exponential model for variation of hydraulic conductivity in the shallow part of a bedrock aquifer the model considers the hydraulic conductivity as an exponentially decaying function k z which takes the maximal value k a at the height of groundwater table fig 3b 3 4 k z k a exp a h z z d 1 k z k b 0 z d 1 where a is a factor characterizing the rate of attenuation of the hydraulic conductivity over depth such idealization is acceptable for shallow groundwater level which correlates with the elevations of the sloping land surface fig 3b and therefore the phreatic surface is everywhere in the upper most permeable part of the bedrock profile therefore one can formally write k z h k a const moreover the very contact of the groundwater table with the above vadoze zone contributes to the development of processes of weathering which increase the permeability of the rock substituting 3 4 into the integrands in equation 2 18 we come to the solution 3 5 l x 2 l 2 2 t h d 1 r 2 k a r a 2 1 exp a h d 1 1 a h d 1 at a 0 the solution 3 5 transforms into the

components vx and vz and then using them in kinematic equations as described below to compute the liquid particles trajectories the first one vx is known from the previous analysis eq 2 3 formally using a 2d continuity equation polubarinova kochina 1952 bear 1972 4 1 v x x v z z 0 one may try to determine the unknown quantity vz specifying boundary condition at the aquifer bottom z 0 such direct approach results in so called first order approximation for the vertical component castro orgaz et al 2012 zerihun 2018 because vx itself was obtained under the dupuit forchheimer concept assuming hydrostatic pore pressure distribution i e implying the vertical component of flow much smaller than the horizontal component and therefore is uncoupled with vz the validity of the approach

integral in the left hand part can be calculated with a piecewise homogeneous representation of the profile of permeability kj fig 5 exemplifies families of flow lines calculated by eq 4 8 for the three stratified systems presented above sect 2 2 which differ in the distributions of the hydraulic conductivity over depth see table in sect 2 2 but for the peculiarities of flow function behavior at permeability discontinuities these plots show fairly good agreement between the analytical model eq 4 8 and the results of numerical simulation the curves computed via forward tracking technique using pmpath code some discrepancies in the streamlines subvertical pieces can be explained by simplifications in the model conceptualization namely a first order approximation for the vertical specific discharge component vz sect 4 1 it is worth mentioning that the average gradients of flow differ considerably in different calculation variants due to the differences in the water table mounding in particular in point x l hmax and this characteristic is controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the layer 1 k 1 overlying the base layer kb the lesser k 1 the greater hmax 4 3 special cases for aquifers with continuous vertically non uniform hydraulic conductivity profile k z the analytical models of the permeability profile k z and the corresponding functions h x and t h x can be used to calculate the trajectories of the motion of particles in an unconfined aquifer however it is of use to start such analysis by solving 2d flow problem in a homogeneous aquifer 4 3 1 a

analyzing the asymptotic behavior of more complex heterogeneous aquifers which is useful for checking the accuracy of the obtained mathematical results in particular this concerns the discussed examples of solutions to the problem of flow in watershed aquifers with depth dependent hydraulic conductivity the solutions can be split into two particularparts each of them is solved separately to

1 and hmax measured with respect to the aquifer base similar to luther and haitjema 1998 for unconfined aquifers with gently sloping water table suitable approximations can be obtained in the framework of the analysis of confined flow systems as could be expected there is a refraction of flow lines due to the contrast in hydraulic conductivity between the layers and the refraction angle is the greater the higher the contrast in the permeability one may check that the tangent law is satisfied at the boundary qualitatively this conclusion coincides with the solution of the problem in the confined setting strack 2017a p 374 4 3 3 power function decay of hydraulic conductivity see appendix d in the case of flow lines in the upper half plain d 1 z h 4 11a h 0 z k b k d k b Œæ d 1 d n k b

to be constant haitjema 1995b introduced f œÑ a cumulative transit time distribution function cumulative ttd which determines the portion q œÑ of the total discharge q which has groundwater transit time less than or equal to œÑ i e 5 3 f œÑ q œÑ q the dimensionless time œÑ is the ratio of time t to the mean transit time t m œÑ t t m statistically the relationships for f œÑ describe the frequency distribution of the times that it takes water molecules to reach the aquifer outlet from all locations in the source aquifer catchment area mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 the other common term for the transit time is the derivative of f with respect to œÑ 5 4 f œÑ d f d œÑ which can be referred to as the probability density function of the transit time or transit time distribution ttd which is the integrated response time of an aquifer to a unit concentration input the ttd may be regarded as a transfer function of many subsurface flow systems rice and raats 1980 the functions f œÑ and f œÑ are fundamental characteristics for determining aquifer response to pollution event or environmental isotopes distribution in groundwater they were originally derived for a semi infinite confined aquifer of constant thickness and recharge assuming steady state dupuit forchheimer flow haitjema 1995b and can be represented by the exponential model 5 5 f œÑ 1 exp œÑ f œÑ exp œÑ which formally coincides with a lumped reservoir type model widely used in the hydrology field ma≈Çoszewski and zuber 1982 solomon et al 2006 leray et al 2012 later based on the dupuit forchheimer concept the derivation of f œÑ and f œÑ was presented for stratified confined aquifers luther and haitjema 1998 rumynin et al 2020 the use of average hydraulic head as the saturated aquifer thickness calculating f œÑ may be a good approximation for low gradient unconfined flow luther and haitjema 1998 in a closed form analytical solution for ttd through unconfined homogeneous aquifers was suggested by chesnaux et al 2005 it was shown that even under these idealistic conditions the accuracy of the approximate assessments of the ttd based on the average saturated aquifer thickness can diminish as the hydraulic gradient rises 5 2 representation of the ttd functions for an unconfined aquifer with an arbitrary distribution of the hydraulic conductivity equation 5 2 can be rewritten in a dimensionless form 5 6 œÑ f 0 t h d Œ∑ k Œ∑ f 1 Œ∑ t h 0 h Œ∑ k Œ∑ Œ∂ d Œ∂ where the value in the lower integration limit in eq 5 6 is a function f f œÑ the cumulative ttd in which the dimensionless transit time 5 7 œÑ rt œÜ l characterizes the movement of a water particle along a flowpath flagged in this context as f flow line f Œ∑ 0 fig 10 Œ∂ Œæ l and Œ∑ x l are dimensionless dummy variables formally speaking in this mathematical setting the time scale for the exchange of a recharge water molecule with bulk groundwater is characterized by the effective time t um œÜ l r and it should depend on the vertical distribution of hydraulic conductivity also equation 5 6 is written in such a way that k Œ∑ f implicitly represents the dimensionless hydraulic conductivity changes with Œ∑ along f flow line k Œ∑ Œ∂ is the dimensionless hydraulic conductivity at Œ∑ Œ∂ h Œ∑ is the dimensionless water table height at Œ∑ h f is the same at Œ∑ f the average saturated aquifer thickness is no longer present in the above relationships thus the actual residence time t is not normalized with respect to the mean transit time œÜ m r as it usually did in the case of analysis of the confined flow to determine the ttd as the derivative of f with respect to œÑ f œÑ for flow in the aquifer under consideration one can transform eq 5 6 by differentiating its left and right sides with respect to Œ∑ 5 8 d œÑ d Œ∑ d d Œ∑ f 0 t h d Œ∑ k Œ∑ f 1 Œ∑ d d Œ∑ 0 f t h d Œ∑ k Œ∑ f 1 Œ∑ using the rule of differentiation of integrals with variable upper limits we obtain 5 9 d œÑ d Œ∑ t h k f f 1 f t h 0 h f k f Œ∂ d Œ∂ the desired derivative df d œÑ i e ttd takes the form 5 10 f œÑ df d œÑ k f f 1 f t h df d Œ∑ where 5 10a k f f 1 f t h d Œ∑ d œÑ is the change of water particle velocity along the f flow line k f f is the relative dimensionless k f f r hydraulic conductivity at the water table where the f flow line begins 5 3 an illustrative example this example was formulated to show how the vertically variable conductivity approximated by the power law model eq 3 1 can influence f œÑ and f œÑ in groundwater under unconfined conditions fig 11 a c the aquifer geometry and the combined parameters kb r and kd r were specified as in the previous example figs 7 and 8 the first thing which is illustrated by fig 11 is that the performednumerical modeling confirmsthe obtained analytical developments regarding the function f œÑ where œÑ is defined by eq 5 7 some minor differences occur for small dimensionless time œÑ due to the inaccuracy of approximation of the outflow boundary condition based on the dupuit forchheimer assumption further fig 11 a c suggest that function f œÑ shows low sensitivity to changes in the exponent n other parameters remaining constant such result can be explained by the fact that an increase in the exponent of power n leads to a decrease in the effective transmissivity of the aquifer resulting in turn in a rise in the hydraulic gradients due to an increase in the contrast between d 1 and hmax as seen in fig 8 the two factors according to darcy s law compensate for each other thereby preventing significant changes in the actual residence time finally to check the applicability of the classical exponential model of ttd eqs 5 5 which were originally developed for confined groundwater systems characterized by a constant mean residence time tm graphs in fig 11 were combined with calculations by eqs 5 5 with the dimensionless time assumed to be equal to œÑ d 1 œÑ is as in eq 5 7 which implies that water flows only through the confined part of the aquifer 0 z d 1 it can be seen that the newly calculated curves fig 11 a c deviate from the model 5 6 except for the case of a homogeneous aquifer fig 11d where the flow is characterized by a low hydraulic gradient and a saturated thickness close to d 1 in contrast f œÑ calculated numerically based on f œÑ eq 5 10 is rather sensitive to n the differences between the derivatives d Œ∑ d œÑ illustrating the change in water particle velocity along the f flow line and df d œÑ corresponding to the ttd also increase with increasing n the functions are close to each other when n 0 i e when the saturated thickness is nearly constant water table is gently sloping fig 8 in a homogeneous aquifer df d œÑ and d Œ∑ d œÑ practically coincide i e df d œÑ d Œ∑ d œÑ which is possible when df d Œ∑ 1 eq 5 10 finally the last graph fig 11d shows that the suggested solution eq 5 6 is in a good agreement with the analytical solution obtained earlier in a closed form chesnaux et al 2005 as well as with the numerical result 6 conclusions approximatesolutions for phreatic flowin a stratified aquifer with a discretely specified arbitrary series of layers differing in hydraulic conductivity k z have been derived the results of calculations show that for unconfined flow the phreatic surface is significantly affected by the geometry of the aquifer and the pattern of its permeability profile the obtained generalized solution converges to known analytical solutions available in the special cases of a one layer and two layer aquifers the solution was extended to a continuously varying hydraulic conductivity k z in this respect two decay functions k z power law and exponential were suggested to study the behavior of the potential function h x flow net and temporal characteristics related to the residence time the analytical forms of k z were adjusted to be appropriate for the observed trends in fractured crystalline granite gneiss formations which are characterized by a downward decrease of the degree of rock weathering however the accompanying decrease of k z is restricted by a certain asymptotic value i e the hydraulic conductivity of the low unweathering zone with respect to hard rock formations the model of the power law function approximating the aquifer permeability profile was investigated in a more detailed manner the flow paths in unconfined watershed aquifers exhibit changes in the hydraulic conductivity due to lithological stratification or weathering effects which are usually far more complex than those in uniform confined aquifers in stratified aquifers characterized by a sharp contrast in the hydraulic conductivity of layers ki the curvature of the phreatic surface the change in saturated aquifer thickness affects the deformation of flow lines near the outflow boundary in the case of nonpoint source this is a factor smoothing the contrast in solute concentrations between the upper and lower parts of the aquifer in aquifers characterized by decay functions k z as expected flow path density increases near the water table thereby increasing the protection of groundwater in the lower part of the aquifer against contamination from nonpoint sources the exponential approximation of the ttd functions f œÑ and f œÑ given by eqs 5 5 originally derived to represent the residence time distribution for a watershed aquifer with constant ratio œÜ m r haitjema 1995b luther and haitjema 1998 leray et al 2016 may be not very accurate for the unconfined aquifers discussed above the conductivity in which varies vertically i e the traditionally used time scale characteristic i e mean transit time may not be sufficient to describe the solute transport and exchange of a recharge water with bulk groundwater under unconfined flow conditions from the presented example of a flow in a rock exhibiting a power law regression of the hydraulic conductivity on depth it follows that the effect of the exponent of power on function f œÑ is insignificant while the other characteristic of the transit time f œÑ is quite sensitive to this coefficient the sensitivity of the residence time to hydraulic conductivity variations in unconfined stratified systems was earlier investigated by luther and haitjema 1998 who showed that the exponential model of ttd works well in most cases of flow under the conditions of low head gradient and where the spatial variations in the hydraulic conductivity of porous material are relatively small this was confirmed later using modeling technique for both synthesized and realistic aquifer representations basu et al 2012 farlin and ma≈Çoszewski 2018 the suggested model allows avoiding the difficulty in estimating a representative saturated thickness for an unconfined aquifer especially at larger scales which requires ttd related assessments thus the present work can help us to better understand the flow and transport processes in unconfined aquifers and to determine the applicability of the earlier

surface has been the subject of numerous studies youngs 1986 lall and santini 1989 strack 2017a which have a lot in common with developments related to the delineation of the seawater freshwater interface in stratified coastal aquifers strack and ausk 2015 rathore et al 2020 for both mathematical problems analytical models have been derived for predicting flow in layered aquifers with the flow either assumed horizontal youngs 1966 lall and santini 1989 strack 2017a or more realistically parallel to the sloping bed yates et al 1985 youngs and rushton 2009 chiach√≠o et al 2018 or over a curved bedrock profile the influence of stochastic heterogeneity of the porous media on the behavior of phreatic aquifers with respect to free surface position and total discharge was studied by revelli and ridolfi 2000 the results achieved although limited to a case of the absence of infiltration are representative of characteristic behavior of the phreatic surface and show the important effect of heterogeneity in another study meng and li 2019 performed numerical experiments which were focused on the unconfined flow in conditions of random hydraulic conductivity and recharge compared with the case of constant recharge the hydraulic head varies in a larger scale and more uncertainties are involved the results of experiments indicated that the random field is affected by the conductivity and recharge independently serrano 1995 extended dupuit forchheimer analysis to two dimensional plan view heterogeneous random phreatic aquifers although this analysis was limited by ignoring the influence of vertical variations of hydraulic conductivity some regional trends in the behavior of phreatic aquifers were discovered such as functional dependence of the longitudinal groundwater flow velocity on distance scale aquifer recharge and aquifer heterogeneity several mathematical approaches both analytical and numerical have been developed to solve the equations of unconfined flow and transport which is the subject of the present work the most general approach implies the formulation of the problem in terms of a discharge potential representing the vertically integrated specific discharge vector as a function of spatial coordinates over the saturated thickness of the aquifer girinskii 1946 youngs 1966 bear 1972 haitjema 1995a strack and ausk 2015 strack 2017a analytical approaches based on the traditional discharge potential are often limited to problems with simple fixed geometry and trivial boundary conditions recent advances in semi analytical series solution approaches have relaxed these constraints on geometry craig 2008 wong and craig 2010 they have been successfully applied in a variety of realistic configurations even when the modeled domain has stratigraphic layers that are discontinuous and or contain normal faults wong and craig 2010 they have been successfully applied in a variety of realistic configurations even when the modeled domain has stratigraphic layers that are discontinuous and or contain normal faults wong and craig 2010 nevertheless many analytical efforts have still focused on solving the problem of flow in stratified aquifers in a more traditional manner in terms of thehydraulic head by using the dupuit forchheimer approximation chesnaux et al 2005 rathore et al 2018 rathore et al 2020 although this approach is lesscommon and in some respect more challenging useful and unique results can be obtained without conversion of the governing flow equations to the discharge potential domain as it will be shown below in the published works the majority of flow models provide analytical solutions for the water table profiles and less attention is paid to the flow net pattern and the temporal characteristics of chemical species movement in particular such characteristic as the transit time distribution ttd the effect of stratification and anisotropy of permeability on groundwater flow patterns was studied first using the analytical approach by freeze and witherspoon 1966 that was supported by the numerical method freeze and witherspoon 1967 zijl 1999 zlotnik et al 2011 and wang et al 2011 all presented analytical solutions on the effect of anisotropy of permeability on groundwater flow patterns setting the top boundary as a sloped water table or a water table with the configuration of a sine curve the main regional trends in groundwater flow through layered medium have been established in particular the existence of hierarchically nested regional flow systems where groundwater is driven by gravity t√≥th 1963 an assumption regarding a prescribed head boundary condition given head variation at the upper aquifer boundary was utilized later in many analytical models allowing one to study the effect of periodic undulation in water table in the subsurface flow and the flow with the land surface interaction zlotnik et al 2014 zlotnik et al 2011 jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 in real aquifer systems the groundwater flow is controlled by recharge rather than the configuration of water table the position of which depends on the groundwater flow regime and is a priori unknown therefore hydrodynamic conceptualization of the upper aquifer boundary as a recharge specified condition seems more reasonable for the prevailing class of hydrogeological problems compared to the above head specified approach solomon and sudicky 1991 liang et al 2013 goderniaux et al 2013 bresciani et al 2016 rumynin et al 2019 however the relationships of flow net pattern with the type of function of hydraulic conductivity with depth k z under the recharge condition have been characterized mostly in case of confined regional groundwater flow systems solomon et al 2006 rumynin et al 2019 rumynin et al 2020 to our knowledge there are also a few publications analyzing the ttd with respect to k z under unconfined flow conditions in stratified formations rice and raats 1980 luther and haitjema 1998 strack 2017b the purpose of this paper is to develop existing flow theory for wider hydrogeological context namely accounting for an arbitrary variation in the hydraulic conductivity with depth in particular to check the applicability of the classical exponential models of ttd which were originally developed for confined homogeneous groundwater systems in the first part of this paper our main focus is on searching for analytical representations of both the water table height function and the streamline pattern controlled by the areal recharge which serves as a basis for the ttd analysis represented in the concluding part of the paper in such developments we tried to account for specific conditions for both stratified of sedimentary type and hard rock granite gneiss watershed aquifer systems with emphasis on the latter it is conceptualized that the fractured rock formations have typical weathering profiles characterized by a progressive gradual or sharp decrease in the hydraulic conductivity with depth i e the unconfined water flow is considered occurring in a shallow weathered rock aquifer with vertically varying permeability overlying a much less permeable bed such groundwater systems are considered to be subjected to a constant recharge resulting in steady state dupuit forchheimer flow in its shallow and deeper parts with the water table drawn down to the dirichlet discharge boundary however there are certain limitations on the practical use of the suggested model the present model concept ignores the possible lateral heterogeneity of aquifer material in particular the presence of highly localized zones of increased hydraulic conductivity hydrologic windows in confining units are known to occur in unconsolidated aquifer systems and represent areas of focused recharge gentry et al 2006 ivey et al 2008a b the presence of such areas is expected to reduce residence time and age for infiltration causing increased mobility of chemicals and their ability to move in downward direction thus raising the risk of groundwater contamination focused recharge may be caused by surface runoff into shallow topographic depressions b√∂hlke 2002 which also results in spatial variations in the penetration depth of chemicals and complicates the travel time distribution obtained for laterally discontinuous geological bodies this aspect is also not considered in the model setup finally this work was motivated by recent findings rumynin et al 2019 rumynin et al 2020 that showed in particular that there are needs to develop appropriate analytical approaches contributing to the safety assessments for the disposal of radioactive waste in the bedrock formations within the watersheds during the conceptual or preliminary design stages when the uncertainty concerning the geological setting due to a lack of field data and prior knowledge exists the suggested analytical approach can be suitable for screening assessments relevant examples of such applications may be found also in the study of the shallow aquifer contamination problems within agricultural areas contaminant transport at waste residue sites as well as groundwater age assessments with isotope techniques 2 a phreatic surface profile in an unconfined stratified aquifer 2 1 mathematical framework and basic analytical solutions it is commonly believed that water table shape and the height of the phreatic zone as well as the flow pattern are affected by the recharge by atmosphericprecipitation and by the heterogeneity of sediments rocks in particular the variability of the hydraulic conductivity k with depth z in this conceptualization the profile under consideration is a stratified unconfined aquifer the impermeable bed of the aquifer z 0 lies below the drainage base level z di the plane z 0 is also the reference level for the head h h x l each layer has its own hydraulic conductivity k i the layers are numbered from bottom to top and i 1 corresponds to the first layer the base of which lies at the elevation z d 1 z d i is the base of the ith layer this multi layer concept of an unconfined aquifer fits both the stratified type of sediments and hard rock formations affected by weathering in a fractured crystalline rock the deeper part of the aquifer z d 1 is often represented by fresh fractured rock where the permeability is mostly related to tectonic fractures while the upper part of the overlaying rock z d 1 shows a high degree of weathering and provides the transmissive function of the aquifer the flow forms through the recharge by uniform infiltration r 0 lt 1 the aquifer is limited from the right x l by an impermeable boundary representing water divide in mathematics neumann boundary condition h x 0 a constant head dirichlet boundary condition was used to specify the outlet flow condition on the basis of drainage x 0 h d 1 or h d ib i e we assume no seepage surface above the free water level see further comments in the conclusive remarks to this section the total flow discharge per unit width of the aquifer q l2t 1 in any cross

in terms of the potential as well using discharge potentials for stratified aquifers simplifies the mathematical setup to the point that the equations for the potentials and discharge in terms of position are independent of stratification strack 2017a despite the advantages of the above approach in the present work we will remain within the framework of the study of the governing equation in terms of the hydraulic head which is mathematically close to those presented in rathore et al 2020 and which allows us to gain some critical insights into the stratification effects on the potentiometric surface and the specific discharge distribution in an unconfined aquifer let x i l x i then integrating 2 5 we obtain a general solution of the problem in the form 2 8 x i 2 2 h r t j 1

d i b fig 1 the expressions 2 16 and 2 20 are a quadratic equation the coefficients of which depend on the number of the layer i in which the head is to be determined appendix a the number of this layer can be determined by special iteration procedures the obtained solutions can underlay the study of groundwater flows either in stratified strata or in bedrock formations sects 2 2 3 and 4 2 2 an illustrative example this example demonstrates the applicability and calculation efficiency of the above approach an unconfined aquifer l 1000 m is represented by a series of layers of equal thickness di 1 di 5 m with relatively high and low permeability the hydraulic conductivities of the layers ki i 1 6 range from 0 02 m d to 5 m d table while the hydraulic conductivity of the base drainage layer is constant kb 0 1 m d the recharge rate was assumed to be 5 10 4 m d the total confined transmissivity t œÉ remains the same in all three variants table 1 as it was expected water table height h x calculated based on the model solution eq 2 16 is rather sensitive to the order of the layers fig 2 the water table height h as a function of the distance from the watershed position l x differs from the ideal ellipse shape which is expected for flow in a homogeneous aquifer it is obvious that the maximum water table height at x l hmax can t be calculated basing on the effective total transmissivity but requires calculating the entire phreatic surface starting with the outflow boundary x 0 the result differs from what one expects to get in the case of a confined aquifer indeed as the total transmissivity of the stratified confined aquifer does not depend on the order of the layers the water table shape also does not change the applicability of the model eq 2 16 and the dupuit forchheimer approximation were checked by using a numerical solution of 2d flow equation with modflow code mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 allowing a more realistic physical boundary condition accounting for seepage face effect to be specified as can be seen in fig 2 the analytical and numerical solutions are in good agreement dupuit forchheimer approach slightly underestimates the true water table height in the vicinity of the outflow boundary due to the presence of the seepage zone above the water level at x 0 as it was shown earlier youngs 1990 thus the presented comparative analysis showed that the dupuit forchheimer approximation is quite accurate even when the underlying confined layers are close to the stream bed and there are remarkable variations in hydraulic conductivity in vertical direction that may greatly modify the groundwater table profile the analysis extends the earlier work by luther and haitjema 1998 and some other authors 3 equations for the phreatic surface of an aquifer with a continuous vertically nonuniform hydraulic conductivity profile k z 3 1 the geological factors determining the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in fractured rock aquifers the decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth is a general trend in geological media which plays an important role in subsurface fluid flow and solute transport in particular in crystalline bedrock aquifers within watershed areas freeze and cherry 1979 brace 1980 singhal and gupta 2010 condon et al 2020 the observed trend can be explained first by an increase of the overburden pressure which tends to decrease the apertures of joints or fractures thus reducing the permeability louis 1974 bredehoeft et al 1983 saar and manga 2004 and second by a downward decrease of the weathering degree of the parent rock dewandel et al 2017 resulting in a decrease of the number of connected fractures and hence in a decrease of the hydraulic conductivity value chesnaux 2013 although the relationship between weathering processes and the permeability is complex and variable and the relationship between k and depth can be inverse wright 1992 in limestone and chalk aquifers with carbonate lithology and karst development higher hydraulic conductivity values are often associated with the upper zone of fluctuation of the water table jackson 2002 various empirical models have been proposed to describe the functional relationship between the permeability and depth for bedrock generally there are two major categories of models the models of the first category assume that k can decrease exponentially or logarithmically with depth the second category includes power law models such models have finite values of permeability at the ground surface but these values decrease too fast sometimes leading to unrealistically low permeability values at large depth saar and manga 2004 kuang and jiao 2014 hence the overestimation of the role of the shallow flow this means that the traditionalmodels are not always relevant to real geological settings and need to be revised and modified in granite and gneiss watershed aquifers which are the primary interest of this paper the main hydraulically active zone is associated with shallow weathered layers with increased fracture density overlaying the less densely fractured zone of the crystalline basement the contact of these zones is controlled by the paleo surface at the time of weathering processes dewandel et al 2017 or and the location of the modern drainage base thus a bedrock aquifer consisting of two zones with distinctly different hydraulic conductivity distributions with depth can often be recognized moreover the boundary between these zones may separate two distinct hydrogeological regimes a topographic flow regime and deeper local or regional groundwater loops maamar et al 2015 the shallow part of the bedrock aquifer exhibits unconfined conditions and a dependence of the hydraulic conductivity on depth which can often be given byan exponential or power lawfunction most changes in the water level and storage volume occur in the shallow part of the aquifer in contrast the deep part of such aquifer exhibits substantially lesser variations of hydraulic conductivity with depth as noted by many authors below a certain depth associated with the depth of weathering the hydraulic conductivity appears to plateau at a low value making the crystalline bedrock below this depth quasi impermeable in comparison with the shallower bedrock above chesnaux 2013 rumynin et al 2020 thus to describe the change in hydraulic conductivity with depth at a particular point in the chalk aquifer the aquifer profile was defined by two sections jackson 2002 in the lower section hydraulic conductivity is constant in the upper section hydraulic conductivity increases linearly with elevation the two zone concept used in the following analysis recognizes the fact that the water table of an unconfined aquifer lies at different elevations z in a rock formation characterized by a specified distribution of the hydraulic conductivity k z the potentiometric surface h x enters the discharge boundary x 0 at elevation z d 1 fig 3 for simplicity it is assumed that z d 1 corresponds to the lower boundary of the shallow zone of the aquifer as mentioned above power and exponential models are most often used to approximate the function k z these functions will be the focus of our study 3 2 the power law model for variations of hydraulic conductivity in the shallow part of a bedrock aquifer the model can be presented as the function 3 1 k z k b k d k b z d 1 d n d 1 z d k z k b 0 z d 1 assuming that there is a critical depth d l below which the conductivity does not change k k b const fig 3a at n

model for the hydraulic conductivity function k z in the original version it is assumed d 1 0 substituting 3 1 into the expression under integral sign 2 18 and integrating we obtain an exact implicit

1 x 2 1 2 k d k b d 2 n 1 n 2 h d 1 d n 2 k b h 2 d 1 2 where x x l h h l d 1 d 1 l d d l k d k d r k b k b r at k d k b k homogeneous bed k const the solution to 3 2a becomes simpler 3 3 l x 2 l 2 k r h 2 d 1 2 and now corresponds to the well known fundamental solution for an unconfined aquifer bear 1972 3 3 the exponential model for variation of hydraulic conductivity in the shallow part of a bedrock aquifer the model considers the hydraulic conductivity as an exponentially decaying function k z which takes the maximal value k a at the height of groundwater table fig 3b 3 4 k z k a exp a h z z d 1 k z k b 0 z d 1 where a is a factor characterizing the rate of attenuation of the hydraulic conductivity over depth such idealization is acceptable for shallow groundwater level which correlates with the elevations of the sloping land surface fig 3b and therefore the phreatic surface is everywhere in the upper most permeable part of the bedrock profile therefore one can formally write k z h k a const moreover the very contact of the groundwater table with the above vadoze zone contributes to the development of processes of weathering which increase the permeability of the rock substituting 3 4 into the integrands in equation 2 18 we come to the solution 3 5 l x 2 l 2 2 t h d 1 r 2 k a r a 2 1 exp a h d 1 1 a h d 1 at a 0 the solution 3 5 transforms into the

generated by uniform recharge in unconfined aquifers 4 the flow line pattern generated by uniform recharge in unconfined aquifers to solve the problem we need first to determine specific discharge components vx and vz and then using them in kinematic equations as described below to compute the liquid particles trajectories the first one vx is known from the previous analysis eq 2 3 formally using a 2d continuity equation polubarinova kochina 1952 bear 1972 4 1 v x x v z z 0 one may try to determine the unknown quantity vz specifying boundary condition at the aquifer bottom z 0 such direct approach results in so called first order approximation for the vertical component castro orgaz et al 2012 zerihun 2018 because vx itself was obtained under the dupuit forchheimer concept assuming hydrostatic pore pressure distribution i e implying the vertical component of flow much smaller than the horizontal component and therefore is uncoupled with vz the validity of the approach can be verified through mathematical modeling 4 1 an approximate solution the first order approximation for the vertical specific discharge component can be deduced from the integration of the continuity equation 4 1 4 2 0 z v x x d z 0 z v z z d z v z 0 suppose that the horizontal specific discharge v x is determined by the gradient darcy law which considering 2 3 can be written as 4 3 v x

integral in the left hand part can be calculated with a piecewise homogeneous representation of the profile of permeability kj fig 5 exemplifies families of flow lines calculated by eq 4 8 for the three stratified systems presented above sect 2 2 which differ in the distributions of the hydraulic conductivity over depth see table in sect 2 2 but for the peculiarities of flow function behavior at permeability discontinuities these plots show fairly good agreement between the analytical model eq 4 8 and the results of numerical simulation the curves computed via forward tracking technique using pmpath code some discrepancies in the streamlines subvertical pieces can be explained by simplifications in the model conceptualization namely a first order approximation for the vertical specific discharge component vz sect 4 1 it is worth mentioning that the average gradients of flow differ considerably in different calculation variants due to the differences in the water table mounding in particular in point x l hmax and this characteristic is controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the layer 1 k 1 overlying the base layer kb the lesser k 1 the greater hmax 4 3 special cases for aquifers with continuous vertically non uniform hydraulic conductivity profile k z the analytical models of the permeability profile k z and the corresponding functions h x and t h x can be used to calculate the trajectories of the motion of particles in an unconfined aquifer however it is of use to start such analysis by solving 2d flow problem in a homogeneous aquifer 4 3 1 a

analyzing the asymptotic behavior of more complex heterogeneous aquifers which is useful for checking the accuracy of the obtained mathematical results in particular this concerns the discussed examples of solutions to the problem of flow in watershed aquifers with depth dependent hydraulic conductivity the solutions can be split into two particularparts each of them is solved separately to

1 and hmax measured with respect to the aquifer base similar to luther and haitjema 1998 for unconfined aquifers with gently sloping water table suitable approximations can be obtained in the framework of the analysis of confined flow systems as could be expected there is a refraction of flow lines due to the contrast in hydraulic conductivity between the layers and the refraction angle is the greater the higher the contrast in the permeability one may check that the tangent law is satisfied at the boundary qualitatively this conclusion coincides with the solution of the problem in the

time and related characteristic functions 5 1 a physically based ttd concept for a confined aquifer having a constant ratio of œÜ m r t m a mean transit time m is the thickness of the aquifer assumed to be constant haitjema 1995b introduced f œÑ a cumulative transit time distribution function cumulative ttd which determines the portion q œÑ of the total discharge q which has groundwater transit time less than or equal to œÑ i e 5 3 f œÑ q œÑ q the dimensionless time œÑ is the ratio of time t to the mean transit time t m œÑ t t m statistically the relationships for f œÑ describe the frequency distribution of the times that it takes water molecules to reach the aquifer outlet from all locations in the source aquifer catchment area mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 the other common term for the transit time is the derivative of f with respect to œÑ 5 4 f œÑ d f d œÑ which can be referred to as the probability density function of the transit time or transit time distribution ttd which is the integrated response time of an aquifer to a unit concentration input the ttd may be regarded as a transfer function of many subsurface flow systems rice and raats 1980 the functions f œÑ and f œÑ are fundamental characteristics for determining aquifer response to pollution event or environmental isotopes distribution in groundwater they were originally derived for a semi infinite confined aquifer of constant thickness and recharge assuming steady state dupuit forchheimer flow haitjema 1995b and can be represented by the exponential model 5 5 f œÑ 1 exp œÑ f œÑ exp œÑ which formally coincides with a lumped reservoir type model widely used in the hydrology field ma≈Çoszewski and zuber 1982 solomon et al 2006 leray et al 2012 later based on the dupuit forchheimer concept the derivation of f œÑ and f œÑ was presented for stratified confined aquifers luther and haitjema 1998 rumynin et al 2020 the use of average hydraulic head as the saturated aquifer thickness calculating f œÑ may be a good approximation for low gradient unconfined flow luther and haitjema 1998 in a closed form analytical solution for ttd through unconfined homogeneous aquifers was suggested by chesnaux et al 2005 it was shown that even under these idealistic conditions the accuracy of the approximate assessments of the ttd based on the average saturated aquifer thickness can diminish as the hydraulic gradient rises 5 2 representation of the ttd functions for an unconfined aquifer with an arbitrary distribution of the hydraulic conductivity equation 5 2 can be rewritten in a dimensionless form 5 6 œÑ f 0 t h d Œ∑ k Œ∑ f 1 Œ∑ t h 0 h Œ∑ k Œ∑ Œ∂ d Œ∂ where the value in the lower integration limit in eq 5 6 is a function f f œÑ the cumulative ttd in which the dimensionless transit time 5 7 œÑ rt œÜ l characterizes the movement of a water particle along a flowpath flagged in this context as f flow line f Œ∑ 0 fig 10 Œ∂ Œæ l and Œ∑ x l are dimensionless dummy variables formally speaking in this mathematical setting the time scale for the exchange of a recharge water molecule with bulk groundwater is characterized by the effective time t um œÜ l r and it should depend on the vertical distribution of hydraulic conductivity also equation 5 6 is written in such a way that k Œ∑ f implicitly represents the dimensionless hydraulic conductivity changes with Œ∑ along f flow line k Œ∑ Œ∂ is the dimensionless hydraulic conductivity at Œ∑ Œ∂ h Œ∑ is the dimensionless water table height at Œ∑ h f is the same at Œ∑ f the average saturated aquifer thickness is no longer present in the above relationships thus the actual residence time t is not normalized with respect to the mean transit time œÜ m r as it usually did in the case of analysis of the confined flow to determine the ttd as the derivative of f with respect to œÑ f œÑ for flow in the aquifer under consideration one can transform eq 5 6 by differentiating its left and right sides with respect to Œ∑ 5 8 d œÑ d Œ∑ d d Œ∑ f 0 t h d Œ∑ k Œ∑ f 1 Œ∑ d d Œ∑ 0 f t h d Œ∑ k Œ∑ f 1 Œ∑ using the rule of differentiation of integrals with variable upper limits we obtain 5 9 d œÑ d Œ∑ t h k f f 1 f t h 0 h f k f Œ∂ d Œ∂ the desired derivative df d œÑ i e ttd takes the form 5 10 f œÑ df d œÑ k f f 1 f t h df d Œ∑ where 5 10a k f f 1 f t h d Œ∑ d œÑ is the change of water particle velocity along the f flow line k f f is the relative dimensionless k f f r hydraulic conductivity at the water table where the f flow line begins 5 3 an illustrative example this example was formulated to show how the vertically variable conductivity approximated by the power law model eq 3 1 can influence f œÑ and f œÑ in groundwater under unconfined conditions fig 11 a c the aquifer geometry and the combined parameters kb r and kd r were specified as in the previous example figs 7 and 8 the first thing which is illustrated by fig 11 is that the performednumerical modeling confirmsthe obtained analytical developments regarding the function f œÑ where œÑ is defined by eq 5 7 some minor differences occur for small dimensionless time œÑ due to the inaccuracy of approximation of the outflow boundary condition based on the dupuit forchheimer assumption further fig 11 a c suggest that function f œÑ shows low sensitivity to changes in the exponent n other parameters remaining constant such result can be explained by the fact that an increase in the exponent of power n leads to a decrease in the effective transmissivity of the aquifer resulting in turn in a rise in the hydraulic gradients due to an increase in the contrast between d 1 and hmax as seen in fig 8 the two factors according to darcy s law compensate for each other thereby preventing significant changes in the actual residence time finally to check the applicability of the classical exponential model of ttd eqs 5 5 which were originally developed for confined groundwater systems characterized by a constant mean residence time tm graphs in fig 11 were combined with calculations by eqs 5 5 with the dimensionless time assumed to be equal to œÑ d 1 œÑ is as in eq 5 7 which implies that water flows only through the confined part of the aquifer 0 z d 1 it can be seen that the newly calculated curves fig 11 a c deviate from the model 5 6 except for the case of a homogeneous aquifer fig 11d where the flow is characterized by a low hydraulic gradient and a saturated thickness close to d 1 in contrast f œÑ calculated numerically based on f œÑ eq 5 10 is rather sensitive to n the differences between the derivatives d Œ∑ d œÑ illustrating the change in water particle velocity along the f flow line and df d œÑ corresponding to the ttd also increase with increasing n the functions are close to each other when n 0 i e when the saturated thickness is nearly constant water table is gently sloping fig 8 in a homogeneous aquifer df d œÑ and d Œ∑ d œÑ practically coincide i e df d œÑ d Œ∑ d œÑ which is possible when df d Œ∑ 1 eq 5 10 finally the last graph fig 11d shows that the suggested solution eq 5 6 is in a good agreement with the analytical solution obtained earlier in a closed form chesnaux et al 2005 as well as with the numerical result 6 conclusions approximatesolutions for phreatic flowin a stratified aquifer with a discretely specified arbitrary series of layers differing in hydraulic conductivity k z have been derived the results of calculations show that for unconfined flow the phreatic surface is significantly affected by the geometry of the aquifer and the pattern of its permeability profile the obtained generalized solution converges to known analytical solutions available in the special cases of a one layer and two layer aquifers the solution was extended to a continuously varying hydraulic conductivity k z in this respect two decay functions k z power law and exponential were suggested to study the behavior of the potential function h x flow net and temporal characteristics related to the residence time the analytical forms of k z were adjusted to be appropriate for the observed trends in fractured crystalline granite gneiss formations which are characterized by a downward decrease of the degree of rock weathering however the accompanying decrease of k z is restricted by a certain asymptotic value i e the hydraulic conductivity of the low unweathering zone with respect to hard rock formations the model of the power law function approximating the aquifer permeability profile was investigated in a more detailed manner the flow paths in unconfined watershed aquifers exhibit changes in the hydraulic conductivity due to lithological stratification or weathering effects which are usually far more complex than those in uniform confined aquifers in stratified aquifers characterized by a sharp contrast in the hydraulic conductivity of layers ki the curvature of the phreatic surface the change in saturated aquifer thickness affects the deformation of flow lines near the outflow boundary in the case of nonpoint source this is a factor smoothing the contrast in solute concentrations between the upper and lower parts of the aquifer in aquifers characterized by decay functions k z as expected flow path density increases near the water table thereby increasing the protection of groundwater in the lower part of the aquifer against contamination from nonpoint sources the exponential approximation of the ttd functions f œÑ and f œÑ given by eqs 5 5 originally derived to represent the residence time distribution for a watershed aquifer with constant ratio œÜ m r haitjema 1995b luther and haitjema 1998 leray et al 2016 may be not very accurate for the unconfined aquifers discussed above the conductivity in which varies vertically i e the traditionally used time scale characteristic i e mean transit time may not be sufficient to describe the solute transport and exchange of a recharge water with bulk groundwater under unconfined flow conditions from the presented example of a flow in a rock exhibiting a power law regression of the hydraulic conductivity on depth it follows that the effect of the exponent of power on function f œÑ is insignificant while the other characteristic of the transit time f œÑ is quite sensitive to this coefficient the sensitivity of the residence time to hydraulic conductivity variations in unconfined stratified systems was earlier investigated by luther and haitjema 1998 who showed that the exponential model of ttd works well in most cases of flow under the conditions of low head gradient and where the spatial variations in the hydraulic conductivity of porous material are relatively small this was confirmed later using modeling technique for both synthesized and realistic aquifer representations basu et al 2012 farlin and ma≈Çoszewski 2018 the suggested model allows avoiding the difficulty in estimating a representative saturated thickness for an unconfined aquifer especially at larger scales which requires ttd related assessments thus the present work can help us to better understand the flow and transport processes in unconfined aquifers and to determine the applicability of the earlier

3967,the use of green roofs grs for domestic wastewater treatment and nitrogen n removal is an appealing opportunity to conjugate hydrological energetic and water quality benefits however the research in this direction has been limited to few experimental studies while the role of numerical modeling for analysis and design has been overlooked to advance understating of reactive transport processes in grs and investigate the use of numerical models this study presents a comprehensive experimental and numerical investigation of the n turnover in vegetated and non vegetated grs exposed to domestic wastewater injection a bayesian framework is used to calibrate a mechanistic numerical model against multiple observations from a controlled laboratory experiment a global sensitivity analysis complements the framework to further enlighten the role of multiple physical processes results indicate that grs have high nitrification capacity which increases after wastewater application the total leached n is 94 of the total injected n in a non vegetated gr compared to 67 for a vegetated gr nitrate leaching is negatively correlated with the root solute uptake capacity of the vegetation which may reach up to 32 of the total injected n maximization of this factor is desirable and can be achieved by selecting appropriate plant species and reducing water stress periods using a proper irrigation schedule 1 introduction in a world with a growing population with increasing demand for food and water current and future generations face multiple social economic and environmental challenges according to the united nations 2018 the urban population is projected to increase by 2 5 billion between 2018 and 2050 reaching approximately 68 of the total world population if not managed properly this growth would increase the environmental footprint of urban areas by aggravating the already existing hydrological energetic and water quality issues as reported by the european

microbial degradation and plant s uptake and detoxification processes despite many potential benefits research on this topic has been limited vo et al 2019 only a few studies have investigated the performance of grs for wastewater treatment usually with promising outcomes for example results reported in zapater pereyra et al 2016 zapater pereyra et al 2013 indicated high ammonium total nitrogen and total phosphorous removal efficiencies of a 9 cm deep gr mainly due to its high aeration capacity similar findings were obtained by van et al 2014 song et al 2013 and thanh et al 2014 furthermore there is a lack of studies dealing with the development and testing of numerical models for such systems analysis and designs advancement in the understanding of the physicochemical processes in grs would clarify their potential benefits and allow for the development of numerical models for design and analysis therefore the main objectives of this study are to experimentally quantify the nitrogen removal efficiency of grs treated with wastewater and numerically describe and investigate the factors driving the nitrogen reactive transport in grs to this aim an experimental campaign involving the application of wastewater on both vegetated and non vegetated grs under controlled laboratory conditions was carried out to characterize water flow and reactive nitrogen transport in the grs the experiment was complemented with tracer applications subsurface outflow and soil moisture monitoring and nitrogen concentration measurements observations were combined with a bayesian inference framework to calibrate the hydrological model hydrus ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2016 and inversely estimate soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters finally the calibrated model is coupled with a global sensitivity analysis to enlighten the role of different physical processes on nitrogen turnover and nutrients leaching from the gr 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study description 2 1 1 experimental setup the experimental setup fig 1 included three 15 cm deep grs testbeds assembled in plastic boxes 56 37 cm and equipped with an irrigation system consisting of multiple drippers one box served as the control and its hydraulic behavior was already investigated in brunetti et al 2020a the boxes were placed on a wooden frame to insulate the bottom and minimize heat transfer from the surrounding environment a slope of 1 was set to convey subsurface outflow to a circular hole and then to a plastic pipe for measurement and sampling the grs morphology and the irrigation system were identical in all boxes a 12 cm deep granular substrate consisting of a mixture of volcanic minerals with a measured porosity and bulk density of 0 66 and 0 9 g cm3 respectively ph equal to 7 initial nitrogen and organic matter contents of 4 and 8 brunetti et al 2016a respectively was used as a growing medium a highly permeable geotextile separated the soil substrate from the underlining 3 cm deep drainage layer composed of coarse gravel two testbeds were vegetated and one was left with a bare soil surface different designs were meant to highlight the role of vegetation on the coupled water solute transport two plant species frequently used for extensive green roofs were installed brunetti et al 2016a lobularia maritima and dianthus gratianapolitanus both plants were transplanted after a two week equilibration period during which only water was applied on the testbeds using peristaltic pumps testbeds were equipped with two thermocouples to measure soil temperature at two different depths and a coaxial impedance dielectric reflectometer stevens hydraprobe at z 6 cm to measure soil moisture and characterize the hydraulic behavior of the substrate a substrate specific calibration curve was developed in the laboratory to link the measured soil permittivity to the actual volumetric water content kargas et al 2013 seyfried et al 2005 an evaporation pan and a tipping bucket to measure the evaporation demand and the subsurface outflow respectively completed the monitoring system connected to an external data logger the acquisition frequency was set to 1 min the assembled testbeds were placed into a climate chamber where spring summer mediterranean climatic conditions were simulated in particular air temperatures relative humidity and day night alternations were set to replicate measured data from a weather station in southern italy fig 2 no radiation intensity control was available in the chamber therefore only day night alternation was simulated the experiment lasted 41 days and encompassed the monitoring of water contents subsurface outflow and the tracer application nitrogen compounds in subsurface outflow were analyzed to characterize water flow and nitrogen turnover in the grs two testbeds were irrigated with a 1 2 primary wastewater effluent 1 part pure water 1 part wastewater while pure water was applied to the control box the effluent was characterized by negligible amounts of organic nitrogen and nitrates and an average ammonium concentration of 25 mg l which is in line with other studies e g do et al 2019 tao et al 2014 2 1 2 transient water flow and tracer experiments the irrigation schedule was designed to 1 simulate the real operating conditions of grs for domestic wastewater treatment 2 induce an alternation of wet and dry soil conditions and 3 minimize the plant water stress in particular each box was irrigated four times per week for one hour during which 3 l of applied solution were distributed on the soil surface the amount of applied water was doubled during the tracer experiments to speed up the tracer s recovery as shown in brunetti et al 2018 such an irrigation pattern can significantly enhance the evaporative cooling efficiency of grs measured volumetric water contents and subsurface outflow were used to assess the gr s hydrological behavior particularly its retention capacity and unsaturated conditions in the growing medium the two tracer experiments were conducted to characterize water flow and solute transport at the beginning and the end of the experimental campaign breakthrough concentration curves were reconstructed for each tracer application by measuring solute concentrations in the outflow over time the first tracer experiment was conducted on june 24th 2019 a known amount of deuterated water 1 ml 90atom deuterated water and salt 30 g nacl was applied to all testbeds together with a mix of wastewater and pure water in a 1 1 proportion 6 l the same irrigation pattern 6 l per day was applied in the following days until the outflow salt concentration reached the background concentration the first tracer experiment lasted 4 irrigation cycles 4 days and 24 l in each box the second tracer experiment also lasting 4 irrigation cycles days was conducted using the same procedure 5 weeks later on july 29th 2019 the outflow collection in both experiments was done using 50 ml plastic vials at equal intervals 15 min until the outflow was negligible the salt concentration was measured using an electrical conductivity ec probe afterward an initial salt concentration curve was constructed for each box fifty subsamples for each box were taken for the isotopic analysis of deuterated water samples were analyzed with laser spectrometry l 2140 i picarro inc santa clara ca usa to diminish the memory effect and attain more precise measurements the analysis was set to 11 subsequent applications while the last three were averaged during the post processing analysis to get the mean sample concentration results given in delta notation were converted into concentrations 2 1 3 characterization of the reactive nitrogen transport inorganic nitrogen compounds ammonium nitrite nitrate were monitored weekly in the three boxes outflow to ensure the data reliability sampling was done randomly relative to the irrigation cycles two times per week with 2 to 3 daily samples the sampling and laboratory analysis were done in replicates to minimize errors and avoid outliers plastic vials with 50 ml volume used for sampling were stored in the fridge for a maximum of 3 days due to the unstable nature of nitrogen species uv vis spectrophotometry was used to measure inorganic nitrogen species all samples were filtered through 0 1 Œºm savana lab disc membrane filters and stored for up to 2 days at 4 c without acid preservation to reduce the potential interference of the dissolved organic matter ammonium and nitrite were measured colorimetrically the determination of ammonium is based on the reaction with phenol and hypochlorite to give an indophenol blue in an alkaline medium berthelot reaction after the sample preparation a 30 min reaction time is necessary before measuring the absorbance at 667 nm the nitrite determination is based on the nitrite s reaction in the acid solution of a primary amine sulphanilamide to form diazonium salt which is coupled to an aromatic amine to produce the red azo dye whose absorbance can be measured at 540 nm the second derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometric method was used to measure nitrate in the outflow ferree and shannon 2001 all samples and standards were treated in the same way 5 ml of sample or standard was transferred into a glass vial and mixed thoroughly with 1 ml of sulfuric acid h2so4 to reduce the ph subsequently each sample s absorbance or standard was measured in the range of 200 and 230 nm in the spectrophotometer and the maximum second derivative was calculated the calibration curve was fitted to the maximum second derivative of the standard samples and used to calculate outflow nitrate concentrations 2 2 modeling theory 2 2 1 water flow and reactive solute transport considering the small dimensions of the testbed fig 1 the transport processes are assumed one dimensional and strictly vertical variably saturated water flow is simulated by solving the richards equation brunetti et al 2020a compared multiple hydraulic parameterizations of the growing medium and demonstrated that the unimodal van genuchten mualem vgm model van genuchten 1980 parameters Œ∏r l3l 3 Œ∏s l3l 3 Œ± l 1 n ks lt 1 l guarantees the appropriate level of model complexity for the numerical analysis of grs therefore this parameterization is used in the present study root water uptake is simulated using the approach of feddes et al 1978 first the measured potential evapotranspiration demand in the chamber is partitioned into potential evaporation and transpiration fluxes using the leaf area index lai sutanto et al 2012 lai is not constant but varies over time due to plant growth which is assumed to be logistic the calculated potential transpiration flux is then converted into actual root water uptake by combining the piecewise linear water stress response model proposed by feddes feddes et al 1978 parameters p0 l popt l p2h l p2l l p3 l and a root density function that accounts for the root density and growth a thorough description of the evapotranspiration partitioning and root water uptake is provided in brunetti et al 2019 the reactive transport of nitrogen in the gr is modeled as a sequential reaction chain in which organic nitrogen norg is first converted into ammonium nh4 and then directly oxidized to nitrate no3 the intermediate conversion from ammonium to nitrite and from nitrite to nitrate is assumed to be instantaneous and thus neglected in the model first ¬µ and zero order Œ≥ coefficients describe nitrogen turnover and potential production of organic nitrogen by the degradation of plant residues respectively the effect of denitrification has been neglected due to the strongly unsaturated conditions in the substrate during the experiment the transport of the kth solute species is described using the advection dispersion reaction equation assuming that solutes can exist only in the solid and liquid phases linear adsorption to the solid phase is considered for norg and nh4 g√§rden√§s et al 2005 li et al 2015 mariano et al 2016 while 2h and no3 exist only in the liquid phase and cannot react to form other compounds unlimited passive uptake of nh4 and no3 in the liquid phase is considered li et al 2015 the effect of molecular diffusion is neglected 2 2 2 numerical domain and boundary conditions the finite element model hydrus 1d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2016 is used to solve the richards and advection dispersion reaction equations hydrus has been used successfully to simulate the hydrological performance of multiple low impact development techniques e g brunetti et al 2016b hilten et al 2008 palla et al 2009 as in brunetti et al 2020a the main modeling assumptions are that the hydraulic effect of the drainage layer is negligible and that water flow and solute transport are strictly vertical the vertical domain is discretized in 100 one dimensional elements which are refined near the soil surface an atmospheric boundary condition is specified on the top boundary while a seepage face is used for the bottom boundary a spin up period of 40 days is used to relax the initial conditions the initial soil nitrogen content is set to 4 1 according to laboratory measurements the plant growth is assumed logistic and characterized by a growth rate of 0 15 1 day brunetti et al 2020a the initial and final lais are set to 1 0 and 3 0 respectively the simulated root depth varies between an initial measured root depth of 4 cm and a final measured value of 12 cm 2 3 model calibration and uncertainty assessment 2 3 1 inverse modeling scenarios the calibration framework encompasses three modeling scenarios focused on the inverse estimation of soil hydraulic and reactive transport parameters of the three testbeds control cr non vegetated nv and vegetated vg fig 1 measured volumetric water contents subsurface outflow tracer breakthrough curve from the first experiment fig 2 and outflow nitrate concentrations are used for model calibration outflow ammonium concentrations were negligible therefore they were not included in the analysis the soil hydraulic parameters Œ∏s Œ± n ks l and the solute dispersivity Œª of the control box were already estimated in brunetti et al 2020a with limited uncertainty thus in the present study and this scenario these parameters are set to their median value and the analysis is restricted to the estimation of reactive parameters both the root growth and solute and water uptake are neglected in the nv scenario with potential evapotranspiration converted into potential evaporation and actual evaporation depending on the surface moisture availability the production of nitrogen from plants tissue degradation is considered only for scenarios cr and vg 2 3 2 multinest algorithm a bayesian framework is used to calibrate the model and assess its predictive uncertainty in particular the nested sampling estimator multinest feroz et al 2009 is combined with experimental observations to inversely estimate the posterior distributions of soil hydraulic and reactive transport parameters for the three scenarios previously described for a thorough description of the multinest algorithm please refer to feroz et al 2009 and brunetti et al 2020b the main advantage of nested sampling algorithms is their computational efficiency and the possibility to simultaneously calculate the parameters posterior distribution and the marginal likelihood which provide a valuable statistical basis for model selection based on a preliminary sensitivity analysis of the algorithm s stability the number of live points in the multinest was set to 100 and the maximum number of algorithm iterations was set to 200 000 this threshold value was never reached during the analysis which was performed three times for each modeling scenario to assess the results accuracy the stopping criterion is then based on the ratio between the estimated total evidence zest and the current evidence zi 1 log z i z est log z est 0 1 2 3 3 likelihood function and prior distributions error residuals were assumed to be uncorrelated and normally distributed with a constant variance œÉ 2 thus leading to the following log likelihood function ‚Ñì œâ 2 ‚Ñì œâ k 2 ln 2 œÄ k 2 ln œÉ 2 1 2 œÉ 2 i 1 k h i œâ y i 2 where k is the number of measurements and h i œâ and ·ªπi are the ith model realization and its corresponding measured value respectively in the bayesian analysis the log likelihood function to be maximized is the aggregated sum of single 3 ‚Ñì œâ ‚Ñì vwc œâ ‚Ñì out œâ ‚Ñì 2 h œâ ‚Ñì n o 3 œâ where ‚Ñìvwc œâ is the log likelihood of volumetric water content ‚Ñìout œâ is the log likelihood of subsurface outflow ‚Ñì2h œâ is the log likelihood of outflow deuterium concentration and ‚Ñìno3 œâ is the log likelihood of outflow nitrate concentration a very low ‚Ñì œâ is attributed to both non convergent model runs and simulations affected by high mass balance errors the standard deviation in eq 2 is inferred by the bayesian framework for each measurement type uniform prior distributions are used in the bayesian analysis parameter bounds are provided in table 1 and are set based on preliminary analyses and a careful literature review brunetti et al 2020a brunetti et al 2020b brunetti et al 2016a hanson et al 2006 hill et al 2019 sandoval et al 2017 the residual water content Œ∏r is set to 0 0 which is a realistic approximation for coarse textured soils a high value of the partition coefficient is used for the organic nitrogen to simulate its strong sorption to the solid phase brunetti et al 2020b which hinders its transport and occurrence in the liquid phase thus only the norg sorbed fraction can react to form nh4 the upper boundary for the saturated water content is set to be lower than the measured porosity to account for the effect of air entrapment snehota et al 2015 finally posterior predictive checks are used to look for systematic discrepancies between real and simulated data gelman et al 2004 despite the questionable criticism of using the data twice we want to emphasize that the posterior predictive checks are a fundamental tool for the analyst to assess the model adequacy gelman et al 2004 kruschke 2013 2 3 4 nitrate leaching from green roofs global sensitivity analysis after the model calibration and the uncertainty assessment a global sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most important factors driving the leaching of nitrates from the gr which is directly linked to the system s environmental impact to include the vegetation s effect scenario vg is used as the basis for the numerical analysis this choice is intended to provide a statistical basis to enlighten the relative importance of different physicochemical processes on the production and transport of nitrates in the gr the random balance designs fourier amplitude sensitivity test rbd fast tarantola et al 2006 tissot and prieur 2012 is coupled with hydrus the method combines the accuracy of the classic fourier amplitude sensitivity test saltelli et al 1999 with the computational efficiency of satterthwaite s random balance designs satterthwaite 1959 to estimate the first order effect s1 in a variance based context saltelli et al 2006 higher s1 values are attributed to more influential parameters the main advantage of the rbd fast method is that the total number of model runs is reduced down to n instead of d n like in sobol or fast methods where d is the number of factors investigated in the present study a convergence analysis is used to determine n non convergent runs are excluded a posteriori from the computation of the sensitivity indices parameter bounds are the same as used for the bayesian analysis and reported in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and uncertainty assessment 3 1 1 water flow and solute transport results of the model calibration are shown in fig 3 which compares the observations and the posterior predictive checks grey lines of simulated subsurface outflow a and d in fig 3 tracer breakthrough curves b and e in fig 3 and volumetric water contents c and f in fig 3 for scenarios nv and vg and outflow nitrate concentrations g h and i in fig 3 for all scenarios model predictions are obtained by random sampling of 100 solutions from the posterior parameters distributions whose quantiles are listed in table 1 the fitting quality is satisfactory and the predictive uncertainty is limited for both scenarios although the model overestimates measured subsurface outflow from the non vegetated testbed this deviation accumulates at the beginning of the numerical simulation still it doesn t grow significantly over time suggesting a potential overestimation of the inflow during the tracer application at the beginning of the experimental campaign conversely the quality of the fitting of the volumetric water content slightly degrades over time with the model underestimating the observations inaccuracies in simulated actual evaporation can explain this deviation whose magnitude remains anyway limited simulated actual evapotranspiration is also partially responsible for the minor differences between simulated and observed volumetric water contents in scenario vg mainly encountered after irrigation events nevertheless the fitting quality remains satisfactory suggesting that the calibrated model reproduces the hydraulic behavior of the vegetated gr well the accurate description of subsurface outflow further confirms this in contrast the tracer breakthrough curve is slightly overestimated as reflected in the wider confidence interval for the solute dispersivity table 1 this deviaiton can also result from mass differences when injecting the tracer cocktail or by inhomogeneous distribution of the irrigation water on the soil surface the estimated soil hydraulic parameters are characterized by narrow confidence intervals for both inverse modeling scenarios nv and vg which exhibit similar estimated saturated water contents Œ∏s these values are both considerably lower than that reported by brunetti et al 2020a for the control box significant differences also emerge for the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the tortuosity altogether these deviations can be partially explained by soil heterogeneity air entrapment and nonuniform application of irrigation water on the soil surface the estimated shape parameters Œ± and n indicate a soil characterized by a sharp air entry point and a moderate retention capacity typical of gr substrates brunetti et al 2016a hill et al 2019 sandoval et al 2017 the calibrated feddes parameters reflect the nearly optimal transpiration rates of the gr vegetation under wet soil conditions and agree with previous studies brunetti et al 2016a kuronuma and watanabe 2017 3 1 2 reactive nitrogen transport nitrogen turnover is well predicted in all inverse modeling scenarios the highest predictive uncertainty is encountered for scenario nv h in fig 3 while the scenarios cr g in fig 3 and vg i in fig 3 exhibit both narrow prediction bands this trend was already observed for water flow and solute transport suggesting experimental inaccuracies in the non vegetated testbed nevertheless the description of the nitrogen reactive transport remains sufficiently accurate also for this scenario comparing the estimated parameters posterior distributions holds more interest and clarifies the role of different physical and biological processes first the very low values estimated for Œ≥norg indicate that the release of nitrogen from the decomposition of plant residues was limited during the experiment although this was expected due to the limited duration of the experimental campaign this process cannot be excluded in the long term and under field operating conditions where the seasonality can trigger changes in the plant status interestingly the estimated degradation rate of organic nitrogen ¬µsnorg for the vegetated box is significantly higher than that calculated for the control box this suggests that wastewater application induces optimal conditions for the microbial conversion of norg to nh4 ibekwe et al 2018 the nh4 partition coefficient cannot be inferred for the cr and nv scenarios still its estimated value for the vg scenario indicates strong sorption of this compound to the solid phase compatible with the high organic matter content of the substrate wang and alva 2000 the high to moderate uncertainty of this estimated parameter is mainly a consequence of the lack of information about the ammonium distribution in the soil profile the nh4 degradation rate in the liquid phase ¬µlnh4 exhibits high uncertainty and cannot be inferred from the observations conversely the high value estimated for ¬µsnh4 which together with ¬µsnorg indicates high nitrification processes in the vegetated testbed the comparison between the estimated standard deviations of nitrate measurements œÉno3 confirms experimental inaccuracies for the non vegetated testbed and might cause the high parameter uncertainty for this scenario table 2 reports the cumulative n fluxes in the grs for different scenarios calculated by averaging the results of 100 numerical simulations obtained by random sampling from the posterior parameters distributions the results indicate that the n leaching potential is significantly higher in the non vegetated testbed where it reaches 94 of the total injected n compared to the 67 estimated for the vegetated box in the latter scenario the roots take up 32 of the injected n while n input from decomposition plays a minor role conversely this process is more important for the control scenario where 63 and 30 of the generated n are leached and taken up by roots respectively these percentages are similar to those obtained for the vegetated scenario and suggest that root solute uptake can mitigate n leaching from grs 3 1 3 key processes in nitrogen turnover the comparison between no3 outflow concentrations and the model calibration results raises interesting discussion points on the role of different processes on the nitrogen reactive transport the control box irrigated with tap water is a source of nitrates the average no3 outflow concentration is 3 6 0 94 mg l which is above the reported threshold concentration of 2 6 mg l that accelerates eutrophication in water bodies bartley and johnson 2006 this behavior was already observed by vijayaraghavan et al 2012 who carried out an extensive experimental campaign on the assessment of grs water quality the authors reported similar concentration values when grs were irrigated solely with tap water and concluded that the nitrate release is mainly due to the degradation of the soil substrate s organic compounds this agrees with the results of the present study that shows a decreasing trend in nitrate concentrations g in fig 3 caused by the consumption of the initial soil organic nitrogen which is not replenished by the degradation of plant residuals low Œ≥norg in table 1 this behavior was also observed by monterusso et al 2004 and suggested the need to periodically fertilize traditional grs to restore nutrient levels and support plants growth using a numerical model can help optimize fertilization to avoid excess nutrients leaching berndtsson et al 2006 finally the narrow estimated uncertainty for ¬µsnorg confirms that organic nitrogen turnover is the dominant process in the release of nitrates from the control box the non vegetated gr releases the highest amount of nitrates suggesting an important role of root solute uptake for the nitrogen removal from grs irrigated with domestic wastewater this uptake is favored by moderately wet conditions of the soil substrate during the experiment f in fig 3 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 reported similar differences between vegetated and non vegetated extensive grs similarly berndtsson et al 2006 highlighted the role of vegetation on nitrogen retention in extensive grs no3 leaching from the non vegetated testbed exhibits a decreasing trend g in fig 3 which is again compatible with gradual degradation of the initially present soil organic nitrogen this trend is not observed for the vegetated box and can be partially explained by plant uptake which hampers the initial accumulation of nitrates afterward the applied wastewater replenishes the soil nitrogen and induces optimal nitrification conditions high ¬µsnh4 in table 1 thus maintaining an approximately constant outflow concentration 3 2 global sensitivity analysis the previous discussion on the experimental data and model calibration outcomes identified root solute uptake and soil organic compounds degradation as important processes in nitrogen turnover in the grs to further confirm or disprove these findings a global sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the factors driving nitrate leaching from the vegetated grs the convergence analysis indicated that 3000 model executions were sufficient to obtain stable estimations of the first order sensitivity indices reported in the last column of table 1 for all investigated parameters seven factors out of 15 exhibit an appreciable influence s1 0 1 on nitrate leaching but only five are characterized by s1 1 Œ≥norg popt ¬µsnh4 ¬µsnorg and p0 in order of importance the soil hydraulic and solute non reactive transport parameters have negligible influence in the investigated range table 1 this may be partially due to the limited depth i e 12 cm of the soil substrate which masks the effect of transport processes and the controlled laboratory conditions which reduce heterogeneity similar reasoning can be applied to the ammonium distribution coefficient whose retardation effect on the nitrate transport cannot be fully appreciated in a shallow soil profile as expected the first order degradation coefficients ¬µsnh4 and ¬µsnorg have an appreciable impact on nitrate leaching however their effect is topped by Œ≥norg and popt which are the two most influential factors these results confirm that root solute uptake and soil organic matter degradation are important processes in the gr nitrogen balance to further clarify their functioning a local sensitivity analysis is performed using the median solution in table 1 as a reference and changing alternatively only Œ≥norg and popt fig 4 shows the resulting cumulative root no3 uptake and bottom flux as a function of Œ≥norg a and c in fig 4 and popt b and d in fig 4 the comparison confirms the bigger influence of Œ≥norg high production of organic nitrogen is positively correlated with an increase in the soil s nitrate level which cannot be completely offset by an increase in root solute uptake the latter depends on the plant uptake capacity which is regulated by the transpiration demand the vegetation s characteristics and the soil volumetric water content in the root zone brunetti et al 2021 for instance very wet conditions can induce waterlogging effects and drastically reduce root water and solute uptake the feddes parameter popt is a threshold pressure head value above which actual transpiration drops due to anaerobic conditions the analysis shows that when popt is reduced c in fig 4 nitrate uptake declines due to the wet conditions observed during the experiment f in fig 3 as a consequence nitrate leaching is higher than in other modeling scenarios to summarize the main findings of the global sensitivity analysis are organic nitrogen production due to exogenous variables further increases nutrient leaching from the gr reducing its environmental benefits therefore installing plants characterized by a minimal potential of tissue decomposition and high resistance and designing an irrigation system to avoid extended periods of water stress is preferable at the same time fertilization or soil amendments should be carefully evaluated and potentially excluded when domestic wastewater is applied when this is not possible for various reasons the fertilizer application should be properly designed to minimize nutrients leaching clark and zheng 2014 by taking into account the in situ conditions of the gr the present study demonstrates that numerical models are a valuable and recommended tool for this task root solute uptake enhances the nitrogen removal efficiency from domestic wastewater thus the system should be designed to maximize transpiration by reducing water stress both due to waterlogging or dry conditions and supporting plants health again we advocate using a numerical model which can provide a comprehensive overview of physical processes in the gr 4 strengths and limitations we consider this study to be innovative in mainly two aspects the numerical analysis of nitrogen turnover in grs irrigated with domestic wastewater is a novel application in this research field the joint use of bayesian inference techniques and sensitivity analyses provides a statistical basis for uncertainty assessment and ranking of the effects of multiple physical processes on nutrients leaching from the grs respectively the model calibration is performed on a comprehensive dataset from a controlled laboratory experiment on multiple testbeds which included not only nitrogen observations but also measurements of volumetric water contents subsurface outflow tracer experiments and atmospheric variables in a climate chamber this allows to narrow down uncertainties and better understand the physical functioning of the system still the study also possesses some limitations and open questions to be solved in the future first the experimental campaign s duration was too limited to observe long term processes such as the alteration of the soil hydraulic properties due to biofilm formation or wastewater toxicity effects on the vegetation which would change both the hydraulic regime and the root uptake capacity second it was impossible to precisely infer certain model parameters e g ammonium partition coefficient due to both operating conditions and experimental inaccuracies and limitations additional measurements of ammonium concentrations in the soil profile could potentially mitigate this problem finally the grs morphology simulated atmospheric conditions and irrigation pattern are not representative of a broad class of field scale operating conditions and more tests under variable atmospheric conditions can give more insights into the physical chemical and biological dynamics of grs such as denitrification processes which might occur during the long duration and low intensity rainfall events qiu et al 2020 or due to water soluble organic carbon from plant residues during initial decomposition surey et al 2020 furthermore precipitation can affect the nitrogen turnover by increasing the nitrate leaching potential and soil water content which influences the microbial degradation processes e g maenhout et al 2018 however we want to emphasize that observations information content was sufficient to estimate multiple parameters with limited uncertainty table 1 5 conclusions this study aimed to expand the current knowledge on the potential use of green roofs for domestic wastewater treatment with particular emphasis on the nitrogen reactive transport and nitrate leaching a bayesian framework was used to calibrate a mechanistic numerical model against multiple observations from a controlled laboratory experiment this analysis was complemented by a global sensitivity analysis to further enlighten the role of multiple physical processes results indicate that grs quickly nitrify wastewater ammonium and resulting nitrate leaching is negatively correlated with the vegetation s root solute uptake capacity maximization of this effect is desirable and could be achieved by selecting appropriate plant species and reducing water stress periods with a proper irrigation schedule this would simultaneously support vegetation s health and limit the decay and decomposition of plants tissues which the analysis showed can potentially influence the nitrogen balance in the grs numerical models are certainly a valuable tool for these tasks and to understand and design grs for wastewater treatment based on these results we recommend extending the experimental campaign in future studies to observe the long term behavior of the system under different operating conditions we further recommend investigating the potential use of grs for the decentralized removal of other compounds such as pharmaceuticals which show significant persistence and occurrence in the environment

3967,the use of green roofs grs for domestic wastewater treatment and nitrogen n removal is an appealing opportunity to conjugate hydrological energetic and water quality benefits however the research in this direction has been limited to few experimental studies while the role of numerical modeling for analysis and design has been overlooked to advance understating of reactive transport processes in grs and investigate the use of numerical models this study presents a comprehensive experimental and numerical investigation of the n turnover in vegetated and non vegetated grs exposed to domestic wastewater injection a bayesian framework is used to calibrate a mechanistic numerical model against multiple observations from a controlled laboratory experiment a global sensitivity analysis complements the framework to further enlighten the role of multiple physical processes results indicate that grs have high nitrification capacity which increases after wastewater application the total leached n is 94 of the total injected n in a non vegetated gr compared to 67 for a vegetated gr nitrate leaching is negatively correlated with the root solute uptake capacity of the vegetation which may reach up to 32 of the total injected n maximization of this factor is desirable and can be achieved by selecting appropriate plant species and reducing water stress periods using a proper irrigation schedule 1 introduction in a world with a growing population with increasing demand for food and water current and future generations face multiple social economic and environmental challenges according to the united nations 2018 the urban population is projected to increase by 2 5 billion between 2018 and 2050 reaching approximately 68 of the total world population if not managed properly this growth would increase the environmental footprint of urban areas by aggravating the already existing hydrological energetic and water quality issues as reported by the european environmental agency eea between 20 and 25 of rivers and coastal water bodies are subject to point source pollution from industrial facilities sewage systems and wastewater treatment plants wwtps eea 2018 excess nitrogen input into ecosystems has an extensive detrimental effect on the environment and human health hill 2010 holmes et al 2019 world health organization 2011 yamashita yamamoto ikemoto

to completely remove nitrogen species from wastewater prior to their disposal into water bodies holmes et al 2019 johnston et al 2019 although alternative technologies are highly efficient e g membrane technologies they are usually expensive and energy intensive thus hindering their widespread adoption matassa et al 2015 mehta et al 2015 consequently urban rivers have become pools of reactive nitrogen and hotspots of regional pollution zhang et al 2015 green infrastructure represents a potential alternative solution to manage excess nitrogen at the local scale through wastewater recycling and treatment yu et al 2019 the combination of physical chemical and biological processes occurring in such infrastructure systems such as soil water retention sorption phytoremediation and

that rooftops may represent up to 50 of impervious surfaces in urban areas and that domestic wastewater is an important source of nitrogen pollution the use of green roofs grs for wastewater treatment

microbial degradation and plant s uptake and detoxification processes despite many potential benefits research on this topic has been limited vo et al 2019 only a few studies have investigated the performance of grs for wastewater treatment usually with promising outcomes for example results reported in zapater pereyra et al 2016 zapater pereyra et al 2013 indicated high ammonium total nitrogen and total phosphorous removal efficiencies of a 9 cm deep gr mainly due to its high aeration capacity similar findings were obtained by van et al 2014 song et al 2013 and thanh et al 2014 furthermore there is a lack of studies dealing with the development and testing of numerical models for such systems analysis and designs advancement in the understanding of the physicochemical processes in grs would clarify their potential benefits and allow for the development of numerical models for design and analysis therefore the main objectives of this study are to experimentally quantify the nitrogen removal efficiency of grs treated with wastewater and numerically describe and investigate the factors driving the nitrogen reactive transport in grs to this aim an experimental campaign involving the application of wastewater on both vegetated and non vegetated grs under controlled laboratory conditions was carried out to characterize water flow and reactive nitrogen transport in the grs the experiment was complemented with tracer applications subsurface outflow and soil moisture monitoring and nitrogen concentration measurements observations were combined with a bayesian inference framework to calibrate the hydrological model hydrus ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2016 and inversely estimate soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters finally the calibrated model is coupled with a global sensitivity analysis to enlighten the role of different physical processes on nitrogen turnover and nutrients leaching from the gr 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study description 2 1 1 experimental setup the experimental setup fig 1 included three 15 cm deep grs testbeds assembled in plastic boxes 56 37 cm and equipped with an irrigation system consisting of multiple drippers one box served as the control and its hydraulic behavior was already investigated in brunetti et al 2020a the boxes were placed on a wooden frame to insulate the bottom and minimize heat transfer from the surrounding environment a slope of 1 was set to convey subsurface outflow to a circular hole and then to a plastic pipe for measurement and sampling the grs morphology and the irrigation system were identical in all boxes a 12 cm deep granular substrate consisting of a mixture of volcanic minerals with a measured porosity and bulk density of 0 66 and 0 9 g cm3 respectively ph equal to 7 initial nitrogen and organic matter contents of 4 and 8 brunetti et al 2016a respectively was used as a growing medium a highly permeable geotextile separated the soil substrate from the underlining 3 cm deep drainage layer composed of coarse gravel two testbeds were vegetated and one was left with a bare soil surface different designs were meant to highlight the role of vegetation on the coupled water solute transport two plant species frequently used for extensive green roofs were installed brunetti et al 2016a lobularia maritima and dianthus gratianapolitanus both plants were transplanted after a two week equilibration period during which only water was applied on the testbeds using peristaltic pumps testbeds were equipped with two thermocouples to measure soil temperature at two different depths and a coaxial impedance dielectric reflectometer stevens hydraprobe at z 6 cm to measure soil moisture and characterize the hydraulic behavior of the substrate a substrate specific calibration curve was developed in the laboratory to link the measured soil permittivity to the actual volumetric water content kargas et al 2013 seyfried et al 2005 an evaporation pan and a tipping bucket to measure the evaporation demand and the subsurface outflow respectively completed the monitoring system connected to an external data logger the acquisition frequency was set to 1 min the assembled testbeds were placed into a climate chamber where spring summer mediterranean climatic conditions were simulated in particular air temperatures relative humidity and day night alternations were set to replicate measured data from a weather station in southern italy fig 2 no radiation intensity control was available in the chamber therefore only day night alternation was simulated the experiment lasted 41 days and encompassed the monitoring of water contents subsurface outflow and the tracer application nitrogen compounds in subsurface outflow were analyzed to characterize water flow and nitrogen turnover in the grs two testbeds were irrigated with a 1 2 primary wastewater effluent 1 part pure water 1 part wastewater while pure water was applied to the control box the effluent was characterized by negligible amounts of organic nitrogen and nitrates and an average ammonium concentration of 25 mg l which is in line with other studies e g do et al 2019 tao et al 2014 2 1 2 transient water flow and tracer experiments the irrigation schedule was designed to 1 simulate the real operating conditions of grs for domestic wastewater treatment 2 induce an alternation of wet and dry soil conditions and 3 minimize the plant water stress in particular each box was irrigated four times per week for one hour during which 3 l of applied solution were distributed on the soil surface the amount of applied water was doubled during the tracer experiments to speed up the tracer s recovery as shown in brunetti et al 2018 such an irrigation pattern can significantly enhance the evaporative cooling efficiency of grs measured volumetric water contents and subsurface outflow were used to assess the gr s hydrological behavior particularly its retention capacity and unsaturated conditions in the growing medium the two tracer experiments were conducted to characterize water flow and solute transport at the beginning and the end of the experimental campaign breakthrough concentration curves were reconstructed for each tracer application by measuring solute concentrations in the outflow over time the first tracer experiment was conducted on june 24th 2019 a known amount of deuterated water 1 ml 90atom deuterated water and salt 30 g nacl was applied to all testbeds together with a mix of wastewater and pure water in a 1 1 proportion 6 l the same irrigation pattern 6 l per day was applied in the following days until the outflow salt concentration reached the background concentration the first tracer experiment lasted 4 irrigation cycles 4 days and 24 l in each box the second tracer experiment also lasting 4 irrigation cycles days was conducted using the same procedure 5 weeks later on july 29th 2019 the outflow collection in both experiments was done using 50 ml plastic vials at equal intervals 15 min until the outflow was negligible the salt concentration was measured using an electrical conductivity ec probe afterward an initial salt concentration curve was constructed for each box fifty subsamples for each box were taken for the isotopic analysis of deuterated water samples were analyzed with laser spectrometry l 2140 i picarro inc santa clara ca usa to diminish the memory effect and attain more precise measurements the analysis was set to 11 subsequent applications while the last three were averaged during the post processing analysis to get the mean sample concentration results given in delta notation were converted into concentrations 2 1 3 characterization of the reactive nitrogen transport inorganic nitrogen compounds ammonium nitrite nitrate were monitored weekly in the three boxes outflow to ensure the data reliability sampling was done randomly relative to the irrigation cycles two times per week with 2 to 3 daily samples the sampling and laboratory analysis were done in replicates to minimize errors and avoid outliers plastic vials with 50 ml volume used for sampling were stored in the fridge for a maximum of 3 days due to the unstable nature of nitrogen species uv vis spectrophotometry was used to measure inorganic nitrogen species all samples were filtered through 0 1 Œºm savana lab disc membrane filters and stored for up to 2 days at 4 c without acid preservation to reduce the potential interference of the dissolved organic matter ammonium and nitrite were measured colorimetrically the determination of ammonium is based on the reaction with phenol and hypochlorite to give an indophenol blue in an alkaline medium berthelot reaction after the sample preparation a 30 min reaction time is necessary before measuring the absorbance at 667 nm the nitrite determination is based on the nitrite s reaction in the acid solution of a primary amine sulphanilamide to form diazonium salt which is coupled to an aromatic amine to produce the red azo dye whose absorbance can be measured at 540 nm the second derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometric method was used to measure nitrate in the outflow ferree and shannon 2001 all samples and standards were treated in the same way 5 ml of sample or standard was transferred into a glass vial and mixed thoroughly with 1 ml of sulfuric acid h2so4 to reduce the ph subsequently each sample s absorbance or standard was measured in the range of 200 and 230 nm in the spectrophotometer and the maximum second derivative was calculated the calibration curve was fitted to the maximum second derivative of the standard samples and used to calculate outflow nitrate concentrations 2 2 modeling theory 2 2 1 water flow and reactive solute transport considering the small dimensions of the testbed fig 1 the transport processes are assumed one dimensional and strictly vertical variably saturated water flow is simulated by solving the richards equation brunetti et al 2020a compared multiple hydraulic parameterizations of the growing medium and demonstrated that the unimodal van genuchten mualem vgm model van genuchten 1980 parameters Œ∏r l3l 3 Œ∏s l3l 3 Œ± l 1 n ks lt 1 l guarantees the appropriate level of model complexity for the numerical analysis of grs therefore this parameterization is used in the present study root water uptake is simulated using the approach of feddes et al 1978 first the measured potential evapotranspiration demand in the chamber is partitioned into potential evaporation and transpiration fluxes using the leaf area index lai sutanto et al 2012 lai is not constant but varies over time due to plant growth which is assumed to be logistic the calculated potential transpiration flux is then converted into actual root water uptake by combining the piecewise linear water stress response model proposed by feddes feddes et al 1978 parameters p0 l popt l p2h l p2l l p3 l and a root density function that accounts for the root density and growth a thorough description of the evapotranspiration partitioning and root water uptake is provided in brunetti et al 2019 the reactive transport of nitrogen in the gr is modeled as a sequential reaction chain in which organic nitrogen norg is first converted into ammonium nh4 and then directly oxidized to nitrate no3 the intermediate conversion from ammonium to nitrite and from nitrite to nitrate is assumed to be instantaneous and thus neglected in the model first ¬µ and zero order Œ≥ coefficients describe nitrogen turnover and potential production of organic nitrogen by the degradation of plant residues respectively the effect of denitrification has been neglected due to the strongly unsaturated conditions in the substrate during the experiment the transport of the kth solute species is described using the advection dispersion reaction equation assuming that solutes can exist only in the solid and liquid phases linear adsorption to the solid phase is considered for norg and nh4 g√§rden√§s et al 2005 li et al 2015 mariano et al 2016 while 2h and no3 exist only in the liquid phase and cannot react to form other compounds unlimited passive uptake of nh4 and no3 in the liquid phase is considered li et al 2015 the effect of molecular diffusion is neglected 2 2 2 numerical domain and boundary conditions the finite element model hydrus 1d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2016 is used to solve the richards and advection dispersion reaction equations hydrus has been used successfully to simulate the hydrological performance of multiple low impact development techniques e g brunetti et al 2016b hilten et al 2008 palla et al 2009 as in brunetti et al 2020a the main modeling assumptions are that the hydraulic effect of the drainage layer is negligible and that water flow and solute transport are strictly vertical the vertical domain is discretized in 100 one dimensional elements which are refined near the soil surface an atmospheric boundary condition is specified on the top boundary while a seepage face is used for the bottom boundary a spin up period of 40 days is used to relax the initial conditions the initial soil nitrogen content is set to 4 1 according to laboratory measurements the plant growth is assumed logistic and characterized by a growth rate of 0 15 1 day brunetti et al 2020a the initial and final lais are set to 1 0 and 3 0 respectively the simulated root depth varies between an initial measured root depth of 4 cm and a final measured value of 12 cm 2 3 model calibration and uncertainty assessment 2 3 1 inverse modeling scenarios the calibration framework encompasses three modeling scenarios focused on the inverse estimation of soil hydraulic and reactive transport parameters of the three testbeds control cr non vegetated nv and vegetated vg fig 1 measured volumetric water contents subsurface outflow tracer breakthrough curve from the first experiment fig 2 and outflow nitrate concentrations are used for model calibration outflow ammonium concentrations were negligible therefore they were not included in the analysis the soil hydraulic parameters Œ∏s Œ± n ks l and the solute dispersivity Œª of the control box were already estimated in brunetti et al 2020a with limited uncertainty thus in the present study and this scenario these parameters are set to their median value and the analysis is restricted to the estimation of reactive parameters both the root growth and solute and water uptake are neglected in the nv scenario with potential evapotranspiration converted into potential evaporation and actual evaporation depending on the surface moisture availability the production of nitrogen from plants tissue degradation is considered only for scenarios cr and vg 2 3 2 multinest algorithm a bayesian framework is used to calibrate the model and assess its predictive uncertainty in particular the nested sampling estimator multinest feroz et al 2009 is combined with experimental observations to inversely estimate the posterior distributions of soil hydraulic and reactive transport parameters for the three scenarios previously described for a thorough description of the multinest algorithm please refer to feroz et al 2009 and brunetti et al 2020b the main advantage of nested sampling algorithms is their computational efficiency and the possibility to simultaneously calculate the parameters posterior distribution and the marginal likelihood which provide a valuable statistical basis for model selection based on a preliminary sensitivity analysis of the algorithm s stability the number of live points in the multinest was set to 100 and the maximum number of algorithm iterations was set to 200 000 this threshold value was never reached during the analysis which was performed three times for each modeling scenario to assess the results accuracy the stopping criterion is then based on the ratio between the estimated total evidence zest and the current evidence zi 1 log z i z est log z est 0 1 2 3 3 likelihood function and prior distributions error residuals were assumed to be uncorrelated and normally distributed with a constant variance œÉ 2 thus leading to the following log likelihood function ‚Ñì œâ 2 ‚Ñì œâ k 2 ln 2 œÄ k 2 ln œÉ 2 1 2 œÉ 2 i 1 k h i œâ y i 2 where k is the number of measurements and h i œâ and ·ªπi are the ith model realization and its corresponding measured value respectively in the bayesian analysis the log likelihood function to be maximized is the aggregated sum of single 3 ‚Ñì œâ ‚Ñì vwc œâ ‚Ñì out œâ ‚Ñì 2 h œâ ‚Ñì n o 3 œâ where ‚Ñìvwc œâ is the log likelihood of volumetric water content ‚Ñìout œâ is the log likelihood of subsurface outflow ‚Ñì2h œâ is the log likelihood of outflow deuterium concentration and ‚Ñìno3 œâ is the log likelihood of outflow nitrate concentration a very low ‚Ñì œâ is attributed to both non convergent model runs and simulations affected by high mass balance errors the standard deviation in eq 2 is inferred by the bayesian framework for each measurement type uniform prior distributions are used in the bayesian analysis parameter bounds are provided in table 1 and are set based on preliminary analyses and a careful literature review brunetti et al 2020a brunetti et al 2020b brunetti et al 2016a hanson et al 2006 hill et al 2019 sandoval et al 2017 the residual water content Œ∏r is set to 0 0 which is a realistic approximation for coarse textured soils a high value of the partition coefficient is used for the organic nitrogen to simulate its strong sorption to the solid phase brunetti et al 2020b which hinders its transport and occurrence in the liquid phase thus only the norg sorbed fraction can react to form nh4 the upper boundary for the saturated water content is set to be lower than the measured porosity to account for the effect of air entrapment snehota et al 2015 finally posterior predictive checks are used to look for systematic discrepancies between real and simulated data gelman et al 2004 despite the questionable criticism of using the data twice we want to emphasize that the posterior predictive checks are a fundamental tool for the analyst to assess the model adequacy gelman et al 2004 kruschke 2013 2 3 4 nitrate leaching from green roofs global sensitivity analysis after the model calibration and the uncertainty assessment a global sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most important factors driving the leaching of nitrates from the gr which is directly linked to the system s environmental impact to include the vegetation s effect scenario vg is used as the basis for the numerical analysis this choice is intended to provide a statistical basis to enlighten the relative importance of different physicochemical processes on the production and transport of nitrates in the gr the random balance designs fourier amplitude sensitivity test rbd fast tarantola et al 2006 tissot and prieur 2012 is coupled with hydrus the method combines the accuracy of the classic fourier amplitude sensitivity test saltelli et al 1999 with the computational efficiency of satterthwaite s random balance designs satterthwaite 1959 to estimate the first order effect s1 in a variance based context saltelli et al 2006 higher s1 values are attributed to more influential parameters the main advantage of the rbd fast method is that the total number of model runs is reduced down to n instead of d n like in sobol or fast methods where d is the number of factors investigated in the present study a convergence analysis is used to determine n non convergent runs are excluded a posteriori from the computation of the sensitivity indices parameter bounds are the same as used for the bayesian analysis and reported in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and uncertainty assessment 3 1 1 water flow and solute transport results of the model calibration are shown in fig 3 which compares the observations and the posterior predictive checks grey lines of simulated subsurface outflow a and d in fig 3 tracer breakthrough curves b and e in fig 3 and volumetric water contents c and f in fig 3 for scenarios nv and vg and outflow nitrate concentrations g h and i in fig 3 for all scenarios model predictions are obtained by random sampling of 100 solutions from the posterior parameters distributions whose quantiles are listed in table 1 the fitting quality is satisfactory and the predictive uncertainty is limited for both scenarios although the model overestimates measured subsurface outflow from the non vegetated testbed this deviation accumulates at the beginning of the numerical simulation still it doesn t grow significantly over time suggesting a potential overestimation of the inflow during the tracer application at the beginning of the experimental campaign conversely the quality of the fitting of the volumetric water content slightly degrades over time with the model underestimating the observations inaccuracies in simulated actual evaporation can explain this deviation whose magnitude remains anyway limited simulated actual evapotranspiration is also partially responsible for the minor differences between simulated and observed volumetric water contents in scenario vg mainly encountered after irrigation events nevertheless the fitting quality remains satisfactory suggesting that the calibrated model reproduces the hydraulic behavior of the vegetated gr well the accurate description of subsurface outflow further confirms this in contrast the tracer breakthrough curve is slightly overestimated as reflected in the wider confidence interval for the solute dispersivity table 1 this deviaiton can also result from mass differences when injecting the tracer cocktail or by inhomogeneous distribution of the irrigation water on the soil surface the estimated soil hydraulic parameters are characterized by narrow confidence intervals for both inverse modeling scenarios nv and vg which exhibit similar estimated saturated water contents Œ∏s these values are both considerably lower than that reported by brunetti et al 2020a for the control box significant differences also emerge for the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the tortuosity altogether these deviations can be partially explained by soil heterogeneity air entrapment and nonuniform application of irrigation water on the soil surface the estimated shape parameters Œ± and n indicate a soil characterized by a sharp air entry point and a moderate retention capacity typical of gr substrates brunetti et al 2016a hill et al 2019 sandoval et al 2017 the calibrated feddes parameters reflect the nearly optimal transpiration rates of the gr vegetation under wet soil conditions and agree with previous studies brunetti et al 2016a kuronuma and watanabe 2017 3 1 2 reactive nitrogen transport nitrogen turnover is well predicted in all inverse modeling scenarios the highest predictive uncertainty is encountered for scenario nv h in fig 3 while the scenarios cr g in fig 3 and vg i in fig 3 exhibit both narrow prediction bands this trend was already observed for water flow and solute transport suggesting experimental inaccuracies in the non vegetated testbed nevertheless the description of the nitrogen reactive transport remains sufficiently accurate also for this scenario comparing the estimated parameters posterior distributions holds more interest and clarifies the role of different physical and biological processes first the very low values estimated for Œ≥norg indicate that the release of nitrogen from the decomposition of plant residues was limited during the experiment although this was expected due to the limited duration of the experimental campaign this process cannot be excluded in the long term and under field operating conditions where the seasonality can trigger changes in the plant status interestingly the estimated degradation rate of organic nitrogen ¬µsnorg for the vegetated box is significantly higher than that calculated for the control box this suggests that wastewater application induces optimal conditions for the microbial conversion of norg to nh4 ibekwe et al 2018 the nh4 partition coefficient cannot be inferred for the cr and nv scenarios still its estimated value for the vg scenario indicates strong sorption of this compound to the solid phase compatible with the high organic matter content of the substrate wang and alva 2000 the high to moderate uncertainty of this estimated parameter is mainly a consequence of the lack of information about the ammonium distribution in the soil profile the nh4 degradation rate in the liquid phase ¬µlnh4 exhibits high uncertainty and cannot be inferred from the observations conversely the high value estimated for ¬µsnh4 which together with ¬µsnorg indicates high nitrification processes in the vegetated testbed the comparison between the estimated standard deviations of nitrate measurements œÉno3 confirms experimental inaccuracies for the non vegetated testbed and might cause the high parameter uncertainty for this scenario table 2 reports the cumulative n fluxes in the grs for different scenarios calculated by averaging the results of 100 numerical simulations obtained by random sampling from the posterior parameters distributions the results indicate that the n leaching potential is significantly higher in the non vegetated testbed where it reaches 94 of the total injected n compared to the 67 estimated for the vegetated box in the latter scenario the roots take up 32 of the injected n while n input from decomposition plays a minor role conversely this process is more important for the control scenario where 63 and 30 of the generated n are leached and taken up by roots respectively these percentages are similar to those obtained for the vegetated scenario and suggest that root solute uptake can mitigate n leaching from grs 3 1 3 key processes in nitrogen turnover the comparison between no3 outflow concentrations and the model calibration results raises interesting discussion points on the role of different processes on the nitrogen reactive transport the control box irrigated with tap water is a source of nitrates the average no3 outflow concentration is 3 6 0 94 mg l which is above the reported threshold concentration of 2 6 mg l that accelerates eutrophication in water bodies bartley and johnson 2006 this behavior was already observed by vijayaraghavan et al 2012 who carried out an extensive experimental campaign on the assessment of grs water quality the authors reported similar concentration values when grs were irrigated solely with tap water and concluded that the nitrate release is mainly due to the degradation of the soil substrate s organic compounds this agrees with the results of the present study that shows a decreasing trend in nitrate concentrations g in fig 3 caused by the consumption of the initial soil organic nitrogen which is not replenished by the degradation of plant residuals low Œ≥norg in table 1 this behavior was also observed by monterusso et al 2004 and suggested the need to periodically fertilize traditional grs to restore nutrient levels and support plants growth using a numerical model can help optimize fertilization to avoid excess nutrients leaching berndtsson et al 2006 finally the narrow estimated uncertainty for ¬µsnorg confirms that organic nitrogen turnover is the dominant process in the release of nitrates from the control box the non vegetated gr releases the highest amount of nitrates suggesting an important role of root solute uptake for the nitrogen removal from grs irrigated with domestic wastewater this uptake is favored by moderately wet conditions of the soil substrate during the experiment f in fig 3 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 reported similar differences between vegetated and non vegetated extensive grs similarly berndtsson et al 2006 highlighted the role of vegetation on nitrogen retention in extensive grs no3 leaching from the non vegetated testbed exhibits a decreasing trend g in fig 3 which is again compatible with gradual degradation of the initially present soil organic nitrogen this trend is not observed for the vegetated box and can be partially explained by plant uptake which hampers the initial accumulation of nitrates afterward the applied wastewater replenishes the soil nitrogen and induces optimal nitrification conditions high ¬µsnh4 in table 1 thus maintaining an approximately constant outflow concentration 3 2 global sensitivity analysis the previous discussion on the experimental data and model calibration outcomes identified root solute uptake and soil organic compounds degradation as important processes in nitrogen turnover in the grs to further confirm or disprove these findings a global sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the factors driving nitrate leaching from the vegetated grs the convergence analysis indicated that 3000 model executions were sufficient to obtain stable estimations of the first order sensitivity indices reported in the last column of table 1 for all investigated parameters seven factors out of 15 exhibit an appreciable influence s1 0 1 on nitrate leaching but only five are characterized by s1 1 Œ≥norg popt ¬µsnh4 ¬µsnorg and p0 in order of importance the soil hydraulic and solute non reactive transport parameters have negligible influence in the investigated range table 1 this may be partially due to the limited depth i e 12 cm of the soil substrate which masks the effect of transport processes and the controlled laboratory conditions which reduce heterogeneity similar reasoning can be applied to the ammonium distribution coefficient whose retardation effect on the nitrate transport cannot be fully appreciated in a shallow soil profile as expected the first order degradation coefficients ¬µsnh4 and ¬µsnorg have an appreciable impact on nitrate leaching however their effect is topped by Œ≥norg and popt which are the two most influential factors these results confirm that root solute uptake and soil organic matter degradation are important processes in the gr nitrogen balance to further clarify their functioning a local sensitivity analysis is performed using the median solution in table 1 as a reference and changing alternatively only Œ≥norg and popt fig 4 shows the resulting cumulative root no3 uptake and bottom flux as a function of Œ≥norg a and c in fig 4 and popt b and d in fig 4 the comparison confirms the bigger influence of Œ≥norg high production of organic nitrogen is positively correlated with an increase in the soil s nitrate level which cannot be completely offset by an increase in root solute uptake the latter depends on the plant uptake capacity which is regulated by the transpiration demand the vegetation s characteristics and the soil volumetric water content in the root zone brunetti et al 2021 for instance very wet conditions can induce waterlogging effects and drastically reduce root water and solute uptake the feddes parameter popt is a threshold pressure head value above which actual transpiration drops due to anaerobic conditions the analysis shows that when popt is reduced c in fig 4 nitrate uptake declines due to the wet conditions observed during the experiment f in fig 3 as a consequence nitrate leaching is higher than in other modeling scenarios to summarize the main findings of the global sensitivity analysis are organic nitrogen production due to exogenous variables further increases nutrient leaching from the gr reducing its environmental benefits therefore installing plants characterized by a minimal potential of tissue decomposition and high resistance and designing an irrigation system to avoid extended periods of water stress is preferable at the same time fertilization or soil amendments should be carefully evaluated and potentially excluded when domestic wastewater is applied when this is not possible for various reasons the fertilizer application should be properly designed to minimize nutrients leaching clark and zheng 2014 by taking into account the in situ conditions of the gr the present study demonstrates that numerical models are a valuable and recommended tool for this task root solute uptake enhances the nitrogen removal efficiency from domestic wastewater thus the system should be designed to maximize transpiration by reducing water stress both due to waterlogging or dry conditions and supporting plants health again we advocate using a numerical model which can provide a comprehensive overview of physical processes in the gr 4 strengths and limitations we consider this study to be innovative in mainly two aspects the numerical analysis of nitrogen turnover in grs irrigated with domestic wastewater is a novel application in this research field the joint use of bayesian inference techniques and sensitivity analyses provides a statistical basis for uncertainty assessment and ranking of the effects of multiple physical processes on nutrients leaching from the grs respectively the model calibration is performed on a comprehensive dataset from a controlled laboratory experiment on multiple testbeds which included not only nitrogen observations but also measurements of volumetric water contents subsurface outflow tracer experiments and atmospheric variables in a climate chamber this allows to narrow down uncertainties and better understand the physical functioning of the system still the study also possesses some limitations and open questions to be solved in the future first the experimental campaign s duration was too limited to observe long term processes such as the alteration of the soil hydraulic properties due to biofilm formation or wastewater toxicity effects on the vegetation which would change both the hydraulic regime and the root uptake capacity second it was impossible to precisely infer certain model parameters e g ammonium partition coefficient due to both operating conditions and experimental inaccuracies and limitations additional measurements of ammonium concentrations in the soil profile could potentially mitigate this problem finally the grs morphology simulated atmospheric conditions and irrigation pattern are not representative of a broad class of field scale operating conditions and more tests under variable atmospheric conditions can give more insights into the physical chemical and biological dynamics of grs such as denitrification processes which might occur during the long duration and low intensity rainfall events qiu et al 2020 or due to water soluble organic carbon from plant residues during initial decomposition surey et al 2020 furthermore precipitation can affect the nitrogen turnover by increasing the nitrate leaching potential and soil water content which influences the microbial degradation processes e g maenhout et al 2018 however we want to emphasize that observations information content was sufficient to estimate multiple parameters with limited uncertainty table 1 5 conclusions this study aimed to expand the current knowledge on the potential use of green roofs for domestic wastewater treatment with particular emphasis on the nitrogen reactive transport and nitrate leaching a bayesian framework was used to calibrate a mechanistic numerical model against multiple observations from a controlled laboratory experiment this analysis was complemented by a global sensitivity analysis to further enlighten the role of multiple physical processes results indicate that grs quickly nitrify wastewater ammonium and resulting nitrate leaching is negatively correlated with the vegetation s root solute uptake capacity maximization of this effect is desirable and could be achieved by selecting appropriate plant species and reducing water stress periods with a proper irrigation schedule this would simultaneously support vegetation s health and limit the decay and decomposition of plants tissues which the analysis showed can potentially influence the nitrogen balance in the grs numerical models are certainly a valuable tool for these tasks and to understand and design grs for wastewater treatment based on these results we recommend extending the experimental campaign in future studies to observe the long term behavior of the system under different operating conditions we further recommend investigating the potential use of grs for the decentralized removal of other compounds such as pharmaceuticals which show significant persistence and occurrence in the environment

3968,rainwater is altered hydrologically and chemically as it passes through tree canopies to reach the soil surface but this aspect of urban forest ecosystems has received less attention than that of natural ecosystems hydrological partitioning and changes in solute composition of rainfall were examined in an urban forest within guangzhou city in southern china with reference to three typical subtropical urban tree species roystonea regia ficus microcarpa and lagerstroemia speciosa with large but morphologically distinct canopies three components of rainfall namely throughfall stemflow and interception were measured and sampled from september 2018 to september 2019 a canopy budget model was used for estimating the contribution of canopy exchange and dry deposition to net rainfall throughfall stemflow solute flux being a palm r regia recorded the highest percentages of throughfall 72 60 and stemflow 8 68 whereas interception was higher in f microcarpa 33 48 and l speciosa 30 54 the concentrations of almost all the solutes ca2 k na mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 in throughfall and stemflow were higher than those in rainfall suggesting that water was enriched with these solutes as a result of passing through the canopy the model of canopy budget also showed that whereas all the three species were similar in terms of the leaching of macronutrient cations the species differed in term of anions whereas r regia and l speciosa generally absorbed or retained anions on foliage twigs or trunks f microcarpa leached cl and no3 presumably because of its unique aerial root these results can inform the design of urban forests for example the lack of no3 uptake by f microcarpa suggests that it would be less suitable for mitigating the problems of n deposition which are significant in southern china than the other two species on other hand the rainfall partitioning and canopy exchange characteristics of l speciosa make it more suitable for intercepting rainwater as well as for alleviating the problem of n deposition the findings of this study therefore have significant implications for the selection of urban tree species in similar subtropical regions worldwide keywords throughfall stemflow canopy exchange dry deposition canopy budget model urban trees 1 introduction before rainwater reaches the surface soil of wooded ecosystems the water is partitioned as it passes though the plant canopy into three fractions namely 1 throughfall or the fraction that directly passes through gaps in the canopy or drips from leaves branches and epiphytes 2 stemflow or the fraction that flows down plant stems or tree trunks and 3 interception or the fraction that is either retained on the canopy or evaporates from it coenders gerrits et al 2020 levia and frost 2003 magliano et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2020 this partitioning can not only determines the spatial and temporal patterns of rainwater inputs at the soil surface li et al 2009 liang et al 2011 van stan et al 2020 but also greatly impacts the net nutrient flux from rainfall chuyong et al 2004 ke et al 2020 tonello et al 2021 soil properties cremer and prietzel 2017 levia and germer 2015 snelgrove et al 2020 composition of the microbial community bittar et al 2018 moore et al 2016 and the transport of polluting metals glinski et al 2018 tan et al 2019 therefore understanding the partitioning processes and their effect on the exchange of chemical elements between the canopy and the soil is particularly important in evaluating regional hydrological and biogeochemical processes against the background of global climate change yue et al 2021 the solute chemistry of rainfall can be greatly altered as it flows through the canopy significantly influencing both the dynamics of water balance and that of associated nutrients chuyong et al 2004 levia and frost 2003 lu et al 2020 ponette gonzalez et al 2020 specifically solute chemistry will be affected by such diverse interactions as leaching absorption and transformation between rainwater and foliage twigs bark and epiphytes lin et al 2001 sun et al 2021 van stan et al 2021 moreover materials deposited from the atmosphere onto plant surfaces during periods between spells of rain referred to as dry deposition will be washed down by rainwater to reach the surface soil through in stemflow and throughfall shen et al 2013 staelens et al 2008 talkner et al 2010 the chemical composition of throughfall and stemflow is therefore the result of the interactions among plant morphology meteorological factors dry deposition and canopy exchange parker 1983 siegert et al 2017 although the hydrometeorological dynamics of throughfall and stemflow are broadly described in the literature ponette gonz√°lez et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2020 only a few studies have attempted to place the resulting hydrological and nutrient fluxes within the context of hydrologic and nutrient budgets of trees aubrey 2020 this knowledge gap is particularly large in the case of urban areas although the ecosystem services provided by urban forests in terms of the partitioning of precipitation have been valued at millions of dollars annually on the scale of a city or a watershed nowak et al 2020 urban trees can play an integral role in supporting sustainable development by offering diverse ecosystem services mullaney et al 2015 rahman et al 2017 wang et al 2021 yao et al 2019 among these services the mediation of urban catchment hydrological processes has been extensively reported specifically urban trees can reduce surface runoff through canopy interception which reduces throughfall and therefore catchment peak flows kuehler et al 2017 livesley et al 2014 nowak et al 2020 for instance asadian and weiler 2009 measured the rainfall partitioning and runoff under two urban tree species in canada namely douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii and western red cedar thuja plicata and reported that on average the reduction and the delay in the throughfall reaching the ground due to canopy interception can be as high as 50 60 of the total rainfall zabret and ≈°raj 2019 also pointed out that in slovenia of the two urban tree species namely birch betula pendula and pine pinus nigra birch intercepted 23 of the gross rainfall whereas pine intercepted 45 and birch reduced runoff by 4 8 whereas pine reduced it by 7 3 hence understanding the role of the canopies of urban tree species in rainfall partitioning can greatly benefit urban stormwater management systems nowak et al 2020 reviewed cities of different physiography and scales and estimated the annual monetary value of reducing runoff using urban trees from 2 million in a sub watershed of grand rapids michigan usa to 230 million in austin texas usa despite their increasing number most studies on rainfall partitioning by urban trees have focused on the proportion of rainfall thus partitioned to gross rainfall xiao et al 2000 the main influencing factors livesley et al 2014 schooling and carlyle moses 2015 and the implications for urban hydrology zabret and ≈°raj 2019 only a few studies have examined the effects of canopies of urban tree species on changes in the solute chemistry of rainwater this is arguably an important gap in knowledge because solutes move more actively in urban environments which are subjected to intense anthropogenic disturbance cao et al 2009 de souza et al 2015 levia and germer 2015 in such tropical or subtropical regions as southern china this knowledge gap is of even greater interest because that region is one of the three regions with the highest nitrogen deposition in the world and also suffers from strong acid deposition lu et al 2020 yu et al 2019 information on nutrient concentration composition and flux within rainwater draining off from common urban trees for this region may be useful in selecting tree species for urban greening at present the choice is mainly aesthetic n√∫√±ez florez et al 2019 and rarely includes utilitarian concerns such as ecohydrological functions of selected trees which is why the present study sought to examine and compare three typical urban tree species in southern china in terms of 1 the proportion partitioned rainfall to gross rainfall 2 nutrient concentrations in the different partitions or components of rainfall and 3 the solute flux and the estimated contribution of dry deposition and canopy exchange processes to solute fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area was part of guangzhou city 112 57 114 03 n 22 26 23

rainfall throughfall and stemflow were measured and sampled from september 2018 to september 2019 the amount of rainfall was monitored every 10 min using a tipping bucket rain gauge texas electronics te525 at a meteorological station on the campus 100 m from the study trees a rainfall event was defined as a period of at least 2 mm of gross rainfall and individual rainfall events were separated by a dry spell of at least 10 h which normally ensures that the tree canopy is dry zhang et al 2020 bulk rainfall was sampled using a funnel 20 cm in diameter connected to a 15 l polyethylene bottle fig 2 three such assemblies were installed within the open area of the meteorological station and at a height of 1 20 m to avoid splash contamination three water samples were collected with 100 ml polyethylene bottles after each rainfall event and then pooled to make a volume weighted composite sample for chemical analysis the funnels and the bottles were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water after each sampling throughfall was measured and collected using the same assembly as that used for rainwater fig 2 one such assembly was placed 0 5 m from the trunk and another was placed 2 m away in each compass direction resulting in a total of eight collection systems under the crown of each tree a table tennis ball served as a plastic float in each funnel to prevent evaporation before the water sampling was collected for measurement and analysis the volume of water throughfall in each collector was measured using a graduated cylinder and samples were collected and stored in 100 ml polyethylene bottles after each rainfall event all the eight samples around each tree were pooled to make a volume weighted composite sample resulting in three composite samples for chemical analysis of throughfall one for each species after each sampling the funnels and bottles were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water approximately 15 of throughfall samples were lost because of clogging of the funnel by litter the throughfall volume mm of each sampling tree was obtained from the eight sampling points using the following equation 1 tf 1 n i 1 n vtf i a i where tf is the throughfall mm from each rainfall event vtfi is the volume ml of each collector ai is the area mm2 of each collector and n is the number of collectors stemflow was measured and sampled from all the 15 study trees and the equipment for collecting stemflow was similar to that used in earlier studies iida et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 a stemflow collection collar was wrapped around each tree trunk and secured to it at a spot 1 30 m above the ground the gap between the collar and tree trunk was sealed using a silicone sealant fig 2 the collar was then connected to a 100 l polyethylene bucket using a flexible plastic tube the volume of stemflow in each bucket was measured using a graduated cylinder and water samples were collected and stored in 250 ml polyethylene bottles after each rainfall event after each sampling the buckets containing the stemflow were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water the stemflow mm from each sampling tree was computed using the following equation 2 sf vsf i pca i where sf is stemflow mm after each rainfall event vsfi is the volume ml of each bucket and pcai is the projected canopy area mm2 of each tree in the sample 2 3 chemical analysis and flux calculation samples of water from rainfall throughfall and stemflow were collected within 24 h after the end of each rainfall event and stored below 4 until required for chemical analysis each sample was filtered through a 0 45 Œºm polypropylene membrane and the ph measured within two days of sampling the concentrations mg l 1 of base cations ca2 k na and mg2 and anions cl f no3 and so4 2 were determined using ion chromatography icp aes thermo scientific icap 6500 radial volume weighted mean vwm was used for representing the mean concentration of chemical ions in bulk rainfall br throughfall and stemflow for each individual event hofhansl et al 2012 tonello et al 2021 using the following equation 3 vwm i 1 n c i v i i 1 n v i where vwm is the mean solute concentration mg l 1 for a given event ci is the concentration at collector i and vi is the volume of br tf and sf at collector i the mean input flux of a given ion for br tf and sf after each individual rainfall event was calculated as follows 4 flux vwm v d 100 where flux represents the input kg ha 1 of a certain chemical element and vd is the total depth mm of bulk rainfall throughfall or stemflow for a given event the chemical flux of tf and sf beneath the canopy results from total atmospheric deposition and canopy exchange processes macinnis ng et al 2012 staelens et al 2008 the canopy budget model developed by ulrich 1983 was extensively used to determine net deposition and canopy exchange processes and can be written as follows 5 tf sf br dd ce 6 nr tf sf br dd ce where dd is the dry deposition ce source or sink of the canopy is the canopy exchange and nr is the net rainfall flux the flux of dry deposition was generally estimated based on the assumption that some tracer ions are not influenced by canopy exchange interactions staelens et al 2008 talkner et al 2010 na and so4 2 are often treated as tracer ions for estimating dry deposition of other solutes with the assumption that tracer ions in throughfall or stemflow maintain a balance during the canopy exchange process and hence the excess in throughfall and stemflow compared to that in rainfall is attributed to dry deposition gautam et al 2017 tonello et al 2021 in the present study the dry deposition of ca2 mg2 k and cl was calculated based on the dry deposition factor ddf from na as a tracer multiplying it by individual ions in the rainfall 7 dd i ddf na br i 8 ddf na tf na sf na br na br na where ddfna is the dry deposition factor for na and i is ca2 mg2 k and cl for estimating dry deposition of no3 and f so4 2 was used as a tracer in the following equations 9 dd j ddf so br j 10 ddf so tf so sf so br so br so where ddfso is the dry deposition factor for so4 2 and j is no3 and f canopy exchange ce for these ions can be then calculated as follows 11 ce t f s f b r d d a positive ce value means that canopy leaching cl of ion contributes to tf or sf flux whereas a negative ce value means canopy uptake of the ion 2 4 statistical analysis violin plots were generated using vioplot a software package adler and kelly 2018 within r statistical software r core team 2018 to show the proportions of throughfall stemflow and interception in bulk rainfall one way analysis of variance with tukey b test was carried out using ibm spss ver 22 0 spss inc chicago usa to test whether the three components differed significantly in terms of ion concentrations and enrichment ratios statistically significant differences were set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 rainfall partitioning a total of 72 rainfall events were recorded during the study period amounting to 1630 mm of rainfall the percentage of throughfall 76 45 and that of stemflow 8 06 in total rainfall was the highest and that of canopy interception 15 49 the lowest in r regia the share of interception was maximum 28 27 in f microcarpa with those of throughfall and stemflow being 68 04 and 3 69 respectively in l speciosa throughfall contributed 71 04 stemflow 2 99 and interception 25 97 the violin plot showed the general characteristics of the share of each component across all rainfall events fig 3 the proportion of throughfall in total rainfall ranged from 32 34 to 79 64 and that of stemflow from 0 45 to 11 54 with the median being the highest in r regia for both throughfall 72 6 and stemflow 8 68 the lowest for throughfall in f microcarpa 64 33 and the lowest for stemflow 1 32 in l speciosa with respect to interception f microcarpa 33 48 and l speciosa 30 54 showed high values of the median whereas r regia showed a very low value 17 74 both throughfall and stemflow especially the former and rainfall were significantly linearly and positively r 0 76 p 0 01 correlated to rainfall fig 4 3 2 concentrations of rainfall throughfall and stemflow the largest proportion in cations in bulk rainfall was that of k which accounted for 48 85 of the total annual mass of cations fig 5 followed by ca2 34 57 na 12 42 and mg2 4 17 among the anions no3 43 25 and so4 2 34 09 were the major components the ph values of throughfall and stemflow for all the three trees were all higher than the corresponding values of rainfall table 2 as were the concentrations of all the cations and anions except f the concentration of which was higher in rainfall the concentrations of some ions also differed significantly for example the average concentration of no3 in stemflow for l speciosa was 22 21 mg l 1 5 8 times that in bulk rainfall and in r regia the average concentration in throughfall was 1 6 times that in bulk rainfall 3 3 dry deposition and canopy exchange the dynamics of flux of the total ions fig 6 or of each individual ion figs s1 and s2 show that total throughfall stemflow ion flux was higher than that of rainfall the throughfall flux accounted for the major share of total net rainfall flux under the canopy event level net rainfall fluxes during the dry season september to march were higher than those during the wet april to august season during the experimental period the throughfall flux for each ion accounted for the majority of the bulk rainfall and dry deposition ranging from 62 62 to 220 72 table 3 in all the three species the fluxes of all cations in canopy exchange were greater than 0 and the relative contribution of canopy leaching to net rainfall together nr for these cations was greater than 24 07 and even as high as 77 38 81 42 for k fig 7 in the case of anions however the results varied with the species the annual cl flux of canopy exchange was 7 85 kg ha 1 in r regia and negative for the other two anions in f microcarpa the annual cl flux was 10 77 kg ha 1 and that of no3 was 9 49 kg ha 1 whereas that for the rest of the anions was negative in l speciosa the flux of almost all the anions was 0 that for no3 being 8 67 kg ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall partitioning and its effects on hydrochemical concentrations for the three tree species the median ratio of throughfall to rainfall was 64 33 72 60 and that of stemflow to rainfall was 1 32 8 68 the relative shares of the components throughfall stemflow and interception in total rainfall also varied greatly among individual rainfall events fig 3 these results are consistent with those of earlier studies on forests or other tree species worldwide macinnis ng et al 2012 sadeghi et al 2020 snelgrove et al 2020 zabret et al 2018 for example a latest global synthesis on rainfall partitioning 644 observations spanning broad climate and plant types globally by sadeghi et al 2020 reported that the median ratios of throughfall and stemflow to rainfall were 75 8 and 2 2 respectively for all observations and 77 and 1 for observations related to trees alone livesley et al 2014 evaluated the impacts of canopy density and bark type on rainfall portioning in two completely different eucalypts growing as avenue trees in cities and found that throughfall accounted for 55 2 71 4 of the rainfall and stemflow accounted for 1 5 to 1 8 during the experimental period in the present experiment the share of net rainfall including throughfall and stemflow in total rainfall in the case of r regia was larger than that in the case of the other two species palms generally have the largest shares of stemflow among tree species frangi and lugo 1985 germer et al 2012 mainly because their relatively sparse canopy fig 1 is less effective in intercepting rainfall and allows more of it to pass through levia et al 2019 livesley et al 2014 however r regia had significantly higher canopy height to width ratio p 0 01 table 1 and a smoother bark than the other two tree species fig 1 and table 1 higher height to width ratios usually mean more steeply inclined branches which act as a funnel and favour stemflow sadeghi et al 2020 the smoother bark also facilitates stemflow greatly because of its lower capacity to absorb or store moisture levia and germer 2015 livesley et al 2014 the concentration of almost all the ions except f in throughfall and stemflow especially in the latter from all the three species was higher than that in rainfall table 2 indicating that their ability to enrich the rainwater chemistry was comparable to that of other plants gautam et al 2017 sun et al 2021 tonello et al 2021 changes in the chemical composition of rainwater passing through the canopy are determined mainly by three factors wash off from dry depositions captured by foliage and bark canopy exchange processes such as uptake or leaching and transformation e g biological nitrification adriaenssens et al 2012 guerrieri et al 2015 ignatova and dambrine 2000 lu et al 2020 van stan and pypker 2015 this enrichment of throughfall or stemflow was therefore greater than the effects of uptake or transformation by plants moreover the ph of throughfall and stemflow was slightly but not significantly higher than that of rainfall table 2 suggesting that the rainwater had not been rendered significantly acidic because of the interaction with the canopy of these three species 4 2 hydrochemical flux and canopy exchange process the solute fluxes in throughfall were approximately 5 fold to 39 fold of the fluxes in stemflow table 3 primarily because of the higher volumes per unit area of throughfall although the concentrations of ions in stemflow were typically higher these differences could also be demonstrated from the results of the dynamics of ions flux in individual rainfall events which indicated that the ion flux in throughfall dominated the ion flux in rainwater in each rainfall event fig 6 figs s1 and s2 the fluxes of ca2 k no3 and so4 2 in tf and sf were relatively greater than those of other ions a finding similar to the findings of other studies of tropical ecosystems shen et al 2013 su et al 2019 sun et al 2021 moreover fluxes of all base cations except na in canopy exchange were positive table 3 indicating leaching when those ions pass through the canopy which too is consistent with the observations from various forest types it was found that the canopy exchange flux of k and its relative contribution to nr were the highest across all three species table 3 and fig 7 indicating strong k leaching from canopy similar results have also been reported from various regions or ecosystems gautam et al 2017 lin et al 2001 tonello et al 2021 zhang et al 2007 for instance shen et al 2013 reported that k accounted for nearly 97 of canopy exchange flux in two subtropical plantation forests at a site in southern china about 70 km from our study site sun et al 2021 found that in canopy exchange k was the dominant component accounting for more than 68 of nr in a subtropical broad leaved forest in south eastern china a reasonable explanation is that k is usually considered highly soluble substance due to its weak bonding and is easily leached from plant tissue berger et al 2008 parker 1983 zhang et al 2007 in addition although the relative contribution of canopy leaching to nr with respect to mg2 was high except r regia fig 7 the flux values of canopy exchange were relatively low table 3 probably because of their low concentrations in rainfall itself fig 5 canopy exchange processes for anions were more complex than those for cations in r regia and l speciosa the flux values of canopy exchange in anions except cl in r regia were almost all negative indicating that a significant portion was absorbed or retained by foliage table 3 fig 8 this retention meant that the flux of these anions particularly of no3 was decreased in passing through the canopy to the soil surface as reported earlier dezzeo and chac√≥n 2006 ma≈Çek and astel 2008 ponette gonz√°lez et al 2017 su et al 2019 fenn et al 2013 estimated that approximately 90 of the wet deposited no3 was retained by the canopy especially during winter ke et al 2020 suggested that more than 40 of the deposited nitrogen oxides were absorbed by the canopy in a subtropical forest in south eastern china the following possible mechanisms have been proposed for this uptake or retention of nutrients by the canopy foliage epiphytic lichens or uptake by bryophytes absorption by the bark and microbial assimilation fenn et al 2013 van stan and pypker 2015 lagerstroemia speciosa has dense twigs and very rough bark fig 1 and table 1 which increase the capacity of the species to retain nutrients thereby facilitating diffusion exchange and uptake which are helped even more because of the larger surface area and greater capacity to store water adriaenssens et al 2012 the possible reason for uptake of anions by r regia is the high wettability of its foliage which promotes their absorption fenn et al 2013 therefore l speciosa and r regia may prove particularly helpful in controlling no3 deposition which is of increasing concern now and in the future in china yu et al 2019 conversely in f microcarpa the flux values of cl and no3 in canopy exchange were positive table 3 suggesting canopy leaching from foliage twigs and the trunk a number of observations have also been reported that atmospheric n or cl deposition fluxes are enhanced as a result of passing through the canopy berger et al 2008 tonello et al 2021 van stan and pypker 2015 we speculate that the explanation lies in the unique structure of aerial roots in f microcarpa which are highly porous and therefore promote leaching from the canopy ouyang and kuo 2006 van stan and pypker 2015 although several studies have reported that the aerial roots of f microcarpa can absorb heavy metals thus removing them from the solution li et al 2019 liu et al 2012 stemflow is often neglected in examining the interaction between urban forests and precipitation and the related chemical changes because stemflow is believed to contribute only a small fraction of the total fluxes of water and nutrients chen et al 2019 levia and germer 2015 however our results indicate that the chemical composition of stemflow is notably enriched probably because of its longer residence time on the tree surface especially its prolonged contact with the bark van stan et al 2021 stemflow is thus an important pathway in nutrient cycling siegert et al 2017 and can even be considered a hot spot because stemflow delivers a substantial flux of water and nutrients along preferential flow paths li et al 2009 schw√§rzel et al 2012 for example several studies have reported that modest amounts of stemflow as a proportion of gross rainfall can be sufficiently enriched to account for a significant portion 10 50 of the total ionic macronutrient flux bellot and escarre 1991 berger et al 2009 dezzeo and chac√≥n 2006 dovey et al 2011 germer et al 2012 oziegbe et al 2011 this also appears to be the case for other compounds delivered by stemflow van stan et al 2017 reported that stemflow was particularly rich in dissolved organic matter dom supplying massive carbon fluxes over short periods to local soils furthermore precipitation regimes around the world have changed significantly as part of the ongoing global climate change a part of those changes being the increased frequency of extreme precipitation events ipcc 2014 in the subtropics the dry season is also expected to be drier and longer and the wet season wetter and with more frequent and more intense rainstorms zhou et al 2013 dry deposition may therefore increase because of the longer dry periods between two storm events and stemflow may be facilitated because of the more intense rainstorms these changes in climate might significantly alter the nutrient and hydrochemical cycle in urban forest ecosystems and are particularly important in urban ecosystems because many harmful elements such as heavy metals are more concentrated in both dry and wet depositions tan et al 2019 which deserve further study therefore trees for urban greening should be chosen on the basis of not only aesthetics and safety but also their hydrological and hydrochemical effects although it is easy enough based on the canopy budget model to estimate the main contribution of dry deposition canopy leaching or dry deposition exceeding canopy uptake to the increasing flux of throughfall and stemflow this approach also has several uncertainties due to the assumption that tracer ions are leached only in negligible amounts through the canopy gautam et al 2017 staelens et al 2008 talkner et al 2010 despite this assumption and the limitations of this approach the canopy budget model can provide valuable information for identifying and quantifying the main sources of nr fluxes sun et al 2021 5 conclusions this study investigated the partitioning of rainfall by the canopy of three common subtropical tree species in urban china and the effects of such partitioning on solute concentrations and fluxes of net rainfall the species a palm roystonea regia a tree with aerial roots ficus microcarpa and a common ornamental tree lagerstroemia speciosa differed significantly in the relative proportions of different components of rainfall throughfall stemflow and interception because of the differences in the tree morphology the shares of throughfall 72 6 and stemflow 8 7 were higher in the palm whereas the share of interception 30 was higher in the other two species concentrations of most ionic solutes in throughfall and stemflow were higher than those in rainfall particularly in stemflow the contributions of dry deposition and canopy exchange were estimated with a canopy budget model canopy exchange was positive for all the base cations especially for k indicating significant leaching from the trees whereas the anions showed great variability canopy exchange was negative for most anions in r regia and l speciosa because of the greater uptake of anions by those two species whereas f microcarpa showed significant leaching of no3 probably because of its unique aerial roots suggesting that f microcarpa will be less useful than the other two species in controlling the deposition of no3 based on these results l speciosa seems effective in intercepting rainwater and in lowering the deposits of n in this region suffering from significant acid deposition a finding that will prove useful in selecting appropriate tree species for urban greening in similar subtropical regions worldwide credit authorship

3968,rainwater is altered hydrologically and chemically as it passes through tree canopies to reach the soil surface but this aspect of urban forest ecosystems has received less attention than that of natural ecosystems hydrological partitioning and changes in solute composition of rainfall were examined in an urban forest within guangzhou city in southern china with reference to three typical subtropical urban tree species roystonea regia ficus microcarpa and lagerstroemia speciosa with large but morphologically distinct canopies three components of rainfall namely throughfall stemflow and interception were measured and sampled from september 2018 to september 2019 a canopy budget model was used for estimating the contribution of canopy exchange and dry deposition to net rainfall throughfall stemflow solute flux being a palm r regia recorded the highest percentages of throughfall 72 60 and stemflow 8 68 whereas interception was higher in f microcarpa 33 48 and l speciosa 30 54 the concentrations of almost all the solutes ca2 k na mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 in throughfall and stemflow were higher than those in rainfall suggesting that water was enriched with these solutes as a result of passing through the canopy the model of canopy budget also showed that whereas all the three species were similar in terms of the leaching of macronutrient cations the species differed in term of anions whereas r regia and l speciosa generally absorbed or retained anions on foliage twigs or trunks f microcarpa leached cl and no3 presumably because of its unique aerial root these results can inform the design of urban forests for example the lack of no3 uptake by f microcarpa suggests that it would be less suitable for mitigating the problems of n deposition which are significant in southern china than the other two species on other hand the rainfall partitioning and canopy exchange characteristics of l speciosa make it more suitable for intercepting rainwater as well as for alleviating the problem of n deposition the findings of this study therefore have significant implications for the selection of urban tree species in similar subtropical regions worldwide keywords throughfall stemflow canopy exchange dry deposition canopy budget model urban trees 1 introduction before rainwater reaches the surface soil of wooded ecosystems the water is partitioned as it passes though the plant canopy into three fractions namely 1 throughfall or the fraction that directly passes through gaps in the canopy or drips from leaves branches and epiphytes 2 stemflow or the fraction that flows down plant stems or tree trunks and 3 interception or the fraction that is either retained on the canopy or evaporates from it coenders gerrits et al 2020 levia and frost 2003 magliano et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2020 this partitioning can not only determines the spatial and temporal patterns of rainwater inputs at the soil surface li et al 2009 liang et al 2011 van stan et al 2020 but also greatly impacts the net nutrient flux from rainfall chuyong et al 2004 ke et al 2020 tonello et al 2021 soil properties cremer and prietzel 2017 levia and germer 2015 snelgrove et al 2020 composition of the microbial community bittar et al 2018 moore et al 2016 and the transport of polluting metals glinski et al 2018 tan et al 2019 therefore understanding the partitioning processes and their effect on the exchange of chemical elements between the canopy and the soil is particularly important in evaluating regional hydrological and biogeochemical processes against the background of global climate change yue et al 2021 the solute chemistry of rainfall can be greatly altered as it flows through the canopy significantly influencing both the dynamics of water balance and that of associated nutrients chuyong et al 2004 levia and frost 2003 lu et al 2020 ponette gonzalez et al 2020 specifically solute chemistry will be affected by such diverse interactions as leaching absorption and transformation between rainwater and foliage twigs bark and epiphytes lin et al 2001 sun et al 2021 van stan et al 2021 moreover materials deposited from the atmosphere onto plant surfaces during periods between spells of rain referred to as dry deposition will be washed down by rainwater to reach the surface soil through in stemflow and throughfall shen et al 2013 staelens et al 2008 talkner et al 2010 the chemical composition of throughfall and stemflow is therefore the result of the interactions among plant morphology meteorological factors dry deposition and canopy exchange parker 1983 siegert et al 2017 although the hydrometeorological dynamics of throughfall and stemflow are broadly described in the literature ponette gonz√°lez et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2020 only a few studies have attempted to place the resulting hydrological and nutrient fluxes within the context of hydrologic and nutrient budgets of trees aubrey 2020 this knowledge gap is particularly large in the case of urban areas although the ecosystem services provided by urban forests in terms of the partitioning of precipitation have been valued at millions of dollars annually on the scale of a city or a watershed nowak et al 2020 urban trees can play an integral role in supporting sustainable development by offering diverse ecosystem services mullaney et al 2015 rahman et al 2017 wang et al 2021 yao et al 2019 among these services the mediation of urban catchment hydrological processes has been extensively reported specifically urban trees can reduce surface runoff through canopy interception which reduces throughfall and therefore catchment peak flows kuehler et al 2017 livesley et al 2014 nowak et al 2020 for instance asadian and weiler 2009 measured the rainfall partitioning and runoff under two urban tree species in canada namely douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii and western red cedar thuja plicata and reported that on average the reduction and the delay in the throughfall reaching the ground due to canopy interception can be as high as 50 60 of the total rainfall zabret and ≈°raj 2019 also pointed out that in slovenia of the two urban tree species namely birch betula pendula and pine pinus nigra birch intercepted 23 of the gross rainfall whereas pine intercepted 45 and birch reduced runoff by 4 8 whereas pine reduced it by 7 3 hence understanding the role of the canopies of urban tree species in rainfall partitioning can greatly benefit urban stormwater management systems nowak et al 2020 reviewed cities of different physiography and scales and estimated the annual monetary value of reducing runoff using urban trees from 2 million in a sub watershed of grand rapids michigan usa to 230 million in austin texas usa despite their increasing number most studies on rainfall partitioning by urban trees have focused on the proportion of rainfall thus partitioned to gross rainfall xiao et al 2000 the main influencing factors livesley et al 2014 schooling and carlyle moses 2015 and the implications for urban hydrology zabret and ≈°raj 2019 only a few studies have examined the effects of canopies of urban tree species on changes in the solute chemistry of rainwater this is arguably an important gap in knowledge because solutes move more actively in urban environments which are subjected to intense anthropogenic disturbance cao et al 2009 de souza et al 2015 levia and germer 2015 in such tropical or subtropical regions as southern china this knowledge gap is of even greater interest because that region is one of the three regions with the highest nitrogen deposition in the world and also suffers from strong acid deposition lu et al 2020 yu et al 2019 information on nutrient concentration composition and flux within rainwater draining off from common urban trees for this region may be useful in selecting tree species for urban greening at present the choice is mainly aesthetic n√∫√±ez florez et al 2019 and rarely includes utilitarian concerns such as ecohydrological functions of selected trees which is why the present study sought to examine and compare three typical urban tree species in southern china in terms of 1 the proportion partitioned rainfall to gross rainfall 2 nutrient concentrations in the different partitions or components of rainfall and 3 the solute flux and the estimated contribution of dry deposition and canopy exchange processes to solute fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area was part of guangzhou city 112 57 114 03 n 22 26 23 56 e the capital of guangdong province in southern china spread over 7437 km2 this area is characterized by a typical subtropical monsoon climate with the annual average temperature of 21 8 and the annual average relative humidity of 77 the mean annual rainfall is about 1720 mm of which about 80 occurs in the wet season from april to september often with intense storms cao et al 2009 the elevation decreases from the north east to the south west with low mountains and hills in the north and plains in the south the soil is neutral or weakly alkaline and mainly clay loam loam or sandy loam wu et al 2019 because of adequate moisture and warmth the vegetation is rich comprising evergreen broad leaved trees deciduous broad leaved trees coniferous trees and evergreen broad leaved shrubs within the above area the experiment was carried out over a plot of 81 35 ha within the shipai campus of south china normal university 113 21 36 n 23 08 53 e elevation 43 4 m in guangzhou city based on their widespread distribution in guangzhou and their distinctive canopy morphology three urban tree species namely roystonea regia ficus microcarpa and lagerstroemia speciosa were selected as indicator plants for the present study fig 1 the frequency of occurrence was 0 53 for r regia 0 4 for f microcarpa and 0 13 for l speciosa su et al 1998 sample trees were chosen for their stable and similar physical characteristics such as canopy height diameter and foliage density a set of five similar trees of each of the chosen species was set aside for the study of plant morphology table 1 the diameter at breast height dbh and basal area were measured with a tape and the characteristics of tree bark were judged qualitatively based on visual examination other parameters such as tree height projected crown area and the ratio of canopy height to width were obtained with a 3d laser scanner hi target china 2 2 measurements and sampling of rainfall throughfall and stemflow bulk rainfall throughfall and stemflow were measured and sampled from september 2018 to september 2019 the amount of rainfall was monitored every 10 min using a tipping bucket rain gauge texas electronics te525 at a meteorological station on the campus 100 m from the study trees a rainfall event was defined as a period of at least 2 mm of gross rainfall and individual rainfall events were separated by a dry spell of at least 10 h which normally ensures that the tree canopy is dry zhang et al 2020 bulk rainfall was sampled using a funnel 20 cm in diameter connected to a 15 l polyethylene bottle fig 2 three such assemblies were installed within the open area of the meteorological station and at a height of 1 20 m to avoid splash contamination three water samples were collected with 100 ml polyethylene bottles after each rainfall event and then pooled to make a volume weighted composite sample for chemical analysis the funnels and the bottles were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water after each sampling throughfall was measured and collected using the same assembly as that used for rainwater fig 2 one such assembly was placed 0 5 m from the trunk and another was placed 2 m away in each compass direction resulting in a total of eight collection systems under the crown of each tree a table tennis ball served as a plastic float in each funnel to prevent evaporation before the water sampling was collected for measurement and analysis the volume of water throughfall in each collector was measured using a graduated cylinder and samples were collected and stored in 100 ml polyethylene bottles after each rainfall event all the eight samples around each tree were pooled to make a volume weighted composite sample resulting in three composite samples for chemical analysis of throughfall one for each species after each sampling the funnels and bottles were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water approximately 15 of throughfall samples were lost because of clogging of the funnel by litter the throughfall volume mm of each sampling tree was obtained from the eight sampling points using the following equation 1 tf 1 n i 1 n vtf i a i where tf is the throughfall mm from each rainfall event vtfi is the volume ml of each collector ai is the area mm2 of each collector and n is the number of collectors stemflow was measured and sampled from all the 15 study trees and the equipment for collecting stemflow was similar to that used in earlier studies iida et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 a stemflow collection collar was wrapped around each tree trunk and secured to it at a spot 1 30 m above the ground the gap between the collar and tree trunk was sealed using a silicone sealant fig 2 the collar was then connected to a 100 l polyethylene bucket using a flexible plastic tube the volume of stemflow in each bucket was measured using a graduated cylinder and water samples were collected and stored in 250 ml polyethylene bottles after each rainfall event after each sampling the buckets containing the stemflow were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water the stemflow mm from each sampling tree was computed using the following equation 2 sf vsf i pca i where sf is stemflow mm after each rainfall event vsfi is the volume ml of each bucket and pcai is the projected canopy area mm2 of each tree in the sample 2 3 chemical analysis and flux calculation samples of water from rainfall throughfall and stemflow were collected within 24 h after the end of each rainfall event and stored below 4 until required for chemical analysis each sample was filtered through a 0 45 Œºm polypropylene membrane and the ph measured within two days of sampling the concentrations mg l 1 of base cations ca2 k na and mg2 and anions cl f no3 and so4 2 were determined using ion chromatography icp aes thermo scientific icap 6500 radial volume weighted mean vwm was used for representing the mean concentration of chemical ions in bulk rainfall br throughfall and stemflow for each individual event hofhansl et al 2012 tonello et al 2021 using the following equation 3 vwm i 1 n c i v i i 1 n v i where vwm is the mean solute concentration mg l 1 for a given event ci is the concentration at collector i and vi is the volume of br tf and sf at collector i the mean input flux of a given ion for br tf and sf after each individual rainfall event was calculated as follows 4 flux vwm v d 100 where flux represents the input kg ha 1 of a certain chemical element and vd is the total depth mm of bulk rainfall throughfall or stemflow for a given event the chemical flux of tf and sf beneath the canopy results from total atmospheric deposition and canopy exchange processes macinnis ng et al 2012 staelens et al 2008 the canopy budget model developed by ulrich 1983 was extensively used to determine net deposition and canopy exchange processes and can be written as follows 5 tf sf br dd ce 6 nr tf sf br dd ce where dd is the dry deposition ce source or sink of the canopy is the canopy exchange and nr is the net rainfall flux the flux of dry deposition was generally estimated based on the assumption that some tracer ions are not influenced by canopy exchange interactions staelens et al 2008 talkner et al 2010 na and so4 2 are often treated as tracer ions for estimating dry deposition of other solutes with the assumption that tracer ions in throughfall or stemflow maintain a balance during the canopy exchange process and hence the excess in throughfall and stemflow compared to that in rainfall is attributed to dry deposition gautam et al 2017 tonello et al 2021 in the present study the dry deposition of ca2 mg2 k and cl was calculated based on the dry deposition factor ddf from na as a tracer multiplying it by individual ions in the rainfall 7 dd i ddf na br i 8 ddf na tf na sf na br na br na where ddfna is the dry deposition factor for na and i is ca2 mg2 k and cl for estimating dry deposition of no3 and f so4 2 was used as a tracer in the following equations 9 dd j ddf so br j 10 ddf so tf so sf so br so br so where ddfso is the dry deposition factor for so4 2 and j is no3 and f canopy exchange ce for these ions can be then calculated as follows 11 ce t f s f b r d d a positive ce value means that canopy leaching cl of ion contributes to tf or sf flux whereas a negative ce value means canopy uptake of the ion 2 4 statistical analysis violin plots were generated using vioplot a software package adler and kelly 2018 within r statistical software r core team 2018 to show the proportions of throughfall stemflow and interception in bulk rainfall one way analysis of variance with tukey b test was carried out using ibm spss ver 22 0 spss inc chicago usa to test whether the three components differed significantly in terms of ion concentrations and enrichment ratios statistically significant differences were set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 rainfall partitioning a total of 72 rainfall events were recorded during the study period amounting to 1630 mm of rainfall the percentage of throughfall 76 45 and that of stemflow 8 06 in total rainfall was the highest and that of canopy interception 15 49 the lowest in r regia the share of interception was maximum 28 27 in f microcarpa with those of throughfall and stemflow being 68 04 and 3 69 respectively in l speciosa throughfall contributed 71 04 stemflow 2 99 and interception 25 97 the violin plot showed the general characteristics of the share of each component across all rainfall events fig 3 the proportion of throughfall in total rainfall ranged from 32 34 to 79 64 and that of stemflow from 0 45 to 11 54 with the median being the highest in r regia for both throughfall 72 6 and stemflow 8 68 the lowest for throughfall in f microcarpa 64 33 and the lowest for stemflow 1 32 in l speciosa with respect to interception f microcarpa 33 48 and l speciosa 30 54 showed high values of the median whereas r regia showed a very low value 17 74 both throughfall and stemflow especially the former and rainfall were significantly linearly and positively r 0 76 p 0 01 correlated to rainfall fig 4 3 2 concentrations of rainfall throughfall and stemflow the largest proportion in cations in bulk rainfall was that of k which accounted for 48 85 of the total annual mass of cations fig 5 followed by ca2 34 57 na 12 42 and mg2 4 17 among the anions no3 43 25 and so4 2 34 09 were the major components the ph values of throughfall and stemflow for all the three trees were all higher than the corresponding values of rainfall table 2 as were the concentrations of all the cations and anions except f the concentration of which was higher in rainfall the concentrations of some ions also differed significantly for example the average concentration of no3 in stemflow for l speciosa was 22 21 mg l 1 5 8 times that in bulk rainfall and in r regia the average concentration in throughfall was 1 6 times that in bulk rainfall 3 3 dry deposition and canopy exchange the dynamics of flux of the total ions fig 6 or of each individual ion figs s1 and s2 show that total throughfall stemflow ion flux was higher than that of rainfall the throughfall flux accounted for the major share of total net rainfall flux under the canopy event level net rainfall fluxes during the dry season september to march were higher than those during the wet april to august season during the experimental period the throughfall flux for each ion accounted for the majority of the bulk rainfall and dry deposition ranging from 62 62 to 220 72 table 3 in all the three species the fluxes of all cations in canopy exchange were greater than 0 and the relative contribution of canopy leaching to net rainfall together nr for these cations was greater than 24 07 and even as high as 77 38 81 42 for k fig 7 in the case of anions however the results varied with the species the annual cl flux of canopy exchange was 7 85 kg ha 1 in r regia and negative for the other two anions in f microcarpa the annual cl flux was 10 77 kg ha 1 and that of no3 was 9 49 kg ha 1 whereas that for the rest of the anions was negative in l speciosa the flux of almost all the anions was 0 that for no3 being 8 67 kg ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall partitioning and its effects on hydrochemical concentrations for the three tree species the median ratio of throughfall to rainfall was 64 33 72 60 and that of stemflow to rainfall was 1 32 8 68 the relative shares of the components throughfall stemflow and interception in total rainfall also varied greatly among individual rainfall events fig 3 these results are consistent with those of earlier studies on forests or other tree species worldwide macinnis ng et al 2012 sadeghi et al 2020 snelgrove et al 2020 zabret et al 2018 for example a latest global synthesis on rainfall partitioning 644 observations spanning broad climate and plant types globally by sadeghi et al 2020 reported that the median ratios of throughfall and stemflow to rainfall were 75 8 and 2 2 respectively for all observations and 77 and 1 for observations related to trees alone livesley et al 2014 evaluated the impacts of canopy density and bark type on rainfall portioning in two completely different eucalypts growing as avenue trees in cities and found that throughfall accounted for 55 2 71 4 of the rainfall and stemflow accounted for 1 5 to 1 8 during the experimental period in the present experiment the share of net rainfall including throughfall and stemflow in total rainfall in the case of r regia was larger than that in the case of the other two species palms generally have the largest shares of stemflow among tree species frangi and lugo 1985 germer et al 2012 mainly because their relatively sparse canopy fig 1 is less effective in intercepting rainfall and allows more of it to pass through levia et al 2019 livesley et al 2014 however r regia had significantly higher canopy height to width ratio p 0 01 table 1 and a smoother bark than the other two tree species fig 1 and table 1 higher height to width ratios usually mean more steeply inclined branches which act as a funnel and favour stemflow sadeghi et al 2020 the smoother bark also facilitates stemflow greatly because of its lower capacity to absorb or store moisture levia and germer 2015 livesley et al 2014 the concentration of almost all the ions except f in throughfall and stemflow especially in the latter from all the three species was higher than that in rainfall table 2 indicating that their ability to enrich the rainwater chemistry was comparable to that of other plants gautam et al 2017 sun et al 2021 tonello et al 2021 changes in the chemical composition of rainwater passing through the canopy are determined mainly by three factors wash off from dry depositions captured by foliage and bark canopy exchange processes such as uptake or leaching and transformation e g biological nitrification adriaenssens et al 2012 guerrieri et al 2015 ignatova and dambrine 2000 lu et al 2020 van stan and pypker 2015 this enrichment of throughfall or stemflow was therefore greater than the effects of uptake or transformation by plants moreover the ph of throughfall and stemflow was slightly but not significantly higher than that of rainfall table 2 suggesting that the rainwater had not been rendered significantly acidic because of the interaction with the canopy of these three species 4 2 hydrochemical flux and canopy exchange process the solute fluxes in throughfall were approximately 5 fold to 39 fold of the fluxes in stemflow table 3 primarily because of the higher volumes per unit area of throughfall although the concentrations of ions in stemflow were typically higher these differences could also be demonstrated from the results of the dynamics of ions flux in individual rainfall events which indicated that the ion flux in throughfall dominated the ion flux in rainwater in each rainfall event fig 6 figs s1 and s2 the fluxes of ca2 k no3 and so4 2 in tf and sf were relatively greater than those of other ions a finding similar to the findings of other studies of tropical ecosystems shen et al 2013 su et al 2019 sun et al 2021 moreover fluxes of all base cations except na in canopy exchange were positive table 3 indicating leaching when those ions pass through the canopy which too is consistent with the observations from various forest types it was found that the canopy exchange flux of k and its relative contribution to nr were the highest across all three species table 3 and fig 7 indicating strong k leaching from canopy similar results have also been reported from various regions or ecosystems gautam et al 2017 lin et al 2001 tonello et al 2021 zhang et al 2007 for instance shen et al 2013 reported that k accounted for nearly 97 of canopy exchange flux in two subtropical plantation forests at a site in southern china about 70 km from our study site sun et al 2021 found that in canopy exchange k was the dominant component accounting for more than 68 of nr in a subtropical broad leaved forest in south eastern china a reasonable explanation is that k is usually considered highly soluble substance due to its weak bonding and is easily leached from plant tissue berger et al 2008 parker 1983 zhang et al 2007 in addition although the relative contribution of canopy leaching to nr with respect to mg2 was high except r regia fig 7 the flux values of canopy exchange were relatively low table 3 probably because of their low concentrations in rainfall itself fig 5 canopy exchange processes for anions were more complex than those for cations in r regia and l speciosa the flux values of canopy exchange in anions except cl in r regia were almost all negative indicating that a significant portion was absorbed or retained by foliage table 3 fig 8 this retention meant that the flux of these anions particularly of no3 was decreased in passing through the canopy to the soil surface as reported earlier dezzeo and chac√≥n 2006 ma≈Çek and astel 2008 ponette gonz√°lez et al 2017 su et al 2019 fenn et al 2013 estimated that approximately 90 of the wet deposited no3 was retained by the canopy especially during winter ke et al 2020 suggested that more than 40 of the deposited nitrogen oxides were absorbed by the canopy in a subtropical forest in south eastern china the following possible mechanisms have been proposed for this uptake or retention of nutrients by the canopy foliage epiphytic lichens or uptake by bryophytes absorption by the bark and microbial assimilation fenn et al 2013 van stan and pypker 2015 lagerstroemia speciosa has dense twigs and very rough bark fig 1 and table 1 which increase the capacity of the species to retain nutrients thereby facilitating diffusion exchange and uptake which are helped even more because of the larger surface area and greater capacity to store water adriaenssens et al 2012 the possible reason for uptake of anions by r regia is the high wettability of its foliage which promotes their absorption fenn et al 2013 therefore l speciosa and r regia may prove particularly helpful in controlling no3 deposition which is of increasing concern now and in the future in china yu et al 2019 conversely in f microcarpa the flux values of cl and no3 in canopy exchange were positive table 3 suggesting canopy leaching from foliage twigs and the trunk a number of observations have also been reported that atmospheric n or cl deposition fluxes are enhanced as a result of passing through the canopy berger et al 2008 tonello et al 2021 van stan and pypker 2015 we speculate that the explanation lies in the unique structure of aerial roots in f microcarpa which are highly porous and therefore promote leaching from the canopy ouyang and kuo 2006 van stan and pypker 2015 although several studies have reported that the aerial roots of f microcarpa can absorb heavy metals thus removing them from the solution li et al 2019 liu et al 2012 stemflow is often neglected in examining the interaction between urban forests and precipitation and the related chemical changes because stemflow is believed to contribute only a small fraction of the total fluxes of water and nutrients chen et al 2019 levia and germer 2015 however our results indicate that the chemical composition of stemflow is notably enriched probably because of its longer residence time on the tree surface especially its prolonged contact with the bark van stan et al 2021 stemflow is thus an important pathway in nutrient cycling siegert et al 2017 and can even be considered a hot spot because stemflow delivers a substantial flux of water and nutrients along preferential flow paths li et al 2009 schw√§rzel et al 2012 for example several studies have reported that modest amounts of stemflow as a proportion of gross rainfall can be sufficiently enriched to account for a significant portion 10 50 of the total ionic macronutrient flux bellot and escarre 1991 berger et al 2009 dezzeo and chac√≥n 2006 dovey et al 2011 germer et al 2012 oziegbe et al 2011 this also appears to be the case for other compounds delivered by stemflow van stan et al 2017 reported that stemflow was particularly rich in dissolved organic matter dom supplying massive carbon fluxes over short periods to local soils furthermore precipitation regimes around the world have changed significantly as part of the ongoing global climate change a part of those changes being the increased frequency of extreme precipitation events ipcc 2014 in the subtropics the dry season is also expected to be drier and longer and the wet season wetter and with more frequent and more intense rainstorms zhou et al 2013 dry deposition may therefore increase because of the longer dry periods between two storm events and stemflow may be facilitated because of the more intense rainstorms these changes in climate might significantly alter the nutrient and hydrochemical cycle in urban forest ecosystems and are particularly important in urban ecosystems because many harmful elements such as heavy metals are more concentrated in both dry and wet depositions tan et al 2019 which deserve further study therefore trees for urban greening should be chosen on the basis of not only aesthetics and safety but also their hydrological and hydrochemical effects although it is easy enough based on the canopy budget model to estimate the main contribution of dry deposition canopy leaching or dry deposition exceeding canopy uptake to the increasing flux of throughfall and stemflow this approach also has several uncertainties due to the assumption that tracer ions are leached only in negligible amounts through the canopy gautam et al 2017 staelens et al 2008 talkner et al 2010 despite this assumption and the limitations of this approach the canopy budget model can provide valuable information for identifying and quantifying the main sources of nr fluxes sun et al 2021 5 conclusions this study investigated the partitioning of rainfall by the canopy of three common subtropical tree species in urban china and the effects of such partitioning on solute concentrations and fluxes of net rainfall the species a palm roystonea regia a tree with aerial roots ficus microcarpa and a common ornamental tree lagerstroemia speciosa differed significantly in the relative proportions of different components of rainfall throughfall stemflow and interception because of the differences in the tree morphology the shares of throughfall 72 6 and stemflow 8 7 were higher in the palm whereas the share of interception 30 was higher in the other two species concentrations of most ionic solutes in throughfall and stemflow were higher than those in rainfall particularly in stemflow the contributions of dry deposition and canopy exchange were estimated with a canopy budget model canopy exchange was positive for all the base cations especially for k indicating significant leaching from the trees whereas the anions showed great variability canopy exchange was negative for most anions in r regia and l speciosa because of the greater uptake of anions by those two species whereas f microcarpa showed significant leaching of no3 probably because of its unique aerial roots suggesting that f microcarpa will be less useful than the other two species in controlling the deposition of no3 based on these results l speciosa seems effective in intercepting rainwater and in lowering the deposits of n in this region suffering from significant acid deposition a finding that will prove useful in selecting appropriate tree species for urban greening in similar subtropical regions worldwide credit authorship

3969,urban rainfall runoff prediction is an effective method for flood mitigation however it is difficult to realize real time and accurate prediction due to the strong nonlinearity and fluctuation of urban rainfall this study develops a data driven model by integrating singular spectrum analysis ssa and a light gradient boosting machine lightgbm to achieve the high accuracy real time prediction of regional urban runoff first ssa decomposes and reconstructs runoff series into trend terms fluctuating terms and noise components then a lightgbm is used to simulate the trend and fluctuating terms finally a comparative analysis of the performance of the ssa lightgbm model under different time steps and prediction lead times is performed and the peak prediction accuracy of the ssa lightgbm model under independent rainfall runoff events is investigated evaluation results show that the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of the ssa lightgbm model remains greater than 0 9 and the error of the peak discharge is within 18 which significantly outperforms the lightgbm and long short term memory lstm models under different conditions moreover the computation time of the ssa lightgbm model 10 000 s is much shorter than that of the lstm model 301 128 s which can meet the calculation time requirement of real time updating model and prediction overall the ssa lightgbm model is suitable for urban rainfall runoff real time prediction with low computation time and high accuracy keywords data driven model singular spectrum analysis light gradient boosting machine real time forecast urban flooding 1 introduction recently climate change has increased extreme rainfall making urban flood control more difficult li et al 2020 given the strong nonlinearity and fluctuation of the rainfall runoff relationship developing an urban rainfall runoff model with rapid response and accurate prediction has always been a crucial and difficult problem over the past decades a large number of runoff prediction models have been proposed and improved these models can be divided into physical models elwell 1990 kim et al 2019 tobio et al 2015 wan and konyha 2015 xie et al 2020 and data driven models gessang and lasminto 2020 ha et al 2021 nuttal et al 2021 reddy et al 2021 salas and markus 2000 zuo et al 2020 physical models have outstanding interpretability which helps to clarify the fundamental physical process of hydrological prediction however as modeling conditions are subject to various complex factors such as surface conditions and air temperature tikhamarine et al 2020 the prediction performances of these models are often unstable necessitating a time consuming solution process yoon et al 2011 comparatively data driven models which can build a direct mapping relationship between rainfall and runoff without the need to understand the physical process are more extensively used than physical models bruen and yang 2006 chang et al 2014 deep learning models belong to a typical data driven category and have received more attention in recent years for example recurrent neural networks rnns are one of the most commonly used models in hydrology because they are extremely adept at handling time series data rangapuram 2018 zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 however the prediction accuracy of rnns is still far from satisfactory due to the gradient disappearance and gradient explosion problems in network training engineering on this basis long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 effectively alleviates this problem by improving the hidden layer structure and setting the threshold operation because of its ability to analyze the internal relationship of long term time series data lstm has been widely used in rainfall runoff forecasting li et al 2021 ouma et al 2021 yin et al 2021 however lstm needs a large number of matrix calculations and sufficient iterations to ensure the minimum training error when processing a large amount of runoff monitoring data the training cost of an lstm model for real time urban rainfall runoff prediction inevitably increases as the training time increases joksas et al 2020 meanwhile noise in urban rainfall runoff data reduces the prediction accuracy of the model hindering accurate and real time predictions furthermore lstm requires memory capacity to update the cell states by inputs and previous states however neural networks are not good at storing information making them unable to handle long term dependencies yu et al 2019 in contrast ensemble learning models such as a light gradient boosting machine lightgbm ke et al 2017 have more advantages on this issue as one of the best and most commonly used algorithms a lightgbm has been widely employed in medical kopitar et al 2020 financial chen et al 2020 engineering yan et al 2020 and other fields ma et al 2018 tan et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a this algorithm is an optimized form of xgboost which has the characteristics of high precision fast convergence small memory consumption and friendly cache optimization in particular it achieves good performance when processing large scale data liang et al 2020 besides lightgbm uses a histogram algorithm and gradient based one side sampling to reduce memory occupancy it also supports efficient parallel training which significantly reduces the computational time in model training and testing while ensuring good performance however the unsatisfactory processing effect for strongly nonlinear time series data limits the application of a lightgbm in the real time prediction of urban rainfall runoff based on runoff monitoring systems singular spectral analysis ssa colebrook 1978 is an advanced time frequency analysis method which can extract trend terms fluctuating terms and noise components from a data sequence and has been widely used in the preprocessing of hydrological data golyandina and korobeynikov 2014 wu and chau 2011 proved that ssa could significantly improve prediction performance and reduce the lag effect of artificial neural networks anns wu et al 2010 found that compared with moving average and principal component analysis an ann model with data preprocessed by ssa exhibited the best runoff prediction effect the above research motivated this study this study proposes a novel ssa lightgbm model which overcomes the sensitivity of a lightgbm to change in high resolution data and improves the accuracy in simulating strongly nonlinear time series data to realize the real time prediction of urban rainfall runoff first a runoff sequence is decomposed and reconstructed by ssa next the reconstructed sequence is simulated using a lightgbm to evaluate the practical application performance of the ssa lightgbm model the model is applied to the urban rainfall runoff prediction simulation of a certain area in yuelai new city liangjiang new district chongqing and compared with lightgbm and lstm models 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 yuelai new city is located in liangjiang new district of chongqing in southwest china with an elevation between 175 0 and 376 2 m the terrain is richly varied because of wind erosion and gravity with longitudinal slope degrees ranging from 0 3 to 8 0 area rainfall mainly occurs during the flood season which lasts from may to september and accounts for approximately 70 of the annual rainfall with an average annual precipitation of 1107 1 mm in this study an independent sub basin covering an area of 3 44 km2 in yuelai new city is the study area 2 2 observational data available data for the case study includes runoff data from the jl279 runoff monitoring site and rainfall data from the a6412 meteorological monitoring site january 2018 to december 2019 fig 1 these data were collected automatically by chongqing yuelai sponge city monitoring and information platform with a sampling period of 5 min and then 6 h was taken as the minimum inter event time to divide the rainfall time series data into rainfall events huff 1967 wang et al 2016 considering that the small rain intensity will not cause a severe impact on urban waterlogging 39 independent rainfall events with single rainfall precipitation not less than 10 mm were screened out based on this runoff time series data corresponding to rainfall events was divided into runoff events and 39 runoff events were generated with complete data records 33 runoff events 6 600 datasets were taken as the training set and six typical runoff events 1 200 datasets as the test set the training data were used to adjust the weight and deviation of the developed model and the test data were used to verify the model s performance 3 methodologies 3 1 lstm lstm is a variant of the recurrent neural network with memory structures for learning long term information an et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 lstm uses a specific unit called the cell state c t to store information and the rest of the structure also includes forget gate f t input gate i t and output gate o t equations related to lstm cell are as follows i the forget gate f t uses the sigmoid function to determine what information will be discarded from the previous cell state c t 1 thus avoiding the information explosion problems 1 f t œÉ w f h t 1 x t b f where œÉ is the logistic sigmoid function with values ranging from 0 to 1 indicating the forgotten degree h t 1 is the antecedent output vector w f and b f are the network weight matrix and bias vector respectively ii the input gate i t determines what information will be updated and stored in the potential cell state c t 2 i t œÉ w i h t 1 x t b i where w i and b i are trainable parameters defined for the input gate a potential update vector of cell state c t can be expressed as 3 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c where w c and b c are the input weight matrix and bias vector for the potential cell state respectively iii the current cell state c t can be update by element wise multiplication 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c t iv the output gate o t specifies which information will be used as output 5 o t œÉ w o h t 1 x t b o where w o and b o are the output weight matrix

transformation theory which can easily extract trend information from original time series data and separate real noise components thereby effectively improving the prediction accuracy elsner and tsonis 1996 golyandina et al 2001 the core idea of ssa is to decompose the original time series into a set of sub series including trend items period items fluctuation items and noise the main steps of ssa include embedding singular value decomposition svd and reconstruction 3 2 1 embedding embedding operation transforms time series into a trajectory matrix in this step the one dimensional original time series x n x 1 x 2 x n with a length of n is first segmented according to an appropriate window length m and then converted into k lag variables of length m finally a trajectory matrix x is constructed in the form of hankel elsner and tsonis 1996 7 x x 1 x 2 x n x 1 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 3 x 4 x 5 x k x k 1 x k 2 x m x m 1 x m 2 x k m 1 where k n m 1 the window length m is the only parameter that depends on the actual situation and a priori information about the target component with a value range of less than n 3 baratta et al 2003 3 2 2 svd similar to the diagonalization of real symmetric matrices conventional matrices can also be decomposed using an analogy method that is svd svd is usually used to decompose an original sequence and extract singular values containing the independent information about the original sequence the eigenvalues and eigenvectors generated by the decomposition are called singular values and singular value vectors specifically when u and v are taken as the left and right singular value vectors of matrix x and œÉ is the singular value the form of the trajectory matrix x is as follows 8 x u œÉ v t the square matrix c x x t m m can be obtained on the basis of the trajectory matrix x 9 c x x t u œÉ v t v œÉ t u t u œÉ œÉ t u t u œÉ 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 œÉ l 2 u t where x t represents the transpose of matrix x and œÉ 1 œÉ 2 œÉ l l m are the non zero eigenvalues of matrix c from eq 9 it can be deduced that œÉ d i a g œÉ 1 œÉ 2 œÉ l œÉ 1 œÉ 2 0 œÉ l and set œÉ 1 œÉ 2 œÉ i i 1 2 l is a singular spectrum afterward the trajectory matrix x can be expressed as 10 x u œÉ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 œÉ l v t the right singular value vector can be expressed as v i x t u i œÉ i i 1 l as a result the trajectory matrix x can be written as the sum of orthogonal elementary matrices 11 x x 1 x 2 x l where x i œÉ i u i v i t 3 2 3 reconstruction reconstruction is the process of regrouping decomposed sequences and constructing new matrices including grouping and diagonalization averaging alharbi and hassani 2016 grouping extracts trend periodic and disordered noise components using appropriate methods specifically the index set 1 2 l can be divided into p disjoint subsets i e i 1 i 2 i p and accordingly the elementary matrix x in eq 11 is split into p groups making i i 1 i 2 i m m 1 2 p the corresponding composite matrix x of the i groups is defined as x i x i 1 x i 2 x i p x i can be further substituted into eq 11 to obtain the following matrix 12 x x i 1 x i 2 x i p noise components can be eliminated by setting the singular value of the corresponding matrix of set id i p d p to 0 accordingly the new trajectory matrix z can be calculated as 13 z i 1 i d x i x i 1 x i 2 x i d the purpose of diagonalization averaging is to restore the new trajectory matrix z to a sequence with a growth degree of n the matrix z is transformed into y 1 y 2 y n by eq 14 where m m i n m n n m a x m n and n m n 1 14 y k 1 k p 1 k y p k p 1 1 k m 1 m p 1 m y p k p 1 m k n 1 n k 1 p k n 1 n n 1 y p k p 1 n k n according to eq 14 a single rct component of length n can be obtained the new x component is the sum of d rct component namely x rc

speed computational efficiency prediction accuracy and other aspects making it particularly suitable for classification prediction and other big data problems a lightgbm uses a histogram based algorithm to discretize continuous eigenvalues into s small bins in a floating point format and uses these bins to construct a histogram with a width of s fig 3 since the histogram does not need to store pre sorted results it can find the optimal segmentation point during feature segmentation according to the cumulative statistics of each discrete value thereby effectively reducing memory consumption and computation time zeng et al 2019 based on the histogram algorithm the lightgbm further uses the strategy of leaf growth with depth limitation removing the horizontal leaf growth strategy used by gbdt fig 4 shows the level wise and leaf wise growth strategies the level wise growth strategy fig 4a enables the leaves of the same layer to split simultaneously as the decision tree grows indicating that the strategy supports multi threaded optimization furthermore the number of leaves splitting in the same layer is identical but the information gain is different liang et al 2020 processing leaves with low information gain has little effect on prediction accuracy improvement while significantly increasing memory consumption on the other hand the leaf wise growth strategy fig 4b allows only leaves with the largest information gain to be segmented thereby effectively improving separation efficiency however this will also lead to a tree structure that is too deep so a strategy of limiting maximum depth should be implemented during tree growth a lightgbm has reliable theoretical support for efficient parallel operation and effective extraction of data features which provides application potential for real time prediction of urban rainfall runoff 3 4 ssa lightgbm a schematic flowchart of the ssa lightgbm model developed in this study is shown in fig 5 first ssa is used to decompose and reconstruct runoff series into subsequent rc d and noise components are separated and removed the percentage of the eigenvalues of d component to the total eigenvalue is the contribution of the component that is œÉ d i 1 d œÉ i second components are sorted according to their contribution value rc 1 rc 2 rc d to further highlight the trend characteristics of runoff make the model capture the runoff trend more accurately and retain sequence information to the maximum extent we divide the sub series into two parts and reconstruct them into trend features and periodicity features rc 1 rc j and rc j 1 rc d j d lastly the lightgbm simulates two components with different characteristics and provides different weights to the simulation results for integration making the model more specific and sensitive 3 5 evaluation of model performance in this paper we use the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae the error of peak discharge eq and the model calculation time t to evaluate the model s performance these evaluation methods are defined as follows 15 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 17 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i 18 eq y p y p y p 100 where y i m3 s and y i m3 s are the real and predicted urban runoff data respectively and y p m3 s and y p m3 s are the real and predicted peak urban runoff data respectively y m3 s is the average of real runoff and n represents the number of observations nse is an efficiency indicator for assessing the difference between the predicted and observed values with a value range of 1 the larger the nse value within this range the closer the simulated value is to the measured value the rmse reflects the errors between the predicted and observed runoff values which can evaluate the spread of the predicted errors and directly reflect the accuracy of the simulated results the mae is the average of the absolute errors and it shows the degree of agreement between predictions and observations the eq value represents the accuracy of the peak runoff prediction and t is the time required by the model for the calculation process the less time the model takes the more practical it is 3 6 software and hyperparameters in this study python 3 6 is used for data preprocessing and modeling the lightgbm packages are used to implement the lightgbm the lstm model is developed on the keras development platform of google tensorflow the tree structured parzen estimator bergstra et al 2011 is used to optimize some hyperparameters of the above models including lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm the optimization of each model hyperparameter obtained by 200 iterations is described in tables 1 3 4 results and discussion the 39 runoff events used in this paper are automatically acquired by chongqing yuelai sponge city monitoring information platform and numbered sequentially i e event 1 event 2 event 39 in section 4 1 we decompose and reconstruct rainfall runoff series by ssa in section 4 2 the influences of different time steps on the performance of the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models are analyzed in section 4 3 we explore the performance of the above three models in different prediction lead times with the optimal time step in section 4 4 the performance of the ssa lightgbm model under individual rainfall runoff events is studied 4 1 decomposing rainfall runoff data by ssa figs 6 and 7 show the decomposed and reconstructed rainfall runoff data using ssa respectively the runoff sequence was decomposed into 15 components by setting the window length to 15 the first 12 components with a contribution rate of 96 1 are selected as the main useful information i e rc 1 rc 12 which meets the requirements of reproducing urban rainfall runoff trends li et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 6 the amplitude of the rc 1 rc 12 components derived by ssa decreases rc 1 component contains the dominant information of runoff data clearly showing the irregular change trend of urban rainfall runoff data with an increase of the subscript value the noise in the component gradually increases rc 1 rc j and rc j 1 rc 12 are reconstructed into the main trend terms and fluctuating terms respectively the value of j is determined by testing to be 5 as demonstrated in fig 7 the trend runoff series are more prominent after reconstruction indicating that ssa can effectively extract the trend and fluctuating component and remove noise components while obtaining the main runoff series features 4 2 evaluation of model performance with different time steps the models performance varies with different time steps this section explores the single step prediction performance of the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models with different time steps 5 10 15 20 and 25 min which are reflected by four evaluation indicators including t nse rmse and mae to determine the optimal time step of the models considering that the randomness of initialization variables may lead to fluctuations in the process each model is repeatedly run three times under the same conditions it is of great significance for real time prediction to reduce the computing time required by the models in training and testing berkhahn et al 2019 fig 8 a shows that the lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models have an advantage over the lstm model in terms of the computation time in the training and testing processes furthermore there is no obvious relationship between the computation time and time steps as illustrated in fig 8b the nse coefficient of the lightgbm model is the same as that of the lstm model whereas the nse coefficient of the ssa lightgbm model is significantly better than that of both indicating that the ssa lightgbm model has a good performance in rainfall runoff prediction this may be because ssa decomposes and reconstructs rainfall runoff series and separates the trend and fluctuation sequences of the model thereby enabling the model to obtain more relevant features when the time step is 5 min the lstm model has the highest prediction accuracy with an nse coefficient of 0 879 as the time step increases the nse coefficient of the lstm model first decreases and then tends to be stable this may be because the 33 runoff events used in this study are independent of each other and the increase in the time step increases the redundant information obtained by the model although the lstm model has the ability of long term memory it cannot counteract this effect similarly for the lightgbm model the best predictive performance nse 0 875 is achieved when the time step is 5 min in contrast the quality of its prediction decreases gradually with the increase in the time step different from the lstm and lightgbm models the prediction accuracy of the ssa lightgbm model gradually improved with the time step increasing from 5 to 15 min and the nse value of the ssa lightgbm model reached the maximum value of 0 951 when the time step was 15 min this can be explained as an increase in the time step enhances the effective information available to the model thereby significantly improving prediction accuracy notably when the time step is greater than 15 min the nse of the ssa lightgbm model is no longer improved which may be attributed to the redundant information from the model s significant training time step fig 8c and fig 8d show the variation trend of rmse and mae parameters in the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models with different time steps consistent with nse based on these results the simulation accuracy of the lstm and lightgbm model is higher under the condition of a smaller time step in contrast the simulation performance of the ssa lightgbm model is better with a specific time step 4 3 performance comparison of models in this section the performance of the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models is compared at optimal time steps fig 8 provides the optimal time steps of the three models the optimal time step of the lstm and lightgbm models is 5 min and that of the ssa lightgbm model is 15 min table 4 illustrates the evaluation metrics of the above three models when the prediction lead time ranges from 5 to 30 min 5 min for lead time the results demonstrate that the performance of the lightgbm and lstm models is the identical under the same prediction lead time when the prediction lead time is 5 min the nse coefficients of both models reach the maximum value whereas the performance of the two models tends to decline when the prediction lead time continues to increase on the one hand this may be due to the lack of future runoff information in the multi step prediction of the models on the other hand the continuous accumulation of prediction errors can also lead to a decline in prediction performance besides the nse coefficient of the lightgbm model decreases more than that of the lstm model this can be ascribed to the long term memory capability of the lstm model which can transfer the output vector of the previous unit as the input vector to the next unit thereby enabling the lstm model to reuse valid historical information therefore the lstm model has a better effect on multi step prediction than the lightgbm model similarly the performance of the ssa lightgbm model gradually decreases as the prediction lead time increases since the prediction of rainfall runoff needs more effective information on future runoff nevertheless note that the prediction accuracy of the ssa lightgbm model is significantly higher than that of the lstm and lightgbm models under the same prediction lead time table 4 when the prediction lead time is 5 min on the one hand the nse coefficient of the ssa lightgbm model reaches the maximum value of 0 951 which is 10 1 higher than that of the lstm model and the ssa lightgbm model decreases the rmse and mae values by 40 2 and 37 0 respectively on the other hand compared with the lightgbm model the ssa lightgbm model reduces the rmse and mae values by 38 9 and 42 7 respectively and increases the nse coefficient by 9 4 the above observation indicates that the addition of ssa addresses the shortcomings of the lightgbm model when processing strongly nonlinear time series data making the ssa lightgbm model less susceptible to the interference of redundant information thus the ssa lightgbm model can achieve the best performance under different lead times in addition a sufficiently short calculation time is also a fundamental requirement for real time prediction as displayed in table 4 the average computing time of the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models in the training and prediction process is 301 128 0 232 and 10 000 s respectively cp redmibook 14 8 512 gb memory the lstm model requires more computation time for training network and prediction mainly due to the complex recursive structure of the model and the first order training characteristic of the optimizer the lightgbm model uses the histogram algorithm to find the optimal segmentation point instead of storing the pre sorted results significantly reducing the calculation time compared with the lightgbm model the ssa lightgbm model increases the calculation time by 9 768 s on average for the ssa decomposition and reconstruction of runoff data although the ssa lightgbm model requires more computing time than the lightgbm model in model training and testing the value is still within the acceptable range berkhahn et al 2019 4 4 prediction of single runoff events by different models the observation and simulation of the three models lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm for the six independent runoff events used in the test with a prediction lead time of 15 min are shown in fig 9 the three models perform well in single peak and bimodal runoff events event 36 39 with nse coefficients ranging from 0 924 and 0 975 while the accuracy in multipeak runoff events event 34 and event 35 is slightly worse this might be attributable to the lack of data patterns for multipeak runoff events in the data used for training failing to extract similar features effectively to address this question we suggest that integrated runoff patterns including single peak bimodal and multipeak runoff events should be collected in the general off line simulation and prediction to improve the model s robustness in rainfall runoff prediction notably the ssa lightgbm model has fewer abnormal fluctuations than the lstm and lightgbm models indicating that the ssa lightgbm performs better in independent runoff events meanwhile the real time prediction system can train new runoff datasets and enrich and improve the adaptability and robustness of the model during the operation of the system in the future furthermore the scatter plots of the simulation vs observation of training and prediction periods by the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models with different prediction lead time 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 min are presented in fig 10 the scatter distribution of the ssa lightgbm is more compact than that of the lstm and lightgbm models suggesting that the predicted value of the ssa lightgbm model is closer to the observed value the r2 values by linear regression equation fitting reinforce the fact that the ssa lightgbm model has better performance than the other two models accurately peak runoff forecasting using a runoff model is critical in realizing timely flood warnings table 5 shows the eq in independent runoff events by the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models under prediction lead times of 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 min the range of the eq values for the three models under a prediction lead time of 5 min are as follows lstm 6 247 68 897 lightgbm 15 445 66 267 and ssa lightgbm 0 252 6 677 in addition the average eq of the ssa lightgbm model under prediction lead times of 5 30 min are 2 479 4 832 6 533 7 477 7 492 and 7 510 respectively the results clearly indicate that the ssa lightgbm model provides the most accurate prediction of peak runoff 5 conclusion to realize the real time prediction of urban rainfall runoff and improve the performance of nonlinear sequence simulation an ssa lightgbm model is established in this study which integrates ssa and a lightgbm to verify the performance of the ssa lightgbm model the model is applied to the yuelai rainfall runoff time series and compared with the lightgbm and lstm models this study s conclusions are as follows 1 ssa can effectively separate trend terms fluctuating terms and noise components overcoming the shortcoming of the lightgbm model in processing nonlinear sequence thus the ssa lightgbm model which is built on this basis has stronger specificity and robustness 2 the performance of the ssa lightgbm model has a good prediction at a specific time step and the optimal time step value should be determined through experiments in practical applications the simulation accuracy of the ssa lightgbm model is significantly better than that of the lightgbm and lstm models under the optimal time step overcoming the shortcomings of the lightgbm and lstm models in a simulation of urban rainfall runoff series 3 the average computation time required by the ssa lightgbm model is less than 10 s which is only 1 30th of that of the lstm model the total operation time of the ssa lightgbm model can fully meet the calculation time requirements for real time prediction credit authorship contribution statement zhongjie cui methodology conceptualization formal analysis writing original

3969,urban rainfall runoff prediction is an effective method for flood mitigation however it is difficult to realize real time and accurate prediction due to the strong nonlinearity and fluctuation of urban rainfall this study develops a data driven model by integrating singular spectrum analysis ssa and a light gradient boosting machine lightgbm to achieve the high accuracy real time prediction of regional urban runoff first ssa decomposes and reconstructs runoff series into trend terms fluctuating terms and noise components then a lightgbm is used to simulate the trend and fluctuating terms finally a comparative analysis of the performance of the ssa lightgbm model under different time steps and prediction lead times is performed and the peak prediction accuracy of the ssa lightgbm model under independent rainfall runoff events is investigated evaluation results show that the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of the ssa lightgbm model remains greater than 0 9 and the error of the peak discharge is within 18 which significantly outperforms the lightgbm and long short term memory lstm models under different conditions moreover the computation time of the ssa lightgbm model 10 000 s is much shorter than that of the lstm model 301 128 s which can meet the calculation time requirement of real time updating model and prediction overall the ssa lightgbm model is suitable for urban rainfall runoff real time prediction with low computation time and high accuracy keywords data driven model singular spectrum analysis light gradient boosting machine real time forecast urban flooding 1 introduction recently climate change has increased extreme rainfall making urban flood control more difficult li et al 2020 given the strong nonlinearity and fluctuation of the rainfall runoff relationship developing an urban rainfall runoff model with rapid response and accurate prediction has always been a crucial and difficult problem over the past decades a large number of runoff prediction models have been proposed and improved these models can be divided into physical models elwell 1990 kim et al 2019 tobio et al 2015 wan and konyha 2015 xie et al 2020 and data driven models gessang and lasminto 2020 ha et al 2021 nuttal et al 2021 reddy et al 2021 salas and markus 2000 zuo et al 2020 physical models have outstanding interpretability which helps to clarify the fundamental physical process of hydrological prediction however as modeling conditions are subject to various complex factors such as surface conditions and air temperature tikhamarine et al 2020 the prediction performances of these models are often unstable necessitating a time consuming solution process yoon et al 2011 comparatively data driven models which can build a direct mapping relationship between rainfall and runoff without the need to understand the physical process are more extensively used than physical models bruen and yang 2006 chang et al 2014 deep learning models belong to a typical data driven category and have received more attention in recent years for example recurrent neural networks rnns are one of the most commonly used models in hydrology because they are extremely adept at handling time series data rangapuram 2018 zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 however the prediction accuracy of rnns is still far from satisfactory due to the gradient disappearance and gradient explosion problems in network training engineering on this basis long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 effectively alleviates this problem by improving the hidden layer structure and setting the threshold operation because of its ability to analyze the internal relationship of long term time series data lstm has been widely used in rainfall runoff forecasting li et al 2021 ouma et al 2021 yin et al 2021 however lstm needs a large number of matrix calculations and sufficient iterations to ensure the minimum training error when processing a large amount of runoff monitoring data the training cost of an lstm model for real time urban rainfall runoff prediction inevitably increases as the training time increases joksas et al 2020 meanwhile noise in urban rainfall runoff data reduces the prediction accuracy of the model hindering accurate and real time predictions furthermore lstm requires memory capacity to update the cell states by inputs and previous states however neural networks are not good at storing information making them unable to handle long term dependencies yu et al 2019 in contrast ensemble learning models such as a light gradient boosting machine lightgbm ke et al 2017 have more advantages on this issue as one of the best and most commonly used algorithms a lightgbm has been widely employed in medical kopitar et al 2020 financial chen et al 2020 engineering yan et al 2020 and other fields ma et al 2018 tan et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a this algorithm is an optimized form of xgboost which has the characteristics of high precision fast convergence small memory consumption and friendly cache optimization in particular it achieves good performance when processing large scale data liang et al 2020 besides lightgbm uses a histogram algorithm and gradient based one side sampling to reduce memory occupancy it also supports efficient parallel training which significantly reduces the computational time in model training and testing while ensuring good performance however the unsatisfactory processing effect for strongly nonlinear time series data limits the application of a lightgbm in the real time prediction of urban rainfall runoff based on runoff monitoring systems singular spectral analysis ssa colebrook 1978 is an advanced time frequency analysis method which can extract trend terms fluctuating terms and noise components from a data sequence and has been widely used in the preprocessing of hydrological data golyandina and korobeynikov 2014 wu and chau 2011 proved that ssa could significantly improve prediction performance and reduce the lag effect of artificial neural networks anns wu et al 2010 found that compared with moving average and principal component analysis an ann model with data preprocessed by ssa exhibited the best runoff prediction effect the above research motivated this study this study proposes a novel ssa lightgbm model which overcomes the sensitivity of a lightgbm to change in high resolution data and improves the accuracy in simulating strongly nonlinear time series data to realize the real time prediction of urban rainfall runoff first a runoff sequence is decomposed and reconstructed by ssa next the reconstructed sequence is simulated using a lightgbm to evaluate the practical application performance of the ssa lightgbm model the model is applied to the urban rainfall runoff prediction simulation of a certain area in yuelai new city liangjiang new district chongqing and compared with lightgbm and lstm models 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 yuelai new city is located in liangjiang new district of chongqing in southwest china with an elevation between 175 0 and 376 2 m the terrain is richly varied because of wind erosion and gravity with longitudinal slope degrees ranging from 0 3 to 8 0 area rainfall mainly occurs during the flood season which lasts from may to september and accounts for approximately 70 of the annual rainfall with an average annual precipitation of 1107 1 mm in this study an independent sub basin covering an area of 3 44 km2 in yuelai new city is the study area 2 2 observational data available data for the case study includes runoff data from the jl279 runoff monitoring site and rainfall data from the a6412 meteorological monitoring site january 2018 to december 2019 fig 1 these data were collected automatically by chongqing yuelai sponge city monitoring and information platform with a sampling period of 5 min and then 6 h was taken as the minimum inter event time to divide the rainfall time series data into rainfall events huff 1967 wang et al 2016 considering that the small rain intensity will not cause a severe impact on urban waterlogging 39 independent rainfall events with single rainfall precipitation not less than 10 mm were screened out based on this runoff time series data corresponding to rainfall events was divided into runoff events and 39 runoff events were generated with complete data records 33 runoff events 6 600 datasets were taken as the training set and six typical runoff events 1 200 datasets as the test set the training data were used to adjust the weight and deviation of the developed model and the test data were used to verify the model s performance 3 methodologies 3 1 lstm lstm is a variant of the recurrent neural network with memory structures for learning long term information an et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 lstm uses a specific unit called the cell state c t to store information and the rest of the structure also includes forget gate f t input gate i t and output gate o t equations related to lstm cell are as follows i the forget gate f t uses the sigmoid function to determine what information will be discarded from the previous cell state c t 1 thus avoiding the information explosion problems 1 f t œÉ w f h t 1 x t b f where œÉ is the logistic sigmoid function with values ranging from 0 to 1 indicating the forgotten degree h t 1 is the antecedent output vector w f and b f are the network weight matrix and bias vector respectively ii the input gate i t determines what information will be updated and stored in the potential cell state c t 2 i t œÉ w i h t 1 x t b i where w i and b i are trainable parameters defined for the input gate a potential update vector of cell state c t can be expressed as 3 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c where w c and b c are the input weight matrix and bias vector for the potential cell state respectively iii the current cell state c t can be update by element wise multiplication 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c t iv the output gate o t specifies which information will be used as output 5 o t œÉ w o h t 1 x t b o where w o and b o are the output weight matrix and bias vector for the output gate respectively v the final output h t is calculated using the results of eqs 4 and 5 6 h t t a n h c t o t 3 2 ssa ssa is an algorithm based on karhunen loeve transformation theory which can easily extract trend information from original time series data and separate real noise components thereby effectively improving the prediction accuracy elsner and tsonis 1996 golyandina et al 2001 the core idea of ssa is to decompose the original time series into a set of sub series including trend items period items fluctuation items and noise the main steps of ssa include embedding singular value decomposition svd and reconstruction 3 2 1 embedding embedding operation transforms time series into a trajectory matrix in this step the one dimensional original time series x n x 1 x 2 x n with a length of n is first segmented according to an appropriate window length m and then converted into k lag variables of length m finally a trajectory matrix x is constructed in the form of hankel elsner and tsonis 1996 7 x x 1 x 2 x n x 1 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 3 x 4 x 5 x k x k 1 x k 2 x m x m 1 x m 2 x k m 1 where k n m 1 the window length m is the only parameter that depends on the actual situation and a priori information about the target component with a value range of less than n 3 baratta et al 2003 3 2 2 svd similar to the diagonalization of real symmetric matrices conventional matrices can also be decomposed using an analogy method that is svd svd is usually used to decompose an original sequence and extract singular values containing the independent information about the original sequence the eigenvalues and eigenvectors generated by the decomposition are called singular values and singular value vectors specifically when u and v are taken as the left and right singular value vectors of matrix x and œÉ is the singular value the form of the trajectory matrix x is as follows 8 x u œÉ v t the square matrix c x x t m m can be obtained on the basis of the trajectory matrix x 9 c x x t u œÉ v t v œÉ t u t u œÉ œÉ t u t u œÉ 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 œÉ l 2 u t where x t represents the transpose of matrix x and œÉ 1 œÉ 2 œÉ l l m are the non zero eigenvalues of matrix c from eq 9 it can be deduced that œÉ d i a g œÉ 1 œÉ 2 œÉ l œÉ 1 œÉ 2 0 œÉ l and set œÉ 1 œÉ 2 œÉ i i 1 2 l is a singular spectrum afterward the trajectory matrix x can be expressed as 10 x u œÉ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 œÉ l v t the right singular value vector can be expressed as v i x t u i œÉ i i 1 l as a result the trajectory matrix x can be written as the sum of orthogonal elementary matrices 11 x x 1 x 2 x l where x i œÉ i u i v i t 3 2 3 reconstruction reconstruction is the process of regrouping decomposed sequences and constructing new matrices including grouping and diagonalization averaging alharbi and hassani 2016 grouping extracts trend periodic and disordered noise components using appropriate methods specifically the index set 1 2 l can be divided into p disjoint subsets i e i 1 i 2 i p and accordingly the elementary matrix x in eq 11 is split into p groups making i i 1 i 2 i m m 1 2 p the corresponding composite matrix x of the i groups is defined as x i x i 1 x i 2 x i p x i can be further substituted into eq 11 to obtain the following matrix 12 x x i 1 x i 2 x i p noise components can be eliminated by setting the singular value of the corresponding matrix of set id i p d p to 0 accordingly the new trajectory matrix z can be calculated as 13 z i 1 i d x i x i 1 x i 2 x i d the purpose of diagonalization averaging is to

speed computational efficiency prediction accuracy and other aspects making it particularly suitable for classification prediction and other big data problems a lightgbm uses a histogram based algorithm to discretize continuous eigenvalues into s small bins in a floating point format and uses these bins to construct a histogram with a width of s fig 3 since the histogram does not need to store pre sorted results it can find the optimal segmentation point during feature segmentation according to the cumulative statistics of each discrete value thereby effectively reducing memory consumption and computation time zeng et al 2019 based on the histogram algorithm the lightgbm further uses the strategy of leaf growth with depth limitation removing the horizontal leaf growth strategy used by gbdt fig 4 shows the level wise and leaf wise growth strategies the level wise growth strategy fig 4a enables the leaves of the same layer to split simultaneously as the decision tree grows indicating that the strategy supports multi threaded optimization furthermore the number of leaves splitting in the same layer is identical but the information gain is different liang et al 2020 processing leaves with low information gain has little effect on prediction accuracy improvement while significantly increasing memory consumption on the other hand the leaf wise growth strategy fig 4b allows only leaves with the largest information gain to be segmented thereby effectively improving separation efficiency however this will also lead to a tree structure that is too deep so a strategy of limiting maximum depth should be implemented during tree growth a lightgbm has reliable theoretical support for efficient parallel operation and effective extraction of data features which provides application potential for real time prediction of urban rainfall runoff 3 4 ssa lightgbm a schematic flowchart of the ssa lightgbm model developed in this study is shown in fig 5 first ssa is used to decompose and reconstruct runoff series into subsequent rc d and noise components are separated and removed the percentage of the eigenvalues of d component to the total eigenvalue is the contribution of the component that is œÉ d i 1 d œÉ i second components are sorted according to their contribution value rc 1 rc 2 rc d to further highlight the trend characteristics of runoff make the model capture the runoff trend more accurately and retain sequence information to the maximum extent we divide the sub series into two parts and reconstruct them into trend features and periodicity features rc 1 rc j and rc j 1 rc d j d lastly the lightgbm simulates two components with different characteristics and provides different weights to the simulation results for integration making the model more specific and sensitive 3 5 evaluation of model performance in this paper we use the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae the error of peak discharge eq and the model calculation time t to evaluate the model s performance these evaluation methods are defined as follows 15 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 17 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i 18 eq y p y p y p 100 where y i m3 s and y i m3 s are the real and predicted urban runoff data respectively and y p m3 s and y p m3 s are the real and predicted peak urban runoff data respectively y m3 s is the average of real runoff and n represents the number of observations nse is an efficiency indicator for assessing the difference between the predicted and observed values with a value range of 1 the larger the nse value within this range the closer the simulated value is to the measured value the rmse reflects the errors between the predicted and observed runoff values which can evaluate the spread of the predicted errors and directly reflect the accuracy of the simulated results the mae is the average of the absolute errors and it shows the degree of agreement between predictions and observations the eq value represents the accuracy of the peak runoff prediction and t is the time required by the model for the calculation process the less time the model takes the more practical it is 3 6 software and hyperparameters in this study python 3 6 is used for data preprocessing and modeling the lightgbm packages are used to implement the lightgbm the lstm model is developed on the keras development platform of google tensorflow the tree structured parzen estimator bergstra et al 2011 is used to optimize some hyperparameters of the above models including lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm the optimization of each model hyperparameter obtained by 200 iterations is described in tables 1 3 4 results and discussion the 39 runoff events used in this paper are automatically acquired by chongqing yuelai sponge city monitoring information platform and numbered sequentially i e event 1 event 2 event 39 in section 4 1 we decompose and reconstruct rainfall runoff series by ssa in section 4 2 the influences of different time steps on the performance of the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models are analyzed in section 4 3 we explore the performance of the above three models in different prediction lead times with the optimal time step in section 4 4 the performance of the ssa lightgbm model under individual rainfall runoff events is studied 4 1 decomposing rainfall runoff data by ssa figs 6 and 7 show the decomposed and reconstructed rainfall runoff data using ssa respectively the runoff sequence was decomposed into 15 components by setting the window length to 15 the first 12 components with a contribution rate of 96 1 are selected as the main useful information i e rc 1 rc 12 which meets the requirements of reproducing urban rainfall runoff trends li et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 6 the amplitude of the rc 1 rc 12 components derived by ssa decreases rc 1 component contains the dominant information of runoff data clearly showing the irregular change trend of urban rainfall runoff data with an increase of the subscript value the noise in the component gradually increases rc 1 rc j and rc j 1 rc 12 are reconstructed into the main trend terms and fluctuating terms respectively the value of j is determined by testing to be 5 as demonstrated in fig 7 the trend runoff series are more prominent after reconstruction indicating that ssa can effectively extract the trend and fluctuating component and remove noise components while obtaining the main runoff series features 4 2 evaluation of model performance with different time steps the models performance varies with different time steps this section explores the single step prediction performance of the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models with different time steps 5 10 15 20 and 25 min which are reflected by four evaluation indicators including t nse rmse and mae to determine the optimal time step of the models considering that the randomness of initialization variables may lead to fluctuations in the process each model is repeatedly run three times under the same conditions it is of great significance for real time prediction to reduce the computing time required by the models in training and testing berkhahn et al 2019 fig 8 a shows that the lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models have an advantage over the lstm model in terms of the computation time in the training and testing processes furthermore there is no obvious relationship between the computation time and time steps as illustrated in fig 8b the nse coefficient of the lightgbm model is the same as that of the lstm model whereas the nse coefficient of the ssa lightgbm model is significantly better than that of both indicating that the ssa lightgbm model has a good performance in rainfall runoff prediction this may be because ssa decomposes and reconstructs rainfall runoff series and separates the trend and fluctuation sequences of the model thereby enabling the model to obtain more relevant features when the time step is 5 min the lstm model has the highest prediction accuracy with an nse coefficient of 0 879 as the time step increases the nse coefficient of the lstm model first decreases and then tends to be stable this may be because the 33 runoff events used in this study are independent of each other and the increase in the time step increases the redundant information obtained by the model although the lstm model has the ability of long term memory it cannot counteract this effect similarly for the lightgbm model the best predictive performance nse 0 875 is achieved when the time step is 5 min in contrast the quality of its prediction decreases gradually with the increase in the time step different from the lstm and lightgbm models the prediction accuracy of the ssa lightgbm model gradually improved with the time step increasing from 5 to 15 min and the nse value of the ssa lightgbm model reached the maximum value of 0 951 when the time step was 15 min this can be explained as an increase in the time step enhances the effective information available to the model thereby significantly improving prediction accuracy notably when the time step is greater than 15 min the nse of the ssa lightgbm model is no longer improved which may be attributed to the redundant information from the model s significant training time step fig 8c and fig 8d show the variation trend of rmse and mae parameters in the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models with different time steps consistent with nse based on these results the simulation accuracy of the lstm and lightgbm model is higher under the condition of a smaller time step in contrast the simulation performance of the ssa lightgbm model is better with a specific time step 4 3 performance comparison of models in this section the performance of the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models is compared at optimal time steps fig 8 provides the optimal time steps of the three models the optimal time step of the lstm and lightgbm models is 5 min and that of the ssa lightgbm model is 15 min table 4 illustrates the evaluation metrics of the above three models when the prediction lead time ranges from 5 to 30 min 5 min for lead time the results demonstrate that the performance of the lightgbm and lstm models is the identical under the same prediction lead time when the prediction lead time is 5 min the nse coefficients of both models reach the maximum value whereas the performance of the two models tends to decline when the prediction lead time continues to increase on the one hand this may be due to the lack of future runoff information in the multi step prediction of the models on the other hand the continuous accumulation of prediction errors can also lead to a decline in prediction performance besides the nse coefficient of the lightgbm model decreases more than that of the lstm model this can be ascribed to the long term memory capability of the lstm model which can transfer the output vector of the previous unit as the input vector to the next unit thereby enabling the lstm model to reuse valid historical information therefore the lstm model has a better effect on multi step prediction than the lightgbm model similarly the performance of the ssa lightgbm model gradually decreases as the prediction lead time increases since the prediction of rainfall runoff needs more effective information on future runoff nevertheless note that the prediction accuracy of the ssa lightgbm model is significantly higher than that of the lstm and lightgbm models under the same prediction lead time table 4 when the prediction lead time is 5 min on the one hand the nse coefficient of the ssa lightgbm model reaches the maximum value of 0 951 which is 10 1 higher than that of the lstm model and the ssa lightgbm model decreases the rmse and mae values by 40 2 and 37 0 respectively on the other hand compared with the lightgbm model the ssa lightgbm model reduces the rmse and mae values by 38 9 and 42 7 respectively and increases the nse coefficient by 9 4 the above observation indicates that the addition of ssa addresses the shortcomings of the lightgbm model when processing strongly nonlinear time series data making the ssa lightgbm model less susceptible to the interference of redundant information thus the ssa lightgbm model can achieve the best performance under different lead times in addition a sufficiently short calculation time is also a fundamental requirement for real time prediction as displayed in table 4 the average computing time of the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models in the training and prediction process is 301 128 0 232 and 10 000 s respectively cp redmibook 14 8 512 gb memory the lstm model requires more computation time for training network and prediction mainly due to the complex recursive structure of the model and the first order training characteristic of the optimizer the lightgbm model uses the histogram algorithm to find the optimal segmentation point instead of storing the pre sorted results significantly reducing the calculation time compared with the lightgbm model the ssa lightgbm model increases the calculation time by 9 768 s on average for the ssa decomposition and reconstruction of runoff data although the ssa lightgbm model requires more computing time than the lightgbm model in model training and testing the value is still within the acceptable range berkhahn et al 2019 4 4 prediction of single runoff events by different models the observation and simulation of the three models lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm for the six independent runoff events used in the test with a prediction lead time of 15 min are shown in fig 9 the three models perform well in single peak and bimodal runoff events event 36 39 with nse coefficients ranging from 0 924 and 0 975 while the accuracy in multipeak runoff events event 34 and event 35 is slightly worse this might be attributable to the lack of data patterns for multipeak runoff events in the data used for training failing to extract similar features effectively to address this question we suggest that integrated runoff patterns including single peak bimodal and multipeak runoff events should be collected in the general off line simulation and prediction to improve the model s robustness in rainfall runoff prediction notably the ssa lightgbm model has fewer abnormal fluctuations than the lstm and lightgbm models indicating that the ssa lightgbm performs better in independent runoff events meanwhile the real time prediction system can train new runoff datasets and enrich and improve the adaptability and robustness of the model during the operation of the system in the future furthermore the scatter plots of the simulation vs observation of training and prediction periods by the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models with different prediction lead time 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 min are presented in fig 10 the scatter distribution of the ssa lightgbm is more compact than that of the lstm and lightgbm models suggesting that the predicted value of the ssa lightgbm model is closer to the observed value the r2 values by linear regression equation fitting reinforce the fact that the ssa lightgbm model has better performance than the other two models accurately peak runoff forecasting using a runoff model is critical in realizing timely flood warnings table 5 shows the eq in independent runoff events by the lstm lightgbm and ssa lightgbm models under prediction lead times of 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 min the range of the eq values for the three models under a prediction lead time of 5 min are as follows lstm 6 247 68 897 lightgbm 15 445 66 267 and ssa lightgbm 0 252 6 677 in addition the average eq of the ssa lightgbm model under prediction lead times of 5 30 min are 2 479 4 832 6 533 7 477 7 492 and 7 510 respectively the results clearly indicate that the ssa lightgbm model provides the most accurate prediction of peak runoff 5 conclusion to realize the real time prediction of urban rainfall runoff and improve the performance of nonlinear sequence simulation an ssa lightgbm model is established in this study which integrates ssa and a lightgbm to verify the performance of the ssa lightgbm model the model is applied to the yuelai rainfall runoff time series and compared with the lightgbm and lstm models this study s conclusions are as follows 1 ssa can effectively separate trend terms fluctuating terms and noise components overcoming the shortcoming of the lightgbm model in processing nonlinear sequence thus the ssa lightgbm model which is built on this basis has stronger specificity and robustness 2 the performance of the ssa lightgbm model has a good prediction at a specific time step and the optimal time step value should be determined through experiments in practical applications the simulation accuracy of the ssa lightgbm model is significantly better than that of the lightgbm and lstm models under the optimal time step overcoming the shortcomings of the lightgbm and lstm models in a simulation of urban rainfall runoff series 3 the average computation time required by the ssa lightgbm model is less than 10 s which is only 1 30th of that of the lstm model the total operation time of the ssa lightgbm model can fully meet the calculation time requirements for real time prediction credit authorship contribution statement zhongjie cui methodology conceptualization formal analysis writing original
