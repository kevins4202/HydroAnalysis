6355,despite the expectation that increases in rainfall with climatic change will result in increases in pluvial flooding there is more historical evidence for decreases in flood magnitude in australia as in many other parts of the world flood magnitudes are mostly decreasing despite increasing rainfall extremes here we show how changes in soil moisture have led to decreasing flood magnitudes while rainfall extremes have been increasing using gauged streamflow catchment average rainfall and modelled soil moisture data across australia we confirm that streamflow peaks or floods that occur at least once a year are strongly related to both the peak rainfall causing the flood and the antecedent soil moisture conditions preceding the storm event regions where the magnitude of the peak flow has decreased are visually and statistically correlated to regions of decreasing soil moisture flood magnitudes are more likely to increase only for the rarest events with increases in rainfall offset by decreases in soil moisture for more frequent events a recurrence interval dependent tipping point is identified beyond which trends in catchment rainfall outweigh those of soil moisture trends and dominate the flood response for regions where soil moisture has decreased this tipping point occurs at an average recurrence interval of ten years or more as most studies investigating trends in flooding generally use annual maxima changes in soil moisture are likely to be the dominant mechanism behind observed flood trends hence changes in soil moisture conditions need to be considered when predicting catchment flood response due to climatic change keywords flooding extreme rainfall soil moisture trend analysis antecedent moisture conditions climate change 1 introduction there is significant evidence that rainfall extremes are increasing allan and soden 2008 hartmann et al 2013 martinez villalobos and neelin 2018 o gorman 2015 using a global gridded data set of extreme rainfall indices from 1951 2003 the annual maximum 1 day rainfall presented statistically significant increases for 7 of grid cells analysed while 2 7 showed a decrease alexander et al 2006 similarly using gauge data the annual maxima displayed statistically significant positive trends for 10 0 of gauges worldwide while 2 2 had significant negative trends westra et al 2013 across the u s from 1950 2011 sub daily annual maxima have increased barbero et al 2017 with increases also demonstrated for more extreme events towards the 5 year annual return interval groisman et al 2005 by fitting generalized extreme value distributions the return period of events up to 20 years has been shown to have reduced universally across europe implying increasing rainfall extremes van den besselaar et al 2013 trends in flooding however show more decreases globally in annual maxima flows than increases sharma et al 2018 over the period of 1966 2005 7 1 of stations had statistically significant increasing trends and 11 9 of stations had statistically significant decreasing trends do et al 2017 in the u s the flood response is mixed archfield et al 2016 slater and villarini 2016 using annual peak discharge records from 50 stations in the u s with at least 100 years of record no overall trends were found villarini et al 2009a similarly a review of flooding across europe showed little uniform continental trends hall et al 2014 although there is evidence of increased flood severity across the uk hannaford and marsh 2008 annual maxima show a general decreasing trend across spain mediero et al 2014 albeit with significant variability hall et al 2014 trends in australian rainfall and streamflow reflect global patterns alexander et al 2007 the magnitude of extreme hourly and daily rainfall observations from australia has increased from 1966 1989 to 1990 2013 guerreiro et al 2018 and in a gridded rainfall product from 1911 to 2010 for the entire continent the only cells with statistically significant trends in annual maxima were those showing increases alexander and arblaster 2017 although a recent study using daily annual maxima from 58 sites over the period 1910 2009 found mixed trends jakob and walland 2016 sub daily rainfall across south east australia from 1965 to 2005 has increased westra and sisson 2011 for flooding using 222 high quality streamflow records since the 1950s annual maxima were found to be increasing at only 8 sites compared to decreasing at 44 sites with similar trends for the 90th percentile zhang et al 2016 likewise using a larger and longer data set 26 of sites across australia showed statistically significant decreasing trends and only 6 showed statistically significant increasing trends at the 10 level ishak et al 2013 with trends in extreme flow difficult to identify villarini et al 2009a due to the high noise to signal ratio hall et al 2014 coupled with the complex rainfall streamflow relationship reasons for the apparent inconsistency between decreases in flow peaks with increasing rainfalls are difficult to establish sharma et al 2018 for example although increased pluvial flooding will largely be caused by increased rainfall intensities the catchment response will also be influenced by changes in the pattern lochbihler et al 2017 wasko et al 2016 wasko and sharma 2015 duration prein et al 2017 and frequency molnar et al 2015 of the rainfall changes to the vegetation ajami et al 2017 and changes in the soil moisture in the catchment prior to the rainfall event ivancic and shaw 2015 stephens et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017a will also change the resultant flood magnitude as the 99th percentile of rainfall only led to a corresponding 99th percentile discharge 36 of the time across the contiguous united states ivancic and shaw 2015 changes in rainfall may not be very well related well to changes in flooding disregarding catchment land use change and other exogenous non stationary factors unrelated to climate change the response of a catchment to flood producing rainfall depends on a the flood producing rainfall from the storm event and b the antecedent conditions or moisture state of the catchment bennett et al 2018 boughton and droop 2003 hettiarachchi et al 2019 ivancic and shaw 2015 kuczera et al 2006 pathiraja et al 2016 saft et al 2016 stephens et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017a case studies abound that focus on rainfall and soil moisture in studying runoff generation houser et al 2000 lana renault et al 2007 penna et al 2011 saffarpour et al 2016 and this corroborates with the observation that changes in the timing of flooding are well correlated to either changes in the soil moisture changes in rainfall or changes in snowmelt blöschl et al 2017 although the reasons behind changes in flooding are likely to be changes in the rainfall or snow causing the flood or the soil moisture conditions prior to the event there is little research on how changing antecedent soil moisture conditions might be modulating changes in flooding there are few studies looking at the changes in antecedent soil moisture directly and studies that have investigated changes in antecedent rainfall have found mixed responses worldwide woldemeskel and sharma 2016 it has been postulated that recent historical decreases in flood magnitude are due to decreases in soil moisture sharma et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017a but this is yet to be confirmed using trends in extreme flows the rainfall causing the flow and the soil moisture prior to the storm event we try to answer the question why have flood magnitudes decreased across australia 2 data compilation streamflow data is obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology s hydrologic reference stations hrs the hrs have been determined to be high quality reference stations in catchments that are largely unimpacted by impoundments and diversions and hence are recommended for the analysis and detection of streamflow trends and climatic variability zhang et al 2016 the original data set consisted of 222 stations but since inception one station has been removed further in this analysis six catchments with areas over 20 000 km2 were omitted as the lag time from rainfall to streamflow exceeded five days and made them unsuitable for analysis finally two arid stations were omitted as rainfall rarely results in streamflow in total 213 stations were chosen for analysis the location of these streamflow gauges i e catchment outlets their respective catchment areas and the köppen climate classification peel et al 2007 is presented in fig 1 the majority of sites have catchment area less than 1000 km2 and are often referred in the hydrologic literature as relatively small natural catchments there is a general climatic shift in australia from north to south with winter dominated rainfall in the temperate south and summer dominated rainfall in the north the streamflow gauges are disturbed across different climate zones with catchments located in the tropical north subtropical east coast through to the mild temperate and cool climatic conditions further south there are few sites in the drier arid areas away from the coast for the analysis here only entire calendar years of record were used station record lengths vary between sites with the earliest year on record 1950 and the last year on record 2014 the record lengths are relatively long with the majority of sites having record lengths exceeding 40 years and a median record length of 45 years fig 2 in order to examine the relative importance of rainfall and antecedent soil moisture conditions on the trends in streamflow and flooding the streamflow data needs to be paired with catchment rainfall and catchment soil moisture catchment boundaries previously used successfully were adopted here fowler et al 2018 2016 the catchment boundaries were derived using elevation data from shuttle radar topography mission srtm data on a grid size of 1 s approximately thirty metres these catchment boundaries were used to extract catchment average rainfall from the australian water availability project awap which is a high quality gridded rainfall data set on a grid size of 0 05 or approximately 5 km jones et al 2009 this product has extensively been used in hydrologic studies nathan and mcmahon 2017 and has been evaluated for use in the analysis of extreme rainfalls nathan et al 2016 catchment average soil moisture was extracted from the australian bureau of meteorology australian water resources assessment landscape awra l product awra l is a daily distributed water balance model that uses the same grid as awap viney et al 2015 to produce soil moisture and streamflow estimates across australia this model has been evaluated against observed in situ soil moisture from multiple locations and found to have strong agreement correlation in many cases exceeding the performance of satellite remote sensed observations holgate et al 2016 consistent with available knowledge hill et al 2016 hill and thomson 2016 the 0 1 m soil moisture data was extracted from awra l as it has been identified to be most correlated with catchment flood response 3 methods of analysis 3 1 event extraction rainfall events were chosen based on a peaks over threshold algorithm where individual events were identified as being separated by 1 day of zero rainfall all catchment average rainfall below 1 mm was assumed to be zero using this procedure for choosing rainfall events resulted in events separated by 4 5 days on average corresponding well to the independence criterion for storm events across australia xuereb and green 2012 the streamflow corresponding to the rainfall was chosen as the flow which commenced on the day of the first day of rainfall and continued five days after the end of the rainfall event or until the next rainfall event commenced this duration was based on a correlation analysis between the rainfall and streamflow which showed the majority of stations had a peak lag correlation of one day with a maximum peak lag correlation of 4 days the time window adopted to select streamflow was hence assumed sufficient to ensure that the flood peak from the storm event was captured the antecedent soil moisture was chosen as the soil moisture on the day immediately before the start of the rainfall for each station only events above a threshold which ensured an average of five events per year were analysed so a site with 45 years of record would have a threshold selected such that the largest 225 events were chosen this approach is equivalent to selecting data for a peak over threshold frequency analysis in which the most frequent quantile of interest is an event with an average recurrence interval of around 2 3 months the threshold for choosing events was based on the peak daily rainfall intensity within the event the sampling frequency of five events pear year was subsequently varied to assess trends in flood peaks over a range of severities the variables retained for further analysis from each event were the peak rainfall intensity with the storm termed peak rainfall the peak flow following the storm termed peak flow and the antecedent moisture on the day before the rainfall event commenced termed soil moisture the storm volume that is the sum of the rainfall event was also retained and is commented on in the discussions the variables chosen for analysis are those most commonly studied and those we believe can be derived with confidence for example trends in rainfall or flow are generally reported as trends in the maximum peak rates and not volumes as the start and end of a streamflow event is more arbitrary the focus here remains on the peak flow the peak flow recorded as a result of the rainfall event had its baseflow removed using a recursive digital filter furey and gupta 2001 lyne and hollick 1979 details of the implementation can also be found in ladson et al 2013 and the parameters used for the filter are as per those recommended in nathan and mcmahon 1990 3 2 analysis of event statistics and trends the association between variables was investigated using a pearson correlation coefficient trends were analysed using a linear regression with the variable of interest as the independent response variable yi and time ti in the units of days as the dependent variable peak rainfall and peak flow were transformed into the logarithmic domain to ensure normality of residuals and zero flows were set as the minimum recorded flow to allow for log transformation for peak flow and peak rainfall the following function was used 1 log 10 y i β 0 β 1 t i where i 1 m and m is the total number of samples for the site location and yi represents either flow or rainfall the regression coefficients β 0 and β 1 represent a constant and the linear change in the response variable per unit change in time t respecitvely to find the trend per decade δ 10 y as a percentage the following transformation was required to the slope where n is the number of days in 10 years 2 δ 10 y 100 10 n β 1 1 soil moisture did not require transformation and hence the trend is simply reported as the slope β 1 of the fitted regression multiplied by the number of days in 10 years to report the trend per decade 3 3 analysis of trends for rare events quantile regression koenker 2013 koenker and bassett 1978 was used to investigate trends for recurrence intervals beyond the sampling frequency quantile regression has successfully been used to investigate the association of extreme rainfall to temperature wasko and sharma 2014 and investigate trends in precipitation tan and shao 2017 and streamflow yin et al 2018 using the same terminology as above quantile regression can be expressed as per equation 1 but a cost function d is used to minimize deviation from the quantile q of interest that is for a regression of the form 3 y i β 0 q β 1 q t i the regression coefficents β 0 q and β 1 q are chosen to minimize a cost function d defined as 4 d β 0 q β 1 q q y i β 0 q β 1 q t i y i β 0 q β 1 q t i 1 q y i β 0 q β 1 q t i y i β 0 q β 1 q t i a choice of 0 5 for the quantile corresponds to the median tendency between the dependent variable ti and response yi in this way by setting quantiles above 0 5 we can investigate trends beyond the average samplying frequency a recurrence interval was assigned to the rainfall using the following equation stedinger et al 1993 5 q 1 λ l n t a t a 1 where q is the quantile of interest λ is the average number of events per year and ta is the annual return period this equation is equivalent to adoption of the weibull plotting position which minimizes bias in the estimated exceedance probability rather than the magnitude of the quantiles 4 results 4 1 correlation of key variables we first reaffirm the assertion that flood response is related to the corresponding peak rainfall and soil moisture fig 3 presents the correlation of the flood peak with peak rainfall and soil moisture stratified on catchment area for small catchments less than 100 km2 fig 3a the peak rainfall is almost always positively correlated with the flood peak with a median correlation of 0 5 similarly the soil moisture also has median correlation of 0 5 with the peak flow although there is some evidence of greater correlations with soil moisture than peak rainfall this evidence is limited as both peak rainfall and soil moisture have similar median correlations with peak flow for larger catchments with area between 100 and 1000 km2 fig 3b and above 1000 km2 fig 3c the median correlation between the peak rainfall and peak flow is below 0 5 while the correlation between the peak flow and soil moisture is now greater than 0 5 for this catchment size and event frequency soil moisture now plays a greater role in modulating flood response than rainfall as the interquartile ranges overlap less as catchment size increases it can be argued that that soil moisture becomes progressively more important to the streamflow response as catchment size increases note that using a spearman s rank correlation gave similar results the modulating effect of the soil moisture on flood peak is examined further in fig 4 peak rainfall peak flow and soil moisture are all converted to non dimensional units to allow pooling of information from different sites the peak rainfall and peak flow are divided by the mean at that site while the soil moisture is divided by the maximum the x axis shows increasing rainfall the y axis increasing flow and the surface is an average of the soil moisture for low rainfalls the flood response varies from low to zero flow conditions to close to the maximum flow recorded for that site this difference in response is highly dependent on the soil moisture conditions for a low rainfall the soil moisture must be wet for a large flow event to be recorded and dry for a small flow event to be recorded the streamflow response is very strongly dominated by the soil moisture conditions conversely it is seen that high rainfalls almost always result in a large flood response at this point the soil moisture on average is neither in a wet or dry state the occurrence of high rainfall is hence independent of the soil moisture the catchment response can also be described by using the flow axis as the basis for discussion a high flow can occur when the catchment is wet or dry but if the catchment is dry a high rainfall is required to produce a high flow alternatively if the catchment is wet a flood can occur even from a relatively small rainfall this demonstrates two important points namely 1 that the relationship between rainfall and streamflow is highly non linear and is modulated significantly by the catchment soil moisture state and 2 the relationship between rainfall and streamflow varies with rainfall severity that is the more severe the rainfall event the less of a modulating effect soil moisture has on the resultant flow see also bennett et al 2018 4 2 correlation of trends using an average frequency of five events per year the trend in the peak rainfall peak flow and soil moisture for each station is presented in fig 5 in the north west of australia more stations have increasing trends in rainfall than decreasing trends however along the east coast north to south the peak rainfall at the majority of sites is decreasing fig 5a in the south of australia again increasing trends are dominant no dominant trend is observed on the south east coast overall the rainfall trend results are mixed 50 of sites positive 50 of sites negative and there are few significant sites only 12 of the entire sample at a 10 significance level the peak flow trends differ greatly from the peak rainfall trends there is some evidence of increasing peak flows across the northern latitudes fig 5b different from the peak rainfall fig 5a which did not exhibit increases particularly on the north east coast along all the east and west coasts of australia the flow trend is overwhelmingly negative fig 5b over half the trends displayed are statistically significant 52 and almost all of these are negative in fact 87 of the sites display decreasing trends and the magnitude of the decreases is much larger than those displayed in the peak rainfall there is no clear correspondence between the trend in the rainfall fig 5a and flow fig 5b across australia particularly in the south the soil moisture trends fig 5c however mimic the peak flow trends more closely the percentage of sites with negative trend is 68 which is closer to the number of sites that had negative trends in the peak flow compared to the peak rainfall a slightly greater number of sites that have decreasing soil moisture trends are statistically significant compared to those sites with positive trends across the north of australia the soil moisture trends are more positive than negative which is consistent with the trends in peak flows fig 5b along the south east coast the soil moisture results are mixed but in the south the trends are negative and this matches the direction of the flow trend this is in contrast to peak rainfall which was increasing in the south fig 5a trends in south west australia have little statistical significance but there are more negative than positive trends in soil moisture fig 5c and this corresponds more to the majority negative trends in the peak flow fig 5b than majority positive trends in peak rainfall fig 5a visually there is evidence to support the assertion that trends in rainfall extremes and antecedent moisture conditions are correlated to the trend in the peak flow but the results are not clear and vary spatially fig 5 to paint a clearer picture we present the trends fig 5 as a scatter plot fig 6 in the left column fig 6a d are scatter plots of peak flow and peak rainfall trends while in the right column fig 6e h are scatter plots of peak flow and soil moisture trends the rows represent varying sampling frequencies previously we sampled to ensure an average of 5 events per year but now we sample partial duration series of varying sample size frequency the first row fig 6a and e has a sampling frequency of 1 event per year notionally equivalent to annual maxima and this increases through 2 events per year fig 6b and f 5 events per year fig 6c and g and 10 events per year fig 6d and h in this way we have relatively infrequent events at the top corresponding to trends in annual maxima analogous to most published literature through to very frequent events occurring approximately once a month the colour scale indicates the latitude allowing placement of the sites as it was noted previously that more northern sites exhibit positive trends in peak flow compared to southern sites which exhibit more negative trends we begin by discussing the trends for an average sampling frequency of 5 events per year that were presented in fig 5 and are now presented as a scatter plot in fig 6c and g there is little evidence that peak flow trends are related to peak rainfall the correlation of the peak rainfall and peak flow trends is low 0 11 we can see that for some of the sites in the north pink dots they have both positive flow trends and positive rainfall trends but overall the dependency in the trends is low conversely the correlation between the soil moisture trends and flow trends fig 6g is reasonably good 0 48 there is some indication of a regional dependence in that positive soil moisture trends are more common at the northern latitudes but overall the site location tends to be scattered as the event frequency increases 10 events per year similar correlations between the trends are obtained however the clustering of sites with positive soil moisture trends now appears visually stronger fig 6h more sites in the tropics appear to have positive or near zero soil moisture trends and corresponding positive peak flow trends so for events that occur multiple times a year we can conclude that changes in antecedent moisture are dominating the flood response and trends in peak rainfall are having a much lesser effect on the trend in the peak flow moving to more infrequent rare events the situation starts to change for a sampling frequency of 2 events per year fig 6b and f the correlation between the peak flow and peak rainfall is now 0 30 which is much greater than observed for the more frequent sampling discussed previously the correlation of the peak flow and soil moisture is still similar but the spread of points is now larger as the event frequency is reduced the trend in the peak rainfall may be having more of an influence on the peak flow trend but even at this point when the events are reasonably rare 2 per year soil moisture trends appear more important as evidenced by the higher correlation between the peak flow and soil moisture trend it is only when we begin to sample the most rare events 1 per year that the trend in peak flow appears to be more correlated with the peak rainfall than the antecedent soil moisture the peak flow trend correlation with peak rainfall is 0 51 fig 6a whereas the correlation with soil moisture 0 32 fig 6e at this sampling frequency any spatial dependence in the trends appears to be lost no longer are positive soil moisture trends clustering around the northern parts of australia nor is there any noticeable spatial clustering of the peak rainfall trends 4 3 trends in rare events the use of quantile regression allows us to assign a recurrence interval to trends beyond the mean sampling frequency using the sample of five events per year we apply quantile regression using various percentiles and calculate corresponding recurrence intervals extrapolating to the most extreme trends is subject to considerable uncertainty but despite inhomogeneity in trends across australia fig 6a and e suggest that the antecedent soil moisture and peak rainfall trends show no spatial dependence for the rarest events for the purposes here the trend in each variable is calculated at each site individually these trends are then assumed to be part of a homogenous sample and the mean of the trends at each site is presented as the thick line in fig 7 against the recurrence interval in years ari the soil moisture trend on average is negative and independent of ari this is consistent with the results presented in fig 4 there is no physical argument that supports the assertion that soil moisture should vary with event recurrence as events are chosen on the basis of rainfall severity and the antecedent soil moisture conditions should be independent for more comment events recurrence intervals less than 2 years peak rainfall does not show either increasing or decreasing trend however as the ari increases the peak rainfall trend also increases up to a mean decadal trend in the order of 2 3 per decade for ari s 10 years or over what is most interesting is the mean peak flow trend for the more common events average flows are decreasing and this decrease is very large in comparison to the change in the peak rainfall even at the 5 year recurrence interval there is still on average a 4 decrease in the peak flow per decade it is only at the 10 year ari that the average peak flow begins to increase and only for the most extreme flows 40 year ari is the peak flow trend similar in magnitude to the peak rainfall trend the notion that trends in extreme rainfall translate to trends in flooding is not supported by the evidence presented here only for aris above 10 years do peak flow trends start to increase alongside increasing peak rainfall this suggests that decreases in soil moisture drying soils may be the driving factor for changes in more common flood events 5 physical interpretation and implications it has been postulated that depending on how rare the storm event is higher temperatures will result in higher rainfalls but not necessarily higher flows due to reductions in soil moisture sharma et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017a the more extreme the event and the larger the rainfall the less important changes in antecedent moisture conditions are in modulating the response to increased rainfall bennett et al 2018 the results presented here confirm that there is a likely tipping point in severity where changes in soil moisture no longer have a dominant influence on the resulting changes in flow and below this tipping point flood magnitudes decrease due to decreases in soil moisture here peak rainfall and soil moisture were used as the primary explanatory variables for changes in flood magnitude for more frequent events greater than or equal to 2 events per year the soil moisture trend was the dominant factor explaining the trend in the magnitude of peak flow it was only for events of rarity in the order of the annual maxima that peak rainfall trends started to correlate well with peak flow trends as discussed in the introduction there are a range of variables which will affect peak flow e g guo et al 2018 johnson et al 2016 hence the analysis was repeated using storm volume in place of peak rainfall the storm volume was calculated by summing all the rainfall which occurred as part of the rainfall event when storm volume was used as an explanatory variable it was found that the results were almost identical to those for the peak rainfall in fact the correlations presented in fig 6 were almost identical regardless of whether peak rainfall trends or storm volume trends were correlated to peak flows this is expected as storm volume is very highly correlated to the peak rainfall contained in a storm the choice to focus on peak rainfall in presenting results was a pragmatic one as most trend studies focus on peak rainfall intensities it is of interest to discuss the results presented in context of historical studies analysis of australian flow trends using annual maxima found increasing trends in the tropics and decreasing trends in the southern latitudes ishak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 those results are replicated in general here using more frequent sampling consistent with results presented in zhang et al 2016 where similar trends were presented for less extreme quantiles however linking the fact that increases in floods are more likely to be found in the tropics to climatic factors is difficult it is increasingly evident that rainfall extremes are increasing across australia alexander and arblaster 2017 guerreiro et al 2018 westra and sisson 2011 though not all studies find evidence of an increase jakob and walland 2016 but peak flow trends do appear to exhibit universal increasing trends in the tropics with strong evidence of decreasing trends in the south of australia due to intensification of the hadley circulation mitas and clement 2005 seidel et al 2008 there has been a resulting increase in mean rainfall in the tropics and a decrease in the subtropics csiro bom 2016 head et al 2014 for more common events these increases in average rainfalls in the tropics may result in soil moisture increases prior to the storm event causing increases in the runoff which is not observed elsewhere in australia this is a simplified explanation as it does not account for dependencies which might exist such as those between the spells of rainfall pui et al 2012 which will subsequently also affect the antecedent conditions wasko et al 2015 nevertheless there is a suggestion that changes in mean rainfall may be indicative of changes in soil moisture which have a resulting influence on changes in peak flows trends in flooding are also related to the catchment area it was found that the proportion of catchments showing increases in the annual maximum flow increases as catchment size is reduced do et al 2017 likewise when the sensitivity of flooding to temperature was analysed it was the smaller catchments that were more likely to see increases in flooding with higher temperatures wasko and sharma 2017a some evidence that soil moisture conditions play a greater role in modulating flood response in larger catchments than smaller catchments was presented here fig 3 with higher correlations for peak flows with soil moisture than peak rainfalls for larger catchments but as there was overlap between the interquartile ranges for the correlations between peak flow with peak rainfall and soil moisture for catchments less than 1000 km2 this suggests that both antecedent moisture and rainfall have equal importance in modulating streamflow response for events occurring multiple times a year the results presented in fig 6a and 6e evidence that the antecedent soil moisture and peak rainfall trends show little spatial dependence for the rarest events this is consistent with guerreiro et al 2018 where there does not appear to be any spatial dependence in trends in annual rainfall maxima as a result to extrapolate to aris greater than one year we used quantile regression and aggregated the results the lack of a uniform trend in peak rainfall for events less than a 2 year recurrence fig 7 is consistent with some studies jakob and walland 2016 but not the majority of evidence which suggests increasing annual maxima daily rainfall guerreiro et al 2018 westra et al 2013 however for more extreme events on average a 2 3 increase in the extreme rainfall was observed per decade if we adopt an extreme rainfall increase of 2 5 per decade and apply this to the average increase in temperatures of 0 1 0 2 c per decade over australia since 1950 head et al 2014 hughes 2003 the trends presented here correspond to an increase in rainfall intensities of 12 5 25 0 c well in excess of the theoretical predictions of 7 c trenberth et al 2003 the rate of increase found here uses daily rainfall whereas previously such high rates of increases in rainfall extremes were only been identified in sub daily rainfall guerreiro et al 2018 westra and sisson 2011 this confirms that the most extreme rainfall events those well beyond annual maxima in severity may be the most likely to be increasing wasko and sharma 2017b decreasing antecedent soil moisture is consistent with the general drying trends in soil moisture that are both observed and predicted albergel et al 2013 collins et al 2013 jung et al 2010 though trends in soil moisture can be expected to vary spatially albergel et al 2013 the average decreasing trend in flood magnitude presented here is consistent with the fact that more sites throughout australia ishak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 and the world do et al 2017 exhibit decreasing flow magnitudes as compared to increases we need to stress that these decreases in flow magnitude even for events with a return interval of several years is only likely in undeveloped catchments in urban areas where little pervious surfaces exist and much of the catchment is directly connected to the catchment outlet increases in rainfall will result in increased flood magnitudes hettiarachchi et al 2018 villarini et al 2009b vogel et al 2011 finally a comment on some of the assumptions made in this study we sample to ensure an average number of events per year this is different from the generally adopted sampling of annual maxima for trend analysis but has the advantage of aiding investigation over a range of severities our sampling method may result in a different number of events in each calendar year but inspection of the time series showed that events tend to be uniformly spread throughout the duration of the time series moreover repeating the analysis by picking the largest 5 events in a given year as opposed to ensuring an average of 5 events per year did not change the conclusions presented here the analysis presented fitted a log linear relationship to the peak flow and peak rainfall and a linear relationship to the soil moisture in sensitivity testing both regression in the log space and linear space were tested for all variables and gave similar results the adopted form of regressions here were those that best fit the variable of interest removal of baseflow also introduces uncertainty but again we note that when baseflow was not removed from the peak flows the conclusions did not change 6 conclusions despite more sites around the world presenting increases in rainfall extremes than decreases the opposite is true for flood magnitudes with more sites exhibiting decreases rather than increases in flooding australia s climate is no different despite evidence for increased rainfall intensities more flow gauges show decreases in flood magnitude than an increase as pluvial flooding by its very nature is dependent on rainfall this leads to the question of why an inconsistency exists between changes in extreme rainfall and flooding by using a peaks over threshold methodology to sample rainfall and streamflow events of varying frequency we were able to show that trends in flood magnitude depend on both trends in rainfall and trends in antecedent soil moisture with decreasing soil moisture the likely cause for decreased flooding of more common events only for the rarest events was it found that trends in flow magnitude are more likely to follow trends in extreme rainfalls hence future research should focus on understanding both changes in rainfall and soil moisture when projecting flooding for climatic change declaration of competing

6355,despite the expectation that increases in rainfall with climatic change will result in increases in pluvial flooding there is more historical evidence for decreases in flood magnitude in australia as in many other parts of the world flood magnitudes are mostly decreasing despite increasing rainfall extremes here we show how changes in soil moisture have led to decreasing flood magnitudes while rainfall extremes have been increasing using gauged streamflow catchment average rainfall and modelled soil moisture data across australia we confirm that streamflow peaks or floods that occur at least once a year are strongly related to both the peak rainfall causing the flood and the antecedent soil moisture conditions preceding the storm event regions where the magnitude of the peak flow has decreased are visually and statistically correlated to regions of decreasing soil moisture flood magnitudes are more likely to increase only for the rarest events with increases in rainfall offset by decreases in soil moisture for more frequent events a recurrence interval dependent tipping point is identified beyond which trends in catchment rainfall outweigh those of soil moisture trends and dominate the flood response for regions where soil moisture has decreased this tipping point occurs at an average recurrence interval of ten years or more as most studies investigating trends in flooding generally use annual maxima changes in soil moisture are likely to be the dominant mechanism behind observed flood trends hence changes in soil moisture conditions need to be considered when predicting catchment flood response due to climatic change keywords flooding extreme rainfall soil moisture trend analysis antecedent moisture conditions climate change 1 introduction there is significant evidence that rainfall extremes are increasing allan and soden 2008 hartmann et al 2013 martinez villalobos and neelin 2018 o gorman 2015 using a global gridded data set of extreme rainfall indices from 1951 2003 the annual maximum 1 day rainfall presented statistically significant increases for 7 of grid cells analysed while 2 7 showed a decrease alexander et al 2006 similarly using gauge data the annual maxima displayed statistically significant positive trends for 10 0 of gauges worldwide while 2 2 had significant negative trends westra et al 2013 across the u s from 1950 2011 sub daily annual maxima have increased barbero et al 2017 with increases also demonstrated for more extreme events towards the 5 year annual return interval groisman et al 2005 by fitting generalized extreme value distributions the return period of events up to 20 years has been shown to have reduced universally across europe implying increasing rainfall extremes van den besselaar et al 2013 trends in flooding however show more decreases globally in annual maxima flows than increases sharma et al 2018 over the period of 1966 2005 7 1 of stations had statistically significant increasing trends and 11 9 of stations had statistically significant decreasing trends do et al 2017 in the u s the flood response is mixed archfield et al 2016 slater and villarini 2016 using annual peak discharge records from 50 stations in the u s with at least 100 years of record no overall trends were found villarini et al 2009a similarly a review of flooding across europe showed little uniform continental trends hall et al 2014 although there is evidence of increased flood severity across the uk hannaford and marsh 2008 annual maxima show a general decreasing trend across spain mediero et al 2014 albeit with significant variability hall et al 2014 trends in australian rainfall and streamflow reflect global patterns alexander et al 2007 the magnitude of extreme hourly and daily rainfall observations from australia has increased from 1966 1989 to 1990 2013 guerreiro et al 2018 and in a gridded rainfall product from 1911 to 2010 for the entire continent the only cells with statistically significant trends in annual maxima were those showing increases alexander and arblaster 2017 although a recent study using daily annual maxima from 58 sites over the period 1910 2009 found mixed trends jakob and walland 2016 sub daily rainfall across south east australia from 1965 to 2005 has increased westra and sisson 2011 for flooding using 222 high quality streamflow records since the 1950s annual maxima were found to be increasing at only 8 sites compared to decreasing at 44 sites with similar trends for the 90th percentile zhang et al 2016 likewise using a larger and longer data set 26 of sites across australia showed statistically significant decreasing trends and only 6 showed statistically significant increasing trends at the 10 level ishak et al 2013 with trends in extreme flow difficult to identify villarini et al 2009a due to the high noise to signal ratio hall et al 2014 coupled with the complex rainfall streamflow relationship reasons for the apparent inconsistency between decreases in flow peaks with increasing rainfalls are difficult to establish sharma et al 2018 for example although increased pluvial flooding will largely be caused by increased rainfall intensities the catchment response will also be influenced by changes in the pattern lochbihler et al 2017 wasko et al 2016 wasko and sharma 2015 duration prein et al 2017 and frequency molnar et al 2015 of the rainfall changes to the vegetation ajami et al 2017 and changes in the soil moisture in the catchment prior to the rainfall event ivancic and shaw 2015 stephens et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017a will also change the resultant flood magnitude as the 99th percentile of rainfall only led to a corresponding 99th percentile discharge 36 of the time across the contiguous united states ivancic and shaw 2015 changes in rainfall may not be very well related well to changes in flooding disregarding catchment land use change and other exogenous non stationary factors unrelated to climate change the response of a catchment to flood producing rainfall depends on a the flood producing rainfall from the storm event and b the antecedent conditions or moisture state of the catchment bennett et al 2018 boughton and droop 2003 hettiarachchi et al 2019 ivancic and shaw 2015 kuczera et al 2006 pathiraja et al 2016 saft et al 2016 stephens et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017a case studies abound that focus on rainfall and soil moisture in studying runoff generation houser et al 2000 lana renault et al 2007 penna et al 2011 saffarpour et al 2016 and this corroborates with the observation that changes in the timing of flooding are well correlated to either changes in the soil moisture changes in rainfall or changes in snowmelt blöschl et al 2017 although the reasons behind changes in flooding are likely to be changes in the rainfall or snow causing the flood or the soil moisture conditions prior to the event there is little research on how changing antecedent soil moisture conditions might be modulating changes in flooding there are few studies looking at the changes in antecedent soil moisture directly and studies that have investigated changes in antecedent rainfall have found mixed responses worldwide woldemeskel and sharma 2016 it has been postulated that recent historical decreases in flood magnitude are due to decreases in soil moisture sharma et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017a but this is yet to be confirmed using trends in extreme flows the rainfall causing the flow and the soil moisture prior to the storm event we try to answer the question why have flood magnitudes decreased across australia 2 data compilation streamflow data is obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology s hydrologic reference stations hrs the hrs have been determined to be high quality reference stations in catchments that are largely unimpacted by impoundments and diversions and hence are recommended for the analysis and detection of streamflow trends and climatic variability zhang et al 2016 the original data set consisted of 222 stations but since inception one station has been removed further in this analysis six catchments with areas over 20 000 km2 were omitted as the lag time from rainfall to streamflow exceeded five days and made them unsuitable for analysis finally two arid stations were omitted as rainfall rarely results in streamflow in total 213 stations were chosen for analysis the location of these streamflow gauges i e catchment outlets their respective catchment areas and the köppen climate classification peel et al 2007 is presented in fig 1 the majority of sites have catchment area less than 1000 km2 and are often referred in the hydrologic literature as relatively small natural catchments there is a general climatic shift in australia from north to south with winter dominated rainfall in the temperate south and summer dominated rainfall in the north the streamflow gauges are disturbed across different climate zones with catchments located in the tropical north subtropical east coast through to the mild temperate and cool climatic conditions further south there are few sites in the drier arid areas away from the coast for the analysis here only entire calendar years of record were used station record lengths vary between sites with the earliest year on record 1950 and the last year on record 2014 the record lengths are relatively long with the majority of sites having record lengths exceeding 40 years and a median record length of 45 years fig 2 in order to examine the relative importance of rainfall and antecedent soil moisture conditions on the trends in streamflow and flooding the streamflow data needs to be paired with catchment rainfall and catchment soil moisture catchment boundaries previously used successfully were adopted here fowler et al 2018 2016 the catchment boundaries were derived using elevation data from shuttle radar topography mission srtm data on a grid size of 1 s approximately thirty metres these catchment boundaries were used to extract catchment average rainfall from the australian water availability project awap which is a high quality gridded rainfall data set on a grid size of 0 05 or approximately 5 km jones et al 2009 this product has extensively been used in hydrologic studies nathan and mcmahon 2017 and has been evaluated for use in the analysis of extreme rainfalls nathan et al 2016 catchment average soil moisture was extracted from the australian bureau of meteorology australian water resources assessment landscape awra l product awra l is a daily distributed water balance model that uses the same grid as awap viney et al 2015 to produce soil moisture and streamflow estimates across australia this model has been evaluated against observed in situ soil moisture from multiple locations and found to have strong agreement correlation in many cases exceeding the performance of satellite remote sensed observations holgate et al 2016 consistent with available knowledge hill et al 2016 hill and thomson 2016 the 0 1 m soil moisture data was extracted from awra l as it has been identified to be most correlated with catchment flood response 3 methods of analysis 3 1 event extraction rainfall events were chosen based on a peaks over threshold algorithm where individual events were identified as being separated by 1 day of zero rainfall all catchment average rainfall below 1 mm was assumed to be zero using this procedure for choosing rainfall events resulted in events separated by 4 5 days on average corresponding well to the independence criterion for storm events across australia xuereb and green 2012 the streamflow corresponding to the rainfall was chosen as the flow which commenced on the day of the first day of rainfall and continued five days after the end of the rainfall event or until the next rainfall event commenced this duration was based on a correlation analysis between the rainfall and streamflow which showed the majority of stations had a peak lag correlation of one day with a maximum peak lag correlation of 4 days the time window adopted to select streamflow was hence assumed sufficient to ensure that the flood peak from the storm event was captured the antecedent soil moisture was chosen as the soil moisture on the day immediately before the start of the rainfall for each station only events above a threshold which ensured an average of five events per year were analysed so a site with 45 years of record would have a threshold selected such that the largest 225 events were chosen this approach is equivalent to selecting data for a peak over threshold frequency analysis in which the most frequent quantile of interest is an event with an average recurrence interval of around 2 3 months the threshold for choosing events was based on the peak daily rainfall intensity within the event the sampling frequency of five events pear year was subsequently varied to assess trends in flood peaks over a range of severities the variables retained for further analysis from each event were the peak rainfall intensity with the storm termed peak rainfall the peak flow following the storm termed peak flow and the antecedent moisture on the day before the rainfall event commenced termed soil moisture the storm volume that is the sum of the rainfall event was also retained and is commented on in the discussions the variables chosen for analysis are those most commonly studied and those we believe can be derived with confidence for example trends in rainfall or flow are generally reported as trends in the maximum peak rates and not volumes as the start and end of a streamflow event is more arbitrary the focus here remains on the peak flow the peak flow recorded as a result of the rainfall event had its baseflow removed using a recursive digital filter furey and gupta 2001 lyne and hollick 1979 details of the implementation can also be found in ladson et al 2013 and the parameters used for the filter are as per those recommended in nathan and mcmahon 1990 3 2 analysis of event statistics and trends the association between variables was investigated using a pearson correlation coefficient trends were analysed using a linear regression with the variable of interest as the independent response variable yi and time ti in the units of days as the dependent variable peak rainfall and peak flow were transformed into the logarithmic domain to ensure normality of residuals and zero flows were set as the minimum recorded flow to allow for log transformation for peak flow and peak rainfall the following function was used 1 log 10 y i β 0 β 1 t i where i 1 m and m is the total number of samples for the site location and yi represents either flow or rainfall the regression coefficients β 0 and β 1 represent a constant and the linear change in the response variable per unit change in time t respecitvely to find the trend per decade δ 10 y as a percentage the following transformation was required to the slope where n is the number of days in 10 years 2 δ 10 y 100 10 n β 1 1 soil moisture did not require transformation and hence the trend is simply reported as the slope β 1 of the fitted regression multiplied by the number of days in 10 years to report the trend per decade 3 3 analysis of trends for rare events quantile regression koenker 2013 koenker and bassett 1978 was used to investigate trends for recurrence intervals beyond the sampling frequency quantile regression has successfully been used to investigate the association of extreme rainfall to temperature wasko and sharma 2014 and investigate trends in precipitation tan and shao 2017 and streamflow yin et al 2018 using the same terminology as above quantile regression can be expressed as per equation 1 but a cost function d is used to minimize deviation from the quantile q of interest that is for a regression of the form 3 y i β 0 q β 1 q t i the regression coefficents β 0 q and β 1 q are chosen to minimize a cost function d defined as 4 d β 0 q β 1 q q y i β 0 q β 1 q t i y i β 0 q β 1 q t i 1 q y i β 0 q β 1 q t i y i β 0 q β 1 q t i a choice of 0 5 for the quantile corresponds to the median tendency between the dependent variable ti and response yi in this way by setting quantiles above 0 5 we can investigate trends beyond the average samplying frequency a recurrence interval was assigned to the rainfall using the following equation stedinger et al 1993 5 q 1 λ l n t a t a 1 where q is the quantile of interest λ is the average number of events per year and ta is the annual return period this equation is equivalent to adoption of the weibull plotting position which minimizes bias in the estimated exceedance probability rather than the magnitude of the quantiles 4 results 4 1 correlation of key variables we first reaffirm the assertion that flood response is related to the corresponding peak rainfall and soil moisture fig 3 presents the correlation of the flood peak with peak rainfall and soil moisture stratified on catchment area for small catchments less than 100 km2 fig 3a the peak rainfall is almost always positively correlated with the flood peak with a median correlation of 0 5 similarly the soil moisture also has median correlation of 0 5 with the peak flow although there is some evidence of greater correlations with soil moisture than peak rainfall this evidence is limited as both peak rainfall and soil moisture have similar median correlations with peak flow for larger catchments with area between 100 and 1000 km2 fig 3b and above 1000 km2 fig 3c the median correlation between the peak rainfall and peak flow is below 0 5 while the correlation between the peak flow and soil moisture is now greater than 0 5 for this catchment size and event frequency soil moisture now plays a greater role in modulating flood response than rainfall as the interquartile ranges overlap less as catchment size increases it can be argued that that soil moisture becomes progressively more important to the streamflow response as catchment size increases note that using a spearman s rank correlation gave similar results the modulating effect of the soil moisture on flood peak is examined further in fig 4 peak rainfall peak flow and soil moisture are all converted to non dimensional units to allow pooling of information from different sites the peak rainfall and peak flow are divided by the mean at that site while the soil moisture is divided by the maximum the x axis shows increasing rainfall the y axis increasing flow and the surface is an average of the soil moisture for low rainfalls the flood response varies from low to zero flow conditions to close to the maximum flow recorded for that site this difference in response is highly dependent on the soil moisture conditions for a low rainfall the soil moisture must be wet for a large flow event to be recorded and dry for a small flow event to be recorded the streamflow response is very strongly dominated by the soil moisture conditions conversely it is seen that high rainfalls almost always result in a large flood response at this point the soil moisture on average is neither in a wet or dry state the occurrence of high rainfall is hence independent of the soil moisture the catchment response can also be described by using the flow axis as the basis for discussion a high flow can occur when the catchment is wet or dry but if the catchment is dry a high rainfall is required to produce a high flow alternatively if the catchment is wet a flood can occur even from a relatively small rainfall this demonstrates two important points namely 1 that the relationship between rainfall and streamflow is highly non linear and is modulated significantly by the catchment soil moisture state and 2 the relationship between rainfall and streamflow varies with rainfall severity that is the more severe the rainfall event the less of a modulating effect soil moisture has on the resultant flow see also bennett et al 2018 4 2 correlation of trends using an average frequency of five events per year the trend in the peak rainfall peak flow and soil moisture for each station is presented in fig 5 in the north west of australia more stations have increasing trends in rainfall than decreasing trends however along the east coast north to south the peak rainfall at the majority of sites is decreasing fig 5a in the south of australia again increasing trends are dominant no dominant trend is observed on the south east coast overall the rainfall trend results are mixed 50 of sites positive 50 of sites negative and there are few significant sites only 12 of the entire sample at a 10 significance level the peak flow trends differ greatly from the peak rainfall trends there is some evidence of increasing peak flows across the northern latitudes fig 5b different from the peak rainfall fig 5a which did not exhibit increases particularly on the north east coast along all the east and west coasts of australia the flow trend is overwhelmingly negative fig 5b over half the trends displayed are statistically significant 52 and almost all of these are negative in fact 87 of the sites display decreasing trends and the magnitude of the decreases is much larger than those displayed in the peak rainfall there is no clear correspondence between the trend in the rainfall fig 5a and flow fig 5b across australia particularly in the south the soil moisture trends fig 5c however mimic the peak flow trends more closely the percentage of sites with negative trend is 68 which is closer to the number of sites that had negative trends in the peak flow compared to the peak rainfall a slightly greater number of sites that have decreasing soil moisture trends are statistically significant compared to those sites with positive trends across the north of australia the soil moisture trends are more positive than negative which is consistent with the trends in peak flows fig 5b along the south east coast the soil moisture results are mixed but in the south the trends are negative and this matches the direction of the flow trend this is in contrast to peak rainfall which was increasing in the south fig 5a trends in south west australia have little statistical significance but there are more negative than positive trends in soil moisture fig 5c and this corresponds more to the majority negative trends in the peak flow fig 5b than majority positive trends in peak rainfall fig 5a visually there is evidence to support the assertion that trends in rainfall extremes and antecedent moisture conditions are correlated to the trend in the peak flow but the results are not clear and vary spatially fig 5 to paint a clearer picture we present the trends fig 5 as a scatter plot fig 6 in the left column fig 6a d are scatter plots of peak flow and peak rainfall trends while in the right column fig 6e h are scatter plots of peak flow and soil moisture trends the rows represent varying sampling frequencies previously we sampled to ensure an average of 5 events per year but now we sample partial duration series of varying sample size frequency the first row fig 6a and e has a sampling frequency of 1 event per year notionally equivalent to annual maxima and this increases through 2 events per year fig 6b and f 5 events per year fig 6c and g and 10 events per year fig 6d and h in this way we have relatively infrequent events at the top corresponding to trends in annual maxima analogous to most published literature through to very frequent events occurring approximately once a month the colour scale indicates the latitude allowing placement of the sites as it was noted previously that more northern sites exhibit positive trends in peak flow compared to southern sites which exhibit more negative trends we begin by discussing the trends for an average sampling frequency of 5 events per year that were presented in fig 5 and are now presented as a scatter plot in fig 6c and g there is little evidence that peak flow trends are related to peak rainfall the correlation of the peak rainfall and peak flow trends is low 0 11 we can see that for some of the sites in the north pink dots they have both positive flow trends and positive rainfall trends but overall the dependency in the trends is low conversely the correlation between the soil moisture trends and flow trends fig 6g is reasonably good 0 48 there is some indication of a regional dependence in that positive soil moisture trends are more common at the northern latitudes but overall the site location tends to be scattered as the event frequency increases 10 events per year similar correlations between the trends are obtained however the clustering of sites with positive soil moisture trends now appears visually stronger fig 6h more sites in the tropics appear to have positive or near zero soil moisture trends and corresponding positive peak flow trends so for events that occur multiple times a year we can conclude that changes in antecedent moisture are dominating the flood response and trends in peak rainfall are having a much lesser effect on the trend in the peak flow moving to more infrequent rare events the situation starts to change for a sampling frequency of 2 events per year fig 6b and f the correlation between the peak flow and peak rainfall is now 0 30 which is much greater than observed for the more frequent sampling discussed previously the correlation of the peak flow and soil moisture is still similar but the spread of points is now larger as the event frequency is reduced the trend in the peak rainfall may be having more of an influence on the peak flow trend but even at this point when the events are reasonably rare 2 per year soil moisture trends appear more important as evidenced by the higher correlation between the peak flow and soil moisture trend it is only when we begin to sample the most rare events 1 per year that the trend in peak flow appears to be more correlated with the peak rainfall than the antecedent soil moisture the peak flow trend correlation with peak rainfall is 0 51 fig 6a whereas the correlation with soil moisture 0 32 fig 6e at this sampling frequency any spatial dependence in the trends appears to be lost no longer are positive soil moisture trends clustering around the northern parts of australia nor is there any noticeable spatial clustering of the peak rainfall trends 4 3 trends in rare events the use of quantile regression allows us to assign a recurrence interval to trends beyond the mean sampling frequency using the sample of five events per year we apply quantile regression using various percentiles and calculate corresponding recurrence intervals extrapolating to the most extreme trends is subject to considerable uncertainty but despite inhomogeneity in trends across australia fig 6a and e suggest that the antecedent soil moisture and peak rainfall trends show no spatial dependence for the rarest events for the purposes here the trend in each variable is calculated at each site individually these trends are then assumed to be part of a homogenous sample and the mean of the trends at each site is presented as the thick line in fig 7 against the recurrence interval in years ari the soil moisture trend on average is negative and independent of ari this is consistent with the results presented in fig 4 there is no physical argument that supports the assertion that soil moisture should vary with event recurrence as events are chosen on the basis of rainfall severity and the antecedent soil moisture conditions should be independent for more comment events recurrence intervals less than 2 years peak rainfall does not show either increasing or decreasing trend however as the ari increases the peak rainfall trend also increases up to a mean decadal trend in the order of 2 3 per decade for ari s 10 years or over what is most interesting is the mean peak flow trend for the more common events average flows are decreasing and this decrease is very large in comparison to the change in the peak rainfall even at the 5 year recurrence interval there is still on average a 4 decrease in the peak flow per decade it is only at the 10 year ari that the average peak flow begins to increase and only for the most extreme flows 40 year ari is the peak flow trend similar in magnitude to the peak rainfall trend the notion that trends in extreme rainfall translate to trends in flooding is not supported by the evidence presented here only for aris above 10 years do peak flow trends start to increase alongside increasing peak rainfall this suggests that decreases in soil moisture drying soils may be the driving factor for changes in more common flood events 5 physical interpretation and implications it has been postulated that depending on how rare the storm event is higher temperatures will result in higher rainfalls but not necessarily higher flows due to reductions in soil moisture sharma et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017a the more extreme the event and the larger the rainfall the less important changes in antecedent moisture conditions are in modulating the response to increased rainfall bennett et al 2018 the results presented here confirm that there is a likely tipping point in severity where changes in soil moisture no longer have a dominant influence on the resulting changes in flow and below this tipping point flood magnitudes decrease due to decreases in soil moisture here peak rainfall and soil moisture were used as the primary explanatory variables for changes in flood magnitude for more frequent events greater than or equal to 2 events per year the soil moisture trend was the dominant factor explaining the trend in the magnitude of peak flow it was only for events of rarity in the order of the annual maxima that peak rainfall trends started to correlate well with peak flow trends as discussed in the introduction there are a range of variables which will affect peak flow e g guo et al 2018 johnson et al 2016 hence the analysis was repeated using storm volume in place of peak rainfall the storm volume was calculated by summing all the rainfall which occurred as part of the rainfall event when storm volume was used as an explanatory variable it was found that the results were almost identical to those for the peak rainfall in fact the correlations presented in fig 6 were almost identical regardless of whether peak rainfall trends or storm volume trends were correlated to peak flows this is expected as storm volume is very highly correlated to the peak rainfall contained in a storm the choice to focus on peak rainfall in presenting results was a pragmatic one as most trend studies focus on peak rainfall intensities it is of interest to discuss the results presented in context of historical studies analysis of australian flow trends using annual maxima found increasing trends in the tropics and decreasing trends in the southern latitudes ishak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 those results are replicated in general here using more frequent sampling consistent with results presented in zhang et al 2016 where similar trends were presented for less extreme quantiles however linking the fact that increases in floods are more likely to be found in the tropics to climatic factors is difficult it is increasingly evident that rainfall extremes are increasing across australia alexander and arblaster 2017 guerreiro et al 2018 westra and sisson 2011 though not all studies find evidence of an increase jakob and walland 2016 but peak flow trends do appear to exhibit universal increasing trends in the tropics with strong evidence of decreasing trends in the south of australia due to intensification of the hadley circulation mitas and clement 2005 seidel et al 2008 there has been a resulting increase in mean rainfall in the tropics and a decrease in the subtropics csiro bom 2016 head et al 2014 for more common events these increases in average rainfalls in the tropics may result in soil moisture increases prior to the storm event causing increases in the runoff which is not observed elsewhere in australia this is a simplified explanation as it does not account for dependencies which might exist such as those between the spells of rainfall pui et al 2012 which will subsequently also affect the antecedent conditions wasko et al 2015 nevertheless there is a suggestion that changes in mean rainfall may be indicative of changes in soil moisture which have a resulting influence on changes in peak flows trends in flooding are also related to the catchment area it was found that the proportion of catchments showing increases in the annual maximum flow increases as catchment size is reduced do et al 2017 likewise when the sensitivity of flooding to temperature was analysed it was the smaller catchments that were more likely to see increases in flooding with higher temperatures wasko and sharma 2017a some evidence that soil moisture conditions play a greater role in modulating flood response in larger catchments than smaller catchments was presented here fig 3 with higher correlations for peak flows with soil moisture than peak rainfalls for larger catchments but as there was overlap between the interquartile ranges for the correlations between peak flow with peak rainfall and soil moisture for catchments less than 1000 km2 this suggests that both antecedent moisture and rainfall have equal importance in modulating streamflow response for events occurring multiple times a year the results presented in fig 6a and 6e evidence that the antecedent soil moisture and peak rainfall trends show little spatial dependence for the rarest events this is consistent with guerreiro et al 2018 where there does not appear to be any spatial dependence in trends in annual rainfall maxima as a result to extrapolate to aris greater than one year we used quantile regression and aggregated the results the lack of a uniform trend in peak rainfall for events less than a 2 year recurrence fig 7 is consistent with some studies jakob and walland 2016 but not the majority of evidence which suggests increasing annual maxima daily rainfall guerreiro et al 2018 westra et al 2013 however for more extreme events on average a 2 3 increase in the extreme rainfall was observed per decade if we adopt an extreme rainfall increase of 2 5 per decade and apply this to the average increase in temperatures of 0 1 0 2 c per decade over australia since 1950 head et al 2014 hughes 2003 the trends presented here correspond to an increase in rainfall intensities of 12 5 25 0 c well in excess of the theoretical predictions of 7 c trenberth et al 2003 the rate of increase found here uses daily rainfall whereas previously such high rates of increases in rainfall extremes were only been identified in sub daily rainfall guerreiro et al 2018 westra and sisson 2011 this confirms that the most extreme rainfall events those well beyond annual maxima in severity may be the most likely to be increasing wasko and sharma 2017b decreasing antecedent soil moisture is consistent with the general drying trends in soil moisture that are both observed and predicted albergel et al 2013 collins et al 2013 jung et al 2010 though trends in soil moisture can be expected to vary spatially albergel et al 2013 the average decreasing trend in flood magnitude presented here is consistent with the fact that more sites throughout australia ishak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 and the world do et al 2017 exhibit decreasing flow magnitudes as compared to increases we need to stress that these decreases in flow magnitude even for events with a return interval of several years is only likely in undeveloped catchments in urban areas where little pervious surfaces exist and much of the catchment is directly connected to the catchment outlet increases in rainfall will result in increased flood magnitudes hettiarachchi et al 2018 villarini et al 2009b vogel et al 2011 finally a comment on some of the assumptions made in this study we sample to ensure an average number of events per year this is different from the generally adopted sampling of annual maxima for trend analysis but has the advantage of aiding investigation over a range of severities our sampling method may result in a different number of events in each calendar year but inspection of the time series showed that events tend to be uniformly spread throughout the duration of the time series moreover repeating the analysis by picking the largest 5 events in a given year as opposed to ensuring an average of 5 events per year did not change the conclusions presented here the analysis presented fitted a log linear relationship to the peak flow and peak rainfall and a linear relationship to the soil moisture in sensitivity testing both regression in the log space and linear space were tested for all variables and gave similar results the adopted form of regressions here were those that best fit the variable of interest removal of baseflow also introduces uncertainty but again we note that when baseflow was not removed from the peak flows the conclusions did not change 6 conclusions despite more sites around the world presenting increases in rainfall extremes than decreases the opposite is true for flood magnitudes with more sites exhibiting decreases rather than increases in flooding australia s climate is no different despite evidence for increased rainfall intensities more flow gauges show decreases in flood magnitude than an increase as pluvial flooding by its very nature is dependent on rainfall this leads to the question of why an inconsistency exists between changes in extreme rainfall and flooding by using a peaks over threshold methodology to sample rainfall and streamflow events of varying frequency we were able to show that trends in flood magnitude depend on both trends in rainfall and trends in antecedent soil moisture with decreasing soil moisture the likely cause for decreased flooding of more common events only for the rarest events was it found that trends in flow magnitude are more likely to follow trends in extreme rainfalls hence future research should focus on understanding both changes in rainfall and soil moisture when projecting flooding for climatic change declaration of competing

6356,there is a need for enhanced guidance in siting distributed infiltrative green infrastructure gi practices especially in densely developed urban watersheds where retrofits come at a high cost to maximize the hydrologic benefit of gi practices on urban streams the disconnection of effective impervious areas eia or those impervious areas hydraulically connected to the stormwater network has been identified as a strategic management approach that is expected to have the greatest impact the overall effect of full disconnection of spatially identified eia on watershed hydrology is uncertain because this type of full disconnection is rarely brought to full scale implementation in this study spatial eia identification is used to parametrize an urban runoff model using the united states environmental protection agency s storm water management model swmm the calibrated model is used to assess runoff reductions resulting from gi practices distributed through the watershed via different placement strategies both spatially informed and not full treatment of the spatially identified eia using bioretention cells was compared to two scenarios treating the same area of impervious surfaces but with random placement either among all impervious areas or placement focused in areas of higher imperviousness model results indicate that substantially higher runoff reduction could be realized by targeting eia with a median runoff reduction of nearly 30 more than other treatment scenarios across storm events ranging from 1 27 to 20 7 mm using this strategic siting further improvements in optimizing distributed infiltrative gi practice placement are needed and targeting of spatially identified eia appears to be a viable method for increasing the hydrologic improvements realized through watershed scale implementations keywords stormwater green infrastructure distributed restoration effective impervious area 1 introduction in an effort to protect and restore ecological health and pre development hydrology in urban streams worldwide watershed managers seek to reinstate more natural flow regimes in highly developed watersheds streamflow has been recognized as a master variable defining ecological potential in riverine systems poff et al 1997 and the impacts of impervious surfaces on urban hydrology and a range of other symptoms of degradation have been well established brabec et al 2002 leopold 1968 shuster et al 2005 walsh et al 2005b the value of healthy streams as both financial and cultural assets assessment 2005 has led urban watershed managers to seek strategies that both maintain flood protection from stormwater but also undo the effects of intense development on local hydrology increasingly worldwide this is accomplished with distributed nature inspired infiltrative green infrastructure gi retrofits specifically these at source smaller scale infiltrative surface runoff treatment practices are being used in urban watersheds in attempts to restore pre development runoff frequencies and volumes bernhardt and palmer 2007 by shifting hydrology back to more natural patterns and addressing runoff production at the source it is believed that urban stream systems will have a better chance of supporting thriving ecosystems without the need for ongoing active channel restoration projects that is restoration efforts will better match the scale of the degrading process walsh et al 2005a research on the effectiveness of distributed gi practices to collectively produce this hydrologic shift at the watershed scale is limited and it remains as an important research focus area jefferson et al 2017 several studies have begun to add to the knowledgebase and demonstrated the complexities of managing urban runoff with distributed gi practices modeling has shown that site runoff dynamics are sensitive to the location type and number of practices installed gilroy and mccuen 2009 for instance comparisons of hydrologic response to rainfall for developed catchments with different stormwater management strategies centralized vs distributed revealed that distributed gi practices can yield more natural runoff dynamics than centralized stormwater systems loperfido et al 2014 a growing number of monitoring studies have also been conducted to measure the efficacy of distributed gi retrofit strategies at several different scales notably though not exhaustively these studies include investigation at the small residential scale 0 53 ha page et al 2015 larger development tracts 2 6 ha bedan and clausen 2009 and catchment wide studies with shepherd creek in cincinnati usa 180 ha roy et al 2014 shuster and rhea 2013 and little stringybark creek 450 ha in melbourne australia walsh et al 2015 additional examples are presented by jefferson et al 2017 the results of these studies indicate improvements in stated goals though they are difficult to compare due to differences in study approaches stormwater control measures scms employed the timeline of installation and siting strategies these are nonetheless valuable studies as the lack of adequate supporting evidence for distributed scms to effectively address watershed wide goals remains an impediment to widespread use of this multi benefit management strategy roy et al 2008 another impediment to wider use of distributed scm retrofits in existing urban areas is that these practices carry a higher cost related to land value in densely developed areas costs are further increased when you consider the opportunity costs of land used for stormwater management as opposed to other uses in the urban setting roy et al 2008 because of this distributed gi practices have mostly been sited in an opportunistic empirical manner where public land is available or where redevelopment occurs the high costs for urban retrofit projects warrants strategic siting of these practices so that they impart the greatest good to stream hydrology especially considering limited water resource budgets and increased urbanization barbosa et al 2012 research has shown that the effective impervious area eia a subset of the total impervious area tia representing the impervious areas hydraulically connected to the stormwater network has a much greater effect on stream hydrology than tia due to rapid surface drainage along hydraulically efficient stormwater infrastructure brabec et al 2002 shuster et al 2005 streams exhibit declining conditions as tia increases but these declines have been shown to be even more tightly coupled to increases in impervious connectivity i e a higher eia tia ratio hatt et al 2004 lee and heaney 2003 leopold 1968 walsh et al 2005b because of this the eia should be leveraged to optimize the hydrologic benefits of gi retrofits by intercepting runoff from these areas first and foremost however quantifying and identifying eia is more difficult than tia because it can be subject to ambiguous urban drainage patterns and variable conditions that influence runoff production alley and veenhuis 1983 boyd et al 1993 1994 brabec et al 2002 chiew and mcmahon 1999 ebrahimian et al 2016a han and burian 2009 although disconnection of eia by implementation of gi practices can theoretically maximize the effectiveness of watershed restoration efforts rapid and reliable identification of these areas is often time consuming roy and shuster 2009 recently developed methodology by epps and hathaway 2018 provides spatially explicit identification of eia that is informed by geospatial data and observed runoff trends the results of this method account for spatial differences in runoff pathways and land cover along these pathways to identify areas most likely to be eia in a gis framework that can be used to prioritize stormwater management projects for runoff reduction this method epps and hathaway 2018 uses eia quantity estimates from rainfall runoff data analysis that build upon the work of boyd et al 1993 and ebrahimian et al 2016b these quantity estimates for eia are then spatially identified with gis flowpath analysis that differentiates impervious areas based on the connectivity of runoff produced by them via interceding surfaces and infrastructure towards the watershed outlet calibration is accomplished using a runoff attenuation parameter varying this until the spatially identified eia quantity matches the quantity estimate from the observed data readers are encouraged to read epps and hathaway 2018 for further methodology details and a discussion of the limits of the results the requirement of gaging a watershed to produce these results is a strong limitation on this methodology but efforts are underway to investigate how this approach can be adapted to be used on ungaged watersheds determining the connectivity or lack thereof of rooftops is a concern with geospatial approaches to eia identification another area for future research a final limitation is that it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the results of this new methodology or determine what the hydrologic effects might be given implementation of gi retrofits as full disconnection of the eia with these would take several years modeling can provide an initial means to assess the potential for this type of watershed wide deployment of gi retrofits assess how targeting spatially identified eia for disconnection compares to other less spatially guided strategies and determine what level of changes in storm event response should be expected given watershed wide implementation one of the most widely used urban stormwater runoff models is the united states environmental protection agency s epa stormwater management model swmm rossman 2004 like most urban runoff models swmm is very sensitive to impervious parameter inputs the need for accurate representation of impervious characteristics in urban runoff models has been noted in particular in relation to eia alley and veenhuis 1983 lee and heaney 2003 a recent review of research applying swmm to urban hydrologic investigations and the modeling of management paradigms for planning and decision making niazi et al 2017 has identified several gaps and opportunities for future studies to strengthen the use of this model this review points to the gap in knowledge in accounting for hydrologic continuity and gi spatial orientation as one of the most important foci for future research due to the importance of assessing different gi retrofit configurations to support current urban watershed management approaches incorporating spatially identified eia information into a swmm model to compare different siting strategies for gi retrofits forms the basis of the study presented here results can be used to guide better approaches for assessing distributed restoration initiatives optimized gi planning and the potential performance related to locational siting and configuration on a watershed scale basis this information will be pursued in this study using swmm to model first creek a large urban watershed in knoxville tn this will help determine what level of runoff reduction may be possible by installing gi practices strategically to disconnect eia and how this targeted strategy using spatially identified eia compares to runoff reductions using less informed spatial siting for the same level of treatment with gi 1 1 objectives the main goal of this study is to utilize the spatial identification of eia areas from epps and hathaway 2018 to assess the runoff volume reduction that might be realized given targeted application of gi practices to these locations results will be compared to other scenarios of similar treatment level that use different criteria for site selection not related to eia location to help quantify the potential advantage of using this spatial eia information a secondary goal is to verify the importance of the results of spatial eia identification using the methods of epps and hathaway 2018 pertaining to the use of this high resolution data this will be accomplished by assessment of model results and discussion of this important modeling parameter and its use in swmm as it relates to surface runoff and gi models 2 methods 2 1 study site and data the focus of this study was the first creek watershed in knoxville tn united states fig 1 first creek is a mixed development watershed 5320 ha with an upland tributary that runs through rural areas with sparse residential development and some agricultural lands and a main stem that flows through a densely developed urban corridor following a main arterial road with flood protection channelization watershed statistics have been summarized in fig 1 eia quantity estimates were developed from rainfall runoff data using rainfall and streamflow records for the period of march 2011 june 2014 from the city of knoxville stormwater engineering department epps and hathaway 2018 rainfall data 15 min timestep was obtained from three locations near the first creek watershed and storm event depths for the watershed were calculated based on a thiessen polygon weighted average storm events with total rainfall depth above 1 27 mm and below 25 4 mm with at least 6 h of separation from any additional rainfall were considered in the analysis local stormwater management goals require capture of runoff from the first 25 4 mm of rainfall for any size event focus on events of this size or smaller will demonstrate how distinctions in gi retrofit placement impact runoff capture for the storm events of this size or less additionally this event size is approximately equal to the 90th percentile storm event size for the region sylvester et al 2016 storm events were further screened for use in gi modeling using best professional judgement to focus on events where all rainfall fell mostly in close temporal succession 12 h or less to focus on simpler single peaked hydrographs with a more uniform runoff response over the watershed while it has been shown that the effectiveness of gi practices can be greatly reduced for subsequent peaks of complex storms versini et al 2016 these dynamics are better explored in studies of scm design effectiveness the stipulation for simpler single peaked events is made in this study to reduce temporal rainfall effects on scm performance and focus on differences in spatial distribution as much as possible in evaluating differences between placement scenarios from the full record of data 68 distinct rain events were identified nine of these were removed because they exceeded 25 4 mm in depth and 19 events were removed because they had multiple peaks the largest storm in the remaining 40 events to be analyzed was 20 7 mm of the 40 events 20 were less than 6 mm in depth 11 events were in the range of 6 12 mm and 9 events were larger than 12 mm direct runoff depths for these storm events were estimated by hydrograph separation using the constant k method of blume et al 2007 this method assumes that baseflow discharges from a linear reservoir with exponential decline such that the point on the receding limb of the hydrograph when the recession coefficient k becomes nearly constant represents the end of direct runoff and the streamflow s return to solely baseflow sources fig 2 the recession coefficient was calculated for all points on the receding limb of the storm event hydrographs via the equation from blume et al 2007 1 k dq dt q t flow data were assessed against the k coefficient data using a 2 h moving average to visually select the point in the receding limb of the hydrograph at which k stabilized to a near constant value this point in the hydrograph was then connected by straight line to the point just before hydrograph rise to complete hydrograph separation fig 2 the volume of water above this line was then summed and converted to a depth through division by the watershed area so that rainfall runoff trends could be used to quantify eia the quantity of eia in the first creek watershed was estimated in the same manner used in epps and hathaway 2018 employing regression analysis of rainfall runoff data by the methods of boyd et al 1993 and ebrahimian et al 2016 as a guide this eia quantity was used as a target for calibration of spatial eia models presented in epps and hathaway 2018 this spatial eia data both 1 forms the impervious connectivity input for a swmm model as opposed to using impervious connectivity as a calibration parameter and 2 is the focal point of various scm siting methodologies that are compared herein to evaluate how volumetric runoff reduction varies based on restoration approach spatial differences in the ratio of eia tia as a measure of impervious connectivity for the first creek watershed are shown in fig 1 summarized at the subcatchment level used in the swmm model 2 2 surface runoff model a previously developed swmm model for first creek was provided by the city of knoxville stormwater engineering for this study this model had been developed for flooding analysis and did not include a groundwater component because the goal of the study was to assess the representation of impervious connectivity and the disconnection of eia using gi retrofits as they pertain to surface runoff the development of a groundwater component was deemed unnecessary the existing swmm model disaggregated the first creek watershed into 125 subcatchments based on infrastructure location and grouping of homogeneous surface cover and topography all surveyed channel information stormwater infrastructure hydraulic parameterization and internal storage portions of the model were preserved for this study subcatchment boundaries were also preserved and the impervious area for each subcatchment was updated to ensure model parameters were consistent with high resolution data used by the spatial eia models 2 3 swmm model setup and parameterization aside from subcatchment geospatial data the swmm model parameters were adapted based on guidance from swmm documentation rossman and huber 2016 the green ampt method was used to represent infiltration in the model and runoff routing was modeled using the kinematic wave approximation rainfall observations 15 min timestep from the three tipping bucket gages fig 1 used in eia quantity estimation were used in the model being assigned to subcatchments based on which representative thiessen polygon area for the three gages that the subcatchment was located in model parameters were developed from literature values in most cases though a few were based on the assumptions of the spatial eia model table 1 infiltration parameters for the green ampt model were taken from literature values based on subcatchment soil properties obtained from the national resources conservation service s ssurgo soil survey database ssurgo 2017 the distribution of each subcatchments soils among different hydrologic soil groups hsg was used to produce weighted values for the literature based green ampt parameters average monthly evaporation values were used for evapotranspiration modeling and derived from pan evaporation measurements for local gages in eastern tennessee farnsworth and thompson 1983 impervious routing parameters were parsed between tia and eia according to the amount of eia identified in each subcatchment from the previously described spatial models epps and hathaway 2018 for each subcatchment the eia was routed directly to the outlet while the balance of tia was routed to pervious areas representing the disconnected portion of impervious surfaces the original swmm model obtained from the city of knoxville had routed impervious and pervious areas directly to the outlet utilizing model calibration of other surface runoff parameters to achieve adequate model fitting the inclusion of the spatially identified eia routing is an improvement over this representation that reflects site specific impervious connectivity data and addresses a concern for swmm models as described by niazi et al 2017 2 4 model calibration and assessment surface runoff was modeled continuously and reported at a 15 min timestep over the period from march 2011 to june 2014 during which records for streamflow and three rain gages existed a subset of 40 of the identified storm events that had been used to estimate the watershed eia were selected for analysis of potential runoff volume reduction analysis of overall gi practice runoff reduction was constrained to these storms since larger storms would likely be associated with runoff from more than just eia areas this focus on storm events most likely producing runoff from just eia areas provides a greater assurance that different gi retrofit placement scenarios described more below will capture the differences in runoff reduction possible under strategic siting using spatial eia identification versus other less targeted guidance rainfall depths for these 40 storms ranged from 1 27 mm to 20 7 mm with an average storm size of 8 3 mm while more than 40 valid storm events occurred during the period of record only storms that had been identified to derive from predominantly eia in regression analysis were used modeled runoff from the equivalent timeframe of each of these observed storm events was summed to produce a runoff volume that was normalized to a depth over the watershed area for comparison to the observed runoff depth over the same equivalent timeframe model fit for storm event runoff depths was used for calibration and assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 simple manual calibration for selected storm event runoff volumes was performed to improve the swmm model fit by varying the starred parameters in table 1 between their high mean and low values identified in the literature to determine model sensitivity and provide a suitable model of surface runoff this calibration was simple in that the parameters for all 125 subcatchments were assigned the same value class low median high for the parameter of interest for each calibration iteration further calibration was not deemed necessary because the focus of the study was on gi practice placement a reasonably accurate runoff model provided a consistent baseline for these different gi practice placement scenarios to be studied and compared final model parameters are noted in bold table 1 calibration was assessed for the storm event runoff depths during 2011 2012 23 events and verified by the remaining event runoff depths during 2013 2014 17 events 2 5 green infrastructure scenarios to study differences in runoff reduction that may be realized given alternative approaches to scm application the calibrated swmm base model was used to assess runoff reduction under different siting strategies for gi retrofits in the first creek watershed since eia was estimated as 7 3 of the watershed this forms the targeted amount of impervious area to be treated by gi practices in all scenarios three scenarios of gi practice siting were compared and a schematic representation of these is shown in fig 3 the first scenario eia applied gi practices only to the spatially identified eia areas treating 7 3 of the watershed this represents the targeted scenario where spatial models of eia are used to identify locations for gi practices to disconnect eia runoff from the stream network the second scenario random distributed gi practices randomly by first using a random number generator to apportion the 7 3 treatment level amongst the subcatchments and then using a second random number generator to divide that apportioned percentage for a given subcatchment between eia and non eia areas subject to availability of each of these impervious types in this scenario it is assumed that the equivalent area of impervious surfaces 7 3 of the watershed are treated for disconnection but that the placement of practices among the tia is not guided by any spatial information i e random the third scenario tia weighted was guided by subcatchment imperviousness wherein the 7 3 treatment level was apportioned amongst subcatchments using a weighted average of the tia in each subcatchment to the overall watershed tia this tia weighted impervious percentage was then divided between eia and non eia areas in each subcatchment based on a random number generator this scenario represents an intermediate guidance strategy in which the treatment amount in each subcatchment is proportional to the tia distribution over the watershed but that there is no further spatial differentiation between eia and non eia areas receiving treatment this scenario was chosen as an intermediate level of spatial guidance since distributed gi retrofits are typically placed more often in the most highly impervious areas of a watershed this process was iterated for each alternative siting strategy random and tia weighted with different randomization to produce 30 different applications of gi practices for each to be compared to the eia focused siting strategy each of these scenarios was then modeled in swmm by placing practices appropriately within the model to identify differences in runoff reduction between each model median and maximum reductions over the 30 model iterations for each alternative siting strategy were then compared to the eia scenario results to assess differences in performance between the three this was done to compare both the average and the best performance for less spatially informed siting methods to quantify the advantage or lack thereof that utilizing spatial eia data might provide over the alternative siting scenarios runoff volume reductions were compared using a storm event pairwise wilcoxon signed rank test wilcoxon et al 1970 due to non normality to assess whether gi siting scenarios exhibited dissimilar runoff reductions on average and thus demonstrate whether a given siting strategy might be advantageous 2 6 green infrastructure modeling to apply the appropriate gi treatment in each scenario a generic bioretention cell was modeled to treat both eia and non eia impervious areas separately in each subcatchment bioretention cells were modeled using the lid editor in swmm version 5 1 a single lumped bioretention cell receiving runoff from each impervious area subset was modeled for a total of two bioretention cells per subcatchment and these were sized distinctly with enough storage to capture the runoff from a 25 4 mm storm for the given impervious area each was determined to treat parameterization of these bioretention cells is summarized in table 2 bioretention cells were sized vertically per guidance from municipal stormwater management manuals table 2 for each gi practice scenario the impervious surface area identified for treatment eia and non eia separately was used to calculate the runoff volume for a storm event of 25 4 mm the required surface area of bioretention cells to treat this amount of runoff was then calculated based on the total storage available in the bioretention cell to accommodate this volume swmm allows a given bioretention cell to receive runoff from a subset of the subcatchment impervious areas thus two bioretention cells were defined and sized for each subcatchment one for eia one for non eia and the appropriate percentage of the impervious area was routed to each based on the eia and non eia impervious areas to be treated in each scenario swmm also allows underdrain flow and excess water from the bioretention cell to be routed back to pervious areas or directly to the outlet this option was utilized to maintain the model representation of surface routing with the bioretention cell treating non eia routed to pervious areas and that treating eia routed to the outlet storm event runoff depths were calculated from model outputs and the percent runoff reduction was calculated by comparison to surface runoff depths for the base model with no gi practices the percent reduction of runoff for the 40 storm events was calculated for the 30 iterations in each alternative scenario to compare to the eia focused runoff reductions further pairwise comparison of storm event runoff reduction between the three siting strategies was then used to assess whether there were statistical differences this was done for all storm events as well as by three groupings of storm event size 6 mm 6 12 mm and 12 mm to aid in discussion of differences in runoff reduction by storm size these grouping represent storm sizes for the area of approximately 54 72 and 89 frequency ranks respectively fig 4 based on rain data from the tyson mcghee airport station for the years 1981 2010 and are consistent with the results presented in sylvester et al 2016 the eia scenario was compared to the median and maximum runoff reduction scenarios of the 30 randomizations for each of the random and tia weighted scenarios to demonstrate the range of performance and sensitivity to placement for these alternate siting strategies in comparison 3 results and discussion 3 1 swmm model results the base model performed well in matching storm event runoff volume given simple manual calibration model performance results over the entire period and the calibration and verification periods are summarized in table 3 and modeled runoff depth versus the observed runoff depth has been plotted in fig 5 the model typically performs well but shows some underprediction of larger storm events an expected outcome given the lack of a groundwater component within the model hydrograph separation distinguishes total runoff between a baseflow component and direct runoff the latter which may contain some portion of interflow or shallow subsurface return flow not related entirely to surface runoff dynamics beven 1989 this portion is not easily discernible through graphical analysis and may over estimate true surface runoff for any given event manual parameter adjustment for this swmm model used mean literature values as a starting point and adjusted parameters to minimum and maximum literature values for all subcatchments to identify the greatest sensitivities in the model for surface runoff to arrive at the final calibrated base model parameters that were adjusted in this process away from the mean value were all related to soils and pervious area runoff and the calibrated values were all on the low end of the literature ranges it is possible that this reflects the condition of urban soils which typically have poorer infiltration and thus contribute to greater surface runoff however this may also be due to the potential overestimate of surface runoff from the inclusion of interflow portion which is not included in the swmm model overall these results demonstrate that the model is well suited to serve as a basis for comparing runoff reduction between scm placement scenarios 3 2 spatial eia distribution among subcatchments the inclusion of spatially explicit estimates of eia that are informed by physical geography and hydrologic trends in this swmm model produced acceptable model results with only simple manual calibration eia has been identified as one of the most sensitive parameters in swmm models and its accurate representation in the model can allow more efficient and accurate calibration for other important urban runoff parameters in the model mancipe munoz et al 2014 comparing the spatially derived results of eia from epps and hathaway 2018 to those from literature regression estimates offers a demonstration of the range in eia values that varies based on the method of estimation which can greatly impact surface runoff modeling results a plot of the eia versus tia for the swmm model subcatchments fig 6 derived from spatial analysis in epps and hathaway 2018 demonstrates a very different relationship for the first creek watershed than predicted by literature regression equations sometimes used for eia estimation alley and veenhuis 1983 roy and shuster 2009 wenger et al 2008 this plot indicates that eia would be mostly overpredicted by regression equations for the first creek watershed especially for intermediate values of tia the use of these regression equations to predict eia in catchments other than where they were developed has been demonstrated to poorly reflect actual eia measurements roy and shuster 2009 while this is not the focus of this paper it demonstrates that the method utilized to estimate eia can vary greatly and because runoff modeling results are sensitive to this parameter it makes sense to use the most site specific information available spatial eia estimates used in this study were conducive to incorporation into swmm model subcatchment discretization for more accurate runoff production and routing information implemented within typical gis analysis for model parameterization they were easily summarized by subcatchment in the same way as tia typically is estimations of eia using regression equations developed elsewhere or by using eia as a model calibration parameter that is when it is one of many calibration parameters may provide a less accurate representation of impervious connectivity and urban runoff processes 3 3 runoff reduction for gi placement scenarios average percent runoff reductions achieved via different gi placement scenarios are summarized overall and by storm size groupings in table 4 these values represent the mean and median reductions by scenario and storm size for all modeled events 40 events for eia and the 30 randomization scenarios of 40 events for the alternative siting scenarios runoff reduction for the 40 storms are presented as boxplots to demonstrate differences in the range of values between gi siting strategies these have been summarized for both the median runoff reduction scenario for the random and tia weighted treatments over the 30 randomizations fig 7 and the maximum runoff reduction scenario over the 30 randomizations as well fig 8 the results of pairwise comparison for each grouping by the wilcoxon signed rank test wilcoxon et al 1970 are presented in table 5 for eia runoff reduction and the maximum runoff reductions under the 30 randomizations of the alternative strategies results indicate that focusing gi applications in locations identified as eia can result in greater runoff reduction especially for smaller storms up to 12 mm over all storm events gi placement focused on eia resulted in nearly 4 10 greater runoff reductions table 5 than those for less spatially guided strategies with an overall mean runoff reduction of 37 3 table 4 this is in comparison to mean reductions of 27 2 and 27 0 for the random and tia weighted placement scenarios over all storm events respectively the differences in runoff reduction when storms are partitioned by size offers insight on modeled runoff dynamics and the performance of gi treatment over a range of conditions this information can inform future model parameterization and utilization of this information for application of distributed gi practices in terms of runoff reduction potential and management strategies for smaller events 6 mm runoff reduction is highest when practices are placed according to spatially identified eia with a mean runoff reduction of 49 2 runoff from connected impervious surfaces during such events is well handled by the modeled bioretention cells and precipitation is sufficiently small that pervious areas do not likely produce substantial runoff if any this is important to note when you consider that the higher frequency of runoff from smaller storm events is one of the indicators of urban hydrologic regime shift substantially greater runoff reduction for small storm events using eia focused placement may have a large impact on decreasing runoff frequency overall while runoff would not be eliminated entirely the amount would be negligible considering the size of the events for intermediate events greater than 6 mm but less than 12 mm runoff reduction using eia focused siting was greater than the maximum tia weighted scenarios with an average runoff reduction of 32 2 but not statistically higher overall than the maximum runoff reductions for random siting scenarios while results were inconclusive for this intermediate range of storm sizes a comparison of eia runoff reductions and median runoff reductions for alternate strategies indicate that on average less spatially informed strategies resulted in approximately 7 less runoff reduction α 0 01 on average runoff reductions for these intermediate storm events were moderately greater for the eia treatment scenario though with diminishing returns relative to the smallest storms events in this size range are typically frequent especially in more humid climates like the southeastern united states full treatment of all eia with distributed practices could thus reduce runoff by greater than 30 annually for storms less than 12 mm in size while the magnitude of this reduction overall would be dependent on local precipitation frequencies it could represent a substantial amount of annual runoff reduction if a larger percentage of storm events for a given urban watershed were in this range when rainfall exceeded 12 mm runoff reductions appear to be greater when using eia focused siting based on mean and median percent reduction statistics table 4 however there was not a statistically significant difference in storm event runoff reduction between siting strategies at the α 0 05 confidence level there was greater variability in runoff reductions for eia treatment scenarios for these larger storm events than for the other storm size groupings and this is also evident in the random and tia weighted treatment scenarios one possible explanation for this could be the influence of antecedent moisture conditions and pervious areas on runoff production for larger storm events in the swmm model when rainfall exceeds infiltrative capacity pervious areas begin to produce runoff and this is more likely to occur for larger storm events further infiltrative capacity for pervious areas ranges based on soil moisture conditions and thus varies by storm event depending on recent rainfall this could also be related to performance of the bioretention cells as well for the same reasons since previous saturation may cause these practices to handle less runoff for storms falling in close temporal succession runoff from impervious areas routed onto pervious areas as in the case of non eia portions of the watershed would additionally influence soil saturation and further increase runoff from pervious areas for larger events for the eia treatment all runoff from non eia is routed to pervious areas without treatment for larger storms and especially those falling when soil saturation is higher due to recent rainfall all runoff from these non eia areas is routed to pervious areas in the swmm model which may produce runoff for these events this effect would be lessened in the random and tia weighted scenarios which treat a portion of non eia runoff and thus would contribute less to intra event pervious saturation for larger storms surface runoff thus becomes the sum of interactions between pervious conditions and surface runoff routing from different portions of the tia that are subject to a range in antecedent moisture conditions treatment location may become secondary to simply the level of treatment for maximum runoff reductions as pervious influences impact surface runoff more for these larger events this is also influenced by model parameterization and the scale of subcatchment disaggregation while the results of the study are specific to the specific watersheds they do indicate some advantage in targeting eia with gi practices over other siting strategies though the magnitude in other watersheds may be unclear despite this the results highlight important foci for research development in urban stormwater management planning and areas where improved data and model representation may be warranted 3 4 limitations and sources for error table 6 provides a summary of important assumptions uncertainties and sources of error in this study acknowledgement of the limitations of these findings serves to point to important opportunities for future research that this study hoped to illuminate while many of these have already been discussed throughout the text it is important to consider them together as they can have a compounding effect on the results each of the items in table 6 point to further lines of inquiry as watershed managers continue to improve data collection and modeling efforts in support of urban watershed management 3 5 modeling considerations and further opportunities while the results of this study indicate that utilizing spatial eia information for gi practice placement can result in greater runoff reduction some considerations should be made regarding model representation in table 6 that will point to areas for further study this modeling exercise utilized a single idealized bioretention cell for eia and non eia areas to represent runoff reduction potential given watershed wide application however the routing of runoff deriving from eia and non eia areas needs to be further studied considering the results for runoff reduction from larger storms model results suggests interactive effects in surface runoff processes as modeled that may be at play in urban hydrology however it could also be a function of the modeling structure itself or possibly the scale of subcatchment disaggregation and representation realistic application of gi practices in this watershed would likely necessitate the disaggregation of the idealized bioretention cells into smaller units that were further distributed within each subcatchment i e modeling at a finer scale for both the gi practices and their contributing watersheds to holistically model this interactivity at the watershed scale investigation of the relationship between groundwater conditions and surface runoff may also be warranted additionally bioretention may not always be the most applicable or feasible type of gi for all areas detention based gi may be more effective than infiltrative practices given certain site conditions and objectives and vice versa the use of a single type of gi practice with uniform design might be expanded in the future to assess how different gi types and designs might perform in conjunction with the additional information on runoff routing that is offered by the high resolution eia data another consideration is the feasibility for gi retrofits in areas identified as eia placement of gi where eia has been identified may not always be feasible due to site constraints not identified by the spatial model this could be related to poor infiltration rates difficult topography or adequate space for the first creek watershed 3 1 of the watershed was identified as eia in the public domain less than half of the total eia targeting these areas first for any gi retrofit efforts in the watershed would be a good strategy to begin implementation of distributed restoration efforts based on these modeling results this would represent the intersection of opportunistic gi applications with spatially informed siting that would provide watershed managers with the best hydrologic benefit for the watershed using readily available spaces for distributed restoration spatial eia models could then be revised given the added gi to reassess impervious connectivity and further identify areas where runoff reductions would be greatest given the disconnection of those where gi has been established over the timeline of implementation 4 conclusions there is a need to prioritize areas for gi retrofits in urban watersheds that enable cities to place often limited resources in areas where they will have the greatest impact on urban streams watershed assessment using high resolution geospatial data can provide robust information concerning priority areas for distributed watershed restoration when coupled with hydrologic information modeling that incorporates the best information from both of these sources can be used to assess management options and refine approaches in order to optimize results for urban watershed improvement the results of this study indicate that spatial eia information can be applied to a swmm model to adequately predict surface runoff using literature based parameters with simple manual calibration the calibrated model was used to investigate three gi placement scenarios the strategy specifically targeting eia within the watershed showed moderate differences in runoff reduction compared to more random gi placement strategies which treated both eia and less connected portions of tia the eia based strategy was estimated to average approximately 37 runoff reduction over all storm events at about 10 more than the other two methods however the difference between the siting strategies weakened as storm size increased indicating that treating effective impervious area is most advantageous for mitigating small frequent rainfall events further study is warranted in particular on watersheds with varying impervious connectivity and especially those with a very high eia tia ratio or where gi opportunities are constrained by dense development these results highlight the importance of focusing gi applications to areas identified as eia to optimize urban hydrologic benefits and point to how this methodology can help watershed managers prioritize restoration efforts further investigation with higher resolution runoff modeling should lead to management recommendations that fully account for the spatial variability of urban runoff production but this initial study demonstrates that the utilization of spatially identified eia data can be used as a basis for gi retrofit siting when runoff reduction is the primary objective declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge employees at the city of knoxville stormwater engineering for providing data and models that form the basis of this study this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant nos 1634975

6356,there is a need for enhanced guidance in siting distributed infiltrative green infrastructure gi practices especially in densely developed urban watersheds where retrofits come at a high cost to maximize the hydrologic benefit of gi practices on urban streams the disconnection of effective impervious areas eia or those impervious areas hydraulically connected to the stormwater network has been identified as a strategic management approach that is expected to have the greatest impact the overall effect of full disconnection of spatially identified eia on watershed hydrology is uncertain because this type of full disconnection is rarely brought to full scale implementation in this study spatial eia identification is used to parametrize an urban runoff model using the united states environmental protection agency s storm water management model swmm the calibrated model is used to assess runoff reductions resulting from gi practices distributed through the watershed via different placement strategies both spatially informed and not full treatment of the spatially identified eia using bioretention cells was compared to two scenarios treating the same area of impervious surfaces but with random placement either among all impervious areas or placement focused in areas of higher imperviousness model results indicate that substantially higher runoff reduction could be realized by targeting eia with a median runoff reduction of nearly 30 more than other treatment scenarios across storm events ranging from 1 27 to 20 7 mm using this strategic siting further improvements in optimizing distributed infiltrative gi practice placement are needed and targeting of spatially identified eia appears to be a viable method for increasing the hydrologic improvements realized through watershed scale implementations keywords stormwater green infrastructure distributed restoration effective impervious area 1 introduction in an effort to protect and restore ecological health and pre development hydrology in urban streams worldwide watershed managers seek to reinstate more natural flow regimes in highly developed watersheds streamflow has been recognized as a master variable defining ecological potential in riverine systems poff et al 1997 and the impacts of impervious surfaces on urban hydrology and a range of other symptoms of degradation have been well established brabec et al 2002 leopold 1968 shuster et al 2005 walsh et al 2005b the value of healthy streams as both financial and cultural assets assessment 2005 has led urban watershed managers to seek strategies that both maintain flood protection from stormwater but also undo the effects of intense development on local hydrology increasingly worldwide this is accomplished with distributed nature inspired infiltrative green infrastructure gi retrofits specifically these at source smaller scale infiltrative surface runoff treatment practices are being used in urban watersheds in attempts to restore pre development runoff frequencies and volumes bernhardt and palmer 2007 by shifting hydrology back to more natural patterns and addressing runoff production at the source it is believed that urban stream systems will have a better chance of supporting thriving ecosystems without the need for ongoing active channel restoration projects that is restoration efforts will better match the scale of the degrading process walsh et al 2005a research on the effectiveness of distributed gi practices to collectively produce this hydrologic shift at the watershed scale is limited and it remains as an important research focus area jefferson et al 2017 several studies have begun to add to the knowledgebase and demonstrated the complexities of managing urban runoff with distributed gi practices modeling has shown that site runoff dynamics are sensitive to the location type and number of practices installed gilroy and mccuen 2009 for instance comparisons of hydrologic response to rainfall for developed catchments with different stormwater management strategies centralized vs distributed revealed that distributed gi practices can yield more natural runoff dynamics than centralized stormwater systems loperfido et al 2014 a growing number of monitoring studies have also been conducted to measure the efficacy of distributed gi retrofit strategies at several different scales notably though not exhaustively these studies include investigation at the small residential scale 0 53 ha page et al 2015 larger development tracts 2 6 ha bedan and clausen 2009 and catchment wide studies with shepherd creek in cincinnati usa 180 ha roy et al 2014 shuster and rhea 2013 and little stringybark creek 450 ha in melbourne australia walsh et al 2015 additional examples are presented by jefferson et al 2017 the results of these studies indicate improvements in stated goals though they are difficult to compare due to differences in study approaches stormwater control measures scms employed the timeline of installation and siting strategies these are nonetheless valuable studies as the lack of adequate supporting evidence for distributed scms to effectively address watershed wide goals remains an impediment to widespread use of this multi benefit management strategy roy et al 2008 another impediment to wider use of distributed scm retrofits in existing urban areas is that these practices carry a higher cost related to land value in densely developed areas costs are further increased when you consider the opportunity costs of land used for stormwater management as opposed to other uses in the urban setting roy et al 2008 because of this distributed gi practices have mostly been sited in an opportunistic empirical manner where public land is available or where redevelopment occurs the high costs for urban retrofit projects warrants strategic siting of these practices so that they impart the greatest good to stream hydrology especially considering limited water resource budgets and increased urbanization barbosa et al 2012 research has shown that the effective impervious area eia a subset of the total impervious area tia representing the impervious areas hydraulically connected to the stormwater network has a much greater effect on stream hydrology than tia due to rapid surface drainage along hydraulically efficient stormwater infrastructure brabec et al 2002 shuster et al 2005 streams exhibit declining conditions as tia increases but these declines have been shown to be even more tightly coupled to increases in impervious connectivity i e a higher eia tia ratio hatt et al 2004 lee and heaney 2003 leopold 1968 walsh et al 2005b because of this the eia should be leveraged to optimize the hydrologic benefits of gi retrofits by intercepting runoff from these areas first and foremost however quantifying and identifying eia is more difficult than tia because it can be subject to ambiguous urban drainage patterns and variable conditions that influence runoff production alley and veenhuis 1983 boyd et al 1993 1994 brabec et al 2002 chiew and mcmahon 1999 ebrahimian et al 2016a han and burian 2009 although disconnection of eia by implementation of gi practices can theoretically maximize the effectiveness of watershed restoration efforts rapid and reliable identification of these areas is often time consuming roy and shuster 2009 recently developed methodology by epps and hathaway 2018 provides spatially explicit identification of eia that is informed by geospatial data and observed runoff trends the results of this method account for spatial differences in runoff pathways and land cover along these pathways to identify areas most likely to be eia in a gis framework that can be used to prioritize stormwater management projects for runoff reduction this method epps and hathaway 2018 uses eia quantity estimates from rainfall runoff data analysis that build upon the work of boyd et al 1993 and ebrahimian et al 2016b these quantity estimates for eia are then spatially identified with gis flowpath analysis that differentiates impervious areas based on the connectivity of runoff produced by them via interceding surfaces and infrastructure towards the watershed outlet calibration is accomplished using a runoff attenuation parameter varying this until the spatially identified eia quantity matches the quantity estimate from the observed data readers are encouraged to read epps and hathaway 2018 for further methodology details and a discussion of the limits of the results the requirement of gaging a watershed to produce these results is a strong limitation on this methodology but efforts are underway to investigate how this approach can be adapted to be used on ungaged watersheds determining the connectivity or lack thereof of rooftops is a concern with geospatial approaches to eia identification another area for future research a final limitation is that it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the results of this new methodology or determine what the hydrologic effects might be given implementation of gi retrofits as full disconnection of the eia with these would take several years modeling can provide an initial means to assess the potential for this type of watershed wide deployment of gi retrofits assess how targeting spatially identified eia for disconnection compares to other less spatially guided strategies and determine what level of changes in storm event response should be expected given watershed wide implementation one of the most widely used urban stormwater runoff models is the united states environmental protection agency s epa stormwater management model swmm rossman 2004 like most urban runoff models swmm is very sensitive to impervious parameter inputs the need for accurate representation of impervious characteristics in urban runoff models has been noted in particular in relation to eia alley and veenhuis 1983 lee and heaney 2003 a recent review of research applying swmm to urban hydrologic investigations and the modeling of management paradigms for planning and decision making niazi et al 2017 has identified several gaps and opportunities for future studies to strengthen the use of this model this review points to the gap in knowledge in accounting for hydrologic continuity and gi spatial orientation as one of the most important foci for future research due to the importance of assessing different gi retrofit configurations to support current urban watershed management approaches incorporating spatially identified eia information into a swmm model to compare different siting strategies for gi retrofits forms the basis of the study presented here results can be used to guide better approaches for assessing distributed restoration initiatives optimized gi planning and the potential performance related to locational siting and configuration on a watershed scale basis this information will be pursued in this study using swmm to model first creek a large urban watershed in knoxville tn this will help determine what level of runoff reduction may be possible by installing gi practices strategically to disconnect eia and how this targeted strategy using spatially identified eia compares to runoff reductions using less informed spatial siting for the same level of treatment with gi 1 1 objectives the main goal of this study is to utilize the spatial identification of eia areas from epps and hathaway 2018 to assess the runoff volume reduction that might be realized given targeted application of gi practices to these locations results will be compared to other scenarios of similar treatment level that use different criteria for site selection not related to eia location to help quantify the potential advantage of using this spatial eia information a secondary goal is to verify the importance of the results of spatial eia identification using the methods of epps and hathaway 2018 pertaining to the use of this high resolution data this will be accomplished by assessment of model results and discussion of this important modeling parameter and its use in swmm as it relates to surface runoff and gi models 2 methods 2 1 study site and data the focus of this study was the first creek watershed in knoxville tn united states fig 1 first creek is a mixed development watershed 5320 ha with an upland tributary that runs through rural areas with sparse residential development and some agricultural lands and a main stem that flows through a densely developed urban corridor following a main arterial road with flood protection channelization watershed statistics have been summarized in fig 1 eia quantity estimates were developed from rainfall runoff data using rainfall and streamflow records for the period of march 2011 june 2014 from the city of knoxville stormwater engineering department epps and hathaway 2018 rainfall data 15 min timestep was obtained from three locations near the first creek watershed and storm event depths for the watershed were calculated based on a thiessen polygon weighted average storm events with total rainfall depth above 1 27 mm and below 25 4 mm with at least 6 h of separation from any additional rainfall were considered in the analysis local stormwater management goals require capture of runoff from the first 25 4 mm of rainfall for any size event focus on events of this size or smaller will demonstrate how distinctions in gi retrofit placement impact runoff capture for the storm events of this size or less additionally this event size is approximately equal to the 90th percentile storm event size for the region sylvester et al 2016 storm events were further screened for use in gi modeling using best professional judgement to focus on events where all rainfall fell mostly in close temporal succession 12 h or less to focus on simpler single peaked hydrographs with a more uniform runoff response over the watershed while it has been shown that the effectiveness of gi practices can be greatly reduced for subsequent peaks of complex storms versini et al 2016 these dynamics are better explored in studies of scm design effectiveness the stipulation for simpler single peaked events is made in this study to reduce temporal rainfall effects on scm performance and focus on differences in spatial distribution as much as possible in evaluating differences between placement scenarios from the full record of data 68 distinct rain events were identified nine of these were removed because they exceeded 25 4 mm in depth and 19 events were removed because they had multiple peaks the largest storm in the remaining 40 events to be analyzed was 20 7 mm of the 40 events 20 were less than 6 mm in depth 11 events were in the range of 6 12 mm and 9 events were larger than 12 mm direct runoff depths for these storm events were estimated by hydrograph separation using the constant k method of blume et al 2007 this method assumes that baseflow discharges from a linear reservoir with exponential decline such that the point on the receding limb of the hydrograph when the recession coefficient k becomes nearly constant represents the end of direct runoff and the streamflow s return to solely baseflow sources fig 2 the recession coefficient was calculated for all points on the receding limb of the storm event hydrographs via the equation from blume et al 2007 1 k dq dt q t flow data were assessed against the k coefficient data using a 2 h moving average to visually select the point in the receding limb of the hydrograph at which k stabilized to a near constant value this point in the hydrograph was then connected by straight line to the point just before hydrograph rise to complete hydrograph separation fig 2 the volume of water above this line was then summed and converted to a depth through division by the watershed area so that rainfall runoff trends could be used to quantify eia the quantity of eia in the first creek watershed was estimated in the same manner used in epps and hathaway 2018 employing regression analysis of rainfall runoff data by the methods of boyd et al 1993 and ebrahimian et al 2016 as a guide this eia quantity was used as a target for calibration of spatial eia models presented in epps and hathaway 2018 this spatial eia data both 1 forms the impervious connectivity input for a swmm model as opposed to using impervious connectivity as a calibration parameter and 2 is the focal point of various scm siting methodologies that are compared herein to evaluate how volumetric runoff reduction varies based on restoration approach spatial differences in the ratio of eia tia as a measure of impervious connectivity for the first creek watershed are shown in fig 1 summarized at the subcatchment level used in the swmm model 2 2 surface runoff model a previously developed swmm model for first creek was provided by the city of knoxville stormwater engineering for this study this model had been developed for flooding analysis and did not include a groundwater component because the goal of the study was to assess the representation of impervious connectivity and the disconnection of eia using gi retrofits as they pertain to surface runoff the development of a groundwater component was deemed unnecessary the existing swmm model disaggregated the first creek watershed into 125 subcatchments based on infrastructure location and grouping of homogeneous surface cover and topography all surveyed channel information stormwater infrastructure hydraulic parameterization and internal storage portions of the model were preserved for this study subcatchment boundaries were also preserved and the impervious area for each subcatchment was updated to ensure model parameters were consistent with high resolution data used by the spatial eia models 2 3 swmm model setup and parameterization aside from subcatchment geospatial data the swmm model parameters were adapted based on guidance from swmm documentation rossman and huber 2016 the green ampt method was used to represent infiltration in the model and runoff routing was modeled using the kinematic wave approximation rainfall observations 15 min timestep from the three tipping bucket gages fig 1 used in eia quantity estimation were used in the model being assigned to subcatchments based on which representative thiessen polygon area for the three gages that the subcatchment was located in model parameters were developed from literature values in most cases though a few were based on the assumptions of the spatial eia model table 1 infiltration parameters for the green ampt model were taken from literature values based on subcatchment soil properties obtained from the national resources conservation service s ssurgo soil survey database ssurgo 2017 the distribution of each subcatchments soils among different hydrologic soil groups hsg was used to produce weighted values for the literature based green ampt parameters average monthly evaporation values were used for evapotranspiration modeling and derived from pan evaporation measurements for local gages in eastern tennessee farnsworth and thompson 1983 impervious routing parameters were parsed between tia and eia according to the amount of eia identified in each subcatchment from the previously described spatial models epps and hathaway 2018 for each subcatchment the eia was routed directly to the outlet while the balance of tia was routed to pervious areas representing the disconnected portion of impervious surfaces the original swmm model obtained from the city of knoxville had routed impervious and pervious areas directly to the outlet utilizing model calibration of other surface runoff parameters to achieve adequate model fitting the inclusion of the spatially identified eia routing is an improvement over this representation that reflects site specific impervious connectivity data and addresses a concern for swmm models as described by niazi et al 2017 2 4 model calibration and assessment surface runoff was modeled continuously and reported at a 15 min timestep over the period from march 2011 to june 2014 during which records for streamflow and three rain gages existed a subset of 40 of the identified storm events that had been used to estimate the watershed eia were selected for analysis of potential runoff volume reduction analysis of overall gi practice runoff reduction was constrained to these storms since larger storms would likely be associated with runoff from more than just eia areas this focus on storm events most likely producing runoff from just eia areas provides a greater assurance that different gi retrofit placement scenarios described more below will capture the differences in runoff reduction possible under strategic siting using spatial eia identification versus other less targeted guidance rainfall depths for these 40 storms ranged from 1 27 mm to 20 7 mm with an average storm size of 8 3 mm while more than 40 valid storm events occurred during the period of record only storms that had been identified to derive from predominantly eia in regression analysis were used modeled runoff from the equivalent timeframe of each of these observed storm events was summed to produce a runoff volume that was normalized to a depth over the watershed area for comparison to the observed runoff depth over the same equivalent timeframe model fit for storm event runoff depths was used for calibration and assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 simple manual calibration for selected storm event runoff volumes was performed to improve the swmm model fit by varying the starred parameters in table 1 between their high mean and low values identified in the literature to determine model sensitivity and provide a suitable model of surface runoff this calibration was simple in that the parameters for all 125 subcatchments were assigned the same value class low median high for the parameter of interest for each calibration iteration further calibration was not deemed necessary because the focus of the study was on gi practice placement a reasonably accurate runoff model provided a consistent baseline for these different gi practice placement scenarios to be studied and compared final model parameters are noted in bold table 1 calibration was assessed for the storm event runoff depths during 2011 2012 23 events and verified by the remaining event runoff depths during 2013 2014 17 events 2 5 green infrastructure scenarios to study differences in runoff reduction that may be realized given alternative approaches to scm application the calibrated swmm base model was used to assess runoff reduction under different siting strategies for gi retrofits in the first creek watershed since eia was estimated as 7 3 of the watershed this forms the targeted amount of impervious area to be treated by gi practices in all scenarios three scenarios of gi practice siting were compared and a schematic representation of these is shown in fig 3 the first scenario eia applied gi practices only to the spatially identified eia areas treating 7 3 of the watershed this represents the targeted scenario where spatial models of eia are used to identify locations for gi practices to disconnect eia runoff from the stream network the second scenario random distributed gi practices randomly by first using a random number generator to apportion the 7 3 treatment level amongst the subcatchments and then using a second random number generator to divide that apportioned percentage for a given subcatchment between eia and non eia areas subject to availability of each of these impervious types in this scenario it is assumed that the equivalent area of impervious surfaces 7 3 of the watershed are treated for disconnection but that the placement of practices among the tia is not guided by any spatial information i e random the third scenario tia weighted was guided by subcatchment imperviousness wherein the 7 3 treatment level was apportioned amongst subcatchments using a weighted average of the tia in each subcatchment to the overall watershed tia this tia weighted impervious percentage was then divided between eia and non eia areas in each subcatchment based on a random number generator this scenario represents an intermediate guidance strategy in which the treatment amount in each subcatchment is proportional to the tia distribution over the watershed but that there is no further spatial differentiation between eia and non eia areas receiving treatment this scenario was chosen as an intermediate level of spatial guidance since distributed gi retrofits are typically placed more often in the most highly impervious areas of a watershed this process was iterated for each alternative siting strategy random and tia weighted with different randomization to produce 30 different applications of gi practices for each to be compared to the eia focused siting strategy each of these scenarios was then modeled in swmm by placing practices appropriately within the model to identify differences in runoff reduction between each model median and maximum reductions over the 30 model iterations for each alternative siting strategy were then compared to the eia scenario results to assess differences in performance between the three this was done to compare both the average and the best performance for less spatially informed siting methods to quantify the advantage or lack thereof that utilizing spatial eia data might provide over the alternative siting scenarios runoff volume reductions were compared using a storm event pairwise wilcoxon signed rank test wilcoxon et al 1970 due to non normality to assess whether gi siting scenarios exhibited dissimilar runoff reductions on average and thus demonstrate whether a given siting strategy might be advantageous 2 6 green infrastructure modeling to apply the appropriate gi treatment in each scenario a generic bioretention cell was modeled to treat both eia and non eia impervious areas separately in each subcatchment bioretention cells were modeled using the lid editor in swmm version 5 1 a single lumped bioretention cell receiving runoff from each impervious area subset was modeled for a total of two bioretention cells per subcatchment and these were sized distinctly with enough storage to capture the runoff from a 25 4 mm storm for the given impervious area each was determined to treat parameterization of these bioretention cells is summarized in table 2 bioretention cells were sized vertically per guidance from municipal stormwater management manuals table 2 for each gi practice scenario the impervious surface area identified for treatment eia and non eia separately was used to calculate the runoff volume for a storm event of 25 4 mm the required surface area of bioretention cells to treat this amount of runoff was then calculated based on the total storage available in the bioretention cell to accommodate this volume swmm allows a given bioretention cell to receive runoff from a subset of the subcatchment impervious areas thus two bioretention cells were defined and sized for each subcatchment one for eia one for non eia and the appropriate percentage of the impervious area was routed to each based on the eia and non eia impervious areas to be treated in each scenario swmm also allows underdrain flow and excess water from the bioretention cell to be routed back to pervious areas or directly to the outlet this option was utilized to maintain the model representation of surface routing with the bioretention cell treating non eia routed to pervious areas and that treating eia routed to the outlet storm event runoff depths were calculated from model outputs and the percent runoff reduction was calculated by comparison to surface runoff depths for the base model with no gi practices the percent reduction of runoff for the 40 storm events was calculated for the 30 iterations in each alternative scenario to compare to the eia focused runoff reductions further pairwise comparison of storm event runoff reduction between the three siting strategies was then used to assess whether there were statistical differences this was done for all storm events as well as by three groupings of storm event size 6 mm 6 12 mm and 12 mm to aid in discussion of differences in runoff reduction by storm size these grouping represent storm sizes for the area of approximately 54 72 and 89 frequency ranks respectively fig 4 based on rain data from the tyson mcghee airport station for the years 1981 2010 and are consistent with the results presented in sylvester et al 2016 the eia scenario was compared to the median and maximum runoff reduction scenarios of the 30 randomizations for each of the random and tia weighted scenarios to demonstrate the range of performance and sensitivity to placement for these alternate siting strategies in comparison 3 results and discussion 3 1 swmm model results the base model performed well in matching storm event runoff volume given simple manual calibration model performance results over the entire period and the calibration and verification periods are summarized in table 3 and modeled runoff depth versus the observed runoff depth has been plotted in fig 5 the model typically performs well but shows some underprediction of larger storm events an expected outcome given the lack of a groundwater component within the model hydrograph separation distinguishes total runoff between a baseflow component and direct runoff the latter which may contain some portion of interflow or shallow subsurface return flow not related entirely to surface runoff dynamics beven 1989 this portion is not easily discernible through graphical analysis and may over estimate true surface runoff for any given event manual parameter adjustment for this swmm model used mean literature values as a starting point and adjusted parameters to minimum and maximum literature values for all subcatchments to identify the greatest sensitivities in the model for surface runoff to arrive at the final calibrated base model parameters that were adjusted in this process away from the mean value were all related to soils and pervious area runoff and the calibrated values were all on the low end of the literature ranges it is possible that this reflects the condition of urban soils which typically have poorer infiltration and thus contribute to greater surface runoff however this may also be due to the potential overestimate of surface runoff from the inclusion of interflow portion which is not included in the swmm model overall these results demonstrate that the model is well suited to serve as a basis for comparing runoff reduction between scm placement scenarios 3 2 spatial eia distribution among subcatchments the inclusion of spatially explicit estimates of eia that are informed by physical geography and hydrologic trends in this swmm model produced acceptable model results with only simple manual calibration eia has been identified as one of the most sensitive parameters in swmm models and its accurate representation in the model can allow more efficient and accurate calibration for other important urban runoff parameters in the model mancipe munoz et al 2014 comparing the spatially derived results of eia from epps and hathaway 2018 to those from literature regression estimates offers a demonstration of the range in eia values that varies based on the method of estimation which can greatly impact surface runoff modeling results a plot of the eia versus tia for the swmm model subcatchments fig 6 derived from spatial analysis in epps and hathaway 2018 demonstrates a very different relationship for the first creek watershed than predicted by literature regression equations sometimes used for eia estimation alley and veenhuis 1983 roy and shuster 2009 wenger et al 2008 this plot indicates that eia would be mostly overpredicted by regression equations for the first creek watershed especially for intermediate values of tia the use of these regression equations to predict eia in catchments other than where they were developed has been demonstrated to poorly reflect actual eia measurements roy and shuster 2009 while this is not the focus of this paper it demonstrates that the method utilized to estimate eia can vary greatly and because runoff modeling results are sensitive to this parameter it makes sense to use the most site specific information available spatial eia estimates used in this study were conducive to incorporation into swmm model subcatchment discretization for more accurate runoff production and routing information implemented within typical gis analysis for model parameterization they were easily summarized by subcatchment in the same way as tia typically is estimations of eia using regression equations developed elsewhere or by using eia as a model calibration parameter that is when it is one of many calibration parameters may provide a less accurate representation of impervious connectivity and urban runoff processes 3 3 runoff reduction for gi placement scenarios average percent runoff reductions achieved via different gi placement scenarios are summarized overall and by storm size groupings in table 4 these values represent the mean and median reductions by scenario and storm size for all modeled events 40 events for eia and the 30 randomization scenarios of 40 events for the alternative siting scenarios runoff reduction for the 40 storms are presented as boxplots to demonstrate differences in the range of values between gi siting strategies these have been summarized for both the median runoff reduction scenario for the random and tia weighted treatments over the 30 randomizations fig 7 and the maximum runoff reduction scenario over the 30 randomizations as well fig 8 the results of pairwise comparison for each grouping by the wilcoxon signed rank test wilcoxon et al 1970 are presented in table 5 for eia runoff reduction and the maximum runoff reductions under the 30 randomizations of the alternative strategies results indicate that focusing gi applications in locations identified as eia can result in greater runoff reduction especially for smaller storms up to 12 mm over all storm events gi placement focused on eia resulted in nearly 4 10 greater runoff reductions table 5 than those for less spatially guided strategies with an overall mean runoff reduction of 37 3 table 4 this is in comparison to mean reductions of 27 2 and 27 0 for the random and tia weighted placement scenarios over all storm events respectively the differences in runoff reduction when storms are partitioned by size offers insight on modeled runoff dynamics and the performance of gi treatment over a range of conditions this information can inform future model parameterization and utilization of this information for application of distributed gi practices in terms of runoff reduction potential and management strategies for smaller events 6 mm runoff reduction is highest when practices are placed according to spatially identified eia with a mean runoff reduction of 49 2 runoff from connected impervious surfaces during such events is well handled by the modeled bioretention cells and precipitation is sufficiently small that pervious areas do not likely produce substantial runoff if any this is important to note when you consider that the higher frequency of runoff from smaller storm events is one of the indicators of urban hydrologic regime shift substantially greater runoff reduction for small storm events using eia focused placement may have a large impact on decreasing runoff frequency overall while runoff would not be eliminated entirely the amount would be negligible considering the size of the events for intermediate events greater than 6 mm but less than 12 mm runoff reduction using eia focused siting was greater than the maximum tia weighted scenarios with an average runoff reduction of 32 2 but not statistically higher overall than the maximum runoff reductions for random siting scenarios while results were inconclusive for this intermediate range of storm sizes a comparison of eia runoff reductions and median runoff reductions for alternate strategies indicate that on average less spatially informed strategies resulted in approximately 7 less runoff reduction α 0 01 on average runoff reductions for these intermediate storm events were moderately greater for the eia treatment scenario though with diminishing returns relative to the smallest storms events in this size range are typically frequent especially in more humid climates like the southeastern united states full treatment of all eia with distributed practices could thus reduce runoff by greater than 30 annually for storms less than 12 mm in size while the magnitude of this reduction overall would be dependent on local precipitation frequencies it could represent a substantial amount of annual runoff reduction if a larger percentage of storm events for a given urban watershed were in this range when rainfall exceeded 12 mm runoff reductions appear to be greater when using eia focused siting based on mean and median percent reduction statistics table 4 however there was not a statistically significant difference in storm event runoff reduction between siting strategies at the α 0 05 confidence level there was greater variability in runoff reductions for eia treatment scenarios for these larger storm events than for the other storm size groupings and this is also evident in the random and tia weighted treatment scenarios one possible explanation for this could be the influence of antecedent moisture conditions and pervious areas on runoff production for larger storm events in the swmm model when rainfall exceeds infiltrative capacity pervious areas begin to produce runoff and this is more likely to occur for larger storm events further infiltrative capacity for pervious areas ranges based on soil moisture conditions and thus varies by storm event depending on recent rainfall this could also be related to performance of the bioretention cells as well for the same reasons since previous saturation may cause these practices to handle less runoff for storms falling in close temporal succession runoff from impervious areas routed onto pervious areas as in the case of non eia portions of the watershed would additionally influence soil saturation and further increase runoff from pervious areas for larger events for the eia treatment all runoff from non eia is routed to pervious areas without treatment for larger storms and especially those falling when soil saturation is higher due to recent rainfall all runoff from these non eia areas is routed to pervious areas in the swmm model which may produce runoff for these events this effect would be lessened in the random and tia weighted scenarios which treat a portion of non eia runoff and thus would contribute less to intra event pervious saturation for larger storms surface runoff thus becomes the sum of interactions between pervious conditions and surface runoff routing from different portions of the tia that are subject to a range in antecedent moisture conditions treatment location may become secondary to simply the level of treatment for maximum runoff reductions as pervious influences impact surface runoff more for these larger events this is also influenced by model parameterization and the scale of subcatchment disaggregation while the results of the study are specific to the specific watersheds they do indicate some advantage in targeting eia with gi practices over other siting strategies though the magnitude in other watersheds may be unclear despite this the results highlight important foci for research development in urban stormwater management planning and areas where improved data and model representation may be warranted 3 4 limitations and sources for error table 6 provides a summary of important assumptions uncertainties and sources of error in this study acknowledgement of the limitations of these findings serves to point to important opportunities for future research that this study hoped to illuminate while many of these have already been discussed throughout the text it is important to consider them together as they can have a compounding effect on the results each of the items in table 6 point to further lines of inquiry as watershed managers continue to improve data collection and modeling efforts in support of urban watershed management 3 5 modeling considerations and further opportunities while the results of this study indicate that utilizing spatial eia information for gi practice placement can result in greater runoff reduction some considerations should be made regarding model representation in table 6 that will point to areas for further study this modeling exercise utilized a single idealized bioretention cell for eia and non eia areas to represent runoff reduction potential given watershed wide application however the routing of runoff deriving from eia and non eia areas needs to be further studied considering the results for runoff reduction from larger storms model results suggests interactive effects in surface runoff processes as modeled that may be at play in urban hydrology however it could also be a function of the modeling structure itself or possibly the scale of subcatchment disaggregation and representation realistic application of gi practices in this watershed would likely necessitate the disaggregation of the idealized bioretention cells into smaller units that were further distributed within each subcatchment i e modeling at a finer scale for both the gi practices and their contributing watersheds to holistically model this interactivity at the watershed scale investigation of the relationship between groundwater conditions and surface runoff may also be warranted additionally bioretention may not always be the most applicable or feasible type of gi for all areas detention based gi may be more effective than infiltrative practices given certain site conditions and objectives and vice versa the use of a single type of gi practice with uniform design might be expanded in the future to assess how different gi types and designs might perform in conjunction with the additional information on runoff routing that is offered by the high resolution eia data another consideration is the feasibility for gi retrofits in areas identified as eia placement of gi where eia has been identified may not always be feasible due to site constraints not identified by the spatial model this could be related to poor infiltration rates difficult topography or adequate space for the first creek watershed 3 1 of the watershed was identified as eia in the public domain less than half of the total eia targeting these areas first for any gi retrofit efforts in the watershed would be a good strategy to begin implementation of distributed restoration efforts based on these modeling results this would represent the intersection of opportunistic gi applications with spatially informed siting that would provide watershed managers with the best hydrologic benefit for the watershed using readily available spaces for distributed restoration spatial eia models could then be revised given the added gi to reassess impervious connectivity and further identify areas where runoff reductions would be greatest given the disconnection of those where gi has been established over the timeline of implementation 4 conclusions there is a need to prioritize areas for gi retrofits in urban watersheds that enable cities to place often limited resources in areas where they will have the greatest impact on urban streams watershed assessment using high resolution geospatial data can provide robust information concerning priority areas for distributed watershed restoration when coupled with hydrologic information modeling that incorporates the best information from both of these sources can be used to assess management options and refine approaches in order to optimize results for urban watershed improvement the results of this study indicate that spatial eia information can be applied to a swmm model to adequately predict surface runoff using literature based parameters with simple manual calibration the calibrated model was used to investigate three gi placement scenarios the strategy specifically targeting eia within the watershed showed moderate differences in runoff reduction compared to more random gi placement strategies which treated both eia and less connected portions of tia the eia based strategy was estimated to average approximately 37 runoff reduction over all storm events at about 10 more than the other two methods however the difference between the siting strategies weakened as storm size increased indicating that treating effective impervious area is most advantageous for mitigating small frequent rainfall events further study is warranted in particular on watersheds with varying impervious connectivity and especially those with a very high eia tia ratio or where gi opportunities are constrained by dense development these results highlight the importance of focusing gi applications to areas identified as eia to optimize urban hydrologic benefits and point to how this methodology can help watershed managers prioritize restoration efforts further investigation with higher resolution runoff modeling should lead to management recommendations that fully account for the spatial variability of urban runoff production but this initial study demonstrates that the utilization of spatially identified eia data can be used as a basis for gi retrofit siting when runoff reduction is the primary objective declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge employees at the city of

university 135 yaguan road tianjin 300350 pr china this manuscript was handled by g syme editor in chief graphical abstract vulnerability assessment is an essential step for urban flood risk management due to the objective existence of statistical errors in the variables and spatial heterogeneity as well as the similarity of flood experience precautionary status and environments for neighbouring areas an urban flood vulnerability assessment essentially entails a multi factor decision making process that accounts for uncertainties and the local spatial dependence of neighbourhoods to address these issues an uncertainty based vulnerability assessment approach embedded with an improved moving split window imsw analysis and probabilistic method is proposed to develop an integrated urban flood vulnerability assessment model three technical issues need to be resolved 1 the development of damage curves of land use types 2 an uncertainty model and spatial dependence model of damages based on an imsw analysis and 3 an uncertainty based framework to quantify vulnerability considering the uncertainties and local spatial dependence of the damage curves as well as the spatial heterogeneity of risky assets simultaneously the proposed method is applied to an urban area in china and provides an integrated vulnerability assessment for different land use types moreover uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed to analyse the spatial differentiation and the dominant parameters of vulnerability compared with two other commonly used methods the proposed local correlated method lcm is more in line with reality and provides more reasonable information for making a better informed decision keywords urban flood vulnerability assessment local spatial dependence entropy weight based moving split window analysis uncertainty 1 introduction flooding is one of the most frequent and destructive natural hazards causing devastating damage to life and economies around the world vulnerability estimation is an indispensable aspect of flood risk assessment with the acceleration of urbanization processes populations and economies are highly concentrated in urban areas increasing uncertainties in the vulnerability analysis process moreover the disaster bearing capacity of neighbourhoods is interdependent and because of their similar service conditions and structure behaviours cities are faced with higher frequencies and higher risk levels from flooding taking the uncertainty and local spatial correlation of risk components into account simultaneously in urban flood vulnerability assessment is still a complicated issue which poses a serious challenge to urban flood vulnerability assessments therefore research on urban flood vulnerability assessment considering uncertainty and spatial dependence can provide more detailed information and reasonable results which is of great significance for risk management and disaster reduction urban flood vulnerability depends on flooding features the intrinsic characteristics of flood prone areas and the environmental surroundings which are multi dimensional and differential with multidisciplinary comprehensive integration the potential damage amount and damage function are the two principal factors affecting urban vulnerability towards flooding due to the limited measuring capability and the objective existence of spatial variability it is impossible to fully grasp the spatiotemporal distribution to reveal the heterogeneous reality of the potential damage amount in addition most damage curves have been developed empirically by expert judgement scorzini et al 2017 which introduces additional uncertainty in the determination of the damage curve shapes and damage models transferred from other areas expand the uncertainty in the modelling of damage curves damage curves are usually site specific and strictly valid for where they were developed and the damages to neighbouring cells in the same damage category is mutually dependent on a similar physical environment and structural service status egorova et al 2008 therefore a local spatial dependence based vulnerability analysis under uncertainty is necessary for urban flood vulnerability assessment this study aims to develop an integrated urban flood vulnerability assessment approach that can simultaneously take the spatial heterogeneity of risky assets uncertainty in the shape of damage curves and spatial dependence of damage factors into account since flood vulnerability assessment in urban areas is a complicated process that needs to synthesise the vulnerability characteristics of different land use types three issues that hinder the effective implementation of the proposed approach should be solved 1 how to develop the damage functions suitable for the study area 2 how to cope with the uncertainty and local spatial dependence in damage curves and 3 how to integrate the spatial heterogeneity of risky assets and uncertainties as well as the spatial dependence in damage curves to quantify urban flood vulnerability this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides an overview of related work on flood vulnerability assessment section 3 provides the study area and the corresponding hydrogeographic information section 4 illustrates the general research process of this study detailed descriptions of the methodology used in the paper and the establishment of the integrated vulnerability assessment method are presented in section 5 the results and discussion are given in section 6 and the conclusions and future works are discussed in section 7 2 related work vulnerability is a complex concept that is varied from different research perspectives balica et al 2013 it is commonly understood as the degree or possibility of damage to a system that is susceptible to or has failed to cope with adverse effects lee et al 2014 the vulnerability index is widely considered as a function of exposure sensitivity adaptability and social capital foudi et al 2015 and is frequently applied in different areas such as measuring the effects of nature hazards on societies gonzález riancho et al 2014 veettil et al 2018 measuring the degree of damage caused by climate change zahmatkesh et al 2017 and measuring the aquifers vulnerability analysis on contamination javadi et al 2017 sullivan et al 2017 anandhi et al 2018 various studies have measured urban flood vulnerability at different scales since a reasonable evaluation index system is the basis for the accurate evaluation of vulnerability many european countries have developed social vulnerability indices suitable for their national conditions frigerio et al 2016 the previous methodology can be grouped into two types one type is implementing vulnerability assessment based solely on available historical disaster records or measurement data aroca jiménez et al 2018 and the other is synthesizing the hazard scenarios simulation and susceptibility analysis of hazard affected elements for an integrated spatial assessment romanescu et al 2018 the geographic information system gis coupled with multi criteria decision analysis mcda method has been frequently adopted in several studies for urban flood vulnerability assessment hazarika et al 2018 zahmatkesh et al 2017 some scholars have developed a vulnerability assessment methodology based on one or two dimensional hydraulic modelling to investigate the most vulnerable areas for risk warning de moel et al 2014 rehan et al 2018 in recent years several risk assessment models have been developed based on the random forest rf method or the improved k means cluster algorithm which means the successful innovative application of artificial intelligence technology in flood risk assessment wang et al 2015 xu et al 2018 uncertainty is inevitable in the flood vulnerability analysis process because of the intrinsic spatial variability of risk components and the inability to exhaust the spatiotemporal information of all the variables to cope with these issues a triangular distribution is chosen to characterize the uncertainty in the value of the assets at risk de moel et al 2014 scorzini et al 2017 analysed the transferability of damage models developed from other areas and proposed new damage curves for the residential sector some studies have used a beta distribution to describe the uncertainty in the shape of damage curves de moel et al 2014 additionally local spatial dependence objectively exists in urban flood vulnerability assessment due to the similarity of intrinsic characteristics of neighbourhoods to solve the spatial dependence of damage a complete correlation method for the cells at the same inundated depth was proposed egorova et al 2008 which effectively compensates for the inability of traditional damage models to consider spatial dependence but fails to reveal the relationship between the dependence and spatial distance moving split window msw analysis is a popular tool for boundary detection in vegetation science körmöczi et al 2016 based on msw technology a probabilistic local ordered weighted averaging owa method was proposed to take the spatial heterogeneity of preferences into account in an urban susceptibility assessment tang et al 2018a b uncertainty of urban flood vulnerability assessment simultaneously exists in the hydrological process and the analysis of damage foudi et al 2015 several mcda and its improved methods have been proposed to address vulnerability evaluation in many studies most of them emphasized the uncertainties in flood hazard analysis and few of them took the spatial dependence of damages at neighbourhood scale into account to establish the integrated urban flood vulnerability assessment framework first the damage depth curves are transferred and corrected from a similar city scorzini et al 2017 then the appropriate probability distributions are chosen to characterize the uncertainties in the damage curve shapes and risky assets next introducing the autocorrelation distance derived from the random field and entropy weight method the improved msw method is developed to address local spatial dependence at neighbourhoods scale finally an integrated assessment approach is proposed for urban flood vulnerability the uncertainties and spatial dependence of the inputs are dynamically integrated and propagated in the latin hypercube sampling lhs framework whilst uncertainty and a sensitivity analysis are implemented to indicate the influential indicators and robustness since robustness ferreira et al 2016 characterizes the capacity of the proposed method to retain the stability of the results during multiple simulations 3 study area the case study area is situated downstream of the tg reservoir with a population of approximately 3 million inhabitants and a total area of 64 km2 ranging from 113o48 e to 113o55 e and 22o31 n to 22o37 n latitude fig 1 topography plays a fundamental role in the simulation of flood routing most of the areas are covered by plains consisting of grasslands covering approximately 5 km2 traffic lands covering 5 6 km2 residential areas covering 6 3 km2 and outbuilding lands covering 22 km2 while nearly one third of the study area is covered by mountains with the highest elevation reaching 200 m to assess the comprehensive flood vulnerability of the urban area the study area was divided into four land use types including agriculture road building and outbuilding according to the landscape features the tg reservoir is the largest reservoir in sz city which experiences flooding from a 1 20 year return period to a 1 2000 year return period with a total storage capacity of 83 million m 3 the reservoir provides protection for the lives and property of the downstream urban area of the reservoir heavy rainstorms will cause destructive disasters to the downstream urban area once the dam breaks 4 research framework the research framework to quantify the integrated urban flood vulnerability under the background of uncertainty is shown in fig 2 the proposed framework reflecting the workflow contains four major steps simulating the urban flood routing establishing and adjusting the damage models for the land use types developing the integrated vulnerability assessment model and processing a case study which can be described as follows frist to balance calculation accuracy and efficiency the widely used 3d k ε turbulent equation coupled with the volume of fluid vof method wang et al 2017 is adopted as an urban flood inundation model to obtain the hydraulic boundary condition for the inundation model in the simulation of flood routing the excessive flood event with a return period of 1 2000 per year digital elevation model dem and land use types are taken as the boundary conditions of the inundation model to obtain the flooding information which provides data support for the vulnerability assessment second the damage model is defined by the susceptibility of the elements at risk against the flooding characteristics which is usually provided by depth damage curves that can be obtained from socio economic surveys or transferred from the other area scorzini et al 2017 due to the lack of available site specific curves in the study area the depth damage curve developed in sh city which shares a similar economic development shi et al 2010 is used in this paper and the ratio of per capita disposable income pcdi to gross regional domestic product grdp in the two cities is used to correct the errors caused by regional deviation on this basis considering the local spatial dependence of damage factors and the uncertainty of the damage curve a damage model suitable for the study area is established third an integrated urban flood vulnerability assessment model based on a local spatial dependence based probabilistic method is developed that contains two sub steps one step is deals with the spatial variability of the risky assets and the corresponding probability distributions are used to characterize the uncertainty in the value of the assets at risk the second step is the processing of the uncertainty and local dependence in the damage the imsw analysis method embedded with the spatial correlation distance is developed to calculate the damage factor inputting the probability distribution of the building height risky assets and damage factors of the elements at risk the uncertainties will be propagated through a the modelling chain of 500 simulations the inundation model damage model and vulnerability assessment model are dynamically coupled in the latin hypercube framework finally the proposed method is applied to the downstream urban area of the tg reservoir compared with the results derived from the complete correlated method ccm egorova et al 2008 and non correlated method ncm de moel et al 2014 the proposed method is more effective and superior promoting the formulation of risk mitigation strategies and allocating resources more efficiently 5 methodology 5 1 simulation model of urban flood routing flood inundation characteristics are the foundation of urban flood vulnerability assessment which can be simulated by a 3d numerical simulation when there is no detailed historical flood record the 3d k ε turbulent equation coupled with the vof method is widely used in flood routing simulation and its superiority in accuracy and efficiency has been verified by wang et al 2017 and sun et al 2014 this method is taken as the urban flood inundation model in this study the governing equations of the inundation model are composed of the continuity equation momentum equation turbulent kinetic energy equation and turbulence dissipation rate equation more details can be found in wang et al 2017 and the general form of the governing equation is as follows 1 ρ ϕ t ρ u ϕ x ρ v ϕ y ρ w ϕ z x γ ϕ x y γ ϕ y z γ ϕ z s where ϕ represents a set of constant 1 the velocity component u v and w the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulence dissipation rate ε ρ is the density of a fluid kg m 3 γ is the generalized diffusion coefficient and s is the source phase set of the constant term momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulence dissipation rate when the hydraulic boundary information is given to the inundation model the inundated range can easily be obtained by the vof method and the inundated depth map of land use types can be determined by overlaying the dem and the land use maps with the inundated range map 5 2 transfer and correction of depth damage curves damage factors are defined as the ratio of the potential damage value to the total risky assets at a certain inundated depth because no site specific curves are available in sz city the damage depth curves developed in sh city with similar levels of development to those in sz city are used in this study and both of them are chinese first tier cities to reduce the regional deviation the ratio of pcdi to grdp is introduced to adjust the damage depth curves and the formulas are given as follows 2 f h d η f h d 3 η r pcdi r grdp r pcdi r grpd where f h d and f h d are the depth damage curves before and after correction respectively h d is the inundated depth m η is the regional correction coefficient and r pcdi and r grpd are the values of pcdi and grdp respectively yuan through the above adjustments the damage depth curves of the land use type suitable for local situation of sz city are established the corrected damage depth curves of the land use types are shown in fig 3 the damage factors of buildings are affected by building height in addition to inundated depth and the existing damage depth curves for buildings are limited to single story buildings which the maximum inundated depth within 3 m with the development of social economy more and more high rise buildings have been built in sz city the single story damage curves cannot be applied to multi story buildings supposing that multi story buildings share the same correlation between damage factors and inundated depth in each floor the damage depth curves suitable for multi story buildings are developed in this study the damage to buildings mainly comes from wall floor and indoor properties and the damage depth curves transferred and adjusted from single story curves are derived as follows the damage depth curve of wall 4 f 1 h d d h d d 1 h d d h d d the damage depth curve of floor 5 f 2 h d d i n t h d a d d h d a i n t h d d 1 d d a h d h d d 1 h d h d d the damage depth curve of indoor properties 6 f 3 h d d i n t h d d d d f h h d h d d 1 h d d 7 h h d i n t h d d d where d is building height m d is the height of each story a is the height of the first floor to the ground m usually equal to 0 15 m h is the value of the height exceeding the integer multiple of d m and int is a rounding function 5 3 vulnerability assessment model based on local spatial dependence based probabilistic approach 5 3 1 uncertainty processing of the value of assets at risk the value of assets at risk is defined as the potential damage amount of unit land use area and is critical in the urban flood vulnerability calculation the average value of the study area for each land use type was obtained from the china national statistical data center http www stats gov cn tjsj ndsj due to the objective existence of measurement error and that the sample space cannot be exhausted a certain degree of uncertainty exists in the value of assets at risk for land use types to process the uncertainty caused by spatial variability a triangular distribution and a lognormal distribution are chosen to characterize the heterogeneity of the risky assets following egorova et al 2008 and moel et al 2012 the statistical characteristics are derived from de moel et al 2014 table 1 the probability density functions are given by triangular distribution 8 t r x a b m 2 x a m a b a a x b 2 b x b m b a m x b where a and b are the upper and lower boundaries respectively x is the sampling probability and m is mode lognormal distribution 9 l g n x μ σ 1 x σ 2 π e x p ln x μ 2 2 σ 2 10 σ l n 1 δ 2 11 μ ln e x 0 5 σ 2 where μ and σ are the shape parameters of the lognormal distribution e x is the sample mean and δ is sample deviation coefficient 5 3 2 uncertainty and spatial dependence model of the damage function the damage function represents the relationship between the degree of damage and the flood inundation characteristics which has a significant impact on the vulnerability assessment due to the lack of a unified standard for transferring specific damage functions from other contexts damage depth curves transferred from other areas contain a certain uncertainty in shape for each land use type and the uncertainty in building height adds extra uncertainty in the damage modelling process moreover damage factors are dependent on neighbouring cells therefore the uncertainty and the spatial dependence of damage factors should be accounted for the vulnerability assessment 1 uncertainty processing of the damage depth curves to take the uncertainty in the damage curves into account a beta distribution is chosen to process the fraction motivated by the fact that the beta distribution can be concentrated on the narrow intervals and possess low probability in the tails following egorova et al 2008 the shape of the beta distribution varies with inundated depth for each land use type and the expected value is always equal to the value of the deterministic damage curves the probability distribution function of the beta distribution can be expressed as follows 12 b e x α β γ α β γ α γ β x α 1 1 x β 1 13 α 1 k 1 f h d 14 β 1 k 1 1 f h d where α and β are the shape parameters of beta distribution k is the constraint coefficient for ensuring α 0 and β 0 2 spatial dependence processing based on improved smw analysis to take the spatial dependence of damage for different damage categories into account the spatial autocorrelation function is derived from random field theory following jiang et al 2014 the exponential 2d autocorrelation function is used to determine the range of the spatial autocorrelation which is defined as 15 ρ x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 θ xy exp 2 x 1 x 2 2 y 1 y 2 2 θ xy where x 1 y 1 and x 2 y 2 are the central coordinates of two cells in a damage category at risk and θ xy is the spatial correlation distance which is assumed to be equal in the horizontal and vertical directions it is known from the above deduction that the damage factors of neighbouring cells from the same land use type are locally correlated within a certain distance additionally recall that the damage depth curves obey a beta distribution this means that if the damage factor in one cell is given by the inverse cumulative probability function of the beta distribution f 1 p 1 and the other cell s damage factor can be obtained by f 1 p 2 assuming that the probability of damage occurrence p 1 and p 2 is correlated for convenience in the following sections the symbols y and x are used to represent p 2 and p 1 respectively following wielen and wielen 2015 and geer et al 2016 discretizing the probability distribution function of damage occurrence into multiple tiny segments based on differential principle bergman et al 1940 roh et al 2016 the central point probability of two discretization points can be approximated by linear functions therefore the probability correlation function p x of the selected neighbouring cells at a certain spatial distances is deduced as follows 16 y p x a x b where a is the function coefficient and b is a constant knowing that x and y satisfy the same distribution the statistical characteristic parameters are determined as follows 17 e x μ d y σ 2 then 18 e y a e x b a μ b d y a 2 d y a 2 σ 2 e x y e a x 2 b x 19 ρ xy cov x y d x d y 20 c o v x y e x y e x e y solving eqs 17 20 a and b can be obtained 21 a ρ xy b μ 1 ρ xy considering that the magnitude of correlation of the occurrences probability will changes with spatial distance of neighbouring cells coupled with the spatial autocorrelation function substituting eqs 15 and 21 into eqs 16 the probability correlation function p x can extended to a 2d probability spatial correlation function 22 p x ρ x μ 1 ρ ρ ρ x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 θ xy within the range of correlation distances more than one cell affects the damage factor of the computing cell and the degree of influence decreases with distance to address this issue the boundary of each land use type is extracted according to satellite images the domain is discretized into raster cells of 10 10 m2 with unique numeric identification in the following computation and the value of the sampling probability p p 0 1 is initialized by the lhs method chen et al 2018 a window with half window width of θ xy m is assigned in the domain of land use type as shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the damage factors of cells within the window are mutually dependent therefore the initialized sample probability needs to be reconfigured by the probability correlation function the entropy weight method xu et al 2018 is used to improve the msw analysis for determining the weight of neighbouring cells at different correlation distances the implementation process can be described as follows step 1 supposing the central cell of the window is the computing cell o k x y k 1 2 m the window space ω can be defined as 23 ω x y ω x y d ω x y θ xy 24 d ω x y m a x x i x y i y the initial sampling probability set π of cells within the window of which the components contained are determined by different correlation distances can be expressed as 25 π p i p 0 d ω x y 0 p 1 d ω x y 10 p n d ω x y θ xy i 0 1 2 n θ xy 10 26 p i x i 1 x i 2 x ij where p i is the set of initial sampling probabilities derived from neighbouring cells at a distance of 10i m and j is the number of neighbouring cells at a certain distance step 2 substituting p i and the corresponding coordinates into eq 22 the sampling probability of the central cell p io considering the local spatial correlation at a distance of 10i m is given by 27 p i o k p p i p o k i 1 p o k i 2 p o kin 28 p o kij ρ x j μ 1 ρ j 1 2 n step 3 the weight of neighbouring cells is calculated by shannon entropy xu et al 2018 and the entropy weight is given as follows 29 e i j 1 n p o ij l n p o kij l n n 30 div i 1 e i 31 w i div i i 0 θ xy 10 div i where e i is the entropy value and div i is the degree of divergence of ith distance step 4 integrating the sampling probability derived from different correlation distances the reconfigured sampling probability p o k is defined by eq 32 32 p o k 1 n i 0 θ xy 10 j 1 n w i p i o kj step 5 when the sampling probability of central cell o k x y is configured the centre of the window is then shifted to another cell o k 1 x d x y d y by one step in any position the imsw analysis procedure is repeated until all the cells within the range of land use type have been configured the sampling probability p considering the spatial correlation is expressed as follows 33 p p o 1 p o 2 p o k p o m then the damage factors of the cells are determined by the inverse cumulative probability function of the beta distribution f 1 p 5 3 3 implementation of the integrated vulnerability model based on the concept of vulnerability the urban flood vulnerability is determined by an integrated index that is expressed as the function of the values of the assets at risk and the damage factors for each land use type to eliminate the influence of dimension per unit risky asset is normalized by eq 34 34 r valueofassetatrisk m i n max m i n integrating all the vulnerability scores of the land use types the integrated urban flood vulnerability vi is given as 35 vi n 1 4 r n p n n 1 2 3 4 where n is the number of land use types agriculture road outbuilding and building to simulate urban flood vulnerability the integrated vulnerability model is implemented by the lhs framework coupled with the breach growth model inundation model and damage model first the inundation model is conducted by a 3d numerical simulation providing flood inundation characteristics for the determination of the damage factors and inundated depth then to take the uncertainty of the unit risky assets the damage curve shapes and the building height and the dependence of damage factors into account the lhs and entropy weight based msw method are coupled in this study and the normalized value of the risky assets r and the correlated damage factors p can be obtained integrating r and p derived from different land use types by geographic information system gis approaches the integrated vulnerability of the study area is finally calculated by eq 35 to analyse the uncertainty and sensitivity the modelling procedure is written in matlab and 500 simulations at θ xy 100 200 a n d 400 are run 6 results and discussion 6 1 analysis of urban flood inundation characteristics for illustration purposes flooding in the downstream urban area of the tg reservoir is taken as a case study the flood inflow process from 1 2000 year return period is substituted into the breach growth model wang et al 2017 then the discharge hydrograph of the tg reservoir can be obtained provided by the q t curve as shown in fig 5 the result of flood routing derived from a 1 2000 year return period event is shown in fig 6 as seen from the figure the inundated area is mostly located in the northeast of the study area and accounts for 49 94 of the total area which means that half of the urban area is affected by flooding from further analysis of the land use types in the inundated area it can be found that outbuilding land is the most widely affected accounting for almost 70 of the total area followed by building land which accounts for approximately one third of the outbuilding land and agricultural land is the least affected probably because its location is far from the breach and is difficult to flood the maximum inundated depth reaches 22 m mainly concentrated in the middle area of the study area because of the low lying terrain such a considerable inundation depth will cause a devastating disaster to the surrounding area therefore integrated flood vulnerability analysis is necessary for urban flood risk prediction and risk reduction 6 2 spatial characteristics of the elements at risk 6 2 1 spatial differentiation analysis of the value of the assets at risk the values of the assets at risk are assumed to be mutually independent for different land use types and the same categories of assets at risk are spatially heterogeneous for a better reflection of spatial heterogeneity the study area is discretized into raster cells of 10 10 m2 once the inundated area is determined by solving the inundation model the unit value of the assets with uncertainty for each land use type is calculated by the lhs method the spatial differentiation maps are shown in fig 7 frequency statistical analysis shows that the average unit value of the assets for agriculture road and outbuilding accords with the characteristics of the triangular distribution see fig 7 a c this conforms to lognormal distribution for buildings which is divided into indoor property floor and wall for the analysis due to the complexity of the building structure see fig 7 d f fig 7 c and a show that most of the study area is covered by outbuildings with the maximum value of the assets at risk mainly fluctuating from 2700 to 4000 y u a n m 2 whereas that of agriculture is fluctuates minimally from 15 to 23 y u a n m 2 the risky assets of roads are more evenly distributed mainly fluctuating from 500 to 700 y u a n m 2 and the buildings are more discrete where the maximum value is 10 times the minimum value in indoor property see fig 7 b and d f every raster cell of each land use type is assigned a random value to satisfy the relevant probability distribution provided in table 1 which can fully reveal the uncertainty in the value of the assets at risk caused by spatial heterogeneity 6 2 2 spatial distribution of the damage factors for the land use types inputting the inundated depths of the cells at risk of each land use type the damage factors considering the local spatial dependence within the range of correlation distances are obtained by imsw analysis for illustration the distribution of the damage factors for some of the land use types at a correlation distance of 200 m is shown in fig 8 the spatial patterns of the varied damage categories are remarkably different which manifests as outbuilding land shows the widest range and highest value due to the considerable inundated area and depth while the agricultural land shows the lowest value with the smallest scale because of its location far away from the breach moreover the high values zone red of the damage factors for agriculture and outbuilding are mainly concentrated in the urban central area because the central area is located in the low lying area at the foot of the mountain where it is prone to water accumulation see fig 8 a and b however the building land floor shows a different distribution pattern the high values are mainly located in the southwest because the damage factors of the floor depend not only on the inundated depth but also on the story height see fig 8 c high value areas will suffer more damage when encountering the same level of flooding where the assets should be reasonably allocated from the perspective of standard deviation sd after 500 simulations the sd of the damage factor for each land use type is basically less than 0 1 which indicates that the proposed method can provide reliable indicators for flood vulnerability analysis considering the uncertainty 6 3 integrated urban flood vulnerability analysis the integrated vulnerability results consist of road vulnerability agriculture vulnerability building vulnerability and outbuilding vulnerability for the city downstream of the tg reservoir are analysed and mapped in fig 9 the overall distribution patterns of vulnerability are similar to the characteristic distributions of the damage factors it might be that the damage factors have a considerable contribution to the vulnerability it can also be seen from the vulnerability maps that outbuilding vulnerability has a great impact on the integrated vulnerability while the vulnerability of agriculture and building have less impact the results indicated that the integrated vulnerability of the study area can be divided into 5 grades by the natural breaking point method chuanglin et al 2016 which are very low low moderated high and very high according to the statistical analysis more than three quarters of the areas are basically not vulnerable and that the grade is very low it is noteworthy that the high level and very high level areas are 3 89 and 2 91 respectively and these areas should be given priority for evacuation when encountering urban floods comparing the integrated vulnerability maps derived from the lcm at the local correlation distances of 100 200 and 400 m the impacts of the spatial correlation distance on the integrated vulnerability are analysed in fig 10 the results show that the spatial patterns of integrated vulnerability are roughly the same fig 10 a c and the vulnerability distribution for 100 m is relatively dispersed the frequency analysis of vulnerability at different degrees reveals that the proportion of very low level vulnerability increases with correlation distance and the other degrees of vulnerability show the opposite trend see fig 10 d the negligible differences between 200 and 400 m indicate that there is little impact on vulnerability when the correlation distance exceeds 200 m therefore when the correlation distance is 200 m ideal results can be obtained and the calculated consumption can be reduced the above analyses show that the whole study area presents a relatively low degree of vulnerability and the red marked area see fig 10 b should give more attention when urban flooding occurs the proposed method with the lcm considering the uncertainty and local dependence of vulnerability can obtain more convincing results and the correlation distance is recommended to be 200 m to balance calculation stability and calculation efficiency the resulting vulnerability distribution is more regionalized filtering out some areas with a negligible degree of vulnerability which makes the implementation of flood mitigation strategies more purposeful and resource allocation more effective 6 4 comparison with other methods the validity of the proposed method considering local spatial dependence was assessed by a comparison with the ccm and ncm which concluded that the proposed method has better consistency representativeness and superiority the comparative results are shown in figs 11 14 1 the distribution of each level on integrated vulnerability derived from the three methods and the consistency of the results of the lcm compared with the ccm and ncm are illustrated in fig 11 generally the results of the lcm are agree with those of the other two methods except for the low level vulnerability in which almost 11 of the areas are classified as low vulnerable according to the lcm 10 according to the cmm and 19 according to the ncm which is quite different from the former two methods from fig 11 b we can conclude that the evaluation results of vulnerability at different levels obtained by the lcm and ccm are consistent comparing the lcm with the ncm the other four levels very low moderate high and very high share the same proportion except for the result of low level vulnerability moreover the mean absolute error mae and the mean square error mse of the proportion of vulnerability levels between the lcm with the ccm and ncm are relatively small the above results show good consistency between the various methods 2 detailed distribution information of the high level and very high level vulnerability of the study area obtained by the three methods are given in fig 12 as we can see 3 9 of the area is identified as a high level vulnerable area and 3 0 of the area is identified as a very high level vulnerable area according to the ccm while for the ncm approximately 4 1 of the area has a high vulnerability level and 2 9 of the area has a very high vulnerability level a similar conclusion can also be drawn by the lcm with 3 9 of the area exhibiting high level vulnerability and 2 9 of the area exhibiting very high level vulnerability for the identification of the risk areas almost 6 8 of the area s vulnerability levels are considered at high or above levels that can be drawn from each of the three methods which show good representativeness of the proposed method among all the methods 3 to analyse the impact of spatial dependence on vulnerability the comparative analyses of integrated vulnerability derived from the lcm ccm and ncm are illustrated in fig 13 sharing the same distribution regularities with the damage factor maps the integrated vulnerability from the ncm is widely distributed and dispersed across the whole study area see fig 13 c and that of the lcm and ccm are relatively localized and regionalized when considering the spatial dependence of the damage factors at the neighbourhoods scale see fig 13 a and 13 b the reason for the remarkable difference between the lcm ccm and ncm is that the damage factors of the cells in the ncm are assumed to be mutually independent while the lcm and ccm take spatial dependence into account the difference is that the lcm emphasizes the value is local dependent at the neighbourhood scale and the ccm assumes that the damage factors of the cells are completely dependent on the same land use type but fails to reflect the uncertainty caused by the damage curve shapes with a comprehensive consideration of uncertainty and local spatial dependence the results of the lcm are more in line with reality based on the vulnerability results of the lhs simulations the average standard deviation and 90 confidence interval derived from the lcm ccm and ncm are shown in fig 14 the average map of the ncm is more dispersed than that of lcm and ccm and the standard deviation derived from the ncm is more widely distributed and larger than that of the lcm and ccm a smaller standard deviation indicates a lower uncertainty and higher confidence therefore the results indicate that the integrated vulnerability scores of the lcm and ccm are more reliable moreover the ranges of the 90 confidence interval represented by radar charts show the conclusion again especially in the low level vulnerable areas while the results of lcm had the minimum deviation see fig 13 d verifying the robustness and reliability of the proposed method 6 5 analysis of uncertainty and sensitivity 6 5 1 uncertainty analysis to investigate the uncertainty of the results derived by the proposed method and the effects of spatial correlation distance on the uncertainty following tang et al 2018a b the study area was divided into four groups low average low standard deviation ll low average high standard deviation lh high average high standard deviation hh and high average low standard deviation hl the hl regions with high average values and low standard deviations are more robust vulnerable areas and the ll regions are in the low level of vulnerability with high confidence the other regions are more controversial the spatial patterns of uncertainty for the correlation distances of 100 200 and 400 m are shown in fig 15 the results show that the areas of ll regions decrease from 97 46 to 97 27 with increasing correlation distances while the hl regions show the opposite trend compared with the results of 400 m the hl regions derived from the correlation distance of 200 m are slightly reduced see fig 15b the results show that the proposed method with a correlation distance of 200 m is considered to be reliable and cost effective in terms of calculation accuracy and efficiency 6 5 2 sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis based on the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast method wang et al 2013 is implemented to demonstrate the dominant factors responsible for integrated vulnerability the first order sensitivity index s i and total sensitivity index st i are taken as indicators to analyse the parameter sensitivity on vulnerability fig 16 shows that the sensitivity parameters ranked in the top 6 from the total sensitivity analysis are basically consistent with those of the first order sensitivity analysis except for the reconfigured sampling probability of agriculture agriculturersp and the value of the assets at risk for road roadvoar however the internal ordering is significantly different that is outbuildingvoar floorvoar indoorvoar buildingheight wallvoar agriculturersp in the first order sensitivity analysis and wallvoar floorvoar indoorvoar outbuildingvoar roadvoar buildingheight in the total sensitivity analysis the total sensitivity indices are more uniform than the first order sensitivity indices because total sensitivity analysis considers the coupling effects between parameters which are objective in vulnerability assessments therefore the total sensitivity indices are suggested to represent the sensitivity of parameters on integrated urban flood vulnerability the results show that the risky assets of buildings consisting of wall floor and indoor property are the most dominant factors followed by the risky assets of outbuildings and roads and building height also makes an important contribution to vulnerability to further investigate the effects of spatial correlation distances on sensitivity the root mean square errors rmse of three groups of sensitivity indices for different correlation distances 100 m versus 200 m 100 m versus 400 m and 200 m versus 400 m are compared and illustrated in fig 17 the rmse values of 100 m versus 200 m and 100 m versus 400 m are 0 0308 and 0 0251 respectively while that of 200 m versus 400 m is 0 0067 which is one order of magnitude smaller than the formers this indicates that the error of sensitivity between 200 m and 400 m is relatively small and negligible compared to that of 100 m indicating that the sensitivity indices calculated with a correlation distance of 200 m are reliable 7 conclusion this study presents an integrated vulnerability assessment approach using a local spatial dependence based probabilistic approach different from other similar studies that focused on the uncertainties in damage or risk assessments and failed to consider spatial heterogeneity and local dependence simultaneously the proposed approach comprehensively considers the uncertainties in the values of the assets at risk caused by spatial heterogeneity and in the damage depth curves caused by the lack of specific site research and the local spatial dependence of damage factors at the neighbourhood scale applied to a downstream urban area of the tg reservoir in sz city in china and compared with the two other methods the proposed approach is highly consistent and representative with the ccm and ncm and the superiority of the proposed method is verified the most influential factor for vulnerability can be identified by a sensitivity analysis and the target information for the decision of risk mitigation strategies can be provided the constructive and significative conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the values of the assets at risk for each land use type are represented by a probability distribution which can fully reveal the spatial heterogeneity of the risky assets and provide the prerequisites for the effectiveness of vulnerability assessment 2 in this approach the inundation model damage model and vulnerability assessment model are dynamically coupled in a probabilistic framework the uncertainties of the risky assets and damage curves as well as the local spatial dependence of the damage factors are simultaneously considered and propagated across the modelling chain based on the imsw analysis and the lhs method which can capture the spatial variability and correlation at the neighbourhood scale and provide more trustworthy and robust vulnerability assessment results 3 the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis performed in the study which is based on statistical analysis and the efast method demonstrates the reliability of the proposed approach and identifies the dominant factors responsible for vulnerability which provides more targeted information for the formulation of risk mitigation measures like many other probabilistic framework based methods the proposed method is not without limitations the major limitation is the high computational resource requirements in the stochastic simulation although the lhs method having superior sampling performance is adopted considerable computational costs were demanded in this study due to the wide extent of the study area with 42 490 raster cells of 10 10 m2 to reduce the computational cost only three correlation distance settings of 100 200 and 400 m were compared and analysed the following is that few studies give clear guidelines for the transfer and adjustment of damage depth curves which is an important step in the implementation of the proposed approach therefore further study should be devoted to developing a scientific method to deal with transferring damage depth curves and presenting a more effective procedure to cover more correlation distance groups in vulnerability assessments the proposed method can be easily applied in other types of urban floods with high portability when the corresponding boundary conditions are given a flood vulnerability analysis can be performed using the proposed method declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments

university 135 yaguan road tianjin 300350 pr china this manuscript was handled by g syme editor in chief graphical abstract vulnerability assessment is an essential step for urban flood risk management due to the objective existence of statistical errors in the variables and spatial heterogeneity as well as the similarity of flood experience precautionary status and environments for neighbouring areas an urban flood vulnerability assessment essentially entails a multi factor decision making process that accounts for uncertainties and the local spatial dependence of neighbourhoods to address these issues an uncertainty based vulnerability assessment approach embedded with an improved moving split window imsw analysis and probabilistic method is proposed to develop an integrated urban flood vulnerability assessment model three technical issues need to be resolved 1 the development of damage curves of land use types 2 an uncertainty model and spatial dependence model of damages based on an imsw analysis and 3 an uncertainty based framework to quantify vulnerability considering the uncertainties and local spatial dependence of the damage curves as well as the spatial heterogeneity of risky assets simultaneously the proposed method is applied to an urban area in china and provides an integrated vulnerability assessment for different land use types moreover uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed to analyse the spatial differentiation and the dominant parameters of vulnerability compared with two other commonly used methods the proposed local correlated method lcm is more in line with reality and provides more reasonable information for making a better informed decision keywords urban flood vulnerability assessment local spatial dependence entropy weight based moving split window analysis uncertainty 1 introduction flooding is one of the most frequent and destructive natural hazards causing devastating damage to life and economies around the world vulnerability estimation is an indispensable aspect of flood risk assessment with the acceleration of urbanization processes populations and economies are highly concentrated in urban areas increasing uncertainties in the vulnerability analysis process moreover the disaster bearing capacity of neighbourhoods is interdependent and because of their similar service conditions and structure behaviours cities are faced with higher frequencies and higher risk levels from flooding taking the uncertainty and local spatial correlation of risk components into account simultaneously in urban flood vulnerability assessment is still a complicated issue which poses a serious challenge to urban flood vulnerability assessments therefore research on urban flood vulnerability assessment considering uncertainty and spatial dependence can provide more detailed information and reasonable results which is of great significance for risk management and disaster reduction urban flood vulnerability depends on flooding features the intrinsic characteristics of flood prone areas and the environmental surroundings which are multi dimensional and differential with multidisciplinary comprehensive integration the potential damage amount and damage function are the two principal factors affecting urban vulnerability towards flooding due to the limited measuring capability and the objective existence of spatial variability it is impossible to fully grasp the spatiotemporal distribution to reveal the heterogeneous reality of the potential damage amount in addition most damage curves have been developed empirically by expert judgement scorzini et al 2017 which introduces additional uncertainty in the determination of the damage curve shapes and damage models transferred from other areas expand the uncertainty in the modelling of damage curves damage curves are usually site specific and strictly valid for where they were developed and the damages to neighbouring cells in the same damage category is mutually dependent on a similar physical environment and structural service status egorova et al 2008 therefore a local spatial dependence based vulnerability analysis under uncertainty is necessary for urban flood vulnerability assessment this study aims to develop an integrated urban flood vulnerability assessment approach that can simultaneously take the spatial heterogeneity of risky assets uncertainty in the shape of damage curves and spatial dependence of damage factors into account since flood vulnerability assessment in urban areas is a complicated process that needs to synthesise the vulnerability characteristics of different land use types three issues that hinder the effective implementation of the proposed approach should be solved 1 how to develop the damage functions suitable for the study area 2 how to cope with the uncertainty and local spatial dependence in damage curves and 3 how to integrate the spatial heterogeneity of risky assets and uncertainties as well as the spatial dependence in damage curves to quantify urban flood vulnerability this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides an overview of related work on flood vulnerability assessment section 3 provides the study area and the corresponding hydrogeographic information section 4 illustrates the general research process of this study detailed descriptions of the methodology used in the paper and the establishment of the integrated vulnerability assessment method are presented in section 5 the results and discussion are given in section 6 and the conclusions and future works are discussed in section 7 2 related work vulnerability is a complex concept that is varied from different research perspectives balica et al 2013 it is commonly understood as the degree or possibility of damage to a system that is susceptible to or has failed to cope with adverse effects lee et al 2014 the vulnerability index is widely considered as a function of exposure sensitivity adaptability and social capital foudi et al 2015 and is frequently applied in different areas such as measuring the effects of nature hazards on societies gonzález riancho et al 2014 veettil et al 2018 measuring the degree of damage caused by climate change zahmatkesh et al 2017 and measuring the aquifers vulnerability analysis on contamination javadi et al 2017 sullivan et al 2017 anandhi et al 2018 various studies have measured urban flood vulnerability at different scales since a reasonable evaluation index system is the basis for the accurate evaluation of vulnerability many european countries have developed social vulnerability indices suitable for their national conditions frigerio et al 2016 the previous methodology can be grouped into two types one type is implementing vulnerability assessment based solely on available historical disaster records or measurement data aroca jiménez et al 2018 and the other is synthesizing the hazard scenarios simulation and susceptibility analysis of hazard affected elements for an integrated spatial assessment romanescu et al 2018 the geographic information system gis coupled with multi criteria decision analysis mcda method has been frequently adopted in several studies for urban flood vulnerability assessment hazarika et al 2018 zahmatkesh et al 2017 some scholars have developed a vulnerability assessment methodology based on one or two dimensional hydraulic modelling to investigate the most vulnerable areas for risk warning de moel et al 2014 rehan et al 2018 in recent years several risk assessment models have been developed based on the random forest rf method or the improved k means cluster algorithm which means the successful innovative application of artificial intelligence technology in flood risk assessment wang et al 2015 xu et al 2018 uncertainty is inevitable in the flood vulnerability analysis process because of the intrinsic spatial variability of risk components and the inability to exhaust the spatiotemporal information of all the variables to cope with these issues a triangular distribution is chosen to characterize the uncertainty in the value of the assets at risk de moel et al 2014 scorzini et al 2017 analysed the transferability of damage models developed from other areas and proposed new damage curves for the residential sector some studies have used a beta distribution to describe the uncertainty in the shape of damage curves de moel et al 2014 additionally local spatial dependence objectively exists in urban flood vulnerability assessment due to the similarity of intrinsic characteristics of neighbourhoods to solve the spatial dependence of damage a complete correlation method for the cells at the same inundated depth was proposed egorova et al 2008 which effectively compensates for the inability of traditional damage models to consider spatial dependence but fails to reveal the relationship between the dependence and spatial distance moving split window msw analysis is a popular tool for boundary detection in vegetation science körmöczi et al 2016 based on msw technology a probabilistic local ordered weighted averaging owa method was proposed to take the spatial heterogeneity of preferences into account in an urban susceptibility assessment tang et al 2018a b uncertainty of urban flood vulnerability assessment simultaneously exists in the hydrological process and the analysis of damage foudi et al 2015 several mcda and its improved methods have been proposed to address vulnerability evaluation in many studies most of them emphasized the uncertainties in flood hazard analysis and few of them took the spatial dependence of damages at neighbourhood scale into account to establish the integrated urban flood vulnerability assessment framework first the damage depth curves are transferred and corrected from a similar city scorzini et al 2017 then the appropriate probability distributions are chosen to characterize the uncertainties in the damage curve shapes and risky assets next introducing the autocorrelation distance derived from the random field and entropy weight method the improved msw method is developed to address local spatial dependence at neighbourhoods scale finally an integrated assessment approach is proposed for urban flood vulnerability the uncertainties and spatial dependence of the inputs are dynamically integrated and propagated in the latin hypercube sampling lhs framework whilst uncertainty and a sensitivity analysis are implemented to indicate the influential indicators and robustness since robustness ferreira et al 2016 characterizes the capacity of the proposed method to retain the stability of the results during multiple simulations 3 study area the case study area is situated downstream of the tg reservoir with a population of approximately 3 million inhabitants and a total area of 64 km2 ranging from 113o48 e to 113o55 e and 22o31 n to 22o37 n latitude fig 1 topography plays a fundamental role in the simulation of flood routing most of the areas are covered by plains consisting of grasslands covering approximately 5 km2 traffic lands covering 5 6 km2 residential areas covering 6 3 km2 and outbuilding lands covering 22 km2 while nearly one third of the study area is covered by mountains with the highest elevation reaching 200 m to assess the comprehensive flood vulnerability of the urban area the study area was divided into four land use types including agriculture road building and outbuilding according to the landscape features the tg reservoir is the largest reservoir in sz city which experiences flooding from a 1 20 year return period to a 1 2000 year return period with a total storage capacity of 83 million m 3 the reservoir provides protection for the lives and property of the downstream urban area of the reservoir heavy rainstorms will cause destructive disasters to the downstream urban area once the dam breaks 4 research framework the research framework to quantify the integrated urban flood vulnerability under the background of uncertainty is shown in fig 2 the proposed framework reflecting the workflow contains four major steps simulating the urban flood routing establishing and adjusting the damage models for the land use types developing the integrated vulnerability assessment model and processing a case study which can be described as follows frist to balance calculation accuracy and efficiency the widely used 3d k ε turbulent equation coupled with the volume of fluid vof method wang et al 2017 is adopted as an urban flood inundation model to obtain the hydraulic boundary condition for the inundation model in the simulation of flood routing the excessive flood event with a return period of 1 2000 per year digital elevation model dem and land use types are taken as the boundary conditions of the inundation model to obtain the flooding information which provides data support for the vulnerability assessment second the damage model is defined by the susceptibility of the elements at risk against the flooding characteristics which is usually provided by depth damage curves that can be obtained from socio economic surveys or transferred from the other area scorzini et al 2017 due to the lack of available site specific curves in the study area the depth damage curve developed in sh city which shares a similar economic development shi et al 2010 is used in this paper and the ratio of per capita disposable income pcdi to gross regional domestic product grdp in the two cities is used to correct the errors caused by regional deviation on this basis considering the local spatial dependence of damage factors and the uncertainty of the damage curve a damage model suitable for the study area is established third an integrated urban flood vulnerability assessment model based on a local spatial dependence based probabilistic method is developed that contains two sub steps one step is deals with the spatial variability of the risky assets and the corresponding probability distributions are used to characterize the uncertainty in the value of the assets at risk the second step is the processing of the uncertainty and local dependence in the damage the imsw analysis method embedded with the spatial correlation distance is developed to calculate the damage factor inputting the probability distribution of the building height risky assets and damage factors of the elements at risk the uncertainties will be propagated through a the modelling chain of 500 simulations the inundation model damage model and vulnerability assessment model are dynamically coupled in the latin hypercube framework finally the proposed method is applied to the downstream urban area of the tg reservoir compared with the results derived from the complete correlated method ccm egorova et al 2008 and non correlated method ncm de moel et al 2014 the proposed method is more effective and superior promoting the formulation of risk mitigation strategies and allocating resources more efficiently 5 methodology 5 1 simulation model of urban flood routing flood inundation characteristics are the foundation of urban flood vulnerability assessment which can be simulated by a 3d numerical simulation when there is no detailed historical flood record the 3d k ε turbulent equation coupled with the vof method is widely used in flood routing simulation and its superiority in accuracy and efficiency has been verified by wang et al 2017 and sun et al 2014 this method is taken as the urban flood inundation model in this study the governing equations of the inundation model are composed of the continuity equation momentum equation turbulent kinetic energy equation and turbulence dissipation rate equation more details can be found in wang et al 2017 and the general form of the governing equation is as follows 1 ρ ϕ t ρ u ϕ x ρ v ϕ y ρ w ϕ z x γ ϕ x y γ ϕ y z γ ϕ z s where ϕ represents a set of constant 1 the velocity component u v and w the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulence dissipation rate ε ρ is the density of a fluid kg m 3 γ is the generalized diffusion coefficient and s is the source phase set of the constant term momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulence dissipation rate when the hydraulic boundary information is given to the inundation model the inundated range can easily be obtained by the vof method and the inundated depth map of land use types can be determined by overlaying the dem and the land use maps with the inundated range map 5 2 transfer and correction of depth damage curves damage factors are defined as the ratio of the potential damage value to the total risky assets at a certain inundated depth because no site specific curves are available in sz city the damage depth curves developed in sh city with similar levels of development to those in sz city are used in this study and both of them are chinese first tier cities to reduce the regional deviation the ratio of pcdi to grdp is introduced to adjust the damage depth curves and the formulas are given as follows 2 f h d η f h d 3 η r pcdi r grdp r pcdi r grpd where f h d and f h d are the depth damage curves before and after correction respectively h d is the inundated depth m η is the regional correction coefficient and r pcdi and r grpd are the values of pcdi and grdp respectively yuan through the above adjustments the damage depth curves of the land use type suitable for local situation of sz city are established the corrected damage depth curves of the land use types are shown in fig 3 the damage factors of buildings are affected by building height in addition to inundated depth and the existing damage depth curves for buildings are limited to single story buildings which the maximum inundated depth within 3 m with the development of social economy more and more high rise buildings have been built in sz city the single story damage curves cannot be applied to multi story buildings supposing that multi story buildings share the same correlation between damage factors and inundated depth in each floor the damage depth curves suitable for multi story buildings are developed in this study the damage to buildings mainly comes from wall floor and indoor properties and the damage depth curves transferred and adjusted from single story curves are derived as follows the damage depth curve of wall 4 f 1 h d d h d d 1 h d d h d d the damage depth curve of floor 5 f 2 h d d i n t h d a d d h d a i n t h d d 1 d d a h d h d d 1 h d h d d the damage depth curve of indoor properties 6 f 3 h d d i n t h d d d d f h h d h d d 1 h d d 7 h h d i n t h d d d where d is building height m d is the height of each story a is the height of the first floor to the ground m usually equal to 0 15 m h is the value of the height exceeding the integer multiple of d m and int is a rounding function 5 3 vulnerability assessment model based on local spatial dependence based probabilistic approach 5 3 1 uncertainty processing of the value of assets at risk the value of assets at risk is defined as the potential damage amount of unit land use area and is critical in the urban flood vulnerability calculation the average value of the study area for each land use type was obtained from the china national statistical data center http www stats gov cn tjsj ndsj due to the objective existence of measurement error and that the sample space cannot be exhausted a certain degree of uncertainty exists in the value of assets at risk for land use types to process the uncertainty caused by spatial variability a triangular distribution and a lognormal distribution are chosen to characterize the heterogeneity of the risky assets following egorova et al 2008 and moel et al 2012 the statistical characteristics are derived from de moel et al 2014 table 1 the probability density functions are given by triangular distribution 8 t r x a b m 2 x a m a b a a x b 2 b x b m b a m x b where a and b are the upper and lower boundaries respectively x is the sampling probability and m is mode lognormal distribution 9 l g n x μ σ 1 x σ 2 π e x p ln x μ 2 2 σ 2 10 σ l n 1 δ 2 11 μ ln e x 0 5 σ 2 where μ and σ are the shape parameters of the lognormal distribution e x is the sample mean and δ is sample deviation coefficient 5 3 2 uncertainty and spatial dependence model of the damage function the damage function represents the relationship between the degree of damage and the flood inundation characteristics which has a significant impact on the vulnerability assessment due to the lack of a unified standard for transferring specific damage functions from other contexts damage depth curves transferred from other areas contain a certain uncertainty in shape for each land use type and the uncertainty in building height adds extra uncertainty in the damage modelling process moreover damage factors are dependent on neighbouring cells therefore the uncertainty and the spatial dependence of damage factors should be accounted for the vulnerability assessment 1 uncertainty processing of the damage depth curves to take the uncertainty in the damage curves into account a beta distribution is chosen to process the fraction motivated by the fact that the beta distribution can be concentrated on the narrow intervals and possess low probability in the tails following egorova et al 2008 the shape of the beta distribution varies with inundated depth for each land use type and the expected value is always equal to the value of the deterministic damage curves the probability distribution function of the beta distribution can be expressed as follows 12 b e x α β γ α β γ α γ β x α 1 1 x β 1 13 α 1 k 1 f h d 14 β 1 k 1 1 f h d where α and β are the shape parameters of beta distribution k is the constraint coefficient for ensuring α 0 and β 0 2 spatial dependence processing based on improved smw analysis to take the spatial dependence of damage for different damage categories into account the spatial autocorrelation function is derived from random field theory following jiang et al 2014 the exponential 2d autocorrelation function is used to determine the range of the spatial autocorrelation which is defined as 15 ρ x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 θ xy exp 2 x 1 x 2 2 y 1 y 2 2 θ xy where x 1 y 1 and x 2 y 2 are the central coordinates of two cells in a damage category at risk and θ xy is the spatial correlation distance which is assumed to be equal in the horizontal and vertical directions it is known from the above deduction that the damage factors of neighbouring cells from the same land use type are locally correlated within a certain distance additionally recall that the damage depth curves obey a beta distribution this means that if the damage factor in one cell is given by the inverse cumulative probability function of the beta distribution f 1 p 1 and the other cell s damage factor can be obtained by f 1 p 2 assuming that the probability of damage occurrence p 1 and p 2 is correlated for convenience in the following sections the symbols y and x are used to represent p 2 and p 1 respectively following wielen and wielen 2015 and geer et al 2016 discretizing the probability distribution function of damage occurrence into multiple tiny segments based on differential principle bergman et al 1940 roh et al 2016 the central point probability of two discretization points can be approximated by linear functions therefore the probability correlation function p x of the selected neighbouring cells at a certain spatial distances is deduced as follows 16 y p x a x b where a is the function coefficient and b is a constant knowing that x and y satisfy the same distribution the statistical characteristic parameters are determined as follows 17 e x μ d y σ 2 then 18 e y a e x b a μ b d y a 2 d y a 2 σ 2 e x y e a x 2 b x 19 ρ xy cov x y d x d y 20 c o v x y e x y e x e y solving eqs 17 20 a and b can be obtained 21 a ρ xy b μ 1 ρ xy considering that the magnitude of correlation of the occurrences probability will changes with spatial distance of neighbouring cells coupled with the spatial autocorrelation function substituting eqs 15 and 21 into eqs 16 the probability correlation function p x can extended to a 2d probability spatial correlation function 22 p x ρ x μ 1 ρ ρ ρ x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 θ xy within the range of correlation distances more than one cell affects the damage factor of the computing cell and the degree of influence decreases with distance to address this issue the boundary of each land use type is extracted according to satellite images the domain is discretized into raster cells of 10 10 m2 with unique numeric identification in the following computation and the value of the sampling probability p p 0 1 is initialized by the lhs method chen et al 2018 a window with half window width of θ xy m is assigned in the domain of land use type as shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the damage factors of cells within the window are mutually dependent therefore the initialized sample probability needs to be reconfigured by the probability correlation function the entropy weight method xu et al 2018 is used to improve the msw analysis for determining the weight of neighbouring cells at different correlation distances the implementation process can be described as follows step 1 supposing the central cell of the window is the computing cell o k x y k 1 2 m the window space ω can be defined as 23 ω x y ω x y d ω x y θ xy 24 d ω x y m a x x i x y i y the initial sampling probability set π of cells within the window of which the components contained are determined by different correlation distances can be expressed as 25 π p i p 0 d ω x y 0 p 1 d ω x y 10 p n d ω x y θ xy i 0 1 2 n θ xy 10 26 p i x i 1 x i 2 x ij where p i is the set of initial sampling probabilities derived from neighbouring cells at a distance of 10i m and j is the number of neighbouring cells at a certain distance step 2 substituting p i and the corresponding coordinates into eq 22 the sampling probability of the central cell p io considering the local spatial correlation at a distance of 10i m is given by 27 p i o k p p i p o k i 1 p o k i 2 p o kin 28 p o kij ρ x j μ 1 ρ j 1 2 n step 3 the weight of neighbouring cells is calculated by shannon entropy xu et al 2018 and the entropy weight is given as follows 29 e i j 1 n p o ij l n p o kij l n n 30 div i 1 e i 31 w i div i i 0 θ xy 10 div i where e i is the entropy value and div i is the degree of divergence of ith distance step 4 integrating the sampling probability derived from different correlation distances the reconfigured sampling probability p o k is defined by eq 32 32 p o k 1 n i 0 θ xy 10 j 1 n w i p i o kj step 5 when the sampling probability of central cell o k x y is configured the centre of the window is then shifted to another cell o k 1 x d x y d y by one step in any position the imsw analysis procedure is repeated until all the cells within the range of land use type have been configured the sampling probability p considering the spatial correlation is expressed as follows 33 p p o 1 p o 2 p o k p o m then the damage factors of the cells are determined by the inverse cumulative probability function of the beta distribution f 1 p 5 3 3 implementation of the integrated vulnerability model based on the concept of vulnerability the urban flood vulnerability is determined by an integrated index that is expressed as the function of the values of the assets at risk and the damage factors for each land use type to eliminate the influence of dimension per unit risky asset is normalized by eq 34 34 r valueofassetatrisk m i n max m i n integrating all the vulnerability scores of the land use types the integrated urban flood vulnerability vi is given as 35 vi n 1 4 r n p n n 1 2 3 4 where n is the number of land use types agriculture road outbuilding and building to simulate urban flood vulnerability the integrated vulnerability model is implemented by the lhs framework coupled with the breach growth model inundation model and damage model first the inundation model is conducted by a 3d numerical simulation providing flood inundation characteristics for the determination of the damage factors and inundated depth then to take the uncertainty of the unit risky assets the damage curve shapes and the building height and the dependence of damage factors into account the lhs and entropy weight based msw method are coupled in this study and the normalized value of the risky assets r and the correlated damage factors p can be obtained integrating r and p derived from different land use types by geographic information system gis approaches the integrated vulnerability of the study area is finally calculated by eq 35 to analyse the uncertainty and sensitivity the modelling procedure is written in matlab and 500 simulations at θ xy 100 200 a n d 400 are run 6 results and discussion 6 1 analysis of urban flood inundation characteristics for illustration purposes flooding in the downstream urban area of the tg reservoir is taken as a case study the flood inflow process from 1 2000 year return period is substituted into the breach growth model wang et al 2017 then the discharge hydrograph of the tg reservoir can be obtained provided by the q t curve as shown in fig 5 the result of flood routing derived from a 1 2000 year return period event is shown in fig 6 as seen from the figure the inundated area is mostly located in the northeast of the study area and accounts for 49 94 of the total area which means that half of the urban area is affected by flooding from further analysis of the land use types in the inundated area it can be found that outbuilding land is the most widely affected accounting for almost 70 of the total area followed by building land which accounts for approximately one third of the outbuilding land and agricultural land is the least affected probably because its location is far from the breach and is difficult to flood the maximum inundated depth reaches 22 m mainly concentrated in the middle area of the study area because of the low lying terrain such a considerable inundation depth will cause a devastating disaster to the surrounding area therefore integrated flood vulnerability analysis is necessary for urban flood risk prediction and risk reduction 6 2 spatial characteristics of the elements at risk 6 2 1 spatial differentiation analysis of the value of the assets at risk the values of the assets at risk are assumed to be mutually independent for different land use types and the same categories of assets at risk are spatially heterogeneous for a better reflection of spatial heterogeneity the study area is discretized into raster cells of 10 10 m2 once the inundated area is determined by solving the inundation model the unit value of the assets with uncertainty for each land use type is calculated by the lhs method the spatial differentiation maps are shown in fig 7 frequency statistical analysis shows that the average unit value of the assets for agriculture road and outbuilding accords with the characteristics of the triangular distribution see fig 7 a c this conforms to lognormal distribution for buildings which is divided into indoor property floor and wall for the analysis due to the complexity of the building structure see fig 7 d f fig 7 c and a show that most of the study area is covered by outbuildings with the maximum value of the assets at risk mainly fluctuating from 2700 to 4000 y u a n m 2 whereas that of agriculture is fluctuates minimally from 15 to 23 y u a n m 2 the risky assets of roads are more evenly distributed mainly fluctuating from 500 to 700 y u a n m 2 and the buildings are more discrete where the maximum value is 10 times the minimum value in indoor property see fig 7 b and d f every raster cell of each land use type is assigned a random value to satisfy the relevant probability distribution provided in table 1 which can fully reveal the uncertainty in the value of the assets at risk caused by spatial heterogeneity 6 2 2 spatial distribution of the damage factors for the land use types inputting the inundated depths of the cells at risk of each land use type the damage factors considering the local spatial dependence within the range of correlation distances are obtained by imsw analysis for illustration the distribution of the damage factors for some of the land use types at a correlation distance of 200 m is shown in fig 8 the spatial patterns of the varied damage categories are remarkably different which manifests as outbuilding land shows the widest range and highest value due to the considerable inundated area and depth while the agricultural land shows the lowest value with the smallest scale because of its location far away from the breach moreover the high values zone red of the damage factors for agriculture and outbuilding are mainly concentrated in the urban central area because the central area is located in the low lying area at the foot of the mountain where it is prone to water accumulation see fig 8 a and b however the building land floor shows a different distribution pattern the high values are mainly located in the southwest because the damage factors of the floor depend not only on the inundated depth but also on the story height see fig 8 c high value areas will suffer more damage when encountering the same level of flooding where the assets should be reasonably allocated from the perspective of standard deviation sd after 500 simulations the sd of the damage factor for each land use type is basically less than 0 1 which indicates that the proposed method can provide reliable indicators for flood vulnerability analysis considering the uncertainty 6 3 integrated urban flood vulnerability analysis the integrated vulnerability results consist of road vulnerability agriculture vulnerability building vulnerability and outbuilding vulnerability for the city downstream of the tg reservoir are analysed and mapped in fig 9 the overall distribution patterns of vulnerability are similar to the characteristic distributions of the damage factors it might be that the damage factors have a considerable contribution to the vulnerability it can also be seen from the vulnerability maps that outbuilding vulnerability has a great impact on the integrated vulnerability while the vulnerability of agriculture and building have less impact the results indicated that the integrated vulnerability of the study area can be divided into 5 grades by the natural breaking point method chuanglin et al 2016 which are very low low moderated high and very high according to the statistical analysis more than three quarters of the areas are basically not vulnerable and that the grade is very low it is noteworthy that the high level and very high level areas are 3 89 and 2 91 respectively and these areas should be given priority for evacuation when encountering urban floods comparing the integrated vulnerability maps derived from the lcm at the local correlation distances of 100 200 and 400 m the impacts of the spatial correlation distance on the integrated vulnerability are analysed in fig 10 the results show that the spatial patterns of integrated vulnerability are roughly the same fig 10 a c and the vulnerability distribution for 100 m is relatively dispersed the frequency analysis of vulnerability at different degrees reveals that the proportion of very low level vulnerability increases with correlation distance and the other degrees of vulnerability show the opposite trend see fig 10 d the negligible differences between 200 and 400 m indicate that there is little impact on vulnerability when the correlation distance exceeds 200 m therefore when the correlation distance is 200 m ideal results can be obtained and the calculated consumption can be reduced the above analyses show that the whole study area presents a relatively low degree of vulnerability and the red marked area see fig 10 b should give more attention when urban flooding occurs the proposed method with the lcm considering the uncertainty and local dependence of vulnerability can obtain more convincing results and the correlation distance is recommended to be 200 m to balance calculation stability and calculation efficiency the resulting vulnerability distribution is more regionalized filtering out some areas with a negligible degree of vulnerability which makes the implementation of flood mitigation strategies more purposeful and resource allocation more effective 6 4 comparison with other methods the validity of the proposed method considering local spatial dependence was assessed by a comparison with the ccm and ncm which concluded that the proposed method has better consistency representativeness and superiority the comparative results are shown in figs 11 14 1 the distribution of each level on integrated vulnerability derived from the three methods and the consistency of the results of the lcm compared with the ccm and ncm are illustrated in fig 11 generally the results of the lcm are agree with those of the other two methods except for the low level vulnerability in which almost 11 of the areas are classified as low vulnerable according to the lcm 10 according to the cmm and 19 according to the ncm which is quite different from the former two methods from fig 11 b we can conclude that the evaluation results of vulnerability at different levels obtained by the lcm and ccm are consistent comparing the lcm with the ncm the other four levels very low moderate high and very high share the same proportion except for the result of low level vulnerability moreover the mean absolute error mae and the mean square error mse of the proportion of vulnerability levels between the lcm with the ccm and ncm are relatively small the above results show good consistency between the various methods 2 detailed distribution information of the high level and very high level vulnerability of the study area obtained by the three methods are given in fig 12 as we can see 3 9 of the area is identified as a high level vulnerable area and 3 0 of the area is identified as a very high level vulnerable area according to the ccm while for the ncm approximately 4 1 of the area has a high vulnerability level and 2 9 of the area has a very high vulnerability level a similar conclusion can also be drawn by the lcm with 3 9 of the area exhibiting high level vulnerability and 2 9 of the area exhibiting very high level vulnerability for the identification of the risk areas almost 6 8 of the area s vulnerability levels are considered at high or above levels that can be drawn from each of the three methods which show good representativeness of the proposed method among all the methods 3 to analyse the impact of spatial dependence on vulnerability the comparative analyses of integrated vulnerability derived from the lcm ccm and ncm are illustrated in fig 13 sharing the same distribution regularities with the damage factor maps the integrated vulnerability from the ncm is widely distributed and dispersed across the whole study area see fig 13 c and that of the lcm and ccm are relatively localized and regionalized when considering the spatial dependence of the damage factors at the neighbourhoods scale see fig 13 a and 13 b the reason for the remarkable difference between the lcm ccm and ncm is that the damage factors of the cells in the ncm are assumed to be mutually independent while the lcm and ccm take spatial dependence into account the difference is that the lcm emphasizes the value is local dependent at the neighbourhood scale and the ccm assumes that the damage factors of the cells are completely dependent on the same land use type but fails to reflect the uncertainty caused by the damage curve shapes with a comprehensive consideration of uncertainty and local spatial dependence the results of the lcm are more in line with reality based on the vulnerability results of the lhs simulations the average standard deviation and 90 confidence interval derived from the lcm ccm and ncm are shown in fig 14 the average map of the ncm is more dispersed than that of lcm and ccm and the standard deviation derived from the ncm is more widely distributed and larger than that of the lcm and ccm a smaller standard deviation indicates a lower uncertainty and higher confidence therefore the results indicate that the integrated vulnerability scores of the lcm and ccm are more reliable moreover the ranges of the 90 confidence interval represented by radar charts show the conclusion again especially in the low level vulnerable areas while the results of lcm had the minimum deviation see fig 13 d verifying the robustness and reliability of the proposed method 6 5 analysis of uncertainty and sensitivity 6 5 1 uncertainty analysis to investigate the uncertainty of the results derived by the proposed method and the effects of spatial correlation distance on the uncertainty following tang et al 2018a b the study area was divided into four groups low average low standard deviation ll low average high standard deviation lh high average high standard deviation hh and high average low standard deviation hl the hl regions with high average values and low standard deviations are more robust vulnerable areas and the ll regions are in the low level of vulnerability with high confidence the other regions are more controversial the spatial patterns of uncertainty for the correlation distances of 100 200 and 400 m are shown in fig 15 the results show that the areas of ll regions decrease from 97 46 to 97 27 with increasing correlation distances while the hl regions show the opposite trend compared with the results of 400 m the hl regions derived from the correlation distance of 200 m are slightly reduced see fig 15b the results show that the proposed method with a correlation distance of 200 m is considered to be reliable and cost effective in terms of calculation accuracy and efficiency 6 5 2 sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis based on the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast method wang et al 2013 is implemented to demonstrate the dominant factors responsible for integrated vulnerability the first order sensitivity index s i and total sensitivity index st i are taken as indicators to analyse the parameter sensitivity on vulnerability fig 16 shows that the sensitivity parameters ranked in the top 6 from the total sensitivity analysis are basically consistent with those of the first order sensitivity analysis except for the reconfigured sampling probability of agriculture agriculturersp and the value of the assets at risk for road roadvoar however the internal ordering is significantly different that is outbuildingvoar floorvoar indoorvoar buildingheight wallvoar agriculturersp in the first order sensitivity analysis and wallvoar floorvoar indoorvoar outbuildingvoar roadvoar buildingheight in the total sensitivity analysis the total sensitivity indices are more uniform than the first order sensitivity indices because total sensitivity analysis considers the coupling effects between parameters which are objective in vulnerability assessments therefore the total sensitivity indices are suggested to represent the sensitivity of parameters on integrated urban flood vulnerability the results show that the risky assets of buildings consisting of wall floor and indoor property are the most dominant factors followed by the risky assets of outbuildings and roads and building height also makes an important contribution to vulnerability to further investigate the effects of spatial correlation distances on sensitivity the root mean square errors rmse of three groups of sensitivity indices for different correlation distances 100 m versus 200 m 100 m versus 400 m and 200 m versus 400 m are compared and illustrated in fig 17 the rmse values of 100 m versus 200 m and 100 m versus 400 m are 0 0308 and 0 0251 respectively while that of 200 m versus 400 m is 0 0067 which is one order of magnitude smaller than the formers this indicates that the error of sensitivity between 200 m and 400 m is relatively small and negligible compared to that of 100 m indicating that the sensitivity indices calculated with a correlation distance of 200 m are reliable 7 conclusion this study presents an integrated vulnerability assessment approach using a local spatial dependence based probabilistic approach different from other similar studies that focused on the uncertainties in damage or risk assessments and failed to consider spatial heterogeneity and local dependence simultaneously the proposed approach comprehensively considers the uncertainties in the values of the assets at risk caused by spatial heterogeneity and in the damage depth curves caused by the lack of specific site research and the local spatial dependence of damage factors at the neighbourhood scale applied to a downstream urban area of the tg reservoir in sz city in china and compared with the two other methods the proposed approach is highly consistent and representative with the ccm and ncm and the superiority of the proposed method is verified the most influential factor for vulnerability can be identified by a sensitivity analysis and the target information for the decision of risk mitigation strategies can be provided the constructive and significative conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the values of the assets at risk for each land use type are represented by a probability distribution which can fully reveal the spatial heterogeneity of the risky assets and provide the prerequisites for the effectiveness of vulnerability assessment 2 in this approach the inundation model damage model and vulnerability assessment model are dynamically coupled in a probabilistic framework the uncertainties of the risky assets and damage curves as well as the local spatial dependence of the damage factors are simultaneously considered and propagated across the modelling chain based on the imsw analysis and the lhs method which can capture the spatial variability and correlation at the neighbourhood scale and provide more trustworthy and robust vulnerability assessment results 3 the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis performed in the study which is based on statistical analysis and the efast method demonstrates the reliability of the proposed approach and identifies the dominant factors responsible for vulnerability which provides more targeted information for the formulation of risk mitigation measures like many other probabilistic framework based methods the proposed method is not without limitations the major limitation is the high computational resource requirements in the stochastic simulation although the lhs method having superior sampling performance is adopted considerable computational costs were demanded in this study due to the wide extent of the study area with 42 490 raster cells of 10 10 m2 to reduce the computational cost only three correlation distance settings of 100 200 and 400 m were compared and analysed the following is that few studies give clear guidelines for the transfer and adjustment of damage depth curves which is an important step in the implementation of the proposed approach therefore further study should be devoted to developing a scientific method to deal with transferring damage depth

6358,this study proposes a general differential split sample test gdsst based on an oriented bootstrap to assess the transferability of conceptual rainfall runoff models to climatically contrasting periods compared to existing benchmark techniques the gdsst allows a larger number of climatically contrasted discontinuous periods to be sampled and is computationally more effective than the basic bootstrap to identify the most contrasted periods when applied to three hydrological models gr4j hbv and ihacres in five catchments in northern tunisia the gdsst provided clear limits of the transferability of the models under changing precipitation p and temperature t conditions towards drier and hotter conditions according to the criteria and thresholds retained approximate limits of model transferability are drawn the models are roughly transferable for relative changes in precipitation δp 0 08 δt 0 18 with δp 30 80 and changes in temperature δt 2 c 2 c these transferability limits suggest selecting a past sub period as close as possible to the future climate to identify calibration parameters which can be used for hydrological projections the limits of transferability were then compared to climate projections by eight high resolution regional climate model rcm simulations resulting from the euro cordex initiative the rcms precipitation and temperature simulations of the historical period 1970 2000 were first assessed to select the most realistic ones for future projections a delta change monthly correction was used to perturb the observed climate series according to climate simulations under two radiative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for one medium term horizon 2040 2070 and one long term horizon 2070 2100 the effects of the selected past calibration period on the hydrological projections were then analysed the rcp 8 5 climate projections fall outside the limits of transferability of all rainfall runoff models tested models calibrated on the whole observed period were found to underestimate the impacts of climate change on runoff by 5 20 in comparison with models calibrated on sub periods with mean annual p and t closer to projected climate conditions keywords rainfall runoff modelling split sample tests parameter transferability climate scenarios cordex tunisia 1 introduction 1 1 simulating the impact of climate change on runoff several studies have shown that climate change has already affected available water resources worldwide e g haddeland et al 2014 and is expected to have even more severe impacts in the future e g hageman et al 2013 ipcc 2013 however assessing the potential impact of climate change on runoff precisely requires both high resolution climate projections and models capable of reliably representing the hydrological processes in recent decades and at the scale of basins that are sufficiently representative of water management issues i e several hundred to several thousand square kilometres fabre et al 2016 in developing countries the use of physically based distributed models is generally hampered by insufficient data to force and control the models consequently model validation is usually based on the streamflow at the outlet which does not guarantee that the water redistribution processes and their interactions are well represented within the catchment application is even harder when it comes to testing the ability of models to reproduce multi decadal hydrological variability which is a prerequisite for studying the impact of climate change on water resources ruelland et al 2012 therefore conceptual models representing the functioning of the basins using a small number of empirical equations whose few parameters can be calibrated with a minimum of data are often preferred particularly in a context of data scarcity e g bastola et al 2011 chen et al 2011 hublart et al 2016 ruelland et al 2012 ruelland et al 2015 on the other hand their relative simplicity and the need to calibrate their parameters on current data do not always plead for their use when conditions shift beyond the range of prior experience hublart et al 2015 as it can be the case in a framework of future change see e g vaze et al 2010 the use of conceptual models is therefore conditional on the estimation of the uncertainty associated with the modelling process itself which is a combination of uncertainties evolving from input and control data model structures parameterization and parameter transferability under non stationary conditions such as climate change or variability 1 2 review of the literature on the problem of model parameter transferability to climate change parameter transferability can be defined as the ability of a model to perform with the same level of accuracy under conditions that differ from those used for its calibration seiller et al 2012 it requires particular attention in studies on the impact of climate change because it can be an important source of uncertainty in the hydrological modelling chain as already pointed out by many authors e g brigode et al 2013 coron et al 2012 poulin et al 2011 fowler et al 2016 melsen et al 2018 many techniques have thus been proposed to assess potential parameter transferability under different climate conditions for instance the differential split sample test dsst klemeš 1986 is a powerful procedure to evaluate transferability under climate variability it consists of calibration and validation exercises for hydrological models using sub periods with contrasted climate conditions which make it possible to evaluate model transferability from one climate condition to another the idea behind performing a dsst is that the errors made when extrapolating from one set of observed climate conditions to another different set could correspond to the errors made when reference data is used for calibration and extrapolation to future climate conditions seibert 2003 the main variables used in the dsst to discretize sub periods of different climate conditions are precipitation and or temperature e g refsgaard and knudsen 1996 vaze et al 2010 seiller et al 2012 tramblay et al 2013 ruelland et al 2015 hartmann and bárdossy 2005 dakhlaoui et al 2017 potential evapotranspiration coron et al 2012 and runoff seibert 2003 vormoor et al 2018 the use of dsst is generally based on clustering reference periods on two climate contrasted sub periods and generally according to only one climate variable e g refsgaard and knudsen 1996 seibert 2003 wu and johnston 2007 vaze et al 2010 ruelland et al 2015 as a result it provides a limited number of calibration and validation samples directly linked to the available data which does not help fully understand the behaviour of the rainfall runoff models rrm under climate variability moreover the implications of rrm robustness under a changing climate remains unknown since potential changes in climate may go beyond the observed variability see ruelland et al 2012 guo et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 these limits led several authors to increase the number of calibration validation exercises and to expand the range of hydro climatic changes between these periods to better explore model robustness under climate variability for example hartmann and bárdossy 2005 divided a 30 year observation period into three sub periods first in terms of mean annual temperature warm normal and cold and second in terms of annual precipitation wet normal and dry years this made it possible to increase the number of validation exercises for each climate variable and catchment to six compared to the two dsst periods usually used and to sample more contrasted sub periods tolson and shoemaker 2007 divided the observation period into three sub periods a 6 year period for calibration and two independent validation series of three years and one year respectively which allowed them to check the model s performance under contrasted hydrological conditions dakhlaoui et al 2017 simultaneously used mean annual temperature and precipitation values to generate four climate contrasted sub periods hot wet cold wet hot dry and cold wet which allowed a bigger number of validation exercises 12 per catchment to be considered and the use of contrasted sub periods in terms of temperature and precipitation coron et al 2012 developed a generalized version of sst so called general split sample test gsst and hereafter called sliding window sst which allows a large number of calibration validation exercises by sampling sub periods based on a sliding window over the reference period this technique allowed even more validation exercises than the previous ones and better exploration of observed climate variability in 216 catchments in southeast australia coron 2013 proposed another version of gsst hereafter called random bootstrap sst by generating sub periods according to a bootstrap where a large number of randomly selected combinations of years are used for calibration and for validation this technique was revisited recently by arsenault et al 2018 to evaluate how the length of the calibration period impacted the transferability of two hydrological models in three north american catchments to explore a larger continuum of model behaviour guo et al 2018 used a stochastic weather generator to generate synthetic climate data to represent future climate conditions which made it possible to assess the transferability of three rrms gr4j awbm and cmd beyond conditions in existing records however one limitation of the proposed methodology is that it is based on only one climate variable precipitation furthermore the authors reported that the stochastic weather generator had difficulty representing natural variability 1 3 research needs revealed by the review of literature even though the gsst sliding window sst or random bootstrap sst seems to offer the most complete sst its use presents some limitations indeed the gsst was not specifically designed to identify contrasted periods only but rather to create an ensemble of conditions ranging from similar to contrasted as a result unlike dsst it does not explicitly ensure that the most climatically contrasted periods are selected when applied to continuous years through a sliding window the gsst provides contrasted climatic conditions which result mainly from the climate trends over the reference period and or smoothed climatic variability over the selected continuous periods when applied to discontinuous years through a random bootstrap the gsst can theoretically select the most contrasted periods if all combinations are sampled which is computationally unrealistic when considering multi decadal periods on the contrary the dsst applications found in the literature were intended to explicitly identify a climatic contrast between the periods based on a statistical climate analysis for example by grouping the wettest driest years in the same period on the other hand the gsst has the major advantage of generating a large number of time periods composed of a continuum of climatic conditions for a more complete assessment of the transferability of conceptual hydrological models this calls for a sst technique which could sample a large number sub periods composed of discontinuous years and gathering similar to contrasted conditions in terms of precipitation and temperature while ensuring that the most climatically contrasted sub periods are sampled although many authors have used dsst to evaluate rrm transferability under climate variability e g refsgaard and knudsen 1996 vaze et al 2010 seiller et al 2012 tramblay et al 2013 ruelland et al 2015 hartmann and bárdossy 2005 seibert 2003 only a few quantified changes in climatic variables which allow acceptable transferability of model results and generally only precipitation was used to define the limits of transferability for example vaze et al 2010 tested four rainfall runoff models in 61 catchments in southwest australia and suggested that calibration periods of at least 20 years were needed for robust models under climate variability but only if the difference in mean rainfall between calibration and validation period was greater than 15 for drier climates and less than 20 for wetter climates similarly bastola et al 2011 found for two irish catchments that model transferability was less affected when the difference in rainfall between calibration and validation periods was less than 10 singh et al 2011 identified an acceptable range of changes in precipitation 10 to 20 with no marked effect on model transferability for five catchments across continental usa coron et al 2012 evaluated the robustness of three rrms gr4j mordor6 and simhyd under simultaneous changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet in southeast australia and reported that on average a 20 absolute bias was observed with a 10 20 change in precipitation and a 1 2 change in pet between the calibration and validation periods however as mentioned above the sliding window sst used in coron et al 2012 was not intended to specifically focus on contrasted periods but rather to create a continuum of conditions from similar climatic conditions to contrasted ones in order to better evaluate the evolution of model behaviour with increasing contrasts between different time periods in a recent study dakhlaoui et al 2017 we evaluated the transferability of three rrms gr4j hbv and ihacres under simultaneous precipitation and temperature variability in catchments representative of hydro climatic conditions in northern tunisia we showed that the difference in climate conditions between calibration and validation periods progressively affected the performance of hydrological models we also showed that the models tested were transferable to wetter and or colder conditions however the model robustness became unacceptable when climate conditions involved a decrease of more than 25 in annual precipitation and an increase in annual mean temperatures of more than 1 75 c however the dsst we used only generated small number of calibration and validation exercises four calibration exercises and 12 validation exercises for each catchment and provided little information on rrms transferability under moderate climate changes in addition only a few studies have put the rrm transferability limits into perspective in the context of climate projections see e g singh et al 2011 guo et al 2018 as a result there is a need for a more precise definition of the limits of transferability of conceptual models in terms of δt and δp and for these limits to be put into perspective with respect to available high resolution climate projections this is of particular importance in the mediterranean region which is known to be a hot spot of climate change notably the southern rim cramer et al 2018 indeed recent climate change scenarios in the mediterranean region predicted a potential 20 decrease in total precipitation and a 1 c to 3 c increase in mean annual temperature by the 2050 horizon compared with the 1971 1990 period milano et al 2012 schilling et al 2012 terink et al 2013 tramblay et al 2018 these climate changes would have a considerable effect on the surface water resources of southern mediterranean countries which already suffer from water paucity blinda and thivet 2009 on the other hand the few studies which evaluated the hydrological impacts of climate change in the mediterranean region e g milano et al 2012 droogers et al 2012 sellami et al 2015 did not take into account the limits of transferability of the hydrological models they used this calls for an evaluation of the effect of the expected loss in performance of rrms under future climate change and for more reliable hydrological projections to enable better climate change adaptation strategies 1 4 objectives this paper proposes an improved sst technique to test the robustness of hydrological models by selecting time periods with contrasted conditions in terms of temperature and precipitation the proposed technique was compared to three other split sampled methods to demonstrate its efficiency it was then used to assess the transferability of conceptual rainfall runoff models under multi decadal climate variability with a view to simulating hydrological scenarios based on high resolution climate projections in northern tunisia we compared the limits of transferability with future climate scenarios obtained from high resolution euro cordex regional climate models finally we analysed the effect of the selection of the calibration period on the limits of rrm robustness on the hydrological projections 2 description of the split sample techniques 2 1 three benchmark sst techniques the sst methods selected to be tested on the study catchments were i a sliding window sst coron et al 2012 ii a random bootstrap sst coron 2013 arsenault et al 2018 and iii a 4 sub period dsst dakhlaoui et al 2017 these three techniques were selected because they enable simultaneous investigation of the effect of t and p on model transferability under climate variability the first technique was adopted in several studies coron et al 2012 2014 guo et al 2018 vormoor et al 2018 the second one inspired our proposed dsst to randomly combine independent years in the sample and the third one was recently successfully used in northern tunisia to sample very climatically contrasted sub periods these three techniques are described in fig 1 and table 1 the sliding window sst technique coron et al 2012 consists in using calibration validation tests on independent sub periods of equal length considering all possible pairs of sub periods the sampling method used to generate sub periods is based on sliding windows applied over the reference period the technique enables the identification of l n 1 calibration sub periods where n is the number of years composing each sub periods and l is the total number of years of the reference period the random bootstrap sst technique coron 2013 arsenault et al 2018 relies on a sub period sampling technique which is based on a random combination of discontinuous years bootstrap this sampling technique is time consuming since the possible number of calibration sub periods is equal to c n l for example the random bootstrap sst technique results in around six million possible 8 year sub periods if applied to a 30 year reference period its application then requires a priori selection of the number of permitted calibration exercises due to limited time budget for model calibration and validation the implementation of the 4 sub period dsst dakhlaoui et al 2017 requires the calculation of the annual precipitation and mean temperature for each hydrological year of the reference period the sub periods are thus made up of clusters of climatically contrasted years to create these clusters the hydrological years are first distributed into two equal groups of hydrological years dry years and wet years according to the annual precipitation median for the reference period fig 1c dry and wet years are defined as years with respectively less or more total precipitation than the median of the reference period for each group the median of the mean annual temperature is then calculated which serves to distinguish hot and cold years the four final groups of hydrological years are hot dry hd hot wet hw cold dry cd and cold wet cw years see fig 1 using the three above techniques makes it possible to identify different numbers of calibration sub periods of n years see table 1 all n year periods which do not have any year in common with a given n year calibration period can thus be considered as independent validation exercises as a result the number of validation exercises may not be the same for all calibration periods selected with the sliding window and random bootstrap sst for the 4 sub period sst there are three possible validation exercises for each of the 4 calibration sub period 2 2 proposal for a general differential split sample test gdsst based on the existing sst methods we developed a technique which can take benefit from the random bootstrap sst technique to provide a large number of validation exercises while accounting for the much contrasted δt and δp detected with the 4 sub period dsst in other words the idea was to design a method which uses the sampling of the random bootstrap sst technique but which is oriented so as to obtain the extreme climate contrast provided by the 4 sub period dsst the proposed method was called general differential split sample test gdsst and is described in fig 2 the procedure used to generate k n year sub periods from the l hydrological years from the 1st of september to the 31st of august of reference period is as follows the first year of the n year sub period to be sampled is randomly selected from the l years of the reference period step 1 in fig 2 the l 1 remaining years of the reference period are then sorted based on the order of increasing distance of mahalanobis 1936 to the first selected year in the space of mean annual temperature t and total annual precipitation p step 2 in fig 2 the mahalanobis distance is computed according to the following expression 1 d c y c 1 c y c 1 t σ 1 c y c 1 where d c y c 1 is the mahalanobis distance between a year y from the l 1 remaining years of the reference period and the first selected year in the space of mean annual temperature t and total annual precipitation p c y is a vector representing a year y from the l 1 remaining years of the reference period in the t and p c 1 is a vector representing the first selected year in the t and p space σ is the covariance matrix between t and p of the l years of the reference period using the mahalanobis distance aims at rescaling the t and p axes in order to account for the correlations between the two variables and to calculate standard euclidean distance in a transformed space having unit variance in other words it aims to reduce the dominance of one climatic variable over the other when computing climatic distance between years a trapezoidal probability is then assigned to the l 1 remaining years of the reference period as follows step 3 in fig 2 2 p i 2 m 1 i m m 1 i 1 m 3 p i 0 i m 1 l 1 where p i is the probability assigned to the year with rank i i is the rank of the remaining years of the reference period sorted in order of increasing mahalanobis distance to the originally selected year m is a number selected randomly at each sub period selection from the interval n 1 l 1 the year closest to the year originally retained has the highest probability p 1 2 m 1 and the farthest years has the lowest probability p m 2 m m 1 and p i 0 for i m the n 1 remaining years of the sub period are then selected from the l 1 remaining years of the reference period according to the trapezoidal probability distribution giving more chance to be selected to the years which are the closest to the initial year retained according to the mahalanobis distance defined in the t and p space step 4 in fig 2 the trapezoidal distribution allows only the m years closest to the initial year retained to be selected in the sub period this gives more chance to years with similar climatic conditions to be selected in order to generate more climatically contrasted sub periods however varying randomly m for each sub period generation also allows years with different climatic conditions to be selected this aims at creating a continuum of climatic conditions from similar to contrasted between the sampled sub periods in view of evaluating the model transferability under increasing climate contrasts in case the new created sub period was already sampled it is not retained step 5 in fig 2 the procedure steps 1 to 5 in fig 2 is repeated until the required number of sub periods is reached step 7 in fig 2 the random selection of years in the proposed procedure allows a larger number of sub periods to be selected than with a deterministic procedure where the closest years to the originally retained year are selected in fact in the best case the deterministic procedure provides a number of sub periods equal to the number of observed years e g 30 sub periods for a 30 year reference period the number of calibration sub periods which can be generated by the proposed technique is similar to the random bootstrap sst technique c n l that is why its application requires a priori selection of the number of permitted calibration exercises similarly to the three benchmark sst section 2 1 all n year periods which do not have any year in common with a given n year calibration period can be considered as independent validation exercises with the gdsst see table 1 3 evaluation protocol in this section we present successively the study basins the hydro climatic data and the methods to assess the transferability of three hydrological models under climate contrasted conditions based on the proposed gdsst 3 1 study basins five catchments located in northern tunisia fig 3 were used for the evaluation protocol these basins were selected based on the following criteria i their streamflow regime can be considered as natural since they are located upstream from major hydraulic installations such as dams and water transfers ii the availability of hydro climatic series for the same 30 year period to enable sufficiently climate contrasted sub periods to be sampled for the split sample tests and iii the availability of good quality hydrological data according to hydrological reports with the aim of reducing the impact of data errors on the results the basins are located in the region that produces most of the surface water in tunisia baouab and cherif 2015 the study catchments are situated within a semi arid to humid mediterranean climate with a hot season the hydro climatic characteristics are given in fig 3 more details on the basins can be found in dakhlaoui et al 2017 3 2 hydro climatic data 3 2 1 in situ meteorological data a total of 123 daily rain gauges located in the study region were used see fig 3 these stations were selected because they had less than 30 of daily gaps in the period 1970 2000 thus providing a stable coherent network of measurements for the spatial interpolation of precipitation forcing eight meteorological stations with monthly mean series of daily minimum and maximum temperatures fig 3 were used to compute mean monthly air temperatures which were considered as daily values climate forcing was interpolated on a 2 km grid with the inverse distance weighting technique temperature t was interpolated by accounting for a lapse rate of 0 65 c 100 m see details on the method used in ruelland et al 2014 while precipitation p was interpolated by accounting for altitude via a 4 10 4 corrective factor in the exponential function proposed by valéry et al 2010 the formula of oudin et al 2005 was chosen to estimate pet this formula is based on mean daily air temperature and on estimated clear daily sky solar radiation depending on the latitude of the grid cells 3 2 2 high resolution climate simulations the climate model data used table 2 are simulations and projections of daily mean temperature and precipitation from eight pairs of rcms regional climate models forced by different global circulation models from the euro cordex initiative the most recent climate simulations for the euro mediterranean region with 0 11 resolution 12 12 km the model data for the period 1951 2005 correspond to the historical simulation and 2006 2100 corresponds to future projections two radiative concentration pathway rcp scenarios were used for the future projections rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 which represent respectively moderate and strong greenhouse gas emission scenarios the climate projections were based on two 30 year future periods one medium term 2040 2070 and one long term 2070 2100 horizon they were compared to the past reference period 1970 2000 3 3 model s transferability evaluation under climate contrasted conditions 3 3 1 hydrological models three conceptual hydrological models running at a daily time step were used gr4j perrin et al 2003 hbv bergström 1976 bergström and lindström 2015 and ihacres jakeman et al 1990 croke and jakeman 2004 they were selected because they are parsimonious models and all have to be calibrated based on precipitation pet and runoff data but differ in the way they conceptualise the hydrological processes and in their complexity 4 to 8 free parameters 2 to 3 conceptual reservoirs see table 3 this makes inter comparison of the model simulations possible all three models have recently been applied in tunisia see dakhlaoui et al 2009 2012 2017 further description on the model versions used can be found in dakhlaoui et al 2017 3 3 2 calibration and validation methods model robustness was evaluated through a series of calibration and validation exercises under contrasted precipitation temperature conditions according to the proposed gdsst the three hydrological models gr4j hbv and ihacres were calibrated for the five study catchments over the 100 sub periods generated by the oriented bootstrap technique one optimal parameter set per sub period was thus obtained by calibration the parameter sets obtained were then used to perform all possible independent validation exercises i e any sub periods which do not have any year in common with the calibration sub period the proposed gdsst method thus enabled testing of the models under different conditions from those used for calibration although discontinuous sub periods were used for both model calibration and validation the models were run in a continuous way for the whole reference period while only the years that corresponded to calibration or validation periods were taken into account to compute the efficiency criteria a 3 year warm up period september 1967 to august 1970 was considered before the whole reference period to limit the effect of the storage initialization the model parameters were calibrated using the kling gupta efficiency index kge gupta et al 2009 which represents a compromise between three evaluation criteria correlation coefficient bias error and standard deviation ratio expressed as follows 4 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between observed qobs and simulated qsim flows α is a measure to compare the variability of the observed and predicted data equal to the standard deviation of qsim over the standard deviation of qobs and β is a measure of bias equal to the mean of qsim over the mean of qobs calibration was performed in a 4d 8d and 5d parameter space for gr4j hbv and ihacres respectively by searching for the maximum value of kge to perform this optimization exercise efficiently we used the shuffle complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1992 the algorithmic parameters of sce ua were set to the values recommended by duan et al 1994 we also followed the recommendation of kuczera 1997 who suggested a number of complexes equal to the number of parameters to be optimised and assumed that with these security measures the risk that sce ua falls in local optimal solutions is considerably reduced the parameter feasible ranges were set to usual parameter limits see dakhlaoui et al 2017 although the hydrological models were run at a daily time step their calibration and validation were performed at 10 day time scale i e based on 10 day mean values since preliminary tests showed that day to day variability was difficult to reproduce accurately due to the limited quality of data in space and over time although models were calibrated by kge criteria their performance transferability during validation was evaluated based on the analysis of the nash and sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the cumulated volume error ve we selected these two efficiency criteria because they are commonly used by hydrologists thus making easier their interpretation notably when defining the model transferability limits the nse criterion is as well known form of the normalized least squares objective function it represents the overall agreement of the shape of the hydrograph while placing more emphasis on high flows perfect agreement between the observed and simulated values yields an efficiency of 1 while a negative efficiency represents a lack of agreement worse than if the simulated values were replaced with the observed mean values ve represents the agreement of cumulated runoff volume during the simulation period and is expressed through the proportional difference to observed values its optimal value is zero these criteria are computed according to the following equations 5 nse 1 i 1 n q sim q obs 2 i 1 n q obs q obs 2 where q obs mean observed runoff 6 ve i 1 n q sim i 1 n q obs i 1 n q obs to underline model instability between periods with contrasted climate conditions parameter transferability was assessed as a function of the climate change variables δt and δp between the validation and calibration periods since nse is based on a ratio of the squared model error to the variance of observed flows any changes in variance or volumes between climatically contrasted periods dry wet can affect result of the comparison we thus chose to evaluate model transferability by calculating the differences between nse resulting from the calibration period rr receiver and the nse calculated in the same period but with parameters provided by model calibration on other sub periods dr donor this made it possible to represent the results obtained from the gdsst classified in a grid of δt and δp with a step of 0 2 c and 5 respectively see fig 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of the different sst techniques the three benchmark sst techniques and the proposed gdsst were applied to the five study catchments in northern tunisia the techniques were compared as regards to the number of validation exercises and to the precipitation temperature differences they provided the 30 year reference period over each catchment was based on the hydrological years from the 1st of september to the 31st of august the length of the sub periods was set to 8 years for the sliding window sst the random bootstrap sst and the gdsst however for the 4 sub period dsst the 30 year reference period was spread over 7 8 years hot dry hot wet cold dry and cold wet sub periods since 30 is not a multiple of four a 8 year time span was judged to be suitable for model calibration indeed several studies have shown that three to eight years are generally sufficient for model calibration with validation using a classical split sample test e g yapo et al 1996 anctil et al 2004 moreover using 8 year periods still provided significant differences in mean climate due to the length of available records 30 years and the high variability of the climate conditions under study as a result we assumed it was an acceptable compromise between the length of the period needed for calibration and the number of possible combinations between calibration validation periods the random bootstrap sst results in a large number of possible sub periods if fully applied to a 30 year period around six millions 8 year sub periods due to limited time budget for model calibration and validation we decided to use only 100 randomly selected sub periods for each catchment for sake of fair comparison the same number of randomly selected sub periods was set with the gdsst note that the number of sub periods for the two other techniques is already limited by their design 23 sub periods for the sliding window sst and four for the 4 sub period dsst fig 4 shows the number of validation exercises obtained with the different sampling techniques according to a grid of the differences in mean annual temperature and precipitation between the validation and calibration sub periods δt and δp with a step of 0 2 c and 5 respectively when a given δt and δp did not exist in the classification sample the corresponding square in the figure was coloured in grey the figure allows the spread of the sample provided by each sampling technique to be evaluated in terms of δt and δp additionally table 4 summarizes the number of calibration validation exercises and the ranges in δt and δp provided by the different sampling techniques applied over the 1970 2000 period in the five studied basins fig 4a shows the sample offered by the sliding window sst technique when applied to the five study catchments it provided 1495 possible validation exercises for 115 23 5 basins calibration exercises the differences between the different sub periods in mean precipitation ranged from 20 to 25 and the differences in temperature ranged from 1 8 c to 1 8 c when looking at the random bootstrap sst technique fig 4b it provided 5800 possible validation exercises for a total of 500 calibration 100 5 basins exercises the differences between the different sub periods in mean precipitation ranged from 35 to 50 and in temperature from 1 4 c to 1 4 c the 4 sub period dsst fig 4c provided 60 possible validation exercises from 20 4 5 basins calibration sub periods the differences in mean precipitation obtained ranged from 40 to 60 and in temperature from 2 c to 2 c like the random bootstrap sst the proposed gdsst fig 4d provided many possible validation exercises 9320 from a total of 500 calibration 100 5 basins exercises however the differences in mean precipitation obtained ranged from 45 to 80 and in temperature from 2 c to 2 c although the sliding window sst technique provided numerous validation exercises the differences in p δp were less contrasted than those offered by the three other techniques the sliding window technique thus appears to depend too much on the historical climate trends to detect extremely contrasted sub periods for calibration using this method coron et al 2012 found well contrasted precipitation in southeast australia however the authors reported precipitation trends that contributed to obtain a significant contrast in precipitation characteristics between different periods in northern tunisia continuous sliding periods were unable to provide sufficiently contrasted periods because there was no trend in precipitation during the historical study period as shown by dakhlaoui et al 2017 in addition the study area presents high inter annual precipitation variability see also dakhlaoui et al 2017 using continuous sub periods thus smooths the average precipitation in the sub periods thereby reducing the climate contrast between them however this is not the case for temperature for which the sliding window sst technique provided significant differences in t δt due to the increasing temperature trends in northern tunisia over 1970 2000 dakhlaoui et al 2017 the random bootstrap sst technique provided an important number of validation exercises 5800 however it led to limited differences in t δt and a poor distribution of the sample with high concentration in the centre of the figure where there is the least significant contrast to test model parameter transferability the 4 sub period dsst provided more contrasted δt and δp than the sliding window and random bootstrap sst indeed it is based on a sampling technique generating highly climate contrasted sub periods however although it explored contrasted climatic conditions in the historical period the technique provides very few insights into moderate δt and δp compared to the other techniques the oriented bootstrap of the gdsst provided more validation exercises than the random bootstrap sst although both techniques were based on the same number of calibration exercises 5 0 0 this can be explained by the fact that the oriented bootstrap favours the selection of independent sub periods by reducing overlap between them in addition the gdsst provided a better spread of validation periods indeed contrary to the random bootstrap technique in which the validation exercises were concentrated in the zone of δt and δp near 0 the sample provided by the gdsst technique was more concentrated at the extremes δt and δp which are the most contrasted sub periods to test the parameter transferability hence the differences in mean precipitation and temperature between the different sub periods ranged respectively from 45 to 80 and from 2 c to 2 c thus providing a more marked climatic contrast between the calibration and validation periods compared with the previous techniques see fig 4 it should be noted that the random bootstrap technique theoretically includes all the spread of δt and δp provided by the other techniques tested in other words the theoretical limits of the tested combinations if all possible combinations were sampled should be as large as the largest limits provided by all the other techniques however the problem is that the application of a bootstrap on all combinations would require excessive computation time and would lead to a very large number 6 million of 8 year sub periods of combinations that could obviously not be tested through cross validation with hydrological models the proposed gdsst has the advantage to be more effective with only a limited number of calibration exercises 1 0 0 it provides a large number of sub periods from similar to contrasted conditions in terms of precipitation and temperature while ensuring that the most climatically contrasted sub periods are sampled 4 2 model transferability under climate contrasted conditions using gdsst these encouraging results led us to use the gdsst to assess the model s transferability under climate contrasted conditions see protocol in section 3 3 based on the nse criterion the model s transferability decreased with an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation fig 5b the simultaneous increase in t and decrease in p resulted in a significant reduction in model performance in contrast an increase in precipitation and or a decrease in temperatures had a much moderate impact on model efficiency sometimes even leading to a slight improvement in performance providing evidence for better parameter transferability under wetter and or colder conditions the cases where the model performance was improved can be explained by the fact that the evaluation criterion nse is different from the calibration objective function kge by the way there were no cases where the kge value in validation on a given period was larger than the kge value in calibration on the same period see fig 5a which shows that the method and the optimization algorithm are consistent and robust fig 5c shows that ve increases with an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation the water balance decreases when temperature decreases and precipitation increases this means that runoff is overestimated when moving to hotter and drier climate conditions and underestimated in the reverse case the transferability as regards to the ve criterion was more affected by changes in precipitation p than by changes in temperature t an increase in t and or a decrease in p between periods weakened the model robustness on the opposite the transferability is very satisfactory when δt and δp are low i e when climate conditions are rather similar between the receiver and donor periods including periods with extreme conditions this means that the models are robust when applied on periods with similarly climate conditions whether extreme or not fig 5d shows the limits of transferability of the hydrological models as a function of δt and δp these limits were defined according to a decrease in nse of more than 0 2 and a variation in ve of more than 25 we acknowledge that these thresholds are somewhat subjective and should be adapted depending on the hydrological conditions and according to the user need for example to match a sustainable level of uncertainties for water resources management in a given context for the current study nse values were always greater than 0 8 while ve values were always around 0 for all calibration periods and catchments we thus assumed that beyond a 0 2 decrease in nse criterion and a 25 increase in ve the simulations were no longer efficient the red grid shows non transferable areas these results show that transferring parameters to different climate conditions resulted in significant uncertainties when the shift is to a hotter drier climate compared to the other hydrological models gr4j appeared to be the least affected by changes in temperature and the most affected by changes in precipitation the limited effect of changes in temperature on the ve criterion can be partly explained by the fact that the changes in temperature mainly occur in the dry season which contributes little to runoff the limits of transferability of the models show clear interdependence of precipitation and temperature given the criteria and the thresholds retained they can be approximated according to an acceptability line fig 5d computed from a linear relation between δt and δp the models are thus roughly transferable for changes in precipitation δp 0 08 δt 0 18 with δp 30 80 and changes in temperature δt 2 c 2 c these limits are more precise than those presented in previous studies which showed squared transferability limits see coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2017 however it should be noted the presence of outliers above the acceptability line these outliers correspond to low density of validation samples see fig 4d and it is difficult to give general conclusion about them for instance another limit towards wetter and colder conditions may also exist but it is difficult to identify within the obtained results moreover although fig 5 provides evidence of transferability problems when moving to drier and hotter conditions the interdependence of temperature and precipitation partly hides the fact that the models are probably less transferable towards drier conditions than towards hotter conditions 4 3 analysis of high resolution climate simulations 4 3 1 efficiency of the rcms over the control period fig 6 shows the raw rcm outputs p and t versus climate observations over the reference period 1970 2000 fig 6a and b compare the mean seasonal precipitation temperature observed with the one simulated by each of the eight rcms over the reference period while fig 6c shows the relative errors between mean simulated and observed annual precipitation and mean errors between mean simulated and observed annual temperature the rcms did not correctly reproduce precipitation nse values between mean seasonal simulated precipitation and mean seasonal observed precipitation range from negative values to 0 7 depending on the climate models and the catchments fig 6b the rcms tested were thus not able to accurately reproduce the average seasonality of precipitation especially during the wet season in addition many models were not even able to represent average annual precipitation which leads to significant over or under estimation of rainfall see fig 6c the rcm simulations of temperature show a better agreement with observations the nse values were generally above 0 85 fig 6b showing the good performance of rcm in reproducing the temperature seasonality the difference between mean annual simulated and observed temperature was very small for clm had clm mpi smh had and smh mpi fig 6c however this difference was greater than 2 c for cnr cnr and knm ecercm the limited efficiency of rcm notably in reproducing observed precipitation over the reference period hampered the direct use of climate model raw outputs for building climate scenarios moreover since cnr cnr rcm was the least efficient in reproducing the past observed climate in the studied basins it was excluded from the ensemble while this did not guarantee better future projections we nevertheless considered it an essential step to obtain the most reliable and relevant simulations for future projections 4 3 2 climate scenarios for the medium and long term horizon the rcm bias in reproducing reference climate notably precipitation volume and seasonal patterns led us to apply a simple delta change method in order to produce a range of climate scenarios from the rcm outputs all simulations of climate change were thus based on the historical representative concentration pathway rcp over the reference period 1970 2000 and scenarios rcp 4 5 and 8 5 for a medium term horizon 2040 2070 and a long term horizon 2070 2100 high resolution climate change forcing was thus obtained by a monthly perturbation method which assumes that climate models reproduce the relative change in climatic variables better than their absolute values the method consists in producing future climate scenarios by modifying the observed climatic series so as to reproduce the mean monthly variations obtained between the reference and future climatic simulations produced by climate models for more details on the method used see ruelland et al 2012 fig 7 a compares the mean seasonal precipitation observed over the reference period and projected precipitation according to the four combinations of horizons and rcps for each of the seven selected rcms fig 7b shows the same comparison for temperature the climate change signal is very different from one rcm to another especially for precipitation however all rcms predict a warmer climate and almost all climate models predict dryer conditions in the future at the medium term horizon a change of 10 to 23 6 3 to 35 in total precipitation is projected under the rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenario at the long term horizon a change of 12 to 30 15 to 52 in total precipitation is projected under the rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenario these changes mainly occur in the wet season november to april for temperature fig 7b at the medium term horizon an increase of 1 0 to 1 5 c 1 8 to 3 5 c is projected under the rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenario at the long term horizon an increase of 1 7 to 3 3 c 3 2 to 5 7 c is expected under the rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenario in contrast to precipitation these changes are expected to occur mainly during summer the changes in temperature are likely to have little impact on discharge since there is almost no runoff in summer but the decrease in winter precipitation may have a critical impact on water resources 4 4 comparing climate projections with model parameter transferability 4 4 1 analysis of the transferability of the models to climate contrasted periods this section exploits one of the main results obtained in section 4 2 which showed that the difference in climate conditions between calibration and validation periods progressively affects the performances of hydrological models see fig 5 for this purpose three cases were used for the hydrological projections with each model the first case uses the parameter sets calibrated over the whole who reference period 1970 2000 the second case uses the parameter sets calibrated over the 12 year sub period the closest to the future climate msp the third case uses the parameter sets calibrated over the 12 year sub period the most different from the future climate mdp the median of the seven rcm projections was considered for each rcp horizon and catchment three hundred sub periods were generated according to the proposed gdsst to increase the chance of finding the msp and mdp sub periods the closest the farthest sub period to the future climate according to mahalanobis distance as regards to the pluviometric and temperature conditions were considered as msp mdp it should be noted that given the time span 30 years of the projection periods we decided to increase the calibration period length from eight see section 4 2 for the tests regarding the gdsst to 12 years the rationale behind this increasing length of calibration periods was to reduce the ratio of number of years between the calibration period 12 and the future periods 30 under study thus limiting over fitted calibration when applying the models to the future 30 year periods fig 8 shows the behaviour of ve and the transferability limits obtained by the gdsst applied to the reference period 1970 2000 as described in section 4 2 for each rcm rcp horizon and catchment three points are shown one for the future climate seen from the whole period one for the future climate seen from the msp and one for the mdp the cross indicates the mean reference climate conditions over the 30 year past period or over the most similar or most different 12 year period i e with 0 coordinates as a reference this makes it possible to position future climate conditions rcm in relation to the transferability limits of the models in the figure the past climate conditions who msp or mdp are thus considered as calibration periods with respect to the climate conditions predicted by the rcm we found that under rcp 4 5 whatever the horizon the transfer of parameter sets calibrated over the whole 30 year period to the future climate conditions would be acceptable with respect to the defined transferability limits however this was not the case under rcp 8 5 at the medium term horizon whereas choosing parameter sets calibrated over the msp would be acceptable given the long term climate predicted under rcp8 5 the parameter sets calibrated over the whole 30 year period or over the most similar 12 year sub period both fell outside the transferability limits 4 4 2 sensitivity of the hydrological projections to the selected calibration period fig 9 shows the relative changes in runoff volume in the hydrological projections performed by the three rainfall runoff models forced by the median of the climate projections of the seven rcms retained three parameter sets who msp and mdp were used for each case the predicted changes in precipitation and temperature are transformed into hydrological projections by a change of 0 14 to 6 2 in mean annual runoff under rcp4 5 and of 13 to 31 under rcp8 5 at the medium term horizon and respectively 16 to 29 and 37 to 57 at the long term horizon the different cases of model parameterization had different impacts on the hydrological projections msp generally predicted the largest change in volume compared to the two other cases in fact when using parameters calibrated over the whole period the hydrological impact of climate change was underestimated by 5 20 compared to when the parameters were calibrated on the msp using parameters calibrated on the mdp msp generally led to a smaller larger change in volume compared to the two other cases additionally the change in volume simulated when using parameters calibrated over the who period was generally closer to the change simulated when they were calibrated over the mdp period rather than the msp period it is clear here that the behaviour concerning the change in volume simulated by the models via the gdsst experiment fig 5 was transferred to the hydrological projections when moving to drier and hotter conditions future climate conditions seen relative to past reference conditions over the who period or the mdp the hydrological models tended to overestimate runoff and to generate less change in volume the overestimation of runoff was reduced in the case of msp where the decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature were less marked which according to the gdsst results section 4 2 could be translated into less overestimation of runoff compared to the who period causing a bigger decrease in runoff the limited difference between mdp and whole period could be explained by rrm transferability of ve which is more affected by changes in precipitation than by changes in temperature as discussed in section 3 3 3 in fact the climate conditions over the whole 30 year period and over the mdp 12 year period are not too different in terms of precipitation in contrast to temperature as found in further experiments a similar behaviour of different rainfall runoff models can be observed 5 summary and conclusion we developed a bootstrap based differential split sample test to assess the transferability of conceptual rainfall runoff models under past and future climate variability the proposed general differential split sample test gdsst aims to sample sub periods of discontinuous years gathering similar to different conditions in terms of differences in precipitation and temperature the gdsst was compared to three other existing techniques to select sub periods over a 30 year past period on a set of five basins under semi arid conditions in northern tunisia we showed that the gdsst outperformed the other split sample techniques by providing a larger number of sub periods from similar to contrasted conditions in terms of precipitation and temperature while ensuring that the most climatically contrasted sub periods are sampled the gdsst was then used to evaluate the transferability of three hydrological models under various past climate conditions in the five basins our results showed that the difference in climate between calibration and validation progressively affects model performance the models tested showed acceptable transferability to wetter and or colder conditions however their efficiency was significantly affected under a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature according to the criteria and the thresholds retained the models were found roughly transferable for relative changes in precipitation δp 0 08 δt 0 18 with δp 30 80 and changes in temperature δt 2 c 2 c these transferability limits showed clear interdependence between precipitation and temperature and are more accurate than those presented in previous studies which revealed more squared limits coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2017 the models tend to overestimate runoff with an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation and conversely the transferability limits were then compared to the future climate projections in seven high resolution regional climate simulations under two radiative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for one medium term horizon 2040 2070 and one long term horizon 2070 2100 at the medium term horizon rcms project a change in mean annual precipitation of 6 3 35 at the long term horizon the change in precipitation is expected to reach 12 52 the rcms foresee an increase in temperature ranging from 1 0 c to 3 5 c by the medium term horizon and from 1 7 c to 5 7 c at the long term horizon the differences in precipitation and temperature between past and future climate are generally within the limits of modelling transferability under rcp 4 5 regardless of the horizon however this was not the case under rcp 8 5 regardless of the horizon our results showed that it was possible to find a calibration sub period within the limits of transferability for the medium term horizon the projected change in precipitation and temperature are translated into hydrological projections by a 0 14 to 6 2 change in mean annual runoff under rcp4 5 and a 13 to 31 change in runoff under rcp8 5 at the medium term horizon and respectively 16 to 29 and 37 to 57 by the long term horizon finally the effects of the selected past calibration period on the hydrological projections were analysed we found that models calibrated on the whole past period underestimated the impact of climate change on mean annual runoff by 5 20 in comparison to their calibration on sub periods with mean annual precipitation and temperature that are closer to future climate conditions another key finding was similar transferability between the different hydrological models tested this paper thus assessed the robustness of hydrological models under climate variability and drew the limits of their parameter transferability in terms of δt and δp we proposed to reduce the uncertainty caused by parameter instability through a better strategy of calibration understanding the sources of the limited transferability of the models beyond the limits identified in the present study is a complex task however we showed that the climate conditions of the period used to calibrate hydrological models can have a significant impact on hydrological projections using the whole historical period for model calibration can result in systematic underestimation of the impact of climate change on surface water resources based on our findings we recommend selecting a past sub period in which the climate conditions are as close as possible to those of the future periods to be simulated in order to identify calibration parameters that can be used for hydrological projections which could significantly reduce uncertainty future studies could focus on a better understanding of parameter instability to improve rrms robustness for instance the choice in the calibration period length could be further explored as mentioned by coron at al 2012 choosing the sub period length used in the sampling methodology is a difficult task the calibration period should be long enough to allow for correct parameter determination several studies see e g guo et al 2018 vaze et al 2010 thus claimed that longer calibration periods lead to more robust rrm under climate variability since they represent more diversified climate conditions at the same time using overly long periods may play against the study s objectives as it would reduce the contrast between periods also the number of independent test periods per catchment decreases when the sub period length increases in the present study dealing with a 30 year reference period we have considered 8 12 year calibration sub periods which appeared as an acceptable compromise between the length of the period needed for calibration and the number of possible combinations between calibration validation periods however we acknowledge that shorter longer sub periods could provide more less different contrasts in terms of δt and δp while possibly increasing reducing model robustness future work could also use physically based models to test whether the more detailed processes they attempt to represent make them less climate dependent than the conceptual models in realistically representing the multi decadal flow finally the proposed gdsst was developed to sample sub periods of discontinuous years which is suitable for a semi arid climate with a long dry summer like in mediterranean environments however it may not be suitable for other climates under which the hydrological processes are strongly influenced by the preceding years and with discharge sustained by groundwater flows during dry periods thus leading to very various initial conditions future studies could thus focus on adapting the gdsst to such climates declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work is part of the postdoc research

6358,this study proposes a general differential split sample test gdsst based on an oriented bootstrap to assess the transferability of conceptual rainfall runoff models to climatically contrasting periods compared to existing benchmark techniques the gdsst allows a larger number of climatically contrasted discontinuous periods to be sampled and is computationally more effective than the basic bootstrap to identify the most contrasted periods when applied to three hydrological models gr4j hbv and ihacres in five catchments in northern tunisia the gdsst provided clear limits of the transferability of the models under changing precipitation p and temperature t conditions towards drier and hotter conditions according to the criteria and thresholds retained approximate limits of model transferability are drawn the models are roughly transferable for relative changes in precipitation δp 0 08 δt 0 18 with δp 30 80 and changes in temperature δt 2 c 2 c these transferability limits suggest selecting a past sub period as close as possible to the future climate to identify calibration parameters which can be used for hydrological projections the limits of transferability were then compared to climate projections by eight high resolution regional climate model rcm simulations resulting from the euro cordex initiative the rcms precipitation and temperature simulations of the historical period 1970 2000 were first assessed to select the most realistic ones for future projections a delta change monthly correction was used to perturb the observed climate series according to climate simulations under two radiative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for one medium term horizon 2040 2070 and one long term horizon 2070 2100 the effects of the selected past calibration period on the hydrological projections were then analysed the rcp 8 5 climate projections fall outside the limits of transferability of all rainfall runoff models tested models calibrated on the whole observed period were found to underestimate the impacts of climate change on runoff by 5 20 in comparison with models calibrated on sub periods with mean annual p and t closer to projected climate conditions keywords rainfall runoff modelling split sample tests parameter transferability climate scenarios cordex tunisia 1 introduction 1 1 simulating the impact of climate change on runoff several studies have shown that climate change has already affected available water resources worldwide e g haddeland et al 2014 and is expected to have even more severe impacts in the future e g hageman et al 2013 ipcc 2013 however assessing the potential impact of climate change on runoff precisely requires both high resolution climate projections and models capable of reliably representing the hydrological processes in recent decades and at the scale of basins that are sufficiently representative of water management issues i e several hundred to several thousand square kilometres fabre et al 2016 in developing countries the use of physically based distributed models is generally hampered by insufficient data to force and control the models consequently model validation is usually based on the streamflow at the outlet which does not guarantee that the water redistribution processes and their interactions are well represented within the catchment application is even harder when it comes to testing the ability of models to reproduce multi decadal hydrological variability which is a prerequisite for studying the impact of climate change on water resources ruelland et al 2012 therefore conceptual models representing the functioning of the basins using a small number of empirical equations whose few parameters can be calibrated with a minimum of data are often preferred particularly in a context of data scarcity e g bastola et al 2011 chen et al 2011 hublart et al 2016 ruelland et al 2012 ruelland et al 2015 on the other hand their relative simplicity and the need to calibrate their parameters on current data do not always plead for their use when conditions shift beyond the range of prior experience hublart et al 2015 as it can be the case in a framework of future change see e g vaze et al 2010 the use of conceptual models is therefore conditional on the estimation of the uncertainty associated with the modelling process itself which is a combination of uncertainties evolving from input and control data model structures parameterization and parameter transferability under non stationary conditions such as climate change or variability 1 2 review of the literature on the problem of model parameter transferability to climate change parameter transferability can be defined as the ability of a model to perform with the same level of accuracy under conditions that differ from those used for its calibration seiller et al 2012 it requires particular attention in studies on the impact of climate change because it can be an important source of uncertainty in the hydrological modelling chain as already pointed out by many authors e g brigode et al 2013 coron et al 2012 poulin et al 2011 fowler et al 2016 melsen et al 2018 many techniques have thus been proposed to assess potential parameter transferability under different climate conditions for instance the differential split sample test dsst klemeš 1986 is a powerful procedure to evaluate transferability under climate variability it consists of calibration and validation exercises for hydrological models using sub periods with contrasted climate conditions which make it possible to evaluate model transferability from one climate condition to another the idea behind performing a dsst is that the errors made when extrapolating from one set of observed climate conditions to another different set could correspond to the errors made when reference data is used for calibration and extrapolation to future climate conditions seibert 2003 the main variables used in the dsst to discretize sub periods of different climate conditions are precipitation and or temperature e g refsgaard and knudsen 1996 vaze et al 2010 seiller et al 2012 tramblay et al 2013 ruelland et al 2015 hartmann and bárdossy 2005 dakhlaoui et al 2017 potential evapotranspiration coron et al 2012 and runoff seibert 2003 vormoor et al 2018 the use of dsst is generally based on clustering reference periods on two climate contrasted sub periods and generally according to only one climate variable e g refsgaard and knudsen 1996 seibert 2003 wu and johnston 2007 vaze et al 2010 ruelland et al 2015 as a result it provides a limited number of calibration and validation samples directly linked to the available data which does not help fully understand the behaviour of the rainfall runoff models rrm under climate variability moreover the implications of rrm robustness under a changing climate remains unknown since potential changes in climate may go beyond the observed variability see ruelland et al 2012 guo et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 these limits led several authors to increase the number of calibration validation exercises and to expand the range of hydro climatic changes between these periods to better explore model robustness under climate variability for example hartmann and bárdossy 2005 divided a 30 year observation period into three sub periods first in terms of mean annual temperature warm normal and cold and second in terms of annual precipitation wet normal and dry years this made it possible to increase the number of validation exercises for each climate variable and catchment to six compared to the two dsst periods usually used and to sample more contrasted sub periods tolson and shoemaker 2007 divided the observation period into three sub periods a 6 year period for calibration and two independent validation series of three years and one year respectively which allowed them to check the model s performance under contrasted hydrological conditions dakhlaoui et al 2017 simultaneously used mean annual temperature and precipitation values to generate four climate contrasted sub periods hot wet cold wet hot dry and cold wet which allowed a bigger number of validation exercises 12 per catchment to be considered and the use of contrasted sub periods in terms of temperature and precipitation coron et al 2012 developed a generalized version of sst so called general split sample test gsst and hereafter called sliding window sst which allows a large number of calibration validation exercises by sampling sub periods based on a sliding window over the reference period this technique allowed even more validation exercises than the previous ones and better exploration of observed climate variability in 216 catchments in southeast australia coron 2013 proposed another version of gsst hereafter called random bootstrap sst by generating sub periods according to a bootstrap where a large number of randomly selected combinations of years are used for calibration and for validation this technique was revisited recently by arsenault et al 2018 to evaluate how the length of the calibration period impacted the transferability of two hydrological models in three north american catchments to explore a larger continuum of model behaviour guo et al 2018 used a stochastic weather generator to generate synthetic climate data to represent future climate conditions which made it possible to assess the transferability of three rrms gr4j awbm and cmd beyond conditions in existing records however one limitation of the proposed methodology is that it is based on only one climate variable precipitation furthermore the authors reported that the stochastic weather generator had difficulty representing natural variability 1 3 research needs revealed by the review of literature even though the gsst sliding window sst or random bootstrap sst seems to offer the most complete sst its use presents some limitations indeed the gsst was not specifically designed to identify contrasted periods only but rather to create an ensemble of conditions ranging from similar to contrasted as a result unlike dsst it does not explicitly ensure that the most climatically contrasted periods are selected when applied to continuous years through a sliding window the gsst provides contrasted climatic conditions which result mainly from the climate trends over the reference period and or smoothed climatic variability over the selected continuous periods when applied to discontinuous years through a random bootstrap the gsst can theoretically select the most contrasted periods if all combinations are sampled which is computationally unrealistic when considering multi decadal periods on the contrary the dsst applications found in the literature were intended to explicitly identify a climatic contrast between the periods based on a statistical climate analysis for example by grouping the wettest driest years in the same period on the other hand the gsst has the major advantage of generating a large number of time periods composed of a continuum of climatic conditions for a more complete assessment of the transferability of conceptual hydrological models this calls for a sst technique which could sample a large number sub periods composed of discontinuous years and gathering similar to contrasted conditions in terms of precipitation and temperature while ensuring that the most climatically contrasted sub periods are sampled although many authors have used dsst to evaluate rrm transferability under climate variability e g refsgaard and knudsen 1996 vaze et al 2010 seiller et al 2012 tramblay et al 2013 ruelland et al 2015 hartmann and bárdossy 2005 seibert 2003 only a few quantified changes in climatic variables which allow acceptable transferability of model results and generally only precipitation was used to define the limits of transferability for example vaze et al 2010 tested four rainfall runoff models in 61 catchments in southwest australia and suggested that calibration periods of at least 20 years were needed for robust models under climate variability but only if the difference in mean rainfall between calibration and validation period was greater than 15 for drier climates and less than 20 for wetter climates similarly bastola et al 2011 found for two irish catchments that model transferability was less affected when the difference in rainfall between calibration and validation periods was less than 10 singh et al 2011 identified an acceptable range of changes in precipitation 10 to 20 with no marked effect on model transferability for five catchments across continental usa coron et al 2012 evaluated the robustness of three rrms gr4j mordor6 and simhyd under simultaneous changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet in southeast australia and reported that on average a 20 absolute bias was observed with a 10 20 change in precipitation and a 1 2 change in pet between the calibration and validation periods however as mentioned above the sliding window sst used in coron et al 2012 was not intended to specifically focus on contrasted periods but rather to create a continuum of conditions from similar climatic conditions to contrasted ones in order to better evaluate the evolution of model behaviour with increasing contrasts between different time periods in a recent study dakhlaoui et al 2017 we evaluated the transferability of three rrms gr4j hbv and ihacres under simultaneous precipitation and temperature variability in catchments representative of hydro climatic conditions in northern tunisia we showed that the difference in climate conditions between calibration and validation periods progressively affected the performance of hydrological models we also showed that the models tested were transferable to wetter and or colder conditions however the model robustness became unacceptable when climate conditions involved a decrease of more than 25 in annual precipitation and an increase in annual mean temperatures of more than 1 75 c however the dsst we used only generated small number of calibration and validation exercises four calibration exercises and 12 validation exercises for each catchment and provided little information on rrms transferability under moderate climate changes in addition only a few studies have put the rrm transferability limits into perspective in the context of climate projections see e g singh et al 2011 guo et al 2018 as a result there is a need for a more precise definition of the limits of transferability of conceptual models in terms of δt and δp and for these limits to be put into perspective with respect to available high resolution climate projections this is of particular importance in the mediterranean region which is known to be a hot spot of climate change notably the southern rim cramer et al 2018 indeed recent climate change scenarios in the mediterranean region predicted a potential 20 decrease in total precipitation and a 1 c to 3 c increase in mean annual temperature by the 2050 horizon compared with the 1971 1990 period milano et al 2012 schilling et al 2012 terink et al 2013 tramblay et al 2018 these climate changes would have a considerable effect on the surface water resources of southern mediterranean countries which already suffer from water paucity blinda and thivet 2009 on the other hand the few studies which evaluated the hydrological impacts of climate change in the mediterranean region e g milano et al 2012 droogers et al 2012 sellami et al 2015 did not take into account the limits of transferability of the hydrological models they used this calls for an evaluation of the effect of the expected loss in performance of rrms under future climate change and for more reliable hydrological projections to enable better climate change adaptation strategies 1 4 objectives this paper proposes an improved sst technique to test the robustness of hydrological models by selecting time periods with contrasted conditions in terms of temperature and precipitation the proposed technique was compared to three other split sampled methods to demonstrate its efficiency it was then used to assess the transferability of conceptual rainfall runoff models under multi decadal climate variability with a view to simulating hydrological scenarios based on high resolution climate projections in northern tunisia we compared the limits of transferability with future climate scenarios obtained from high resolution euro cordex regional climate models finally we analysed the effect of the selection of the calibration period on the limits of rrm robustness on the hydrological projections 2 description of the split sample techniques 2 1 three benchmark sst techniques the sst methods selected to be tested on the study catchments were i a sliding window sst coron et al 2012 ii a random bootstrap sst coron 2013 arsenault et al 2018 and iii a 4 sub period dsst dakhlaoui et al 2017 these three techniques were selected because they enable simultaneous investigation of the effect of t and p on model transferability under climate variability the first technique was adopted in several studies coron et al 2012 2014 guo et al 2018 vormoor et al 2018 the second one inspired our proposed dsst to randomly combine independent years in the sample and the third one was recently successfully used in northern tunisia to sample very climatically contrasted sub periods these three techniques are described in fig 1 and table 1 the sliding window sst technique coron et al 2012 consists in using calibration validation tests on independent sub periods of equal length considering all possible pairs of sub periods the sampling method used to generate sub periods is based on sliding windows applied over the reference period the technique enables the identification of l n 1 calibration sub periods where n is the number of years composing each sub periods and l is the total number of years of the reference period the random bootstrap sst technique coron 2013 arsenault et al 2018 relies on a sub period sampling technique which is based on a random combination of discontinuous years bootstrap this sampling technique is time consuming since the possible number of calibration sub periods is equal to c n l for example the random bootstrap sst technique results in around six million possible 8 year sub periods if applied to a 30 year reference period its application then requires a priori selection of the number of permitted calibration exercises due to limited time budget for model calibration and validation the implementation of the 4 sub period dsst dakhlaoui et al 2017 requires the calculation of the annual precipitation and mean temperature for each hydrological year of the reference period the sub periods are thus made up of clusters of climatically contrasted years to create these clusters the hydrological years are first distributed into two equal groups of hydrological years dry years and wet years according to the annual precipitation median for the reference period fig 1c dry and wet years are defined as years with respectively less or more total precipitation than the median of the reference period for each group the median of the mean annual temperature is then calculated which serves to distinguish hot and cold years the four final groups of hydrological years are hot dry hd hot wet hw cold dry cd and cold wet cw years see fig 1 using the three above techniques makes it possible to identify different numbers of calibration sub periods of n years see table 1 all n year periods which do not have any year in common with a given n year calibration period can thus be considered as independent validation exercises as a result the number of validation exercises may not be the same for all calibration periods selected with the sliding window and random bootstrap sst for the 4 sub period sst there are three possible validation exercises for each of the 4 calibration sub period 2 2 proposal for a general differential split sample test gdsst based on the existing sst methods we developed a technique which can take benefit from the random bootstrap sst technique to provide a large number of validation exercises while accounting for the much contrasted δt and δp detected with the 4 sub period dsst in other words the idea was to design a method which uses the sampling of the random bootstrap sst technique but which is oriented so as to obtain the extreme climate contrast provided by the 4 sub period dsst the proposed method was called general differential split sample test gdsst and is described in fig 2 the procedure used to generate k n year sub periods from the l hydrological years from the 1st of september to the 31st of august of reference period is as follows the first year of the n year sub period to be sampled is randomly selected from the l years of the reference period step 1 in fig 2 the l 1 remaining years of the reference period are then sorted based on the order of increasing distance of mahalanobis 1936 to the first selected year in the space of mean annual temperature t and total annual precipitation p step 2 in fig 2 the mahalanobis distance is computed according to the following expression 1 d c y c 1 c y c 1 t σ 1 c y c 1 where d c y c 1 is the mahalanobis distance between a year y from the l 1 remaining years of the reference period and the first selected year in the space of mean annual temperature t and total annual precipitation p c y is a vector representing a year y from the l 1 remaining years of the reference period in the t and p c 1 is a vector representing the first selected year in the t and p space σ is the covariance matrix between t and p of the l years of the reference period using the mahalanobis distance aims at rescaling the t and p axes in order to account for the correlations between the two variables and to calculate standard euclidean distance in a transformed space having unit variance in other words it aims to reduce the dominance of one climatic variable over the other when computing climatic distance between years a trapezoidal probability is then assigned to the l 1 remaining years of the reference period as follows step 3 in fig 2 2 p i 2 m 1 i m m 1 i 1 m 3 p i 0 i m 1 l 1 where p i is the probability assigned to the year with rank i i is the rank of the remaining years of the reference period sorted in order of increasing mahalanobis distance to the originally selected year m is a number selected randomly at each sub period selection from the interval n 1 l 1 the year closest to the year originally retained has the highest probability p 1 2 m 1 and the farthest years has the lowest probability p m 2 m m 1 and p i 0 for i m the n 1 remaining years of the sub period are then selected from the l 1 remaining years of the reference period according to the trapezoidal probability distribution giving more chance to be selected to the years which are the closest to the initial year retained according to the mahalanobis distance defined in the t and p space step 4 in fig 2 the trapezoidal distribution allows only the m years closest to the initial year retained to be selected in the sub period this gives more chance to years with similar climatic conditions to be selected in order to generate more climatically contrasted sub periods however varying randomly m for each sub period generation also allows years with different climatic conditions to be selected this aims at creating a continuum of climatic conditions from similar to contrasted between the sampled sub periods in view of evaluating the model transferability under increasing climate contrasts in case the new created sub period was already sampled it is not retained step 5 in fig 2 the procedure steps 1 to 5 in fig 2 is repeated until the required number of sub periods is reached step 7 in fig 2 the random selection of years in the proposed procedure allows a larger number of sub periods to be selected than with a deterministic procedure where the closest years to the originally retained year are selected in fact in the best case the deterministic procedure provides a number of sub periods equal to the number of observed years e g 30 sub periods for a 30 year reference period the number of calibration sub periods which can be generated by the proposed technique is similar to the random bootstrap sst technique c n l that is why its application requires a priori selection of the number of permitted calibration exercises similarly to the three benchmark sst section 2 1 all n year periods which do not have any year in common with a given n year calibration period can be considered as independent validation exercises with the gdsst see table 1 3 evaluation protocol in this section we present successively the study basins the hydro climatic data and the methods to assess the transferability of three hydrological models under climate contrasted conditions based on the proposed gdsst 3 1 study basins five catchments located in northern tunisia fig 3 were used for the evaluation protocol these basins were selected based on the following criteria i their streamflow regime can be considered as natural since they are located upstream from major hydraulic installations such as dams and water transfers ii the availability of hydro climatic series for the same 30 year period to enable sufficiently climate contrasted sub periods to be sampled for the split sample tests and iii the availability of good quality hydrological data according to hydrological reports with the aim of reducing the impact of data errors on the results the basins are located in the region that produces most of the surface water in tunisia baouab and cherif 2015 the study catchments are situated within a semi arid to humid mediterranean climate with a hot season the hydro climatic characteristics are given in fig 3 more details on the basins can be found in dakhlaoui et al 2017 3 2 hydro climatic data 3 2 1 in situ meteorological data a total of 123 daily rain gauges located in the study region were used see fig 3 these stations were selected because they had less than 30 of daily gaps in the period 1970 2000 thus providing a stable coherent network of measurements for the spatial interpolation of precipitation forcing eight meteorological stations with monthly mean series of daily minimum and maximum temperatures fig 3 were used to compute mean monthly air temperatures which were considered as daily values climate forcing was interpolated on a 2 km grid with the inverse distance weighting technique temperature t was interpolated by accounting for a lapse rate of 0 65 c 100 m see details on the method used in ruelland et al 2014 while precipitation p was interpolated by accounting for altitude via a 4 10 4 corrective factor in the exponential function proposed by valéry et al 2010 the formula of oudin et al 2005 was chosen to estimate pet this formula is based on mean daily air temperature and on estimated clear daily sky solar radiation depending on the latitude of the grid cells 3 2 2 high resolution climate simulations the climate model data used table 2 are simulations and projections of daily mean temperature and precipitation from eight pairs of rcms regional climate models forced by different global circulation models from the euro cordex initiative the most recent climate simulations for the euro mediterranean region with 0 11 resolution 12 12 km the model data for the period 1951 2005 correspond to the historical simulation and 2006 2100 corresponds to future projections two radiative concentration pathway rcp scenarios were used for the future projections rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 which represent respectively moderate and strong greenhouse gas emission scenarios the climate projections were based on two 30 year future periods one medium term 2040 2070 and one long term 2070 2100 horizon they were compared to the past reference period 1970 2000 3 3 model s transferability evaluation under climate contrasted conditions 3 3 1 hydrological models three conceptual hydrological models running at a daily time step were used gr4j perrin et al 2003 hbv bergström 1976 bergström and lindström 2015 and ihacres jakeman et al 1990 croke and jakeman 2004 they were selected because they are parsimonious models and all have to be calibrated based on precipitation pet and runoff data but differ in the way they conceptualise the hydrological processes and in their complexity 4 to 8 free parameters 2 to 3 conceptual reservoirs see table 3 this makes inter comparison of the model simulations possible all three models have recently been applied in tunisia see dakhlaoui et al 2009 2012 2017 further description on the model versions used can be found in dakhlaoui et al 2017 3 3 2 calibration and validation methods model robustness was evaluated through a series of calibration and validation exercises under contrasted precipitation temperature conditions according to the proposed gdsst the three hydrological models gr4j hbv and ihacres were calibrated for the five study catchments over the 100 sub periods generated by the oriented bootstrap technique one optimal parameter set per sub period was thus obtained by calibration the parameter sets obtained were then used to perform all possible independent validation exercises i e any sub periods which do not have any year in common with the calibration sub period the proposed gdsst method thus enabled testing of the models under different conditions from those used for calibration although discontinuous sub periods were used for both model calibration and validation the models were run in a continuous way for the whole reference period while only the years that corresponded to calibration or validation periods were taken into account to compute the efficiency criteria a 3 year warm up period september 1967 to august 1970 was considered before the whole reference period to limit the effect of the storage initialization the model parameters were calibrated using the kling gupta efficiency index kge gupta et al 2009 which represents a compromise between three evaluation criteria correlation coefficient bias error and standard deviation ratio expressed as follows 4 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between observed qobs and simulated qsim flows α is a measure to compare the variability of the observed and predicted data equal to the standard deviation of qsim over the standard deviation of qobs and β is a measure of bias equal to the mean of qsim over the mean of qobs calibration was performed in a 4d 8d and 5d parameter space for gr4j hbv and ihacres respectively by searching for the maximum value of kge to perform this optimization exercise efficiently we used the shuffle complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1992 the algorithmic parameters of sce ua were set to the values recommended by duan et al 1994 we also followed the recommendation of kuczera 1997 who suggested a number of complexes equal to the number of parameters to be optimised and assumed that with these security measures the risk that sce ua falls in local optimal solutions is considerably reduced the parameter feasible ranges were set to usual parameter limits see dakhlaoui et al 2017 although the hydrological models were run at a daily time step their calibration and validation were performed at 10 day time scale i e based on 10 day mean values since preliminary tests showed that day to day variability was difficult to reproduce accurately due to the limited quality of data in space and over time although models were calibrated by kge criteria their performance transferability during validation was evaluated based on the analysis of the nash and sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the cumulated volume error ve we selected these two efficiency criteria because they are commonly used by hydrologists thus making easier their interpretation notably when defining the model transferability limits the nse criterion is as well known form of the normalized least squares objective function it represents the overall agreement of the shape of the hydrograph while placing more emphasis on high flows perfect agreement between the observed and simulated values yields an efficiency of 1 while a negative efficiency represents a lack of agreement worse than if the simulated values were replaced with the observed mean values ve represents the agreement of cumulated runoff volume during the simulation period and is expressed through the proportional difference to observed values its optimal value is zero these criteria are computed according to the following equations 5 nse 1 i 1 n q sim q obs 2 i 1 n q obs q obs 2 where q obs mean observed runoff 6 ve i 1 n q sim i 1 n q obs i 1 n q obs to underline model instability between periods with contrasted climate conditions parameter transferability was assessed as a function of the climate change variables δt and δp between the validation and calibration periods since nse is based on a ratio of the squared model error to the variance of observed flows any changes in variance or volumes between climatically contrasted periods dry wet can affect result of the comparison we thus chose to evaluate model transferability by calculating the differences between nse resulting from the calibration period rr receiver and the nse calculated in the same period but with parameters provided by model calibration on other sub periods dr donor this made it possible to represent the results obtained from the gdsst classified in a grid of δt and δp with a step of 0 2 c and 5 respectively see fig 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of the different sst techniques the three benchmark sst techniques and the proposed gdsst were applied to the five study catchments in northern tunisia the techniques were compared as regards to the number of validation exercises and to the precipitation temperature differences they provided the 30 year reference period over each catchment was based on the hydrological years from the 1st of september to the 31st of august the length of the sub periods was set to 8 years for the sliding window sst the random bootstrap sst and the gdsst however for the 4 sub period dsst the 30 year reference period was spread over 7 8 years hot dry hot wet cold dry and cold wet sub periods since 30 is not a multiple of four a 8 year time span was judged to be suitable for model calibration indeed several studies have shown that three to eight years are generally sufficient for model calibration with validation using a classical split sample test e g yapo et al 1996 anctil et al 2004 moreover using 8 year periods still provided significant differences in mean climate due to the length of available records 30 years and the high variability of the climate conditions under study as a result we assumed it was an acceptable compromise between the length of the period needed for calibration and the number of possible combinations between calibration validation periods the random bootstrap sst results in a large number of possible sub periods if fully applied to a 30 year period around six millions 8 year sub periods due to limited time budget for model calibration and validation we decided to use only 100 randomly selected sub periods for each catchment for sake of fair comparison the same number of randomly selected sub periods was set with the gdsst note that the number of sub periods for the two other techniques is already limited by their design 23 sub periods for the sliding window sst and four for the 4 sub period dsst fig 4 shows the number of validation exercises obtained with the different sampling techniques according to a grid of the differences in mean annual temperature and precipitation between the validation and calibration sub periods δt and δp with a step of 0 2 c and 5 respectively when a given δt and δp did not exist in the classification sample the corresponding square in the figure was coloured in grey the figure allows the spread of the sample provided by each sampling technique to be evaluated in terms of δt and δp additionally table 4 summarizes the number of calibration validation exercises and the ranges in δt and δp provided by the different sampling techniques applied over the 1970 2000 period in the five studied basins fig 4a shows the sample offered by the sliding window sst technique when applied to the five study catchments it provided 1495 possible validation exercises for 115 23 5 basins calibration exercises the differences between the different sub periods in mean precipitation ranged from 20 to 25 and the differences in temperature ranged from 1 8 c to 1 8 c when looking at the random bootstrap sst technique fig 4b it provided 5800 possible validation exercises for a total of 500 calibration 100 5 basins exercises the differences between the different sub periods in mean precipitation ranged from 35 to 50 and in temperature from 1 4 c to 1 4 c the 4 sub period dsst fig 4c provided 60 possible validation exercises from 20 4 5 basins calibration sub periods the differences in mean precipitation obtained ranged from 40 to 60 and in temperature from 2 c to 2 c like the random bootstrap sst the proposed gdsst fig 4d provided many possible validation exercises 9320 from a total of 500 calibration 100 5 basins exercises however the differences in mean precipitation obtained ranged from 45 to 80 and in temperature from 2 c to 2 c although the sliding window sst technique provided numerous validation exercises the differences in p δp were less contrasted than those offered by the three other techniques the sliding window technique thus appears to depend too much on the historical climate trends to detect extremely contrasted sub periods for calibration using this method coron et al 2012 found well contrasted precipitation in southeast australia however the authors reported precipitation trends that contributed to obtain a significant contrast in precipitation characteristics between different periods in northern tunisia continuous sliding periods were unable to provide sufficiently contrasted periods because there was no trend in precipitation during the historical study period as shown by dakhlaoui et al 2017 in addition the study area presents high inter annual precipitation variability see also dakhlaoui et al 2017 using continuous sub periods thus smooths the average precipitation in the sub periods thereby reducing the climate contrast between them however this is not the case for temperature for which the sliding window sst technique provided significant differences in t δt due to the increasing temperature trends in northern tunisia over 1970 2000 dakhlaoui et al 2017 the random bootstrap sst technique provided an important number of validation exercises 5800 however it led to limited differences in t δt and a poor distribution of the sample with high concentration in the centre of the figure where there is the least significant contrast to test model parameter transferability the 4 sub period dsst provided more contrasted δt and δp than the sliding window and random bootstrap sst indeed it is based on a sampling technique generating highly climate contrasted sub periods however although it explored contrasted climatic conditions in the historical period the technique provides very few insights into moderate δt and δp compared to the other techniques the oriented bootstrap of the gdsst provided more validation exercises than the random bootstrap sst although both techniques were based on the same number of calibration exercises 5 0 0 this can be explained by the fact that the oriented bootstrap favours the selection of independent sub periods by reducing overlap between them in addition the gdsst provided a better spread of validation periods indeed contrary to the random bootstrap technique in which the validation exercises were concentrated in the zone of δt and δp near 0 the sample provided by the gdsst technique was more concentrated at the extremes δt and δp which are the most contrasted sub periods to test the parameter transferability hence the differences in mean precipitation and temperature between the different sub periods ranged respectively from 45 to 80 and from 2 c to 2 c thus providing a more marked climatic contrast between the calibration and validation periods compared with the previous techniques see fig 4 it should be noted that the random bootstrap technique theoretically includes all the spread of δt and δp provided by the other techniques tested in other words the theoretical limits of the tested combinations if all possible combinations were sampled should be as large as the largest limits provided by all the other techniques however the problem is that the application of a bootstrap on all combinations would require excessive computation time and would lead to a very large number 6 million of 8 year sub periods of combinations that could obviously not be tested through cross validation with hydrological models the proposed gdsst has the advantage to be more effective with only a limited number of calibration exercises 1 0 0 it provides a large number of sub periods from similar to contrasted conditions in terms of precipitation and temperature while ensuring that the most climatically contrasted sub periods are sampled 4 2 model transferability under climate contrasted conditions using gdsst these encouraging results led us to use the gdsst to assess the model s transferability under climate contrasted conditions see protocol in section 3 3 based on the nse criterion the model s transferability decreased with an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation fig 5b the simultaneous increase in t and decrease in p resulted in a significant reduction in model performance in contrast an increase in precipitation and or a decrease in temperatures had a much moderate impact on model efficiency sometimes even leading to a slight improvement in performance providing evidence for better parameter transferability under wetter and or colder conditions the cases where the model performance was improved can be explained by the fact that the evaluation criterion nse is different from the calibration objective function kge by the way there were no cases where the kge value in validation on a given period was larger than the kge value in calibration on the same period see fig 5a which shows that the method and the optimization algorithm are consistent and robust fig 5c shows that ve increases with an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation the water balance decreases when temperature decreases and precipitation increases this means that runoff is overestimated when moving to hotter and drier climate conditions and underestimated in the reverse case the transferability as regards to the ve criterion was more affected by changes in precipitation p than by changes in temperature t an increase in t and or a decrease in p between periods weakened the model robustness on the opposite the transferability is very satisfactory when δt and δp are low i e when climate conditions are rather similar between the receiver and donor periods including periods with extreme conditions this means that the models are robust when applied on periods with similarly climate conditions whether extreme or not fig 5d shows the limits of transferability of the hydrological models as a function of δt and δp these limits were defined according to a decrease in nse of more than 0 2 and a variation in ve of more than 25 we acknowledge that these thresholds are somewhat subjective and should be adapted depending on the hydrological conditions and according to the user need for example to match a sustainable level of uncertainties for water resources management in a given context for the current study nse values were always greater than 0 8 while ve values were always around 0 for all calibration periods and catchments we thus assumed that beyond a 0 2 decrease in nse criterion and a 25 increase in ve the simulations were no longer efficient the red grid shows non transferable areas these results show that transferring parameters to different climate conditions resulted in significant uncertainties when the shift is to a hotter drier climate compared to the other hydrological models gr4j appeared to be the least affected by changes in temperature and the most affected by changes in precipitation the limited effect of changes in temperature on the ve criterion can be partly explained by the fact that the changes in temperature mainly occur in the dry season which contributes little to runoff the limits of transferability of the models show clear interdependence of precipitation and temperature given the criteria and the thresholds retained they can be approximated according to an acceptability line fig 5d computed from a linear relation between δt and δp the models are thus roughly transferable for changes in precipitation δp 0 08 δt 0 18 with δp 30 80 and changes in temperature δt 2 c 2 c these limits are more precise than those presented in previous studies which showed squared transferability limits see coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2017 however it should be noted the presence of outliers above the acceptability line these outliers correspond to low density of validation samples see fig 4d and it is difficult to give general conclusion about them for instance another limit towards wetter and colder conditions may also exist but it is difficult to identify within the obtained results moreover although fig 5 provides evidence of transferability problems when moving to drier and hotter conditions the interdependence of temperature and precipitation partly hides the fact that the models are probably less transferable towards drier conditions than towards hotter conditions 4 3 analysis of high resolution climate simulations 4 3 1 efficiency of the rcms over the control period fig 6 shows the raw rcm outputs p and t versus climate observations over the reference period 1970 2000 fig 6a and b compare the mean seasonal precipitation temperature observed with the one simulated by each of the eight rcms over the reference period while fig 6c shows the relative errors between mean simulated and observed annual precipitation and mean errors between mean simulated and observed annual temperature the rcms did not correctly reproduce precipitation nse values between mean seasonal simulated precipitation and mean seasonal observed precipitation range from negative values to 0 7 depending on the climate models and the catchments fig 6b the rcms tested were thus not able to accurately reproduce the average seasonality of precipitation especially during the wet season in addition many models were not even able to represent average annual precipitation which leads to significant over or under estimation of rainfall see fig 6c the rcm simulations of temperature show a better agreement with observations the nse values were generally above 0 85 fig 6b showing the good performance of rcm in reproducing the temperature seasonality the difference between mean annual simulated and observed temperature was very small for clm had clm mpi smh had and smh mpi fig 6c however this difference was greater than 2 c for cnr cnr and knm ecercm the limited efficiency of rcm notably in reproducing observed precipitation over the reference period hampered the direct use of climate model raw outputs for building climate scenarios moreover since cnr cnr rcm was the least efficient in reproducing the past observed climate in the studied basins it was excluded from the ensemble while this did not guarantee better future projections we nevertheless considered it an essential step to obtain the most reliable and relevant simulations for future projections 4 3 2 climate scenarios for the medium and long term horizon the rcm bias in reproducing reference climate notably precipitation volume and seasonal patterns led us to apply a simple delta change method in order to produce a range of climate scenarios from the rcm outputs all simulations of climate change were thus based on the historical representative concentration pathway rcp over the reference period 1970 2000 and scenarios rcp 4 5 and 8 5 for a medium term horizon 2040 2070 and a long term horizon 2070 2100 high resolution climate change forcing was thus obtained by a monthly perturbation method which assumes that climate models reproduce the relative change in climatic variables better than their absolute values the method consists in producing future climate scenarios by modifying the observed climatic series so as to reproduce the mean monthly variations obtained between the reference and future climatic simulations produced by climate models for more details on the method used see ruelland et al 2012 fig 7 a compares the mean seasonal precipitation observed over the reference period and projected precipitation according to the four combinations of horizons and rcps for each of the seven selected rcms fig 7b shows the same comparison for temperature the climate change signal is very different from one rcm to another especially for precipitation however all rcms predict a warmer climate and almost all climate models predict dryer conditions in the future at the medium term horizon a change of 10 to 23 6 3 to 35 in total precipitation is projected under the rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenario at the long term horizon a change of 12 to 30 15 to 52 in total precipitation is projected under the rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenario these changes mainly occur in the wet season november to april for temperature fig 7b at the medium term horizon an increase of 1 0 to 1 5 c 1 8 to 3 5 c is projected under the rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenario at the long term horizon an increase of 1 7 to 3 3 c 3 2 to 5 7 c is expected under the rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenario in contrast to precipitation these changes are expected to occur mainly during summer the changes in temperature are likely to have little impact on discharge since there is almost no runoff in summer but the decrease in winter precipitation may have a critical impact on water resources 4 4 comparing climate projections with model parameter transferability 4 4 1 analysis of the transferability of the models to climate contrasted periods this section exploits one of the main results obtained in section 4 2 which showed that the difference in climate conditions between calibration and validation periods progressively affects the performances of hydrological models see fig 5 for this purpose three cases were used for the hydrological projections with each model the first case uses the parameter sets calibrated over the whole who reference period 1970 2000 the second case uses the parameter sets calibrated over the 12 year sub period the closest to the future climate msp the third case uses the parameter sets calibrated over the 12 year sub period the most different from the future climate mdp the median of the seven rcm projections was considered for each rcp horizon and catchment three hundred sub periods were generated according to the proposed gdsst to increase the chance of finding the msp and mdp sub periods the closest the farthest sub period to the future climate according to mahalanobis distance as regards to the pluviometric and temperature conditions were considered as msp mdp it should be noted that given the time span 30 years of the projection periods we decided to increase the calibration period length from eight see section 4 2 for the tests regarding the gdsst to 12 years the rationale behind this increasing length of calibration periods was to reduce the ratio of number of years between the calibration period 12 and the future periods 30 under study thus limiting over fitted calibration when applying the models to the future 30 year periods fig 8 shows the behaviour of ve and the transferability limits obtained by the gdsst applied to the reference period 1970 2000 as described in section 4 2 for each rcm rcp horizon and catchment three points are shown one for the future climate seen from the whole period one for the future climate seen from the msp and one for the mdp the cross indicates the mean reference climate conditions over the 30 year past period or over the most similar or most different 12 year period i e with 0 coordinates as a reference this makes it possible to position future climate conditions rcm in relation to the transferability limits of the models in the figure the past climate conditions who msp or mdp are thus considered as calibration periods with respect to the climate conditions predicted by the rcm we found that under rcp 4 5 whatever the horizon the transfer of parameter sets calibrated over the whole 30 year period to the future climate conditions would be acceptable with respect to the defined transferability limits however this was not the case under rcp 8 5 at the medium term horizon whereas choosing parameter sets calibrated over the msp would be acceptable given the long term climate predicted under rcp8 5 the parameter sets calibrated over the whole 30 year period or over the most similar 12 year sub period both fell outside the transferability limits 4 4 2 sensitivity of the hydrological projections to the selected calibration period fig 9 shows the relative changes in runoff volume in the hydrological projections performed by the three rainfall runoff models forced by the median of the climate projections of the seven rcms retained three parameter sets who msp and mdp were used for each case the predicted changes in precipitation and temperature are transformed into hydrological projections by a change of 0 14 to 6 2 in mean annual runoff under rcp4 5 and of 13 to 31 under rcp8 5 at the medium term horizon and respectively 16 to 29 and 37 to 57 at the long term horizon the different cases of model parameterization had different impacts on the hydrological projections msp generally predicted the largest change in volume compared to the two other cases in fact when using parameters calibrated over the whole period the hydrological impact of climate change was underestimated by 5 20 compared to when the parameters were calibrated on the msp using parameters calibrated on the mdp msp generally led to a smaller larger change in volume compared to the two other cases additionally the change in volume simulated when using parameters calibrated over the who period was generally closer to the change simulated when they were calibrated over the mdp period rather than the msp period it is clear here that the behaviour concerning the change in volume simulated by the models via the gdsst experiment fig 5 was transferred to the hydrological projections when moving to drier and hotter conditions future climate conditions seen relative to past reference conditions over the who period or the mdp the hydrological models tended to overestimate runoff and to generate less change in volume the overestimation of runoff was reduced in the case of msp where the decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature were less marked which according to the gdsst results section 4 2 could be translated into less overestimation of runoff compared to the who period causing a bigger decrease in runoff the limited difference between mdp and whole period could be explained by rrm transferability of ve which is more affected by changes in precipitation than by changes in temperature as discussed in section 3 3 3 in fact the climate conditions over the whole 30 year period and over the mdp 12 year period are not too different in terms of precipitation in contrast to temperature as found in further experiments a similar behaviour of different rainfall runoff models can be observed 5 summary and conclusion we developed a bootstrap based differential split sample test to assess the transferability of conceptual rainfall runoff models under past and future climate variability the proposed general differential split sample test gdsst aims to sample sub periods of discontinuous years gathering similar to different conditions in terms of differences in precipitation and temperature the gdsst was compared to three other existing techniques to select sub periods over a 30 year past period on a set of five basins under semi arid conditions in northern tunisia we showed that the gdsst outperformed the other split sample techniques by providing a larger number of sub periods from similar to contrasted conditions in terms of precipitation and temperature while ensuring that the most climatically contrasted sub periods are sampled the gdsst was then used to evaluate the transferability of three hydrological models under various past climate conditions in the five basins our results showed that the difference in climate between calibration and validation progressively affects model performance the models tested showed acceptable transferability to wetter and or colder conditions however their efficiency was significantly affected under a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature according to the criteria and the thresholds retained the models were found roughly transferable for relative changes in precipitation δp 0 08 δt 0 18 with δp 30 80 and changes in temperature δt 2 c 2 c these transferability limits showed clear interdependence between precipitation and temperature and are more accurate than those presented in previous studies which revealed more squared limits coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2017 the models tend to overestimate runoff with an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation and conversely the transferability limits were then compared to the future climate projections in seven high resolution regional climate simulations under two radiative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for one medium term horizon 2040 2070 and one long term horizon 2070 2100 at the medium term horizon rcms project a change in mean annual precipitation of 6 3 35 at the long term horizon the change in precipitation is expected to reach 12 52 the rcms foresee an increase in temperature ranging from 1 0 c to 3 5 c by the medium term horizon and from 1 7 c to 5 7 c at the long term horizon the differences in precipitation and temperature between past and future climate are generally within the limits of modelling transferability under rcp 4 5 regardless of the horizon however this was not the case under rcp 8 5 regardless of the horizon our results showed that it was possible to find a calibration sub period within the limits of transferability for the medium term horizon the projected change in precipitation and temperature are translated into hydrological projections by a 0 14 to 6 2 change in mean annual runoff under rcp4 5 and a 13 to 31 change in runoff under rcp8 5 at the medium term horizon and respectively 16 to 29 and 37 to 57 by the long term horizon finally the effects of the selected past calibration period on the hydrological projections were analysed we found that models calibrated on the whole past period underestimated the impact of climate change on mean annual runoff by 5 20 in comparison to their calibration on sub periods with mean annual precipitation and temperature that are closer to future climate conditions another key finding was similar transferability between the different hydrological models tested this paper thus assessed the robustness of hydrological models under climate variability and drew the limits of their parameter transferability in terms of δt and δp we proposed to reduce the uncertainty caused by parameter instability through a better strategy of calibration understanding the sources of the limited transferability of the models beyond the limits identified in the present study is a complex task however we showed that the climate conditions of the period used to calibrate hydrological models can have a significant impact on hydrological projections using the whole historical period for model calibration can result in systematic underestimation of the impact of climate change on surface water resources based on our findings we recommend selecting a past sub period in which the climate conditions are as close as possible to those of the future periods to be simulated in order to identify calibration parameters that can be used for hydrological projections which could significantly reduce uncertainty future studies could focus on a better understanding of parameter instability to improve rrms robustness for instance the choice in the calibration period length could be further explored as mentioned by coron at al 2012 choosing the sub period length used in the sampling methodology is a difficult task the calibration period should be long enough to allow for correct parameter determination several studies see e g guo et al 2018 vaze et al 2010 thus claimed that longer calibration periods lead to more robust rrm under climate variability since they represent more diversified climate conditions at the same time using overly long periods may play against the study s objectives as it would reduce the contrast between periods also the number of independent test periods per catchment decreases when the sub period length increases in the present study dealing with a 30 year reference period we have considered 8 12 year calibration sub periods which appeared as an acceptable compromise between the length of the period needed for calibration and the number of possible combinations between calibration validation periods however we acknowledge that shorter longer sub periods could provide more less different contrasts in terms of δt and δp while possibly increasing reducing model robustness future work could also use physically based models to test whether the more detailed processes they attempt to represent make them less climate dependent than the conceptual models in realistically representing the multi decadal flow finally the proposed gdsst was developed to sample sub periods of discontinuous years which is suitable for a semi arid climate with a long dry summer like in mediterranean environments however it may not be suitable for other climates under which the hydrological processes are strongly influenced by the preceding years and with discharge sustained by groundwater flows during dry periods thus leading to very various initial conditions future studies could thus focus on adapting the gdsst to such climates declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work is part of the postdoc research

6359,the joint spatiotemporal modeling of aquifer level fluctuations provides a significant tool in the prediction of groundwater levels at unvisited locations two types of variogram functions appropriately modified to incorporate physical information are presented and compared under space time residual kriging methodology using the bayesian bootstrap idea to quantify uncertainty the spatiotemporal trend is approximated using a component of physical meaning a recently developed spartan type non separable variogram function employs tools of physical meaning to enhance the efficiency and reliability of spatiotemporal geostatistical modeling in groundwater applications in addition the product sum space time variogram is applied and involves in the separable variogram functions a scale factor of hydraulic conductivity directional ratio the proposed variogram functions involve a non euclidean distance metric and are mathematically valid i e constitutes permissible models herein the efficiency of the proposed tools is tested using groundwater level data from an alluvial unconfined aquifer both functions provide improved results compared to those of the space time ordinary kriging between the two the non separable one has the most efficient performance keywords non separable variogram space time kriging groundwater manhattan distance bayesian bootstrap idea non euclidean distance 1 introduction spatiotemporal geostatistics is a significant tool for groundwater level modeling and resources management a common field where geostatistics is applied is the one of hydrology e g to model the spatial temporal variability of aquifer level as a random field successful groundwater flow modelling using physically based models and numerical techniques requires detailed information on the spatial variation of the aquifer variables input and boundary conditions on the other hand statistical stochastic approaches like geostatistics are suitable to determine the groundwater level space time variations at scarce and sparse monitored areas kitanidis 1997 estimation of groundwater levels at grid points using measurements at random points is necessary to apply groundwater simulation models in most geohydrological studies the initial data are in the form of scattered data a basic task is to use these values in order to provide the spatial variability of the variable under study rouhani 1986 kriging and other forms of regularization can be useful in many circumstances in developing ground water models map water table which is basic for regional hydrogeological investigations identification of groundwater flow direction and zones of recharge or discharge desbarats et al 2002 hill 2006 varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 groundwater flow models often needs to be defined using limited data or after extensive calibration uncertainties still exist on the other hand kriging techniques does not guarantee consistency with the physics of groundwater flow but can reliably represent the hydraulic head fields rivest et al 2008 due to scarcity of information about the hydrogeological system boundary conditions and hydrogeological detailed data or gaps in groundwater level spatial and temporal measurements geostatistical models in spatial or spatiotemporal context are extensively applied to represent the hydraulic head field variations e g baú and mayer 2006 bierkens et al 2001 kumar 2007 lyon et al 2006 razavi et al 2012 ruybal et al 2019 theodossiou and latinopoulos 2006 tonkin and larson 2002 varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 there are also works regarding groundwater levels or groundwater contamination where the results of kriging techniques were successfully compared with the results of numerical models and apply as surrogates an et al 2015 asher et al 2015 baú and mayer 2006 ma et al 1999 pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 zhao et al 2016 generally geostatistical modelling can aid a physically based modelling approach e g providing the initial conditions of groundwater level distribution or to provide a reliable representation of groundwater levels space time variations based on available data the implementation of geostatistical methods is based on the calculation of data spatial and or temporal dependence the geostatistical analysis of space time dependent data has initially been performed applying separable covariance functions involving the combination of discrete spatial and temporal variogram models cressie 1993 dimitrakopoulos and luo 1994 rodriguez iturbe and mejia 1974 rouhani and myers 1990 on the other hand the non separable covariance functions developed the last two decades often include components with physical meaning dynamic rules or differential equations employed in these functions help to improve prediction accuracy christakos 2000 christakos and hristopulos 1998 gneiting 2002 kolovos et al 2004 porcu et al 2006 up to now spatiotemporal covariance functions for groundwater level applications have not been established however spatiotemporal covariance functions based on physical ground have been developed and are mostly applied in atmospheric pollution and synthetic data such research has been presented in the past i e the cressie huang functions cressie and huang 1999 gneiting s non separable models gneiting 2002 a series of non separable models based on physical laws and dynamic rules in kolovos et al 2004 and the non separable functions that replace the covariance with a spectral density function porcu et al 2008 previous research on geostatistical analysis of scarce groundwater level datasets has shown that the approximation of a spatial trend using secondary information e g topographic and geomorphologic features improves the predictions of groundwater level e g desbarats et al 2002 varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 therefore the introduction of a spatiotemporal trend model for space time geostatistical analysis of groundwater level would be an interesting approach to improve spatiotemporal predictions the incorporation of temporal trend in terms of an exponentially weighted moving average filter and the spatial trend in terms of a groundwater flow equation resulted in the spatiotemporal trend applied in the present work the estimated trend and the residual component are combined in terms of space time residual kriging strk methodology while the investigation of the spatiotemporal trend variance is also important due to its complexity to estimate the variance associated with the trend three components were considered the predictors at the prediction point the variance of the temporal trend function and the variance resulted from the groundwater flow equation the variance terms are necessary to be determined for the accurate strk estimations and the overall variance calculation for this reason a bayesian kriging type under the bootstrap idea called empirical bayesian kriging pilz and spöck 2008 was applied to capture the range of the spatiotemporal model uncertainty in terms of the parameters involved and the estimated covariance function given a time series at specific spatial points and considering the time as an extra dimension the spatiotemporal geostatistical analysis aims to model multiple time series of data performing interpolation and prediction the interpolation accuracy is tested using leave one out cross validation while predictions assessment applies validating measurements on the examined temporal scale i e wet and dry periods of a hydrological year in a time forward mode the latter means that the spatiotemporal process prediction occur time forward according to the determined properties that are defined by the space time variogram space time kriging can be applied for interpolation purposes heuvelink and griffith 2010 júnez ferreira and herrera 2013 ruybal et al 2019 snepvangers et al 2003 but also in the form of time forward kriging using proximities such as the variogram or covariance parameters i e correlation length to forecast the spatio temporal process christakos 2000 measurements usually are regularly taken on the time domain compared to the spatial domain hence estimation is most often in time extrapolation mode kyriakidis and journel 1999 space time kriging is one of those methodologies that can be applied for extrapolation prediction gneiting et al 2007 kyriakidis and journel 1999 rouhani and myers 1990 extrapolation prediction assumes that the calculated variogram properties applies outside the space time range of data specifically consider a purely spatial random field with stationary covariance function and suppose that the entire field moves time forward the resulting spatio temporal random field has stationary covariance with correlation lengths that indicates the spatial and temporal correlation distance of the measurements and therefore the reliable prediction time window gneiting et al 2007 many works have applied successfully space time kriging for prediction time forward prediction purposes at different spatial locations of variable datasets e g groundwater level

correlated trend and a residual s trf factor z s t modeling space time variations around that trend christakos 1991 kyriakidis and journel 1999 the first goal of this work was the development of a reliable geostatistical model to represent the space time variations of groundwater levels at the study aquifer the second goal of this study was to employ novel covariance functions for groundwater level applications and to test its efficiency on spatiotemporal analysis finally the third goal was the calculation of spatiotemporal uncertainty that has not been approached before with a methodology based on classical bayesian analysis regarding the novelty of this work it presents and asses two modified space time variogram types using novel terms of physical meaning to model the space time data dependence of groundwater level measurements the first is a scale factor of hydraulic conductivity directional ratio and the second the hydraulic gradient moreover it involves and tests the application of a non euclidean distance metric in the space time geostatistical process the procedure of defining the estimations uncertainty is also new as a bayesian kriging type approach using detrending and the bootstrap idea is applied for the first time in joint space time data finally a combination of an exponentially weighted moving average filter with the thiem s law that define the groundwater flow under pumping of multiple wells to approximate the temporal groundwater level trend and to describe the corresponding spatial trend is employed for the first time 2 spatiotemporal modelling theory and application the field application of the present work is related to mires basin in the messara watershed which is located on the island of crete greece fig 1 the basin mainly consists of quaternary alluvial sediments which form an inter bedded sequence of gravels gravely sands sands silts silty sands and clays in its greatest extend the aquifer is homogeneous with only very small inconsistencies that exist in every aquifer a small number of faults four exist at the center of the aquifer that may affect locally the groundwater flow the hydraulic conductivity values are of the same magnitude 10 4 m s in the entire aquifer it varies thought from 0 0009 m s in the east to 0 00021 m s in the west the basin s aquifer is characterized in the hydro geological reports as unconfined the mean annual rainfall in the basin is around 650 mm and the basin altitude is less than 300 m about 65 of rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration and 10 as runoff to the sea leaving only 25 to recharge the aquifer the land use in the area comprise mainly of olive trees vines fruit trees and vegetable cultivations mostly open field and some greenhouses varouchakis 2016 only 10 wells were regularly monitored between years 1981 and 2015 while groundwater level measurements were only taken bi annually wet dry period special water secretariat of greece 2015 thus the available data file consists of 680 values 34 bi annual measurements implying 68 values at 10 monitoring stations distributed in a matrix of 68 rows and 10 columns the monitoring wells are unevenly distributed and mostly concentrated along geropotamos river that crosses the basin due to the overexploitation of the aquifer and the expeditious increase of drip irrigation the water table has been declined almost 35 m since 1981 causing great shortage of the water resources in the area the application of spatiotemporal geostatistics exploits the spatially short groundwater level dataset to determine the spatiotemporal variability of the aquifer and detect possible space time interdependencies useful for interpolation and extrapolation predictions spatiotemporal geostatistical analysis considers the following steps 1 approximation of spatiotemporal trend 2 space time variogram calculation 3 application of space time kriging and 4 evaluation of the proposed methodology reliability by applying leave one out cross validation of the monitored data values prediction at omitted onward time steps for validation purposes and calculation of estimations uncertainty i e space time kriging variance and or simulations in this work the latter applied using a simulations technique in terms of space time empirical bayesian kriging space time ordinary kriging stok and strk are reliable methods for space time estimation christakos et al 2001 de cesare et al 2001 varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 nevertheless the simultaneous solution of kriging equations to calculate the spatial and temporal weights of the system becomes complicated skøien and blöschl 2007 thus special attention is needed to ensure the validity and suitability of the chosen spatiotemporal dependence model therefore first the experimental spatiotemporal variogram is determined jointly in space and time according to the space time classical moment estimator γ z r τ 1 2 n r τ i 1 n j 1 n z s i t i z s j t j 2 where γ z r τ denotes the space time variogram r is the space lag and τ is the time lag then separable and non separable space time variogram functions are fitted to the experimental space time variogram using the least squares sum method to obtain the optimal theoretical variogram fit that will provide the space time dependence parameters 2 1 geostatistical tools the first step of a geostatistical analysis is to split the random function into two subcomponents trend and fluctuations the spatiotemporal trend considers separately the spatial and temporal trend under a product function the product of the two trend types is inspired by the product covariance function that considers the multiplication of a purely spatial function and a purely temporal function to express the spatiotemporal data dependence however kyriakidis and journel 1999 have proposed a similar approach for the decomposition of trend and residuals of a random field an exponentially weighted moving average filter ewma was applied on the mean bi annual groundwater level field data to remove the average temporal trend of the groundwater level in the aquifer pham 2006 varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 the general form of ewma model that is convenient in minimizing computations is applied in this work m z t i w z t i 1 w m z t i 1 with initial condition m z t 1 z t 1 where m z is the temporal trend z t i is the average groundwater level of the wells at the time t i and 0 w 1 is a constant weight determined by the data the latter is a constant that determines how fast the exponential weights decline over the past consecutive periods in its analytical form ewma takes a weighted average of all past observations and use this as a forecast of the trend of a random variable at time t i declining weights are put on older data by increasing the weight exponent during the smoothing process holt 2004 pham 2006 the spatial trend approximation is based on thiem s equation that describes the groundwater flow when pumping in the aquifer is on varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 the form of the equation for an unconfined aquifer when multiple wells operate is given below bear 1979 todd 1959 1 h 2 s h 0 2 s 1 π k i 1 n q i ln r i r i r i r i i 1 n where h s and h0 s denote the estimated and initial groundwater levels at the point s respectively k stands for hydraulic conductivity r i describes the distance between the prediction location and the contributing well i n is the set of contributing wells q expresses the pumping rate and sri is the well s radius of influence in terms of an empirical equation 2 in the absence of available pumping tests bear 1979 todd 1959 2 r i 575 s w i h 0 i k i in eq 2 sw i corresponds to the groundwater drawdown at the well and h 0 i m is the prior to pumping aquifer saturation thickness due to lack of information uniform values were used for the variables sw i and k an assumption was considered about sw i due to different values that receives during the wet and dry period the different pumping rates that occur during each season and the deviations from the agreed pumping rates according to the local authorities led to determine an average sw i that corresponds to the mean annual drawdown of the aquifer level at each well thus it was determined from a linear regression analysis of the mean annual groundwater level variations during a 34 years period at each well the k value on the other hand was determined from a recent work that updated the hydraulic conductivity at the study area due to changes in the saturation thickness the alluvial background of the aquifer provides k values of the same magnitude the assigned values of k were spatially averaged from values obtained at different monitoring locations of the aquifer the pumping rates were available as the 10 wells monitored in the area are registered in the national network with specified permitted pumping rates special water secretariat of greece 2015 varouchakis 2016 thiem s formulation meets in this work the application assumptions todd 1959 bear 1979 the study aquifer is homogeneous as it consists of quaternary alluvial deposits it has a hydraulic gradient from east to west equal to 0 004 65 18 m 12000 m denoting that prior to pumping conditions the aquifer level is almost horizontal and equilibrium or steady state flow conditions have reached as the entire pumped water is yielded from external sources beyond the radius of influence i e the radii of influence of the pumping wells are under 500 m much less than the aquifer extend which is around 12 000 m in addition the study aquifer receives inflows from the east and outflows to the west thiem s equation is applied to approximate the spatial trend of the aquifer level separately at each timestep wet and dry hydrological periods the trend removal supports a more stable space time variogram estimation that helps strk to deliver results of improved accuracy steady state or equilibrium flow conditions apply at spatial scale within each specific timestep along with the other thiem equation application assumptions reported previously the product of the spatial trend that follows the thiem s law and the temporal trend that was calculated at every time step was divided by a reference spatial trend component to provide the spatiotemporal trend variation the latter is applied to keep the units in meters the residuals calculated at every well at a specific time step were obtained as a result of the subtraction between the groundwater level and the spatiotemporal trend groundwater level is part of the aquifer s saturation zone and describes the water table variation hydraulic conductivity is an important parameter that determines both groundwater flow and head in the saturation zone according to the basic groundwater flow equation expressed by the darcy law bear 1979 it is an anisotropic parameter that usually varies significantly in the vertical direction therefore the average hydraulic conductivity directional ratio can be applied as a scale factor of the theoretical variogram model to control the fitting to the experimental variogram the presence of outliers in datasets or of long spatiotemporal dependencies affect the range of the experimental variogram fluctuations and sill s location if any thus the application of a scaling factor that has a physical meaning and directly affects groundwater level variations provides a consistent variogram fit that provides reliable parameters a uniform hydraulic conductivity directional ratio was applied as the aquifer porous media was characterized homogeneous by the hydrogeological studies conducted in the area the application of such a scale factor was inspired by a similar application of a global anisotropy ratio acting as a scale factor involving the vertical to horizontal hydraulic conductivity ratio to model the spatial variability of transmissivity chiles and delfiner 1999 according to a hydrogeological literature review the hydraulic conductivity follows the lognormal distribution with an exponential covariance desbarats 1992 similarly the hydraulic head covariance of a simplified linear reservoir model appears to decrease with time and approaches the typical exponential covariance as time increases zhang and li 2005 on the other hand at a local scale the hydraulic head is spatially interpreted by a differentiable function such as the basic groundwater flow equation thus a differentiable covariance function such as the gaussian which is applicable and efficient in determining the spatial dependence of variations in small spatial resolutions is considered to model the spatial dependence of the water table variations theodoridou et al 2017 therefore considering the previous research findings and facts in the present work a gaussian and an exponential variogram were applied the first to describe the spatial dependence of the groundwater level residuals and the second the temporal the experimental space time variogram of the residuals was first calculated and then modelled with a theoretical spatiotemporal variogram function herein the product sum spatiotemporal variogram was applied by means of the gaussian and the exponential variogram functions 3 γ z s r k z k x y σ z s 2 1 exp r s ξ s 2 4 γ z t r t k z k x y σ z t 2 1 exp r t ξ t where σ is the variance ξ is the correlation length in space s and time t r is the lag vector in space and time and the k fraction is the hydraulic conductivity directional ratio the product sum variogram combines the use of separate spatial and temporal variograms under a non separable function the product sum space time variogram de cesare et al 2001 model is inspired from the separate product and sum models it is defined as 5 c st r s r t k 1 c s r s c t r t k 2 c s r s k 3 c t r t cs ct are purely spatial and temporal covariance models with k 1 0 k 2 0 k 3 0 in terms of the variogram the above equation is expressed as 6 γ st r s r t k 1 c s 0 k 3 γ t r t k 1 c t 0 k 2 γ s r s k 1 γ s r s γ t r t where γ s γ t are purely spatial and temporal variogram models on the other hand spartan covariance and variogram functions that were introduced by hristopulos 2003 and have been implemented to miscellaneous environmental data sets elogne et al 2008 elogne and hristopulos 2008 hristopulos 2003 hristopulos and elogne 2009 varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 were also applied in this work herein this family of functions is modified appropriately to model hydro geological data the spartan covariance functions in d 3 dimensions are expressed as follows 7 c z h η 0 e h β 2 2 π η 1 2 4 sin h β 1 h β 1 for η 1 2 σ z 2 η 0 2 π η 1 2 4 η 0 e h 8 π for η 1 2 σ z 2 η 0 8 π η 0 e h ω 1 e h ω 2 4 π ω 2 ω 1 h η 1 2 4 for η 1 2 σ z 2 η 0 4 π η 1 2 4 where η 0 is the scale factor η 1 is the rigidity coefficient β 1 2 η 1 1 2 2 is a dimensionless wavenumber β 2 2 η 1 1 2 2 and ω 1 2 η 1 δ 2 1 2 δ η 1 2 4 1 2 ξ stands for the correlation length h r ξ is the normalized lag vector h h is the separation distance norm while σ z 2 is the variance equation 7 can be also allied in two dimensions christakos 1991 in case of η 1 2 the covariance is expressed by the exponential model while for less than 2 η 1 by the combination of the exponential and hole effect the respective stationary variogram model is then given by γ st r s r t σ z 2 c z h the spatiotemporal spartan function constitutes a new approach in the interdependence modeling of spatiotemporal data varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 it forms a non separable model which is derived by substituting h with the following equation in its spatial form of eq 7 h h r 2 α h τ 2 h r r ξ r h τ τ ξ τ where τ is the time step lag and α denotes a relative weight of the time lag with respect to the spatial lag the scale factor η 0 that partly defines the variance of the variogram is expressed in terms of the average spatiotemporal hydraulic gradient η 0 dh d l of the space time groundwater level dataset the latter is applied to obtain a physical parameter in the function that determines the highest value sill of the measurement variable in terms of different spatial and temporal separation distances a similar approach is common in developing covariance structures of physical meaning by including a parameter that affects the spatial or temporal behavior of the measured variable kolovos et al 2004 both variograms developed in this work are valid variogram functions as they satisfy the conditions of bochner s theorem i e the fourier transform exist and is non negative de cesare et al 2001 varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 the spatiotemporal process is anisotropic because of the time dimension enclosure the product sum space time variogram was applied likewise to other works of similar topic using isotropic variograms for space and time correlations de iaco 2010 raja et al 2017 tadić et al 2017 however the application of separate variogram models for space and time that have a different sill under the same space time joint function means the incorporation of zonal anisotropy hoogland et al 2010 geometric anisotropy on the other hand can be comprised when a common term of correlation length applies in a variogram function then it is appropriately modified using an anisotropic ratio parameter to approximate the difference of the spatial to temporal scale hoogland et al 2010 which in our case it was possible to be only applied for the spartan type thus it was applied modifying the correlation length in equation 7 another new approach in the modeling of spatiotemporal data is the application of non euclidean distance metrics in the present study the manhattan metric described by eq 8 is applied to examine the effect of distance calculation on the data interdependence modelling and the prediction results 8 manhattan d 1 x i x j y i y j where the cartesian coordinates of the ith and jth monitoring points wells are expressed by xi yi xj yj i j 1 n in the area of study and n is the number of wells in case of grid path data the application of manhattan distance provides better results due to its concentric rhombus structure compared to euclidean distance whose formula describes a concentric circle due to this special feature the aforementioned distance has the ability to bypass spatial hydrogeological discontinuities between the measurements theodoridou et al 2017 then strk is applied to combine both the residuals and the trend interpolation while the empirical bayesian bootstrap method pilz and spöck 2008 was applied to determine the overall uncertainty of estimations this stochastic modelling approach is based on the monte carlo simulation approach and produces multiple realizations rank the prediction results with respect to specified criteria and captures the range of the uncertainty the process considers the following steps unconditional simulation of the field space time fluctuations at the monitoring locations using the estimated model statistics and superposition with estimated trend the unconditional simulation process replicates the data mean variance and variogram on average estimation of the spatial and temporal groundwater level trend for the simulated realization and of the associated parameters using the same trend model structure estimation of the empirical space time residuals variogram and model fitting iteration of the above steps e g 1 000 times leads to the posterior distribution of the space time model parameters empirical bayesian bootstrap idea for each realization strk was performed to estimate the head at the nodes of a 100 100 grid for a specified time step of the study period herein bi annually leading to the predictive distribution at each grid point the mean cdf cumulative distribution function as well as the 5 and 95 cdf quantiles were calculated using bayes theory one can acquire a posteriori distribution of parameters using the prior distribution and the initial values of the parameters in bayesian kriging the posterior distribution of the parameters involved trend model and variogram is specified by means of simulations which corresponds to their uncertainty in order to implement bayesian kriging method first the appropriate space time variogram model of the fluctuations is determined after fitted to the experimental one the fluctuations were obtained by removing the spatiotemporal trend from the initial dataset using the parameters derived and the variogram function the covariance matrix is constructed then uniform random numbers generation is applied see appendix a these correlated random values have the same statistical characteristics with the initial observations dataset besides the random values represent a new realization that first undergoes detrending then the variogram of the fluctuations is calculated and finally strk is applied to estimate values at unknown locations this procedure is performed iteratively as described at the steps previously presented therefore aquifer level and prediction uncertainty maps can be developed to present the groundwater level distribution based on the spatiotemporal interdependence of the available data to determine the spatiotemporal variability of mires aquifer s groundwater level since 1981 and to use the data correlations to undertake predictions a spatiotemporal geostatistical analysis based on the aforementioned tools was performed two validation methods were applied to test the spatiotemporal model capabilities first the spatiotemporal experimental variogram was calculated using bi annual groundwater level data from the ten sampling locations for the period 1981 2014 validation of the estimates was performed using bi annual data of the wet and dry periods for the year 2014 2015 the available dataset consists of bi annual measurements from 1981 to 2015 a spatiotemporal variogram needs a sufficient time period and number of data in order to effectively represent the interdependence of the available measurements and to capture the data variability usually in spatiotemporal analysis the predictive capability of the model is tested sakizadeh et al 2019 tapoglou et al 2014 varouchakis 2017 varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 thus the spatiotemporal dependence of the dataset values was determined using the entire available data information apart from the last hydrological year in order to assess the prediction capability of the proposed model at the monitoring locations for the dry and wet period where measurements occur on the other hand the entire dataset was used with the proposed model via a leave one out cross validation to assess the estimation capability of the model at ungauged locations apart from the classical estimation metrics absolute error and absolute relative error two more metrics are applied to assess the efficiency of the proposed methodologies the root mean square standardized error rmsse diodato 2005 and the modified index of agreement ioa calzolari and ungaro 2012 the root mean square standardized error rmsse compares the error variance with a theoretical variance such as kriging variance therefore it should be close to unity if the rmsse is greater than one the prediction variability is underestimated by the kriging variance whereas if rmsse is less than one the variability is overestimated in this work we apply a complex spatiotemporal trend model and a simulation approach to capture the overall uncertainty considering the space time kriging parameters involved as well therefore we assess the rmsse for the calculated residuals 9 ε rmss 1 n i 1 n z s i z s i σ s i 2 where z s i is the estimated head at point s i z s i is the observed head and σ 2 s i is the kriging variance on the other hand the modified index of agreement ioa ranges between 0 and 1 is a standardized measure of the mean error and expresses the agreement directly the optimal value is 1 calzolari and ungaro 2012 10 io a 1 i 1 n z s i z s i i 1 n z s i i z s i z s i z s i where z s i denotes the average of the observed data 2 2 results and discussion following the proposed spatiotemporal trend analysis and the space time variogram of the residuals were applied the optimal ewma coefficient was determined w 0 71 from the temporal trend fitting process the experimental variogram fitting to the proposed product sum spatiotemporal model and the associated parameters are presented in fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity directional ratio for the study area was based on the available hydrogeological information that decreases in the vertical direction by an order of magnitude compared to the horizontal direction kz 0 000057 m s and kx y 0 00057 m s next a validation process was applied using strk to identify the efficiency of the estimations the validation results in terms of the absolute error ae and absolute relative error are are presented in table 1 fig 2 presents the fitting of the theoretical modified spartan space time variogram model to the corresponding experimental variogram and the respective variogram parameters the average spatiotemporal hydraulic gradient was calculated equal to dh dl 0 08 m the nugget term was considered to improve the experimental variogram fit the validation results of the latter approach are also presented in table 1 the first four columns present the groundwater level estimation error for the wet and dry period of hydrological year 2014 2015 using strk and the product sum variogram while the last four columns represent the corresponding error using strk and the spartan type variogram both approaches involve the application of the manhattan distance metric neither of the variograms has an actual correlation length since their fit is only asymptotic to the sill in these cases it is common to refer to the effective range i e the lag distance at which the variogram value is 95 of the sill the space time variogram parameters provide useful information for the dataset sampling and the aquifer physical characteristics the variance parameters denote the variance of the variable studied and the sill or approximated sill of the theoretical model the sill of both variograms is similar denoting consistency in absolute units around 6 5 m meaning that the spatiotemporal groundwater level variations at the aquifer indicate medium scale fluctuations from the mean value that depend on the extensive aquifer pumping both variograms exhibit a nugget effect that signifies measurement errors or spatiotemporal variations at smaller scale than the sampling interval or both in this work the nugget effect depends on the scarce available dataset 10 spatial monitoring locations in bi annual scale that cannot capture small scale variations spatially and temporarily the correlation length effective range parameter for both variogram types denote long spatial dependences due to the aquifer hydrogeological homogeneity but small scale temporal dependences due to the unregulated pumping that occur over time in the aquifer finally the other calculated variogram parameters as explained in the methodology section are shape coefficients that help the variogram fitting procedure spatial and temporal trends were significant in the available dataset before detrending the experimental variogram was characterized by important fluctuations while after detrending residuals delivered a smoother experimental variogram that can partially reach a sill both detrending methods were consistent as they provided residuals that deliver variograms of similar shape for the produced realizations of the simulation procedure in addition both strk models assessed in this work were consistent as they produced similar patterns of groundwater level spatial distribution in the study aquifer as it is shown in tables 1 and 2 strk provides a very good agreement with the reported values to be improved by 18 on average in terms of absolute error compared to the previous methodology involving the product sum variogram in addition strk estimates are improved by 22 when the modified spartan model is applied as well as the manhattan distance compared to the euclidean and by 40 compared to stok using the original spartan variogram and the euclidean distance metric in this work the manhattan distance metric applies better compared to the euclidean distance in connecting locations due to the presence of faults in the study aquifer fig 1 that can be bypassed because of the grid path that it follows on the other hand rmsse estimate for the optimal approach is equal to 0 94 thus close to 1 00 implying that strk with the modified spartan variogram and the manhattan distance metric deliver reliable estimates with kriging variance representative of prediction uncertainty the approach that involves the product sum variogram delivers an rmsse equal to 0 88 providing also reliable results the ioa for the strk using the modified spartan variogram is equal to 0 91 while using the product sum function equal to 0 80 both ioa values denote estimations of significant accuracy but with the first model approach to prevail finally interpolation maps were derived using the bayesian strk type therefore aquifer level maps for the 2014 2015 hydrological year were then derived using the modified spartan spatiotemporal variogram structure and the manhattan distance metric the maps presented the aquifer level variations during the wet and dry period accompanied by the estimated uncertainty figs 3 and 4 to construct the maps produced by the geostatistical analysis the estimates are kept within the interpolation area the 2d plots are accompanied by additional plots figs 5 and 6 showing two cross sections of the study aquifer the additional plots include the aquifer level distribution during the wet and dry period in the study area as well as hydrogeological and topographic information that help the results to be better interpreted the wells with the lower and higher uncertainty bounds are presented in the attached cross sections highlighting that the lower estimation uncertainty was met at wells close to the measurements core and higher in those further away another indicator to assess the reliability of the optimal method is the posterior distribution of the parameters involved the posterior distribution of the most important parameters of the space time trend model and of simulated variograms are presented in fig 7 the posterior parameters distribution is close to normal fact that strengthens the methodology and results validity and reliability a classical leave one out cross validation procedure olea 1999 was also applied to test the estimation capability of the proposed method using the entire dataset this time strk using the modified spartan variogram and the manhattan distance metric displayed estimates of significant accuracy as the absolute average error was equal to 1 81 m and the mean absolute relative error 0 09 on the other hand strk using the product sum variogram and the manhattan distance metric also delivered results of significant accuracy with an absolute average error equal to 2 51 m and a mean absolute relative error of 0 11 stok provided an absolute average error equal to 3 71 m and a mean absolute relative error of 0 15 the observed values vary spatially form east to west the hydraulic gradient might be small but the model must predict values in the range of 65 m to 18 m at temporal scale the fluctuations may vary from 2 m to 6 5 m seasonally and from 0 5 m to 3 m annually therefore the proposed model has the ability to provide estimates of significant accuracy and consistency at ungauged locations the proposed model is expected to provide reliable estimates considering its estimation capability the space time kriging variance of the residuals shows the expected spatial distribution of uncertainty at ungauged locations away from the measurements locations the uncertainty increases and becomes highest at the boundaries of the area where there are no measurements fig 8 presents the average standard deviation of estimated residuals for all time steps using the proposed strk model the estimated kriging standard deviation range is low due to the precise theoretical space time variogram fit to the experimental one which declares accurate parameters estimation however for strk applications that involve complex trend functions the full uncertainty estimation should involve a simulation approach the groundwater spatial variability estimation in an aquifer using a scarce dataset as herein influences the presence of high estimation error and uncertainty however the application of an appropriate trend approximation technique and of a spatiotemporal dependence function can reduce the estimations error and uncertainty nevertheless in such cases the space time kriging variance is not appropriate to express the uncertainty of estimations as the spatiotemporal uncertainty depends also on the effect of the spatiotemporal trend model parameters that are involved this work does not employ a standard space time regression kriging method with known standard predictors e g elevation and or coordinates to calculate the space time regression kriging variance hengl et al 2007 it applies space time residual kriging where the auxiliary information is obtained through equations that express the groundwater process in space and time and involve several parameters that contain uncertainty thus in such cases simulations figs 3 and 4 apply to quantify the uncertainty of estimations bierkens et al 2001 pilz and spöck 2008 within specific quantiles that determine the estimations uncertainty bounds apart from the exponential moving average model weight parameter and the space time variogram parameters a number of variables are involved for the calculation of the spatial trend the radius of influence is determined from the drawdown at each well which is calculated as the average annual drawdown the last 34 years while hydraulic conductivity due to the homogeneous aquifer receives a specific characteristic value the proposed model has a reduced estimation error compared to the other models tested table 2 and estimations uncertainty that consider the uncertainty of all the involved space time model parameters however the estimations uncertainty is lower compared to stok by 22 implying that the estimated fluctuations were more stable as expected and were modeled effectively by the spatiotemporal variogram function in addition this implies that the assigned variable values were reliable and characteristic for the case study the range of spatiotemporal variability of the estimated uncertainty is low for estimation points close to measurement points and inside the radius of influence of wells that have a drawdown close to the estimated average its extent depends more on the trend model parameters and variables and less on the variogram parameters because the estimated residuals provide a stable experimental variogram that fits efficiently to the theoretical model the scope of this work was to employ two new tools of physical background in the variogram calculation of the available data and to test their efficiency for modeling the spatiotemporal response of the groundwater level variations in an aquifer the proposed tools delivered excellent variogram fits with very accurate estimates however for the most accurate approach that involved the modified spartan variogram the spatial and temporal correlation lengths effective ranges were calculated approximately equal to 3 km and 12 months respectively the temporal range denotes that the spatiotemporal prediction considers measurements of both wet and dry hydrological periods therefore according to rouhani and myers 1990 the model is capable to provide consistent estimates during dry and wet periods in rouhani and myers 1990 is stated that if only data from a dry period are used the space time kriging estimates in wet period would not be reliable and vice versa in addition if a correlation length in time considers only dry or wet period observations then estimates are only reliable for the specific period type the available dataset is at bi annual scale wet dry period for 34 years therefore a temporal correlation length of 12 months is short compared to the length of the time series furthermore a 12 month correlation length expresses a temporal variability within one year as it considers wet and dry period observations moreover it means that temporal observations within one year are correlated to each other a large number of unregistered wells are operating in the study area depending on how wet dry a year is and on the availability of surface waters pumping rates may increase decrease compared to the registered wells the aquifer recharge depending on the hydrological year type wet or dry does not replenish regularly the aquifer therefore the aquifer groundwater level does not remain stable during the monitoring period to provide long temporal dependencies it fluctuates with a decreasing trend the groundwater level of the aquifer varies at annual scale due to the unregulated pumping of the unregistered wells the groundwater level is mostly closer to the previous timestep value of 12 months range either for wet or for dry period exactly as determined by the correlation length thus short temporal groundwater level dependencies occur in the aquifer figs 3 and 4 present the spatial variability of the estimated groundwater level based on the space time correlations of the data that consider the dynamic aquifer behavior the manhattan distance metric provides improved predictions this may result from the physical characteristics of the aquifer manhattan distance metric compared to the euclidean distance has the ability to estimate the distance between two points accordingly to the axes orientation thus in the case of a geological discontinuity exists e g a karstic or fracture intervention the manhattan function is the appropriate metric to calculate the distance between two points however it is worth mentioning that the aforementioned approach is not necessarily the appropriate for each data set but it depends on the characteristics of the system under study and on the scope of each study the proposed scaling factors of physical background provide more stable theoretical variograms with an excellent fit to the experimental variogram leading to optimal parameter calculation for the prediction process with strk therefore the proposed variograms are flexible new models for the estimation of the interdependence of groundwater level space time data in addition strk by using the modified variogram structure provided accurate results in comparison to the classic stok the involvement of a physical law in the trend function that supports the secondary information improves the interpolation accuracy finally it was clearly identified that the contribution of the bayesian bootstrap idea was significant for the assessment of the spatiotemporal model parameter uncertainty and for the aquifer level estimates 3 conclusions the understanding of the hydraulic head spatiotemporal variability derived from reliable estimation processes is vital to the water resources management this work presented the space time geostatistical analysis framework and examined the spatiotemporal modeling of groundwater level in a sub surface aquifer where the groundwater resources have been significantly depleted the past 35 years two modified space time variogram functions were presented and successfully tested in this work involving terms such as the hydraulic conductivity directional ratio and the hydraulic gradient with an objective to model the space time dependence of the groundwater level variations the optimal spatiotemporal approach employed the application of the spartan variogram function involving the term of hydraulic gradient to approximate the scale parameter of the space time variogram this spatiotemporal structure models closely the experimental space time variogram of the groundwater level residuals after effective detrending capturing the space time correlations of the available data both variogram models provided long spatial dependencies explained by the aquifer homogeneity while short temporal dependencies exist due to the aquifer level variations through the years strk joint by the proper spatiotemporal trend model distance metric and interdependence functions establish a reliable and flexible approach for the stochastic modeling of sparse groundwater level data the proposed methodology employed a new space time trend model which approximates both the temporal and spatial trends even though this idea it is not new the description of the temporal trend by an exponentially weighted moving average filter and the involvement of a groundwater flow physical law in the spatial term are applied for the first time the trend function reduces efficiently the measurement trend leading to a smooth space time variogram structure while affects more than the geostatstical method the estimations uncertainty due to a sufficient number of parameters and variables involved the strk estimates presented accurately the groundwater level variability delivering accurate cross validation and prediction results while provided the spatial distribution of the aquifer level at ungauged locations for the wet and dry period of the year 2014 2015 the examined approach accompanied by the bayesian bootstrap idea provides estimations of improved uncertainty and establishes a useful assessment tool of aquifer level spatiotemporal variation for spatiotemporal aquifer level modeling in the absence of detailed hydrogeological data the proposed methodology was applied and tested under the specific aquifer properties characteristics and available data the

6359,the joint spatiotemporal modeling of aquifer level fluctuations provides a significant tool in the prediction of groundwater levels at unvisited locations two types of variogram functions appropriately modified to incorporate physical information are presented and compared under space time residual kriging methodology using the bayesian bootstrap idea to quantify uncertainty the spatiotemporal trend is approximated using a component of physical meaning a recently developed spartan type non separable variogram function employs tools of physical meaning to enhance the

models herein the efficiency of the proposed tools is tested using groundwater level data from an alluvial unconfined aquifer both functions provide improved results compared to those of the space time ordinary kriging between the two the non separable one has the most efficient performance keywords non separable variogram space time kriging groundwater manhattan distance bayesian bootstrap idea non euclidean distance 1 introduction spatiotemporal geostatistics is a significant tool for groundwater level modeling and resources management a common field where geostatistics is applied is the one of hydrology e g to model the spatial temporal variability of aquifer level as a random field successful groundwater flow modelling using physically based models and numerical techniques requires detailed information on the spatial variation of the aquifer variables input and boundary conditions on the other hand statistical stochastic approaches like geostatistics are suitable to determine the groundwater level space time variations at scarce and sparse monitored areas kitanidis 1997 estimation of groundwater levels at grid points using measurements at random points is necessary to apply groundwater simulation models in most geohydrological studies the initial data are in the form of scattered data a basic task is to use these values in order to provide the spatial variability of the variable under study rouhani 1986 kriging and other forms of regularization can be useful in many circumstances in developing ground water models map water table which is basic for regional hydrogeological investigations identification of groundwater flow direction and zones of recharge or discharge desbarats et al 2002 hill 2006 varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 groundwater flow models often needs to be defined using limited data or after extensive calibration uncertainties still exist on the other hand kriging techniques does not guarantee consistency with the physics of groundwater flow but can reliably represent the hydraulic head fields rivest et al 2008 due to scarcity of information about the hydrogeological system boundary conditions and hydrogeological detailed data or gaps in groundwater level spatial and temporal measurements geostatistical models in spatial or spatiotemporal context are extensively applied to represent the hydraulic head field variations e g baú and mayer 2006 bierkens et al 2001 kumar 2007 lyon et al 2006 razavi et al 2012 ruybal et al 2019 theodossiou and latinopoulos 2006 tonkin and larson 2002 varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 there are also works regarding groundwater levels or groundwater contamination where the results of kriging techniques were successfully compared with the results of numerical models and apply as surrogates an et al 2015 asher et al 2015 baú and mayer 2006 ma et al 1999 pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 zhao et al 2016 generally geostatistical modelling can aid a physically based modelling approach e g providing the initial conditions of groundwater level distribution or to provide a reliable representation of groundwater levels space time variations based on available data the implementation of geostatistical methods is based on the calculation of data spatial and or temporal dependence the geostatistical analysis of space time dependent data has initially been performed applying separable covariance functions involving the combination of discrete spatial and temporal variogram models cressie 1993 dimitrakopoulos and luo 1994 rodriguez iturbe and mejia 1974 rouhani and myers 1990 on the other hand the non separable covariance functions developed the last two decades often include components with physical meaning dynamic rules or differential equations employed in these functions help to improve prediction accuracy christakos 2000 christakos and hristopulos 1998 gneiting 2002 kolovos et al 2004 porcu et al 2006 up to now spatiotemporal covariance functions for groundwater level applications have not been established however spatiotemporal covariance functions based on physical ground have been developed and are mostly applied in atmospheric pollution and synthetic data such research has been presented in the past i e the cressie huang functions cressie and huang 1999 gneiting s non separable models gneiting 2002 a series of non separable models based on physical laws and dynamic rules in kolovos et al 2004 and the non separable functions that replace the covariance with a spectral density function porcu et al 2008 previous research on geostatistical analysis of scarce groundwater level datasets has shown that the approximation of a spatial trend using secondary information e g topographic and geomorphologic features improves the predictions of groundwater level e g desbarats et al 2002 varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 therefore the introduction of a spatiotemporal trend model for space time geostatistical analysis of groundwater level would be an interesting approach to improve spatiotemporal predictions the incorporation of temporal trend in terms of an exponentially weighted moving average filter and the spatial trend in terms of a groundwater flow equation resulted in the spatiotemporal trend applied in the present work the estimated trend and the residual component are combined in terms of space time residual kriging strk methodology while the investigation of the spatiotemporal trend variance is also important due to its complexity to estimate the variance associated with the trend three components were considered the predictors at the prediction point the variance of the temporal trend function and the variance resulted from the groundwater flow equation the variance terms are necessary to be determined for the accurate strk estimations and the overall variance calculation for this reason a bayesian kriging type under the bootstrap idea called empirical bayesian kriging pilz and spöck 2008 was applied to capture the range of the spatiotemporal model uncertainty in terms of the parameters involved and the estimated covariance function given a time series at specific spatial points and considering the time as an extra dimension the spatiotemporal geostatistical analysis aims to model multiple time series of data performing interpolation and prediction the interpolation accuracy is tested using leave one out cross validation while predictions assessment applies validating measurements on the examined temporal scale i e wet and dry periods of a hydrological year in a time forward mode the latter means that the spatiotemporal process prediction occur time forward according to the determined properties that are defined by the space time variogram space time kriging can be applied for interpolation purposes heuvelink and griffith 2010 júnez ferreira and herrera 2013 ruybal et al 2019 snepvangers et al 2003 but also in the form of time forward kriging using proximities such as the variogram or covariance parameters i e correlation length to forecast the spatio temporal process christakos 2000 measurements usually are regularly taken on the time domain compared to the spatial domain hence estimation is most often in time extrapolation mode kyriakidis and journel 1999 space time kriging is one of those methodologies that can be applied for extrapolation prediction gneiting et al 2007 kyriakidis and journel 1999 rouhani and myers 1990 extrapolation prediction assumes that the calculated variogram properties applies outside the space time range of data specifically consider a purely spatial random field with stationary covariance function and suppose that the entire field moves time forward the resulting spatio temporal random field has stationary covariance with correlation lengths that indicates the spatial and temporal correlation distance of the measurements and therefore the reliable prediction time window gneiting et al 2007 many works have applied successfully space time kriging for prediction time forward prediction purposes at different spatial locations of variable datasets e g groundwater level

correlated trend and a residual s trf factor z s t modeling space time variations around that trend christakos 1991 kyriakidis and journel 1999 the first goal of this work was the development of a reliable geostatistical model to represent the space time variations of groundwater levels at the study aquifer the second goal of this study was to employ novel covariance functions for groundwater level applications and to test its efficiency on spatiotemporal analysis finally the third goal was the calculation of spatiotemporal uncertainty that has not been approached before with a methodology based on classical bayesian analysis regarding the novelty of this work it presents and asses two modified space time variogram types using novel terms of physical meaning to model the space time data dependence of groundwater level measurements the first is a scale factor of hydraulic conductivity directional ratio and the second the hydraulic gradient moreover it involves and tests the application of a non euclidean distance metric in the space time geostatistical process the procedure of defining the estimations uncertainty is also new as a bayesian kriging type approach using detrending and the bootstrap idea is applied for the first time in joint space time data finally a combination of an exponentially weighted moving average filter with the thiem s law that define the groundwater flow under pumping of multiple wells to approximate the temporal groundwater level trend and to describe the corresponding spatial trend is employed for the first time 2 spatiotemporal modelling theory and application the field application of the present work is related to mires basin in the messara watershed which is located on the island of crete greece fig 1 the basin mainly consists of quaternary alluvial sediments which form an inter bedded sequence of gravels gravely sands sands silts silty sands and clays in its greatest extend the aquifer is homogeneous with only very small inconsistencies that exist in every aquifer a small number of faults four exist at the center of the aquifer that may affect locally the groundwater flow the hydraulic conductivity values are of the same magnitude 10 4 m s in the entire aquifer it varies thought from 0 0009 m s in the east to 0 00021 m s in the west the basin s aquifer is characterized in the hydro geological reports as unconfined the mean annual rainfall in the basin is around 650 mm and the basin altitude is less than 300 m about 65 of rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration and 10 as runoff to the sea leaving only 25 to recharge the aquifer the land use in the area comprise mainly of olive trees vines fruit trees and vegetable cultivations mostly open field and some greenhouses varouchakis 2016 only 10 wells were regularly monitored between years 1981 and 2015 while groundwater level measurements were only taken bi annually wet dry period special water secretariat of greece 2015 thus the available data file consists of 680 values 34 bi annual measurements implying 68 values at 10 monitoring stations distributed in a matrix of 68 rows and 10 columns the monitoring wells are unevenly distributed and mostly concentrated along geropotamos river that crosses the basin due to the overexploitation of the aquifer and the expeditious increase of drip irrigation the water table has been declined almost 35 m since 1981 causing great shortage of the water resources in the area the application of spatiotemporal geostatistics exploits the spatially short groundwater level dataset to determine the spatiotemporal variability of the aquifer and detect possible space time interdependencies useful for interpolation and extrapolation predictions spatiotemporal geostatistical analysis considers the following steps 1 approximation of spatiotemporal trend 2 space time variogram calculation 3 application of space time kriging and 4 evaluation of the proposed methodology reliability by applying leave one out cross validation of the monitored data values prediction at omitted onward time steps for validation purposes and calculation of estimations uncertainty i e space time kriging variance and or simulations in this work the latter applied using a simulations technique in terms of space time empirical bayesian kriging space time ordinary kriging stok and strk are reliable methods for space time estimation christakos et al 2001 de cesare et al 2001 varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 nevertheless the simultaneous solution of kriging equations to calculate the spatial and temporal weights of the system becomes complicated skøien and blöschl 2007 thus special attention is needed to ensure the validity and suitability of the chosen spatiotemporal dependence model therefore first the experimental spatiotemporal variogram is determined jointly in space and time according to the space time classical moment estimator γ z r τ 1 2 n r τ i 1 n j 1 n z s i t i z s j t j 2 where γ z r τ denotes the space time variogram r is the space lag and τ is the time lag then separable and non separable space time variogram functions are fitted to the experimental space time variogram using the least squares sum method to obtain the optimal theoretical variogram fit that will provide the space time dependence parameters 2 1 geostatistical tools the first step of a geostatistical analysis is to split the random function into two subcomponents trend and fluctuations the spatiotemporal trend considers separately the spatial and temporal trend under a product function the product of the two trend types is inspired by the product covariance function that considers the multiplication of a purely spatial function and a purely temporal function to express the spatiotemporal data dependence however kyriakidis and journel 1999 have proposed a similar approach for the decomposition of trend and residuals of a random field an exponentially weighted moving average filter ewma was applied on the mean bi annual groundwater level field data to remove the average temporal trend of the groundwater level in the aquifer pham 2006 varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 the general form of ewma model that is convenient in minimizing computations is applied in this work m z t i w z t i 1 w m z t i 1 with initial condition m z t 1 z t 1 where m z is the temporal trend z t i is the average groundwater level of the wells at the time t i and 0 w 1 is a constant weight determined by the data the latter is a constant that determines how fast the exponential weights decline over the past

older data by increasing the weight exponent during the smoothing process holt 2004 pham 2006 the spatial trend approximation is based on thiem s equation that describes the groundwater flow when pumping in the aquifer is on varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 the form of the equation for an unconfined aquifer when multiple wells operate is given below bear 1979 todd 1959 1 h 2 s h 0 2 s 1 π k i 1 n q i ln r i r i r i r i i 1 n where h s and h0 s denote the estimated and initial groundwater levels at the point s respectively k stands for hydraulic conductivity r i describes the distance between the prediction location and the contributing well i n is the set of contributing wells q expresses the pumping rate and sri is the well s radius of influence in terms of an empirical equation

saturation thickness due to lack of information uniform values were used for the variables sw i and k an assumption was considered about sw i due to different values that receives during the wet and dry period the different pumping rates that occur during each season and the deviations from the agreed pumping rates according to the local authorities led to determine an average sw i that corresponds to the mean annual drawdown of the aquifer level at each well thus it was determined from a linear regression analysis of the mean annual groundwater level variations during a 34 years period at each well the k value on the other hand was determined from a recent work that updated the hydraulic conductivity at the study area due to changes in the saturation thickness the alluvial background of the aquifer provides k values of the same magnitude the assigned values of k were spatially averaged from values obtained at different monitoring locations of the aquifer the pumping rates were available as the 10 wells monitored in the area are registered in the national network with specified permitted pumping rates special water secretariat of greece 2015 varouchakis 2016 thiem s formulation meets in this work the application assumptions todd 1959 bear 1979 the study aquifer is homogeneous as it consists of quaternary alluvial deposits it has a hydraulic gradient from east to west equal to 0 004 65 18 m 12000 m denoting that prior to pumping conditions the aquifer level is almost horizontal and equilibrium or steady state flow conditions have reached as the entire pumped water is yielded from external sources beyond the radius of influence i e the radii of influence of the pumping wells are under 500 m much less than the aquifer extend which is around 12 000 m in addition the study aquifer receives inflows from the east and outflows to the west thiem s equation is applied to approximate the spatial trend of the aquifer level separately at each timestep wet and dry hydrological periods the trend removal supports a more stable space time variogram estimation that helps strk to deliver results of improved accuracy steady state or equilibrium flow conditions apply at spatial scale within each specific timestep along with the other thiem equation application assumptions reported previously the product of the spatial trend that follows the thiem s law and the temporal trend that was calculated at every time step was divided by a reference spatial trend component to provide the spatiotemporal trend variation the latter is applied to keep the units in meters the residuals calculated at every well at a specific time step were obtained as a result of the subtraction between the groundwater level and the spatiotemporal trend groundwater level is part of the aquifer s saturation zone and describes the water table variation hydraulic conductivity is an important parameter that determines both groundwater flow and head in the saturation zone according to the basic groundwater flow equation expressed by the darcy law bear 1979 it is an anisotropic parameter that usually varies significantly in the vertical direction therefore the average hydraulic conductivity directional ratio can be applied as a scale factor of the theoretical variogram model to control the fitting to the experimental variogram the presence of outliers in datasets or of long spatiotemporal dependencies affect the range of the experimental variogram fluctuations and sill s location if any thus the application of a scaling factor that has a physical meaning and directly affects groundwater level variations provides a consistent variogram fit that provides reliable parameters a uniform hydraulic conductivity directional ratio was applied as the aquifer porous media was characterized homogeneous by the hydrogeological studies conducted in the area the application of such a scale factor was inspired by a similar application of a global anisotropy ratio acting as a scale factor involving the vertical to horizontal hydraulic conductivity ratio to model the spatial variability of transmissivity chiles and delfiner 1999 according to a hydrogeological literature review the hydraulic conductivity follows the lognormal distribution with an exponential covariance desbarats 1992 similarly the hydraulic head covariance of a simplified linear reservoir model appears to decrease with time and approaches the typical exponential covariance as time increases zhang and li 2005 on the other hand at a local scale the hydraulic head is spatially interpreted by a differentiable function such as the basic groundwater flow equation thus a differentiable covariance function such as the gaussian which is applicable and efficient in determining the spatial dependence of variations in small spatial resolutions is considered to model the spatial dependence of the water table variations theodoridou et al 2017 therefore considering the previous research findings and facts in the present work a gaussian and an exponential variogram were applied the first to describe the spatial dependence of the groundwater level residuals and the second the temporal the experimental space time variogram of the residuals was first calculated and then modelled with a theoretical spatiotemporal variogram function herein the product sum spatiotemporal variogram was applied by means of the gaussian and the exponential variogram functions 3 γ z s r k z k x y σ z s 2 1 exp r s ξ s 2 4 γ z t r t k z k x y σ z t 2 1 exp r t ξ t where σ is the variance ξ is the correlation length in space s and time t r is the lag vector in space and time and the k fraction is the hydraulic conductivity directional ratio the product sum variogram combines the use of separate spatial and temporal variograms under a non separable function the product sum space time variogram de cesare et al 2001 model is inspired from the separate product and sum models it is defined as 5 c st r s r t k 1 c s r s c t r t k 2 c s r s k 3 c t r t cs ct are purely spatial and temporal covariance models with k 1 0 k 2 0 k 3 0 in terms of the variogram the above equation is expressed as 6 γ st r s r t k 1 c s 0 k 3 γ t r t k 1 c t 0 k 2 γ s r s k 1 γ s r s γ t r t where γ s γ t are purely spatial and temporal variogram models on the other hand spartan covariance and variogram functions that were introduced by hristopulos 2003 and have been implemented to miscellaneous environmental data sets elogne et al 2008 elogne and hristopulos 2008 hristopulos 2003 hristopulos and elogne 2009 varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 were also applied in this work herein this family of functions is modified appropriately to model hydro geological data the spartan covariance functions in d 3 dimensions are expressed as follows 7 c z h η 0 e h β 2 2 π η 1 2 4 sin h β 1 h β 1 for η 1 2 σ z 2 η 0 2 π η 1 2 4 η 0 e h 8 π for η 1 2 σ z 2 η 0 8 π η 0 e h ω 1 e h ω 2 4 π ω 2 ω 1 h η 1 2 4 for η 1 2 σ z 2 η 0 4 π η 1 2 4 where η 0 is the scale factor η 1 is the rigidity coefficient β 1 2 η 1 1 2 2 is a dimensionless wavenumber β 2 2 η 1 1 2 2 and ω 1 2 η 1 δ 2 1 2 δ η 1 2 4 1 2 ξ stands for the correlation length h r ξ is the normalized lag vector h h is the separation distance norm while σ z 2 is the variance equation 7 can be also allied in two dimensions christakos 1991 in case of η 1 2 the covariance is expressed by the exponential model while for less than 2 η 1 by the combination of the exponential and hole effect the respective stationary variogram model is then given by γ st r s r t σ z 2 c z h the spatiotemporal spartan function constitutes a new approach in the interdependence modeling of spatiotemporal data varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 it forms a non separable model which is derived by substituting h with the following equation in its spatial form of eq 7 h h r 2 α h τ 2 h r r ξ r h τ τ ξ τ where τ is the time step lag and α denotes a relative weight of the time lag with respect to the spatial lag the scale factor η 0 that partly defines the variance of the variogram is expressed in terms of the average spatiotemporal hydraulic gradient η 0 dh d l of the space time groundwater level dataset the latter is applied to obtain a physical parameter in the function that determines the highest value sill of the measurement variable in terms of different spatial and temporal separation distances a similar approach is common in developing covariance structures of physical meaning by including a parameter that affects the spatial or temporal behavior of the measured variable kolovos et al 2004 both variograms developed in this work are valid variogram functions as they satisfy the conditions of bochner s theorem i e the fourier transform exist and is non negative de cesare et al 2001 varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 the spatiotemporal process is anisotropic because of the time dimension enclosure the product sum space time variogram was applied likewise to other works of similar topic using isotropic variograms for space and time correlations de iaco 2010 raja et al 2017 tadić et al 2017 however the application of separate variogram models for space and time that have a different sill under the same space time joint function means the incorporation of zonal anisotropy hoogland et al 2010 geometric anisotropy on the other hand can be comprised when a common term of correlation length applies in a variogram function then it is appropriately modified using an anisotropic ratio parameter to approximate the difference of the spatial to temporal scale hoogland et al 2010 which in our case it was possible to be only applied for the spartan type thus it was applied modifying the correlation length in equation 7 another new approach in the modeling of spatiotemporal data is the application of non euclidean distance metrics in the present study the manhattan metric described by eq 8 is applied to examine the effect of distance calculation on the data interdependence modelling and the prediction results 8 manhattan d 1 x i x j y i y j where the cartesian coordinates of the ith and jth monitoring points wells are expressed by xi yi xj yj i j 1 n in the area of study and n is the number of wells in case of grid path data the application of manhattan distance provides better results due to its concentric rhombus structure compared to euclidean distance whose formula describes a concentric circle due to this special feature the aforementioned distance has the ability to bypass spatial hydrogeological discontinuities between the measurements theodoridou et al 2017 then strk is applied to combine both the residuals and the trend interpolation while the empirical bayesian bootstrap method pilz and spöck 2008 was applied to determine the overall uncertainty of estimations this stochastic modelling approach is based on the monte carlo simulation approach and produces multiple realizations rank the prediction results with respect to specified criteria and captures the range of the uncertainty the process considers the following steps unconditional simulation of the field space time fluctuations at the monitoring locations using the estimated model statistics and superposition with estimated trend the unconditional simulation process replicates the data mean variance and variogram on average estimation of the spatial and temporal groundwater level trend for the simulated realization and of the associated parameters using the same trend model structure estimation of the empirical space time residuals variogram and model fitting iteration of the above steps e g 1 000 times leads to the posterior distribution of the space time model parameters empirical bayesian bootstrap idea for each realization strk was performed to estimate the head at the nodes of a 100 100 grid for a specified time step of the study period herein bi annually leading to the predictive distribution at each grid point the mean cdf cumulative distribution function as well as the 5 and 95 cdf quantiles were calculated using bayes theory one can acquire a posteriori distribution of parameters using the prior distribution and the initial values of the parameters in bayesian kriging the posterior distribution of the parameters involved trend model and variogram is specified by means of simulations which corresponds to their uncertainty in order to implement bayesian kriging method first the appropriate space time variogram model of the fluctuations is determined after fitted to the experimental one the fluctuations were obtained by removing the spatiotemporal trend from the initial dataset using the parameters derived and the variogram function the covariance matrix is constructed then uniform random numbers generation is applied see appendix a these correlated random values have the same statistical characteristics with the initial observations dataset besides the random values represent a new realization that first undergoes detrending then the variogram of the fluctuations is calculated and finally strk is applied to estimate values at unknown locations this procedure is performed iteratively as described at the steps previously presented therefore aquifer level and prediction uncertainty maps can be developed to present the groundwater level distribution based on the spatiotemporal interdependence of the available data to determine the spatiotemporal variability of mires aquifer s groundwater level since 1981 and to use the data correlations to undertake predictions a spatiotemporal geostatistical analysis based on the aforementioned tools was performed two validation methods were applied to test the spatiotemporal model capabilities first the spatiotemporal experimental variogram was calculated using bi annual groundwater level data from the ten sampling locations for the period 1981 2014 validation of the estimates was performed using bi annual data of the wet and dry periods for the year 2014 2015 the available dataset consists of bi annual measurements from 1981 to 2015 a spatiotemporal variogram needs a sufficient time period and number of data in order to effectively represent the interdependence of the available measurements and to capture the data variability usually in spatiotemporal analysis the predictive capability of the model is tested sakizadeh et al 2019 tapoglou et al 2014 varouchakis 2017 varouchakis and hristopulos 2017 thus the spatiotemporal dependence of the dataset values was determined using the entire available data information apart from the last hydrological year in order to assess the prediction capability of the proposed model at the monitoring locations for the dry and wet period where measurements occur on the other hand the entire dataset was used with the proposed model via a leave one out cross validation to assess the estimation capability of the model at ungauged locations apart from the classical estimation metrics absolute error and absolute relative error two more metrics are applied to assess the efficiency of the proposed methodologies the root mean square standardized error rmsse diodato 2005 and the modified index of agreement ioa calzolari and ungaro 2012 the root mean square standardized error rmsse compares the error variance with a theoretical variance such as kriging variance therefore it should be close to unity if the rmsse is greater than one the prediction variability is underestimated by the kriging variance whereas if rmsse is less than one the variability is overestimated in this work we apply a complex spatiotemporal trend model and a simulation approach to capture the overall uncertainty considering the space time kriging parameters involved as well therefore we assess the rmsse for the calculated residuals 9 ε rmss 1 n i 1 n z s i z s i σ s i 2 where z s i is the estimated head at point s i z s i is the observed head and σ 2 s i is the kriging variance on the other hand the modified index of agreement ioa ranges between 0 and 1 is a standardized measure of the mean error and expresses the agreement directly the optimal value is 1 calzolari and ungaro 2012 10 io a 1 i 1 n z s i z s i i 1 n z s i i z s i z s i z s i where z s i denotes the average of the observed data 2 2 results and discussion following the proposed spatiotemporal trend analysis and the space time variogram of the residuals were applied the optimal ewma coefficient was determined w 0 71 from the temporal trend fitting process the experimental variogram fitting to the proposed product sum spatiotemporal model and the associated parameters are presented in fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity directional ratio for the study area was based on the available hydrogeological information that decreases in the vertical direction by an order of magnitude compared to the horizontal direction kz 0 000057 m s and kx y 0 00057 m s next a validation process was applied using strk to identify the efficiency of the estimations the validation results in terms of the absolute error ae and absolute relative error are are presented in table 1 fig 2 presents the fitting of the theoretical modified spartan space time variogram model to the corresponding experimental variogram and the respective variogram parameters the average spatiotemporal hydraulic gradient was calculated equal to dh dl 0 08 m the nugget term was considered to improve the experimental variogram fit the validation results of the latter approach are also presented in table 1 the first four columns present the groundwater level estimation error for the wet and dry period of hydrological year 2014 2015 using strk and the product sum variogram while the last four columns represent the corresponding error using strk and the spartan type variogram both approaches involve the application of the manhattan distance metric neither of the variograms has an actual correlation length since their fit is only asymptotic to the sill in these cases it is common to refer to the effective range i e the lag distance at which the variogram value is 95 of the sill the space time variogram parameters provide useful information for the dataset sampling and the aquifer physical characteristics the variance parameters denote the variance of the variable studied and the sill or approximated sill of the theoretical model the sill of both variograms is similar denoting consistency in absolute units around 6 5 m meaning that the spatiotemporal groundwater level variations at the aquifer indicate medium scale fluctuations from the mean value that depend on the extensive aquifer pumping both variograms exhibit a nugget effect that signifies measurement errors or spatiotemporal variations at smaller scale than the sampling interval or both in this work the nugget effect depends on the scarce available dataset 10 spatial monitoring locations in bi annual scale that cannot capture small scale variations spatially and temporarily the correlation length effective range parameter for both variogram types denote long spatial dependences due to the aquifer hydrogeological homogeneity but small scale temporal dependences due to the unregulated pumping that occur over time in the aquifer finally the other calculated variogram parameters as explained in the methodology section are shape coefficients that help the variogram fitting procedure spatial and temporal trends were significant in the available dataset before detrending the experimental variogram was characterized by important fluctuations while after detrending residuals delivered a smoother experimental variogram that can partially reach a sill both detrending methods were consistent as they provided residuals that deliver variograms of similar shape for the produced realizations of the simulation procedure in addition both strk models assessed in this work were consistent as they produced similar patterns of groundwater level spatial distribution in the study aquifer as it is shown in tables 1 and 2 strk provides a very good agreement with the reported values to be improved by 18 on average in terms of absolute error compared to the previous methodology involving the product sum variogram in addition strk estimates are improved by 22 when the modified spartan model is applied as well as the manhattan distance compared to the euclidean and by 40 compared to stok using the original spartan variogram and the euclidean distance metric in this work the manhattan distance metric applies better compared to the euclidean distance in connecting locations due to the presence of faults in the study aquifer fig 1 that can be bypassed because of the grid path that it follows on the other hand rmsse estimate for the optimal approach is equal to 0 94 thus close to 1 00 implying that strk with the modified spartan variogram and the manhattan distance metric deliver reliable estimates with kriging variance representative of prediction uncertainty the approach that involves the product sum variogram delivers an rmsse equal to 0 88 providing also reliable results the ioa for the strk using the modified spartan variogram is equal to 0 91 while using the product sum function equal to 0 80 both ioa values denote estimations of significant accuracy but with the first model approach to prevail finally interpolation maps were derived using the bayesian strk type therefore aquifer level maps for the 2014 2015 hydrological year were then derived using the modified spartan spatiotemporal variogram structure and the manhattan distance metric the maps presented the aquifer level variations during the wet and dry period accompanied by the estimated uncertainty figs 3 and 4 to construct the maps produced by the geostatistical analysis the estimates are kept within the interpolation area the 2d plots are accompanied by additional plots figs 5 and 6 showing two cross sections of the study aquifer the additional plots include the aquifer level distribution during the wet and dry period in the study area as well as hydrogeological and topographic information that help the results to be better interpreted the wells with the lower and higher uncertainty bounds are presented in the attached cross sections highlighting that the lower estimation uncertainty was met at wells close to the measurements core and higher in those further away another indicator to assess the reliability of the optimal method is the posterior distribution of the parameters involved the posterior distribution of the most important parameters of the space time trend model and of simulated variograms are presented in fig 7 the posterior parameters distribution is close to normal fact that strengthens the methodology and results validity and reliability a classical leave one out cross validation procedure olea 1999 was also applied to test the estimation capability of the proposed method using the entire dataset this time strk using the modified spartan variogram and the manhattan distance metric displayed estimates of significant accuracy as the absolute average error was equal to 1 81 m and the mean absolute relative error 0 09 on the other hand strk using the product sum variogram and the manhattan distance metric also delivered results of significant accuracy with an absolute average error equal to 2 51 m and a mean absolute relative error of 0 11 stok provided an absolute average error equal to 3 71 m and a mean absolute relative error of 0 15 the observed values vary spatially form east to west the hydraulic gradient might be small but the model must predict values in the range of 65 m to 18 m at temporal scale the fluctuations may vary from 2 m to 6 5 m seasonally and from 0 5 m to 3 m annually therefore the proposed model has the ability to provide estimates of significant accuracy and consistency at ungauged locations the proposed model is expected to provide reliable estimates considering its estimation capability the space time kriging variance of the residuals shows the expected spatial distribution of uncertainty at ungauged locations away from the measurements locations the uncertainty increases and becomes highest at the boundaries of the area where there are no measurements fig 8 presents the average standard deviation of estimated residuals for all time steps using the proposed strk model the estimated kriging standard deviation range is low due to the precise theoretical space time variogram fit to the experimental one which declares accurate parameters estimation however for strk applications that involve complex trend functions the full uncertainty estimation should involve a simulation approach the groundwater spatial variability estimation in an aquifer using a scarce dataset as herein influences the presence of high estimation error and uncertainty however the application of an appropriate trend approximation technique and of a spatiotemporal dependence function can reduce the estimations error and uncertainty nevertheless in such cases the space time kriging variance is not appropriate to express the uncertainty of estimations as the spatiotemporal uncertainty depends also on the effect of the spatiotemporal trend model parameters that are involved this work does not employ a standard space time regression kriging method with known standard predictors e g elevation and or coordinates to calculate the space time regression kriging variance hengl et al 2007 it applies space time residual kriging where the auxiliary information is obtained through equations that express the groundwater process in space and time and involve several parameters that contain uncertainty thus in such cases simulations figs 3 and 4 apply to quantify the uncertainty of estimations bierkens et al 2001 pilz and spöck 2008 within specific quantiles that determine the estimations uncertainty bounds apart from the exponential moving average model weight parameter and the space time variogram parameters a number of variables are involved for the calculation of the spatial trend the radius of influence is determined from the drawdown at each well which is calculated as the average annual drawdown the last 34 years while hydraulic conductivity due to the homogeneous aquifer receives a specific characteristic value the proposed model has a reduced estimation error compared to the other models tested table 2 and estimations uncertainty that consider the uncertainty of all the involved space time model parameters however the estimations uncertainty is lower compared to stok by 22 implying that the estimated fluctuations were more stable as expected and were modeled effectively by the spatiotemporal variogram function in addition this implies that the assigned variable values were reliable and characteristic for the case study the range of spatiotemporal variability of the estimated uncertainty is low for estimation points close to measurement points and inside the radius of influence of wells that have a drawdown close to the estimated average its extent depends more on the trend model parameters and variables and less on the variogram parameters because the estimated residuals provide a stable experimental variogram that fits efficiently to the theoretical model the scope of this work was to employ two new tools of physical background in the variogram calculation of the available data and to test their efficiency for modeling the spatiotemporal response of the groundwater level variations in an aquifer the proposed tools delivered excellent variogram fits with very accurate estimates however for the most accurate approach that involved the modified spartan variogram the spatial and temporal correlation lengths effective ranges were calculated approximately equal to 3 km and 12 months respectively the temporal range denotes that the spatiotemporal prediction considers measurements of both wet and dry hydrological periods therefore according to rouhani and myers 1990 the model is capable to provide consistent estimates during dry and wet periods in rouhani and myers 1990 is stated that if only data from a dry period are used the space time kriging estimates in wet period would not be reliable and vice versa in addition if a correlation length in time considers only dry or wet period observations then estimates are only reliable for the specific period type the available dataset is at bi annual scale wet dry period for 34 years therefore a temporal correlation length of 12 months is short compared to the length of the time series furthermore a 12 month correlation length expresses a temporal variability within one year as it considers wet and dry period observations moreover it means that temporal observations within one year are correlated to each other a large number of unregistered wells are operating in the study area depending on how wet dry a year is and on the availability of surface waters pumping rates may increase decrease compared to the registered wells the aquifer recharge depending on the hydrological year type wet or dry does not replenish regularly the aquifer therefore the aquifer groundwater level does not remain stable during the monitoring period to provide long temporal dependencies it fluctuates with a decreasing trend the groundwater level of the aquifer varies at annual scale due to the unregulated pumping of the unregistered wells the groundwater level is mostly closer to the previous timestep value of 12 months range either for wet or for dry period exactly as determined by the correlation length thus short temporal groundwater level dependencies occur in the aquifer figs 3 and 4 present the spatial variability of the estimated groundwater level based on the space time correlations of the data that consider the dynamic aquifer behavior the manhattan distance metric provides improved predictions this may result from the physical characteristics of the aquifer manhattan distance metric compared to the euclidean distance has the ability to estimate the distance between two points accordingly to the axes orientation thus in the case of a geological discontinuity exists e g a karstic or fracture intervention the manhattan function is the appropriate metric to calculate the distance between two points however it is worth mentioning that the aforementioned approach is not necessarily the appropriate for each data set but it depends on the characteristics of the system under study and on the scope of each study the proposed scaling factors of physical background provide more stable theoretical variograms with an excellent fit to the experimental variogram leading to optimal parameter calculation for the prediction process with strk therefore the proposed variograms are flexible new models for the estimation of the interdependence of groundwater level space time data in addition strk by using the modified variogram structure provided accurate results in comparison to the classic stok the involvement of a physical law in the trend function that supports the secondary information improves the interpolation accuracy finally it was clearly identified that the contribution of the bayesian bootstrap idea was significant for the assessment of the spatiotemporal model parameter uncertainty and for the aquifer level estimates 3 conclusions the understanding of the hydraulic head spatiotemporal variability derived from reliable estimation processes is vital to the water resources management this work presented the space time geostatistical analysis framework and examined the spatiotemporal modeling of groundwater level in a sub surface aquifer where the groundwater resources have been significantly depleted the past 35 years two modified space time variogram functions were presented and successfully tested in this work involving terms such as the hydraulic conductivity directional ratio and the hydraulic gradient with an objective to model the space time dependence of the groundwater level variations the optimal spatiotemporal approach employed the application of the spartan variogram function involving the term of hydraulic gradient to approximate the scale parameter of the space time variogram this spatiotemporal structure models closely the experimental space time variogram of the groundwater level residuals after effective detrending capturing the space time correlations of the available data both variogram models provided long spatial dependencies explained by the aquifer homogeneity while short temporal dependencies exist due to the aquifer level variations through the years strk joint by the proper spatiotemporal trend model distance metric and interdependence functions establish a reliable and flexible approach for the stochastic modeling of sparse groundwater level data the proposed methodology employed a new space time trend model which approximates both the temporal and spatial trends even though this idea it is not new the description of the temporal trend by an exponentially weighted moving average filter and the involvement of a groundwater flow physical law in the spatial term are applied for the first time the trend function reduces efficiently the measurement trend leading to a smooth space time variogram structure while affects more than the geostatstical method the estimations uncertainty due to a sufficient number of parameters and variables involved the strk estimates presented accurately the groundwater level variability delivering accurate cross validation and prediction results while provided the spatial distribution of the aquifer level at ungauged locations for the wet and dry period of the year 2014 2015 the examined approach accompanied by the bayesian bootstrap idea provides estimations of improved uncertainty and establishes a useful assessment tool of aquifer level spatiotemporal variation for spatiotemporal aquifer level modeling in the absence of detailed hydrogeological data the proposed methodology was applied and tested under the specific aquifer properties characteristics and available data the
