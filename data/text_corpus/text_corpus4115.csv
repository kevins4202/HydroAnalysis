20575,flexible pipes are critical elements for offshore oil and gas development and determining its response in axisymmetric loadings is of paramount importance often the anti birdcage tape layer is represented by a tubular structure with either isotropic or orthotropic material properties however it is recognized that a tubular structure cannot fully replicate the stiffness and strength and deformation mechanisms of helically wound tape layers this paper presents a mathematical model for the local analysis of unbonded flexible pipes subjected to axisymmetric loadings where three anti birdcage tape layer modeling strategies are presented including helical tape orthotropic and isotropic tubes this model is then verified against existing test data the deviations caused by the orthotropic and isotropic tube modeling strategies in different loading conditions are discussed this is followed by parametric studies on the effects of anti birdcage tape tensile stiffness laying angle and direction on the flexible pipe mechanical behaviors in tension axial rotation in both directions axial compression as well as birdcaging limit loads the importance of considering non uniform tensions in the filaments that constitute the tape is discussed keywords flexible pipes axisymmetric model anti birdcage tape layer birdcaging 1 introduction flexible pipes are tubular composite structures widely used in the offshore oil and gas floating production systems for transportation of hydrocarbons and production fluids fig 1 shows the cross section of a typical unbonded flexible pipe which consists of a number of layers with specific functions the steel made interlocked carcass and pressure armour resist most of the load in the radial direction respectively from external hydrostatic pressure and internal fluid crushing loads during installation and contracting forces from tensile armour wires in tension the tensile armour wires layers constituted by a number of helically wound steel wires with a quasi rectangular cross section carry most of the axial torsional loads the extruded polymeric fluid barrier prevents the bore fluid leakage the outer sheath avoids seawater ingress into the pipe annulus as well as protects the inner structures the helically wound polymeric anti friction tapes are applied to reduce the abrasion between metallic layers in dynamic applications while pressure and tensile loads are the principle loads carried by a flexible pipe in most of its service life large axial compression may also be encountered under certain scenarios due to the reversed end cap effect bectarte and coutarel 2004 and large dynamic motions in harsh weather garcía et al 2015 driven by axial compression the tensile armour wires tend to expand radially and the high strength tape layer is thus needed as the outer sheath stiffness is insufficient the high strength tape layer also known as the anti birdcage tape layer is a fabric composed of various yarns of aromatic polyamide pet polyethylene terephthalate or glass fibers in the warp and weft directions depending on its applications fig 2 shows an anti birdcage tape whose warp is made of kevlar yarns while the weft consists of glass fibers thus the fabric exhibits orthotropic properties in practical applications one or two anti birdcage tapes are helically applied over the outer tensile armour wires layer with a high lay angle with overlapping after each turn pre tension may exist in this tape layer upon manufacture the anti birdcage tape layer provides most of the radial expansive resistance especially when the pipe annulus is flooded as the resistance from external hydrostatic pressure is neutralized the usual axisymmetric loads carried by a flexible pipe are composed of axial force and torsion moment internal and external pressures under such loads the flexible pipe will experience axial elongation or shortening axial rotation and radius variation meanwhile stresses and deformations are generated in each helical strip layer and continuum polymeric layer determining the flexible pipe mechanical behavior in axisymmetric loadings is important for the local structural analysis and considerable research has been conducted mathematical models for the evaluation of the flexible pipe behavior subjected to axisymmetric loads have been well developed decades ago among others by bournazel and féret 1985 by establishing and solving a system of equations through an iterative process the flexible pipe global response the stresses and deformations in each layer as well as the gaps or contact pressures between neighboring layers can all be determined for quick evaluation a simplified solution has been proposed by féret and bournazel 1987 by introducing additional hypotheses such as geometric continuity between layers ignoring the resistance from polymeric layers considering the pressure armour laid at 90 etc this quick solution must be verified by the more rigorous solution as those hypotheses may not always hold thereafter a general analytical method has been developed by mcnamara and harte 1992 in which a flexible pipe is considered as an arbitrary number of discrete layers of isotropic and orthotropic continuum thin tubes and helical steel strip layers stiffness relations for each type of layer have been developed and combined to form a total sectional stiffness assuming geometric continuity between layers this model was further improved by harte and mcnamara 1993 incorporating thick tube theory moreover an analytical model for predicting the axial torsional structural behavior of flexible pipes umbilicals and marine cables was also presented by witz and tan 1992 in which the core components in a cable were replaced by a cylinder with equivalent stiffness and constriction tension tests of marine cable and umbilical were reported and good agreements with the analytical solution were observed claydon et al 1992 proposed theoretical approach to predict the service life of unbonded flexible pipe and presented an analytical axisymmetric model in this model the thickness variation of each layer was ignored and geometric continuity was assumed the contact pressure between the inner and outer armour wires was calculated considering the spaces between armour wires witz 1996 reported a series of tests of an unbonded flexible pipe in cyclic axial tension axial rotation in both directions and bending with and without internal pressures ten research groups were invited to provide analytical predictions and the results were compared with test data this work is still continually used as benchmark additionally ramos et al 2000 also presented an analytical model for axisymmetric study the results were compared with the results from a fem as well as the test data presented by witz 1996 and good agreements were demonstrated thereafter custódio and vaz 2002 presented a mathematical model for the axisymmetric response of umbilical cables and flexible pipes in which the non linear stress strain curve of polyethylene obtained from tests was employed and the steel stress strain curve was fitted by ramberg osgood curve for umbilical cables the core was modeled as an elastic foundation and the tensile armour wires locking phenomenon was considered sævik and bruaseth 2005 proposed a finite element formulation for predicting the axisymmetric behavior of umbilicals incorporating material nonlinearity and gaps between individual bodies the finite element results were validated against the test data of 10 different umbilicals with respect to axial tensile stiffness and torsion stiffness in both directions bruaseth and sævik 2003 ye and bruaseth 2004 merino et al 2009 studied the extensional torsional response of flexible pipes through a finite element model implemented in the commercial fe software ansys the fe results confirmed that the friction coefficient has a very small effect on the flexible pipe axisymmetric behavior besides experimental tests of a 4 in flexible pipe in cyclic axial tension with ends axial rotation free or restricted were reported while the fe results and test data agreed with respect to tensile stiffnesses and external diameter variations a discrepancy was observed with respect to axial rotation or torque generated bahtui et al 2009 studied the flexible pipe mechanical behavior in axial tension torsion as well as bending combined with internal pressure through analytical formulation and finite element model ren et al 2014 developed a finite element model where the geometric details of the pressure armour and carcass were presented the fe results in axial tension were compared with analytical and existing test data additionally ramos et al 2014 reported a series of cyclic tension tests using a 2 5 in flexible pipe sample with ends axial rotations free or restricted and with or without internal pressure illustrating that uniform deformation assumption in tensile armour wires that is widely used in analytical modeling was not fully observed the experimental results were compared with those predicted by an analytical model assuming linear response in axisymmetric loads ramos and kawano 2015 liu and vaz 2016b a studied the effect of viscoelastic damping of polymeric layers on flexible pipe mechanical behavior in cyclic axial motion dong et al 2016 investigated the end fitting effect on tensile armour behavior in a flexible pipe subjected to axial tension in the absence of friction cornacchia et al 2019 studied the flexible pipe mechanical behavior in pure tension through analytical and finite element approaches fang et al 2019 studied the torsional behavior of metallic strip flexible pipes msfp through a finite element model and material tests of the constituted steel and hdpe were presented zhang et al 2020 presented an analytical model for a flexible pipe in axisymmetric loading where the contact mechanism between neighboring layers was modeled by penalty function and lagrange multiplier method the results were compared with fe results as well as existing test data recently more researches were published to evaluate the tensile behavior of a flexible pipe with composite tensile armour wires among others by liu et al 2020 while most of the published studies investigated intact flexible pipes a few studies were reported for damaged flexible pipe axisymmetric mechanical behavior sousa et al 2009 studied the axisymmetric response of a flexible pipe with several ruptured tensile armour wires in the outer armour wires layer through a finite element model the uneven force distribution between armour wires and the uneven pressure distribution on the underlying layers were discussed the fe results were validated against a tensile test of a 6 in flexible pipe under pure tension considering intact and damaged conditions sousa et al 2014 ji et al 2014 presented a methodology to assess the integrity of damaged flexible pipe cross sections applying a finite element model and considering several inner armour wires ruptured the stress distribution in tensile armour wires and pressure armour as well as the flexible pipe overall response in tension and bending were investigated on this basis probabilistic analysis was presented to estimate the time from first wire failure until cross section failure recently ren et al 2020 also studied the axial torsional response of an unbonded flexible pipe with ruptured tensile armour wires in the outer armour wires layer through a finite element model where the frictional effect on the recovery of damaged tensile armour wires was discussed the abovementioned studies all concerned the axial torsional structural behavior of a flexible pipe and little attention has been paid to the effect of the anti birdcage tape layer in those studies the anti birdcage tape layer was either not mentioned or simplified as an isotropic tube while the anti birdcage tape layer may not noticeably affect the flexible pipe tensile behavior it is of vital importance for the flexible pipe mechanical behavior in axial compression driven by axial compressive loads the tensile armour wires tend to expand radially and push outward the anti birdcage tape layer if the anti birdcage tape layer is not sufficiently strong to hold the armour wires radial expansion a birdcaging failure characterized by large radial deformation in the tensile armour wires may be generated rabelo et al 2015 sævik and thorsen 2017 lu et al 2017 li et al 2019b on the other hand in axial compression combined with cyclic bending the tensile armour wires may also deflect in the transverse direction and develop into lateral buckling li et al 2019a as a consequence a large pipe axial rotation will be generated and the helically wound anti birdcage tape may retard this axial rotation and slow down the lateral buckling progression depending on the tape laying direction zhou et al 2015 to date few studies have been reported on the flexible pipe mechanical behavior in axial compression sousa et al 2012 studied the flexible pipe behavior in axial compression until the formation of birdcaging failure through a finite element model where the anti birdcage tape layer was modeled as a tubular structure with orthotropic material properties also the compressive behaviors of three samples of a 4 in flexible pipe as well as the anti birdcage tape tensile behavior were tested and reported borges et al 2017 studied the birdcaging mechanism of a 6 in flexible pipe with defects on the outer sheath and anti birdcage tape layer through fe and experimental simulations moreover yoo et al 2017 presented a finite element approach to evaluate the ultimate strength of a flexible pipe in both axial tension and compression where the anti birdcage tape layer was modeled as an isotropic tube zhu and lei 2019 studied the effect of axial compression and external hydrostatic pressure on the flexible pipe axial rotational behavior no information related to the anti birdcage tape modeling was presented in the studies of flexible pipe armour wire lateral buckling the anti birdcage tape layer has usually been modeled as a non deformable tube or elastic foundations østergaard 2012 sævik and ji 2014 li et al 2018 malta and martins 2014 liu et al 2019 gonzalez et al 2019 yang et al 2020 in this study a mathematical model is developed for a flexible pipe subjected to axisymmetric loadings three modeling strategies for the anti birdcage tape layer are presented including helical tape orthotropic tube and isotropic tube the discrepancies between the results obtained from those three modeling strategies in different loading conditions are discussed parametric studies are then presented on the effects of tape layer material and geometric properties on the flexible pipe mechanical behavior in axisymmetric loadings 2 mathematical model as shown in fig 1 an unbonded flexible pipe is composed of several layers with different geometry and material properties in axisymmetric models the polymeric layers such as the outer sheath fluid barrier and anti friction tape layers are usually treated based on the theory of elastic thin walled or thick walled tubes although the anti friction tapes are helically wound structures they are often simplified as continuum tubes as they are thin and soft the introduction of this simplification is not expected to interfere with the axisymmetric analysis besides the steel helical layers such as tensile armour wires layers pressure armour and carcass are usually modeled as space curved beams alternatively as the pressure armour and carcass possess high lay angles they are often represented by orthotropic tubes sousa et al 2012 to date little attention has been paid to the precise modeling of the anti birdcage tape layer in this study three modeling approaches for this layer are presented for comparison including helical tape orthotropic tube and isotropic tube the mathematical modeling of each type of layer is introduced in detail in this section the main assumptions used throughout the analysis are outlined below the helical strips are wound as perfectly cylindrical helices over a straight pipe and the helical strips within the same layer are placed evenly and axisymmetrically all those layers are assembled perfectly with no gap or prestress the contact pressures on the layers beneath and above those helical steel strips are considered uniform disregarding the space between helical strips as the filling factors are usually big all those layers deform uniformly along a flexible pipe as a consequence relative displacements do not exist between each layer and the frictional effect is duly ignored the deformation is small and there is no lateral contact between the helical strips within the same layer all materials are assumed linear elastic isotropic end effects are not considered 2 1 homogeneous layers cylindrical polymeric layers are herein modeled based on the theory of elastic thick walled tubes consider a tube with axial length l i n i and inner and outer radii r i and r o subjected to uniform internal and external pressures p i and p o axial elongation δ l and relative axial rotation between two ends δ θ as illustrated in fig 3 the radial expansion at radius r is denoted by u r the internal and external pressures on the polymeric layers are assumed as the average pressures at the corresponding interfaces note that due to the space between helical strips the actual contact pressures between every single helical strip and the neighboring polymeric layers are slightly larger than the average contact pressures it is assumed that in small deformations the polymer layer is approximately linear elastic with constant young s modulus e p shear modulus g p and poisson s ratio ν p therefore applying the elasticity theory for isotropic materials and considering the equilibrium state of an element as shown in fig 3 c the radial expansion in the cross section can be determined by 1 u r 1 ν p 1 2 ν p e p p i r i 2 p o r o 2 r o 2 r i 2 r p o p i 1 ν p e p r i 2 r o 2 r o 2 r i 2 1 r ν p δ l l i n i r for convenience sake the radial deformation is characterized by the average radius increment δ r and thickness increment δ t as 2 δ r 1 2 u r i u r o 1 ν p 2 e p r o r i p i p o r i r o p i r i 2 p o r o 2 1 2 ν p ν p 2 δ l l i n i r i r o 3 δ t u r o u r i 1 ν p e p r i r o p i p o r i r o p o r o 2 p i r i 2 1 2 ν p ν p δ l l i n i r o r i subsequently the stresses in the radial circumferential and axial directions denoted respectively by σ r σ θ and σ z can be obtained as 4a σ r p i r i 2 p o r o 2 r o 2 r i 2 p o p i 1 r 2 r i 2 r o 2 r o 2 r i 2 4b σ θ p i r i 2 p o r o 2 r o 2 r i 2 p o p i 1 r 2 r i 2 r o 2 r o 2 r i 2 4c σ z e p δ l l i n i 2 ν p p i r i 2 p o r o 2 r o 2 r i 2 the cross sectional force in the axial direction denoted by f z can then be evaluated by multiplying the axial stress by the cross sectional area as 5 f z σ z π r o 2 r i 2 e p δ l l i n i π r o 2 r i 2 2 ν p π p i r i 2 p o r o 2 besides the torque along the axial direction denoted by m z is given by 6 m z g p j δ θ l i n i g p π 4 r o 4 r i 4 δ θ l i n i where j is the polar moment of inertia of the cross section 2 2 steel helical strip layers 2 2 1 geometric relationships the steel helical strip layers including tensile armour wires layers pressure armour and carcass are modeled using space curved beam theory consider a helical beam over a straight cylindrical surface at a lay angle α i n i with the average radius r i n i in the initial configuration as shown in fig 4 a the total axial length in the initial state is l i n i an orthonormal triad of local unit vectors t n b is defined on the helical beam representing its tangential normal and bi normal directions after applying axisymmetric loadings the axial length and average radius increase respectively δ l and δ r and an axial rotation δ θ is generated the positive lay angle and rotational direction are defined as shown in fig 4 a as bending is not considered in this analysis the cylindrical surface can be expanded in the plane coordinate system as shown in fig 4 b where the solid and dashed lines represent respectively the helical beam paths before and after loading considering that the deformation is small in practical loading conditions and assuming that the deformation is uniform along the helix the strain along the helical direction can be approximately evaluated by retaining first order small terms as 7 ε t s s i n i 1 cos 2 α i n i δ l l i n i sin 2 α i n i δ r r i n i sin 2 α i n i 2 r i n i δ θ l i n i still ignoring higher order small terms the helical beam lay angle variation can be approximately determined from the geometric relationship as 8 δ α sin 2 α i n i 2 δ l l i n i δ r r i n i r i n i tan α i n i δ θ l i n i for a flexible pipe subjected to large axial loading those steel helical strips with a flat cross section are strongly restrained by the contacts from neighboring layers thus are unlikely to rotate in their helical directions therefore it is reasonable to assume that the helical beam normal direction coincides with the radial direction of the underlying cylindrical surface since the deformation is assumed uniform the helical beam lay angle is constant which renders zero geodesic curvature on the other hand the curvature component in the normal direction κ n and torsion in its helical direction τ in the initial and deformed states can be obtained easily from the darboux frame as 9a κ n i n i sin 2 α i n i r i n i κ n sin 2 α i n i δ α r i n i δ r 9b τ i n i sin 2 α i n i 2 r i n i τ sin 2 α i n i 2 δ α 2 r i n i δ r 2 2 2 constitutive relations consider the material isotropic linear elastic with young s modulus e shear modulus g and poisson s ratio ν assuming there exists no transverse contact between neighboring helical strips within each layer the tangential strain can be related to the stresses in the axial and normal directions denoted respectively by σ t and σ n through 10 ε t σ t e ν σ n e besides the cross sectional moments in the tangential and bi normal directions can be obtained from the following constitutive relationship 11a m t g j τ τ i n i 11b m b e i b κ n κ n i n i where i b is the inertia moment of the cross section in the bi normal direction and j is the torsional moment of inertia the cross sectional moment in the normal direction is deemed negligible as the geodesic curvature is zero assuming a uniform lay angle while the cross sections of tensile armour wires usually possess quasi rectangular shapes the cross sections of pressure armour and carcass are more complex whose inertias need to be carefully evaluated based on their specific profile geometries 2 2 3 equilibrium equations expanding the vectorial formed equilibrium equations for space curved beam segment derived by reissner 1981 in the local orthonormal coordinate system as shown in fig 4 a the sectional force in the bi normal direction can be obtained as 12 f b κ n m t τ m b with f b determined the distributed force per unit arc length in the normal direction can then be calculated by 13 p n κ n f t τ f b consequently for a layer containing n helical strips the average contact pressures at the outer and inner interfaces with the neighboring layers denoted respectively by p o and p i can be related by 14 p o p i n p n 2 π r i n i δ r cos α i n i δ α besides consider a helical strip with width w the average radial stress in the helical strip can be given by 15 σ n p o p i 2 2 π r i n i δ r cos α i n i δ α n w where the second fraction represents the reciprocal of the filling factor according to elasticity theory for isotropic material the thickness increment of a helical strip with a thickness t i n i can be evaluated with 16 δ t t i n i σ n e ν ε t note that the thickness variation of steel layers in a general loading condition is very small thus it could be ignored thereafter substituting eqs 7 and 15 into 10 and multiplying by the beam cross sectional area a the sectional force in its helical direction can be obtained as 17 f t e a cos 2 α i n i δ l l i n i sin 2 α i n i δ r r i n i sin 2 α i n i 2 r i n i δ θ l i n i p o p i a ν π r i n i δ r cos α i n i δ α n w subsequently the axial load and moment carried by a helical strip layer are evaluated by summing the contribution from all helical strips as 18 f z n f t cos α i n i δ α f b sin α i n i δ α 19 m z n f t sin α i n i δ α f b cos α i n i δ α r i n i δ r m t cos α i n i δ α m b sin α i n i δ α 2 3 anti birdcage tape layer consider a tape with a width w t a p e and thickness t t a p e helically wound with a lay angle α t a p e i n i over a straight cylinder with axial length l i n i and radius r i n i in the initial state as illustrated in fig 5 after loading the overall axial elongation radial expansion and axial rotation are respectively δ l δ r and δ θ the tape is assumed linear elastic in tension with tensile stiffness e a t a p e and breaking strain ε u t for the sake of comparison three modeling strategies for this layer are presented including helical tape orthotropic tube and isotropic tube 2 3 1 helical tape similarly the geometric relationships presented previously for a helical beam are still applicable for a helical tape nonetheless differing from a beam the bending torsional shear and compressive stiffnesses of a tape are all negligible besides as the helically wound tape layer is not continuous in its transversal direction the bi normal stress may exist but is merely held by friction thus it is not expected to be significant therefore only the tape tensile stiffness needs to be considered assuming that the aramid yarns deform uniformly the tape tensile force can be evaluated by 20 f t e a t a p e ε t where the axial strain ε t is given by eq 7 consequently considering that there are n tapes helically wound one above another the axial load and torque carried by the anti birdcage tape layer can be evaluated respectively by 21 f z n f t cos α t a p e i n i δ α t a p e 22 m z n f t sin α t a p e i n i δ α t a p e r i n i δ r while there exist spaces between steel helical strips the tape is usually applied with an overlap after each turn in the initial straight unloaded state to ensure that the entire underlying surface in a deformed state is covered accordingly the tape width and lay angle usually obey the following relationship 23 w t a p e 2 π r i n i cos α t a p e i n i as a consequence of overlapping the aramid yarns that constitute the tape may not be evenly distributed over the cylindrical surface which may lead to a non uniform radial expansion resistance nonetheless considering the average constraint eq 14 is still valid to describe the pressure variation across the tape layer thickness besides as the tape layer is very thin its thickness variation is not expected to interfere with the axisymmetric analysis then it may be disregarded the tape layer is deemed broken when the tensile strain obtained from eq 7 reaches the tape breaking strain 2 3 2 orthotropic tube alternatively as a simplification the tape layer may be represented by an orthotropic tubular shell with the same thickness the definition of orthotropic material involves 3 young s moduli e r e θ e z 3 poisson s ratios ν r θ ν θ z ν z r and 3 shear moduli g r θ g θ z g z r in which the subscripts r θ z represent respectively the radial angular and axial directions in this study the poisson s ratios are all assumed as zero to decouple deformations in different directions as a consequence of ignoring poisson s effect the radial expansion resistance from the tape layer may be slightly overestimated as the tape is usually applied with a large lay angle its resistance is principally in the circumferential direction therefore it is of vital importance to ensure that the resistance in the circumferential direction remains unchanged considering the tape layer as a thin walled tube the radial stress variation across its thickness can be evaluated by 24 p o p i e θ t t a p e r i n i δ r r i n i equalizing eqs 14 and 24 the hoop elastic modulus can be obtained approximately as 25 e θ n e a t a p e t t a p e sin 4 α t a p e i n i 2 π r i n i cos α t a p e i n i note that the elastic modulus given by eq 25 is only applicable to the condition of radial expansion otherwise the tape would be loose and the hoop elastic modulus negligible subsequently considering that the tape tension is principally attributed to pipe radial expansion the critical radial expansion ratio that causes tape breaking can be approximately evaluated from eq 7 by 26 δ r r i n i ε u t sin 2 α t a p e i n i combining eqs 25 and 26 the rupture stress in the circumferential direction is obtained as 27 σ θ n e a t a p e ε u t t t a p e sin 2 α t a p e i n i 2 π r i n i cos α t a p e i n i besides when the tape is tensioned the projection of the tape tensile load in the pipe axial direction would axially compress the pipe note that the tape is tensioned usually in a flexible pipe subjected to axial compression in other words the tape layer promotes axial compression on the other hand as the tape is usually loose in a flexible pipe subjected to axial tension its tensile elastic modulus in the pipe axial direction is negligible considering that the tape is applied with a large lay angle its tensile load projection in the pipe axial direction is relatively small for the sake of simplicity such a non linear elastic modulus in the axial direction e z is assumed as zero moreover as the tape layer is very thin and the poisson s effect is disregarded the elastic modulus in the radial direction e r is not expected to interfere with axisymmetric analysis which is herein assumed equal to that given by eq 25 also a unidirectional axial torque would be generated by the tape layer when it is tensioned it is noteworthy that the axial torque from the tape layer depends on the tape tensile force and laying direction rather than the pipe axial rotation magnitude and direction thus axial torque from the tape layer cannot be properly described by shear moduli in a tubular structure for the sake of simplicity the shear moduli g r θ g θ z g z r are all deemed zero 2 3 3 isotropic tube although the tape layer exhibits orthotropic properties it is often simplified as an isotropic tube in the axisymmetric analysis this simplification is based on the consideration that the tape tensile stiffness is much smaller than that of steel layers and their contribution to the pipe axial stiffness is negligible as the tape layer thickness is small the thin walled tube theory may describe its mechanical behavior alternatively the mathematical model based on thick walled tube theory presented in section 2 1 can also be used which is consistent with the thin walled tube theory in the condition of small thickness the elastic modulus of the isotropic tube is often considered as that of the filaments that constitute the tape or the average modulus over the tape cross sectional area herein to render the isotropic tube the equivalent radial expansion resistance and strength young s modulus and breaking criterion of the isotropic tube are defined respectively by eqs 25 and 26 besides a poisson s ratio of 0 3 is considered 2 4 assembling consider a flexible pipe with n layers subjected to axial tension f z t o t a l and torque m z t o t a l summing the axial tension and torque carried by each layer as discussed previously the overall axial tension and torque on the flexible pipe can be obtained respectively by 28 f z t o t a l n 1 n f z n t h l a y e r 29 m z t o t a l n 1 n m z n t h l a y e r besides boundary conditions in the radial direction need to be defined if two neighboring layers are in contact the inner radius of the outer layer and the outer radius of the inner layer should be the same i e 30 r o n t h l a y e r r i n 1 t h l a y e r on the other hand if a gap is opened between two neighboring layers the contact pressure at the interface should be zero i e 31 p o n t h l a y e r p i n 1 t h l a y e r 0 the internal pressure generated by bore fluids should be added to the internal surface of the fluid barrier the external hydrostatic pressure should be added respectively to the external surfaces of the outer sheath and the fluid barrier when the pipe annulus is dry or flooded 2 5 solution technique in summary for each layer the variables to be determined including internal and external radii pressures or gaps at the internal and external interfaces axial force and torque the external and bore pressures are considered known meanwhile the same number of equations are established the axisymmetric loads on a flexible pipe can be applied through either displacement and rotation or force and torque a matlab program is developed to solve this equations system using an incremental iterative algorithm as illustrated in fig 6 axisymmetric loads are applied linearly in n increments within each iterative increment this equations system is solved using newton s method and the results of the previous increment are taken as a guess for the roots of the next increment initially it is assumed that the tape would be tensioned in the applied loading condition if the tape tensile strain or radial displacement turns out to be negative respectively in the helical tape and orthotropic tube approaches the tape tensile stiffness should be neglected and the calculation needs to be restarted with this updated however for comparative purposes the tape tensile states are not verified in the isotropic tube approach besides the geometric continuity is assumed at all those interfaces at the beginning of the calculation if the contact pressure at an interface is evaluated as negative which is not possible in an unbonded structure the geometric continuity condition should be removed at this interface instead contact pressure at this interface needs to be defined directly as zero and unknown should be changed to the gap size if negative contact pressures are observed at several interfaces the geometric continuity conditions need to be modified tentatively at each interface until there is neither negative pressure nor penetration at all those interfaces 3 results and discussions in this section verification of the present mathematical model in axial tension rotation and compression against existing test data is presented the effects of different tape layer modeling strategies on flexible pipe mechanical behavior in each loading condition are discussed 3 1 axial tension a series of tests were reported by witz 1996 using a 2 5 in unbonded flexible pipe which serves as a good foundation for the verification of the present mathematical model in pure axial tension and rotation the main characteristics of this 2 5 in flexible pipe are summarized in table 1 the outer sheath was removed to facilitate the assembling of terminations as the anti birdcage tape layer possesses a thickness of merely 0 5 mm and exhibits overlapping according to eq 23 it is reasonable to consider that there is only one tape in this layer besides whether the given tape elastic modulus 600 mpa indicates the properties of the filaments that constitute the tape or the average modulus over the tape cross sectional area is ambiguous it is herein assumed as the average elastic modulus based on the cross sectional area with 75 mm width and 0 5 mm thickness accordingly the tape tensile stiffness can be evaluated as 22 5 kn m m and the equivalent hoop elastic modulus when the tape layer is represented by an orthotropic or isotropic tube can be obtained from eq 25 as 1 2 gpa two unpressurized tests were performed applying cyclic axial tension with end axial rotation free and restricted respectively ten research groups were invited to provide analytical estimations on this structure behavior fig 7 shows the axial force elongation data of the test with end free to rotate as well as the curves representing the mean tensile stiffness with one standard deviation on either side based on results provided by those research groups the present mathematical model indicates that the anti birdcage tape layer remains loose under this loading condition thus could be disregarded the results obtained from the present model disregarding the tape layer are presented by the dashed magenta curve in fig 7 for comparative purposes the results obtained through the approach in which the tape layer is represented by an isotropic tube with an elastic modulus of 1 2 gpa are also presented the pipe tensile stiffnesses obtained from both approaches are similar and approximately equal to 127 mn m m which coincides with the mean stiffnesses provided by other research groups this is because the tape tensile stiffness in this pipe is diminutive note that the anti birdcage tape constituted by aramid fibers such as kevlar exhibits a much larger tensile stiffness kevlar material possesses an elastic modulus as large as 124 gpa talgatti 2013 tensile tests of anti birdcage tape constituted by kevlar filaments were performed by sousa et al 2012 suggesting a tensile stiffness of 1341 kn m m to illustrate the deviation caused by the isotropic tube modeling approach for a stiff tape layer the tape tensile stiffness is now considered as 1341 kn m m in this 2 5 in flexible pipe under this circumstance the elastic modulus of the isotropic tube is obtained from eq 25 as 72 gpa the corresponding pipe axial force elongation curve applying the isotropic tube approach is shown in fig 7 for comparison which exhibits a tensile stiffness of 139 mn m m it is conspicuous that the pipe tensile stiffness is overestimated in this modeling approach thus although modeling the tape layer as an isotropic tube is not expected to cause a significant deviation on the flexible pipe tensile stiffness when the tape is relatively soft it results in an overestimated pipe tensile stiffness when the tape is stiff besides it needs to be noted that while nearly linear relationships are estimated by mathematical models non linear and hysteresis behavior was observed in the test indicating that those previously mentioned hypotheses widely employed in axisymmetric modeling may not be fully realized in the test 3 2 axial rotation moreover tests were performed using this flexible pipe sample applying twist in both directions with end axial elongation free or restricted and with no internal and external pressures the measured torque twist curves with ends prevented from moving axially are shown in fig 8 where the positive axial rotational direction is defined in fig 4 a for comparative purposes the results obtained from the present mathematical model applying different tape layer modeling approaches as well as the curves representing the mean torsional stiffnesses provided by those research groups are also presented in fig 8 according to the present mathematical model the tape is tensioned in all those loading conditions except for twisting in the positive direction with end elongation restricted it can be seen that the pipe torsional stiffnesses suggested by the present mathematical model are close to the mean values provided by those research groups no notable difference is observed applying different tape layer modeling approaches however this coincidence is no longer valid when the tape possesses a large tensile stiffness to illustrate the deviation caused by the orthotropic and isotropic tube modeling approaches the tape tensile stiffness is varied from zero to 1500 kn m m and the corresponding pipe torsional stiffnesses in both directions with end axial movement free or restricted applying those three tape layer modeling approaches are presented in fig 9 besides considering the tape laid with the same angle but in the opposite direction the pipe torsional stiffnesses obtained from the helical tape approach are also presented in fig 9 it is evident that the discrepancies between different modeling approaches grow with the tape tensile stiffness note that the tape layer is loose in the condition of positive twisting with end elongation restricted thus the pipe torsional stiffnesses in this condition applying the helical tape and orthotropic tube approaches are not affected by the tape tensile stiffness which is represented by the black dash dot line in fig 9 except for this condition it can be observed that applying the helical tape approach the pipe torsional stiffnesses are affected by reverting the tape laying direction as the reaction torque from the tape layer becomes opposite a flexible pipe would be torsional stiffer if the tape laying direction is along the axial rotational direction however the effect of tape laying direction is not represented when the tape layer is modeled as a tubular structure comparing those black blue and red curves in fig 9 the pipe rotational stiffness suggested by the orthotropic tube approach lies in the middle of those given by the helical tape approach considering opposite tape laying directions this is due to the ignorance of axial rotational stiffness in the orthotropic tube approach besides comparing the orthotropic and isotropic tube modeling approaches the pipe rotational stiffness obtained from the latter is always larger as the axial torque from the tape layer is improperly counted in this approach see the blue and green curves in fig 9 thus for a flexible pipe with a stiff tape layer in axial rotation more reasonable results can be obtained through the helical tape modeling approach observing those curves obtained through the helical tape approach in fig 9 except for those representing the condition of positive twisting with end elongation restricted it is noteworthy that the pipe torsional stiffnesses increase monotonically and verge upon limits asymptotically with increasing tape tensile stiffness the limits correspond to the state in which the tape layer is extremely stiff so that the tensile armour wires are not allowed to expand radially in the condition of positive twisting with end elongation free as the inner and outer tensile armour wires are squeezed and their radial movement tendencies are approximately balanced their radial expansion can be restricted by a relatively small resistance from the tape layer thus the pipe torsional stiffness in this condition is stabilized when the tape tensile stiffness reaches approximately 500 kn m m on the other hand in the condition of negative twisting the inner and outer tensile armour wires tend to be separated and a larger radial restriction is thus demanded to resist the outer armour wires radial expansions as a consequence the pipe torsional stiffnesses in the negative rotational direction are still increasing until the given maximum tape tensile stiffness in fig 9 3 3 axial compression a series of flexible pipe compressive tests as well as anti birdcage tape tensile tests were reported in sousa et al 2012 which will be used for the validation of the present model in axial compression the main characteristics of this 4 in flexible pipe are summarized in table 2 the anti birdcage tape is a fabric composed of various aramid yarns the tape number in the anti birdcage tape layer was not specified it is herein assumed as one 3 3 1 tape stiffness and strength tests using the anti birdcage tape extracted from this 4 in flexible pipe tape samples were prepared with ends fixed by aluminum plates with the help of acrylic resin with a free span length of 0 5 m a series of tape tensile tests were performed demonstrating an approximately linear force elongation relationship until tape breaking the measured tape tensile stiffness and breaking strain are respectively 1341 kn m m and 2 1 nevertheless caution should be exercised when applying those measured tape properties in tape layer modeling a series of tensile tests on a 130 mm wide anti birdcage tape constituted by 85 kevlar filaments was reported in petrobras 2009 besides the sample of complete tape samples were also prepared with respectively 1 3 5 10 kevlar filaments applying the average filament tensile stiffness obtained from those tests with 1 3 5 10 filaments the tensile stiffness of complete tape can be evaluated as 1245 kn m m which is similar to that reported in sousa et al 2012 however the tape tensile stiffness obtained from the test of complete tape is merely 650 kn m m this great discrepancy is due to the fact that tensile load distribution between the filaments is not uniform some filaments may be still in a loose state while others strongly tensioned consequently the breakage did not occur uniformly some filaments broke and others did not furthermore for a tape helically wound over a flexible pipe the tensile states of the filaments are more complex any small geometric asymmetry between the helically wound aramid yarns would cause non uniform tension distribution between them thus the acting tape layer resistance in a flexible pipe may be overestimated by applying the tape properties obtained in ideal test conditions 3 3 2 compressive tests and model validation three samples of 4 in flexible pipe with ends free to rotate axially and no internal and external pressures were tested applying axial compression until the formation of birdcaging the measured pipe end shortenings radial expansions and average axial rotations per unit length in axial compression as well as the results obtained from a finite element model developed by sousa et al 2012 are presented respectively in figs 10 12 in fig 11 the radial expansion ratio is defined as the ratio of pipe outer diameter increment to the initial pipe outer diameter as shown in fig 10 the measured pipe axial compressive stiffness and average buckling load are respectively 22 1 mn m m and 256 kn in wet annulus conditions this critical load can be generated by the reversed end cap effect at a water depth of 2236 m according to fig 11 the measured radial expansive stiffness defined by the ratio of axial compressive load to radial expansion ratio is approximately 14 0 mn m m besides although the pipe axial rotations are not repetitive in those three tests they demonstrate similar inclinations see fig 12 the increment of axial rotation per unit pipe length generated by a unit axial compressive load is approximately 2 0 1 0 6 deg mn good agreements were observed between the finite element results and test data the anti birdcage tape layer was modeled as an orthotropic cylindrical shell in this finite element model but no information was presented on the calculation of its properties applying the measured tape properties the flexible pipe mechanical responses obtained from the present mathematical model with different tape layer modeling strategies are also presented in figs 10 12 the ends of those curves represent the conditions of tape breakage it is verified that the other layers are still in the elastic stage when the tape layer breaks from fig 11 it can be observed that the radial expansions at the moments of tape layer breakage obtained from tests and the present model are approximate indicating that the tape layer failed approximately at the measured breaking strain however as shown in fig 10 the pipe axial compressive stiffnesses and the critical axial compressive loads to cause tape layer breakage obtained through the helical tape orthotropic tube and isotropic tube modeling approaches are respectively 38 9 mn m m 39 4 mn m m 44 0 mn m m and 564 kn 568 kn 619 kn they are approximately twice the corresponding measured values this indicates that the tape layer stiffness is significantly overestimated the discrepancy in the buckling load estimation applying tape breakage criterion was also observed by sævik and thorsen 2017 through an analytical model 32 p r tan 2 α n t σ u t a t sin 2 α t cos α t r t 2 π e s ε u t t s where r and r t are respectively the mean radii of tensile armour wires layers and anti birdcage tape layer n t is the number of tapes a t α t ε u t σ u t are respectively the tape cross sectional area lay angle breaking strain and ultimate stress e s is the outer sheath young s modulus and t s is the outer sheath thickness the first and second terms in eq 32 represent respectively the contributions from the anti birdcage tape layer and the outer sheath the critical load given by this analytical formulation is 592 kn where 523 kn is contributed by the anti birdcage tape layer and 69 kn is contributed by the outer sheath this is close to the limit loads obtained from the present mathematical model note that in the work from sævik and thorsen 2017 the tape number in this flexible pipe was assumed as two so that the critical load for tape breakage given by eq 32 was approximately doubled as 1110 kn no matter whether existing one or two tapes the analytical estimations on the critical loads for tape layer breakage are much larger than the measured buckling loads to bring the buckling load estimation closer to the measured ones other buckling criteria were proposed by sævik and thorsen 2017 including helical beam radial instability in an elastic foundation and armour wires yielding the buckling limit was then evaluated by the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals of those three critical loads obtained from each criterion although the critical loads obtained from every criterion are larger than the measured buckling loads the final estimation after this manipulation is close to the measured ones indeed flexible pipe birdcaging is a complex problem that may involve different triggering mechanisms however explanations for the divergence in the estimations of pipe axial compressive stiffness and radial expansion are still needed as previously declared the tape tensile stiffness obtained in ideal test conditions should be used with caution assuming that the acting tape tensile stiffness in this flexible pipe is 543 kn m m which is close to that reported in petrobras 2009 the corresponding pipe mechanical responses obtained from the present mathematical model are presented in figs 10 12 also the ends of those curves represent the conditions of tape layer breakage observing those curves obtained from the helical tape modeling approach it can be seen that by merely reducing the tape tensile stiffness the pipe axial compressive stiffness radial expansion as well as buckling limit all become approximate to the test data this proves the conjecture that the acting tape tensile stiffness may be overestimated on the other hand discrepancies between the calculated and measured pipe axial rotations are observed in fig 12 note that the pipe axial rotation in axial compression is very small and it is sensitive to the hypotheses employed in the mathematical model for instance considering uncertainties in fabrication and displacements induced by cyclic loadings the inner and outer tensile armour wires laying angles may not be precisely 35 degrees fig 13 shows the sensitivity of the pipe axial compressive and radial expansive stiffnesses and axial rotation per unit length per unit axial compressive load to the lay angles of inner and outer tensile armour wires the vertical coordinate denotes the ratios of the results obtained from the present model using the helical tape modeling approach to the corresponding measured data the coincidence between calculated and measured data is observed when this ratio is equal to one conspicuously while slightly modifying the armour wires lay angles has small effects on the axial compressive and radial expansive stiffnesses it significantly affects the pipe axial rotation good agreement on pipe axial rotation can be obtained when the inner and outer armour wires lay angles are respectively 35 4 degrees and 34 5 degrees apart from that the hypotheses related to the armour wires cross sectional areas geometric imperfections boundary effect etc may also affect the pipe axial rotation which renders the calibration difficult thus due to the uncertainties in flexible pipe tests and hypotheses adopted in the analytical model development it is difficult to precisely estimate flexible pipe axial rotation besides evident discrepancies between the results obtained from different tape layer modeling approaches are observed in figs 10 12 whose reasons will be discussed in the following section 3 3 3 parametric studies varying the tape tensile stiffness from zero to 1500 kn m m and considering different tape lay angles and directions the flexible pipe axial compressive stiffnesses radial expansion ratios and axial rotations per unit pipe length per unit axial compressive load obtained from different tape layer modeling approaches are shown respectively in figs 14 16 observing those curves obtained from the helical tape modeling approach in figs 14 and 15 it can be seen that increasing either the tape tensile stiffness or lay angle results in larger pipe axial compressive stiffnesses and smaller radial expansions besides the tape laying direction has a negligible effect on pipe axial compressive stiffness and radial expansion nevertheless evident discrepancies between the results obtained from different tape layer modeling approaches are observed although the present tape layer modeling approaches offer approximately identical hoop resistance they exhibit dissimilar axial mechanical behaviors in reality the projection of the tape tensile force in the pipe axial direction tends to compress the pipe however this is ignored when the tape layer is modeled as an orthotropic tube while the effect of this simplification is negligible when the tape lay angle is 85 degrees it becomes notable when the tape lay angle is 75 degrees see figs 14 and 15 thus when the tape is applied with a relatively small lay angle modeling the tape layer as an orthotropic tube would slightly overestimate the pipe axial compressive stiffness and underestimate the pipe radial expansion worse still representing the tape layer as an isotropic tube exhibits false resistance to axial compression therefore the pipe axial compressive stiffness is overestimated through this approach see fig 14 also as the isotropic tube exhibits axial resistance smaller compressive loads would be carried by the tensile armour wires layers consequently for a pipe subjected to a certain axial compressive load the radial expansion would be underestimated through this approach see fig 15 while the tape laying direction has a negligible effect on pipe axial compressive stiffness and radial expansion it is recognized as a significant inducement to pipe axial rotation observing the black and red curves in fig 16 changing the tape laying direction from positive to negative reverses the torque from the tape layer thus reduces the axial rotation as the axial torque is ignored in the orthotropic tube approach the blue curves are approximately in the middle of the corresponding black and red curves in fig 16 moreover as the isotropic tube approach offers a false rotational resistance the generated axial rotation is smaller than that obtained from the orthotropic tube approach moreover varying the tape tensile stiffness from zero to 1500 kn m m the ratios of axial compressive loads carried by each layer to the total applied axial compression are presented in fig 17 besides considering the tape tensile stiffness as 543 kn m m and varying the tape lay angle and direction the axial compressive load carrying ratios of each layer are presented in fig 18 observing those curves obtained from the helical tape modeling approach in fig 17 the axial compressive load carrying ratios of the tensile armour wires layers increase and verge upon limits asymptotically with increasing tape tensile stiffness the limits correspond to the condition of an unexpansive tape layer from the results obtained from the helical tape approach in fig 18 it can be seen that the axial compressive load carrying ratio of the anti birdcage tape layer is negative as this layer facilitates axial compression it is also noteworthy that the tensile armour wires layer with the same laying direction of the anti birdcage tape layer carries more axial compressive loads than the tensile armour wires layer with an opposite laying direction especially at a relatively small tape lay angle consider that in axial compression lateral buckling may take place in the inner armour wires layer due to less frictional resistance from this perspective it is preferable to apply the anti birdcage tape in the helical direction of outer armour wires so that smaller compressive loads are imposed on the inner armour wires layer this has been claimed by zhou et al 2015 still significant discrepancies are observed between those results obtained from different tape layer modeling approaches in figs 17 18 modeling the tape layer as an orthotropic tube disregards the torque from this layer thus results in imprecise estimations on axial compressive load distribution between the inner and outer tensile armour wires layers worse still larger deviations in axial compressive load distribution are observed applying the isotropic tube modeling approach as in which the tape layer rotational and axial resistance are improperly represented additionally employing tape layer breakage as the birdcaging triggering criterion the critical axial compression obtained at different tape tensile stiffnesses lay angles and directions are shown in figs 19 and 20 observing those results obtained from the helical tape approach birdcaging limit increases linearly with increasing tape tensile stiffness and exponentially and asymptotically with increasing tape lay angle besides the tape laying direction is recognized with a negligible effect on birdcaging limit moreover while the birdcaging limits suggested by the orthotropic tube approach are similar to those obtained from the helical tape approach the birdcaging limits are overestimated when the tape layer is modeled as an isotropic tube as an additional axial compressive load is needed to compress it 4 conclusions this paper presents a mathematical model for an unbonded flexible pipe subjected to axisymmetric loadings three modeling strategies for the anti birdcage tape layer are presented including helical tape orthotropic tube and isotropic tube although modeling the anti birdcage tape layer through those three approaches exhibit approximately identical radial expansive resistance and strength their mechanical behaviors in pipe axial and rotational directions are dissimilar in practical applications axial compression and unidirectional axial torque would be generated by the anti birdcage tape layer when it is tensioned when the tape layer is loose its effect on flexible pipe mechanical behavior can be disregarded while those non linear mechanical behaviors are represented in the helical tape modeling approach they cannot be fully replicated by either orthotropic or isotropic tubes consequently modeling the tape layer as a tubular structure results in deviation in the estimation of some mechanical behaviors of a flexible pipe this is especially the case when the tape is stiff based on the results obtained from the helical tape modeling approach either applying a tape with larger tensile stiffness or winding the tape at a larger lay angle would increase the radial expansive resistance and strength consequently larger pipe axial compressive stiffness and birdcaging limit can be obtained besides while reverting tape laying direction has a negligible effect on radial expansive resistance and strength it reverts the axial torque from the tape layer when it is tensioned this affects the flexible pipe torsional behavior and axial load distribution between different layers concerning the risk of lateral buckling in the inner tensile armour wires layer it is preferable to apply the anti birdcage tape in the helical direction of outer armour wires so that smaller axial compressive loads are imposed on the inner armour wires layer moreover as the filaments that constitute the tape may not deflect uniformly in a flexible pipe caution should be exercised when applying the tape tensile stiffness measured in ideal test conditions additional experimental tests are needed to further prove this conjecture and determine the deviation range of acting tape tensile stiffness in a flexible pipe lastly it needs to be emphasized that the present mathematical model is based on several hypotheses as summarized before those hypotheses may not always hold in a practical flexible pipe structure and their effects need to be carefully checked credit authorship

20575,flexible pipes are critical elements for offshore oil and gas development and determining its response in axisymmetric loadings is of paramount importance often the anti birdcage tape layer is represented by a tubular structure with either isotropic or orthotropic material properties however it is recognized that a tubular structure cannot fully replicate the stiffness and strength and deformation mechanisms of helically wound tape layers this paper presents a mathematical model for the local analysis of unbonded flexible pipes subjected to axisymmetric loadings where three anti birdcage tape layer modeling strategies are presented including helical tape orthotropic and isotropic tubes this model is then verified against existing test data the deviations caused by the orthotropic and isotropic tube modeling strategies in different loading conditions are discussed this is followed by parametric studies on the effects of anti birdcage tape tensile stiffness laying angle and direction on the flexible pipe mechanical behaviors in tension axial rotation in both directions axial compression as well as birdcaging limit loads the importance of considering non uniform tensions in the filaments that constitute the tape is discussed keywords flexible pipes axisymmetric model anti birdcage tape layer birdcaging 1 introduction flexible pipes are tubular composite structures widely used in the offshore oil and gas floating production systems for transportation of hydrocarbons and production fluids fig 1 shows the cross section of a typical unbonded flexible pipe which consists of a number of layers with specific functions the steel made interlocked carcass and pressure armour resist most of the load in the radial direction respectively from external hydrostatic pressure and internal fluid crushing loads during installation and contracting forces from tensile armour wires in tension the tensile armour wires layers constituted by a number of helically wound steel wires with a quasi rectangular cross section carry most of the axial torsional loads the extruded polymeric fluid barrier prevents the bore fluid leakage the outer sheath avoids seawater ingress into the pipe annulus as well as protects the inner structures the helically wound polymeric anti friction tapes are applied to reduce the abrasion between metallic layers in dynamic applications while pressure and tensile loads are the principle loads carried by a flexible pipe in most of its service life large axial compression may also be encountered under certain scenarios due to the reversed end cap effect bectarte and coutarel 2004 and large dynamic motions in harsh weather garcía et al 2015 driven by axial compression the tensile armour wires tend to expand radially and the high strength tape layer is thus needed as the outer sheath stiffness is insufficient the high strength tape layer also known as the anti birdcage tape layer is a fabric composed of various yarns of aromatic polyamide pet polyethylene terephthalate or glass fibers in the warp and weft directions depending on its applications fig 2 shows an anti birdcage tape whose warp is made of kevlar yarns while the weft consists of glass fibers thus the fabric exhibits orthotropic properties in practical applications one or two anti birdcage tapes are helically applied over the outer tensile armour wires layer with a high lay angle with overlapping after each turn pre tension may exist in this tape layer upon manufacture the anti birdcage tape layer provides most of the radial expansive resistance especially when the pipe annulus is flooded as the resistance from external hydrostatic pressure is neutralized the usual axisymmetric loads carried by a flexible pipe are composed of axial force and torsion moment internal and external pressures under such loads the flexible pipe will experience axial elongation or shortening axial rotation and radius variation meanwhile stresses and deformations are generated in each helical strip layer and continuum polymeric layer determining the flexible pipe mechanical behavior in axisymmetric loadings is important for the local structural analysis and considerable research has been conducted mathematical models for the evaluation of the flexible pipe behavior subjected to axisymmetric loads have been well developed decades ago among others by bournazel and féret 1985 by establishing and solving a system of equations through an iterative process the flexible pipe global response the stresses and deformations in each layer as well as the gaps or contact pressures between neighboring layers can all be determined for quick evaluation a simplified solution has been proposed by féret and bournazel 1987 by introducing additional hypotheses such as geometric continuity between layers ignoring the resistance from polymeric layers considering the pressure armour laid at 90 etc this quick solution must be verified by the more rigorous solution as those hypotheses may not always hold thereafter a general analytical method has been developed by mcnamara and harte 1992 in which a flexible pipe is considered as an arbitrary number of discrete layers of isotropic and orthotropic continuum thin tubes and helical steel strip layers stiffness relations for each type of layer have been developed and combined to form a total sectional stiffness assuming geometric continuity between layers this model was further improved by harte and mcnamara 1993 incorporating thick tube theory moreover an analytical model for predicting the axial torsional structural behavior of flexible pipes umbilicals and marine cables was also presented by witz and tan 1992 in which the core components in a cable were replaced by a cylinder with equivalent stiffness and constriction tension tests of marine cable and umbilical were reported and good agreements with the analytical solution were observed claydon et al 1992 proposed theoretical approach to predict the service life of unbonded flexible pipe and presented an analytical axisymmetric model in this model the thickness variation of each layer was ignored and geometric continuity was assumed the contact pressure between the inner and outer armour wires was calculated considering the spaces between armour wires witz 1996 reported a series of tests of an unbonded flexible pipe in cyclic axial tension axial rotation in both directions and bending with and without internal pressures ten research groups were invited to provide analytical predictions and the results were compared with test data this work is still continually used as benchmark additionally ramos et al 2000 also presented an analytical model for axisymmetric study the results were compared with the results from a fem as well as the test data presented by witz 1996 and good agreements were demonstrated thereafter custódio and vaz 2002 presented a mathematical model for the axisymmetric response of umbilical cables and flexible pipes in which the non linear stress strain curve of polyethylene obtained from tests was employed and the steel stress strain curve was fitted by ramberg osgood curve for umbilical cables the core was modeled as an elastic foundation and the tensile armour wires locking phenomenon was considered sævik and bruaseth 2005 proposed a finite element formulation for predicting the axisymmetric behavior of umbilicals incorporating material nonlinearity and gaps between individual bodies the finite element results were validated against the test data of 10 different umbilicals with respect to axial tensile stiffness and torsion stiffness in both directions bruaseth and sævik 2003 ye and bruaseth 2004 merino et al 2009 studied the extensional torsional response of flexible pipes through a finite element model implemented in the commercial fe software ansys the fe results confirmed that the friction coefficient has a very small effect on the flexible pipe axisymmetric behavior besides experimental tests of a 4 in flexible pipe in cyclic axial tension with ends axial rotation free or restricted were reported while the fe results and test data agreed with respect to tensile stiffnesses and external diameter variations a discrepancy was observed with respect to axial rotation or torque generated bahtui et al 2009 studied the flexible pipe mechanical behavior in axial tension torsion as well as bending combined with internal pressure through analytical formulation and finite element model ren et al 2014 developed a finite element model where the geometric details of the pressure armour and carcass were presented the fe results in axial tension were compared with analytical and existing test data additionally ramos et al 2014 reported a series of cyclic tension tests using a 2 5 in flexible pipe sample with ends axial rotations free or restricted and with or without internal pressure illustrating that uniform deformation assumption in tensile armour wires that is widely used in analytical modeling was not fully observed the experimental results were compared with those predicted by an analytical model assuming linear response in axisymmetric loads ramos and kawano 2015 liu and vaz 2016b a studied the effect of viscoelastic damping of polymeric layers on flexible pipe mechanical behavior in cyclic axial motion dong et al 2016 investigated the end fitting effect on tensile armour behavior in a flexible pipe subjected to axial tension in the absence of friction cornacchia et al 2019 studied the flexible pipe mechanical behavior in pure tension through analytical and finite element approaches fang et al 2019 studied the torsional behavior of metallic strip flexible pipes msfp through a finite element model and material tests of the constituted steel and hdpe were presented zhang et al 2020 presented an analytical model for a flexible pipe in axisymmetric loading where the contact mechanism between neighboring layers was modeled by penalty function and lagrange multiplier method the results were compared with fe results as well as existing test data recently more researches were published to evaluate the tensile behavior of a flexible pipe with composite tensile armour wires among others by liu et al 2020 while most of the published studies investigated intact flexible pipes a few studies were reported for damaged flexible pipe axisymmetric mechanical behavior sousa et al 2009 studied the axisymmetric response of a flexible pipe with several ruptured tensile armour wires in the outer armour wires layer through a finite element model the uneven force distribution between armour wires and the uneven pressure distribution on the underlying layers were discussed the fe results were validated against a tensile test of a 6 in flexible pipe under pure tension considering intact and damaged conditions sousa et al 2014 ji et al 2014 presented a methodology to assess the integrity of damaged flexible pipe cross sections applying a finite element model and considering several inner armour wires ruptured the stress distribution in tensile armour wires and pressure armour as well as the flexible pipe overall response in tension and bending were investigated on this basis probabilistic analysis was presented to estimate the time from first wire failure until cross section failure recently ren et al 2020 also studied the axial torsional response of an unbonded flexible pipe with ruptured tensile armour wires in the outer armour wires layer through a finite element model where the frictional effect on the recovery of damaged tensile armour wires was discussed the abovementioned studies all concerned the axial torsional structural behavior of a flexible pipe and little attention has been paid to the effect of the anti birdcage tape layer in those studies the anti birdcage tape layer was either not mentioned or simplified as an isotropic tube while the anti birdcage tape layer may not noticeably affect the flexible pipe tensile behavior it is of vital importance for the flexible pipe mechanical behavior in axial compression driven by axial compressive loads the tensile armour wires tend to expand radially and push outward the anti birdcage tape layer if the anti birdcage tape layer is not sufficiently strong to hold the armour wires radial expansion a birdcaging failure characterized by large radial deformation in the tensile armour wires may be generated rabelo et al 2015 sævik and thorsen 2017 lu et al 2017 li et al 2019b on the other hand in axial compression combined with cyclic bending the tensile armour wires may also deflect in the transverse direction and develop into lateral buckling li et al 2019a as a consequence a large pipe axial rotation will be generated and the helically wound anti birdcage tape may retard this axial rotation and slow down the lateral buckling progression depending on the tape laying direction zhou et al 2015 to date few studies have been reported on the flexible pipe mechanical behavior in axial compression sousa et al 2012 studied the flexible pipe behavior in axial compression until the formation of birdcaging failure through a finite element model where the anti birdcage tape layer was modeled as a tubular structure with orthotropic material properties also the compressive behaviors of three samples of a 4 in flexible pipe as well as the anti birdcage tape tensile behavior were tested and reported borges et al 2017 studied the birdcaging mechanism of a 6 in flexible pipe with defects on the outer sheath and anti birdcage tape layer through fe and experimental simulations moreover yoo et al 2017 presented a finite element approach to evaluate the ultimate strength of a flexible pipe in both axial tension and compression where the anti birdcage tape layer was modeled as an isotropic tube zhu and lei 2019 studied the effect of axial compression and external hydrostatic pressure on the flexible pipe axial rotational behavior no information related to the anti birdcage tape modeling was presented in the studies of flexible pipe armour wire lateral buckling the anti birdcage tape layer has usually been modeled as a non deformable tube or elastic foundations østergaard 2012 sævik and ji 2014 li et al 2018 malta and martins 2014 liu et al 2019 gonzalez et al 2019 yang et al 2020 in this study a mathematical model is developed for a flexible pipe subjected to axisymmetric loadings three modeling strategies for the anti birdcage tape layer are presented including helical tape orthotropic tube and isotropic tube the discrepancies between the results obtained from those three modeling strategies in different loading conditions are discussed parametric studies are then presented on the effects of tape layer material and geometric properties on the flexible pipe mechanical behavior in axisymmetric loadings 2 mathematical model as shown in fig 1 an unbonded flexible pipe is composed of several layers with different geometry and material properties in axisymmetric models the polymeric layers such as the outer sheath fluid barrier and anti friction tape layers are usually treated based on the theory of elastic thin walled or thick walled tubes although the anti friction tapes are helically wound structures they are often simplified as continuum tubes as they are thin and soft the introduction of this simplification is not expected to interfere with the axisymmetric analysis besides the steel helical layers such as tensile armour wires layers pressure armour and carcass are usually modeled as space curved beams alternatively as the pressure armour and carcass possess high lay angles they are often represented by orthotropic tubes sousa et al 2012 to date little attention has been paid to the precise modeling of the anti birdcage tape layer in this study three modeling approaches for this layer are presented for comparison including helical tape orthotropic tube and isotropic tube the mathematical modeling of each type of layer is introduced in detail in this section the main assumptions used throughout the analysis are outlined below the helical strips are wound as perfectly cylindrical helices over a straight pipe and the helical strips within the same layer are placed evenly and axisymmetrically all those layers are assembled perfectly with no gap or prestress the contact pressures on the layers beneath and above those helical steel strips are considered uniform disregarding the space between helical strips as the filling factors are usually big all those layers deform uniformly along a flexible pipe as a consequence relative displacements do not exist between each layer and the frictional effect is duly ignored the deformation is small and there is no lateral contact between the helical strips within the same layer all materials are assumed linear elastic isotropic end effects are not considered 2 1 homogeneous layers cylindrical polymeric layers are herein modeled based on the theory of elastic thick walled tubes consider a tube with axial length l i n i and inner and outer radii r i and r o subjected to uniform internal and external pressures p i and p o axial elongation δ l and relative axial rotation between two ends δ θ as illustrated in fig 3 the radial expansion at radius r is denoted by u r the internal and external pressures on the polymeric layers are assumed as the average pressures at the corresponding interfaces note that due to the space between helical strips the actual contact pressures between every single helical strip and the neighboring polymeric layers are slightly larger than the average contact pressures it is assumed that in small deformations the polymer layer is approximately linear elastic with constant young s modulus e p shear modulus g p and poisson s ratio ν p therefore applying the elasticity theory for isotropic materials and considering the equilibrium state of an element as shown in fig 3 c the radial expansion in the cross section can be determined by 1 u r 1 ν p 1 2 ν p e p p i r i 2 p o r o 2 r o 2 r i 2

the torque along the axial direction denoted by m z is given by 6 m z g p j δ θ l i n i g p π 4 r o 4 r i 4 δ θ l i n i where j is the polar moment of inertia of the cross section 2 2 steel helical strip layers 2 2 1 geometric relationships the steel helical strip layers including tensile armour wires layers pressure armour and carcass are modeled using space curved beam theory consider a helical beam over a straight cylindrical surface at a lay angle α i n i with the average radius r i n i in the initial configuration as shown in fig 4 a the total axial length in the initial state is l i n i an orthonormal triad of local unit vectors t n b is defined on the helical beam representing its tangential normal and bi normal directions after applying axisymmetric loadings the axial length and average radius increase respectively δ l and δ r and an axial rotation δ θ is generated the positive lay angle and rotational direction are defined as shown in fig 4 a as bending is not considered in this analysis the cylindrical surface can be expanded in the plane coordinate system as shown in fig 4 b where the solid and dashed lines represent respectively the helical beam paths before and after loading considering that the deformation is small in practical loading conditions and assuming that the deformation is uniform along the helix the strain along the helical direction can be approximately evaluated by retaining first order small terms as 7 ε t s s i n i 1 cos 2 α i n i δ l l i n i sin 2 α i n i δ r r i n i sin 2 α i n i 2 r i n i δ θ l i n i still ignoring higher order small terms the helical beam lay angle variation can be approximately determined from the geometric relationship as 8 δ α sin 2 α i n i 2 δ l l i n i δ r r i n i r i n i tan α i n i δ θ l i n i for a flexible pipe subjected to large axial loading those steel helical strips with a flat cross section are strongly restrained by the contacts from neighboring layers thus are unlikely to rotate in their helical directions therefore it is reasonable to assume that the helical beam normal direction coincides with the radial direction of the underlying cylindrical surface since the deformation is assumed uniform the helical beam lay angle is constant which renders zero geodesic curvature on the other hand the curvature component in the normal direction κ n and torsion in its helical direction τ in the initial and deformed states can be obtained easily from the darboux frame as 9a κ n i n i sin 2 α i n i r i n i κ n sin 2 α i n i δ α r i n i δ r 9b τ i n i sin 2 α i n i 2 r i n i τ sin 2 α i n i 2 δ α 2 r i n i δ r 2 2 2 constitutive relations consider the material isotropic linear elastic with young s modulus e shear modulus g and poisson s ratio ν assuming there exists no transverse contact between neighboring helical strips within each layer the tangential strain can be related to the stresses in the axial and normal directions denoted respectively by σ t and σ n through 10 ε t σ t e ν σ n e besides the cross sectional moments in the tangential and bi normal directions can be obtained from the following constitutive relationship 11a m t g j τ τ i n i 11b m b e i b κ n κ n i n i where i b is the inertia moment of the cross section in the bi normal direction and j is the torsional moment of inertia the cross sectional moment in the normal direction is deemed negligible as the geodesic curvature is zero assuming a uniform lay angle while the cross sections of tensile armour wires usually possess quasi rectangular shapes the cross sections of pressure armour and carcass are more complex whose inertias need to be carefully evaluated based on their specific profile geometries 2 2 3 equilibrium equations expanding the vectorial formed equilibrium equations for space curved beam segment derived by reissner 1981 in the local orthonormal coordinate system as shown in fig 4 a the sectional force in the bi normal direction can be obtained as 12 f b κ n m t τ m b with f b determined the distributed force per unit arc length in the normal direction can then be calculated by 13 p n κ n f t τ f b consequently for a layer containing n helical strips the average contact pressures at the outer and inner interfaces with the neighboring layers denoted respectively by p o and p i can be related by 14 p o p i n p n 2 π r i n i δ r cos α i n i δ α besides consider a helical strip with width w the average radial stress in the helical strip can be given by 15 σ n p o p i 2 2 π r i n i δ r cos α i n i δ α n w where the second fraction represents the reciprocal of the filling factor according to elasticity theory for isotropic material the thickness increment of a helical strip with a thickness t i n i can be evaluated with 16 δ t t i n i σ n e ν ε t note that the thickness variation of steel layers in a general loading condition is very small thus it could be ignored thereafter substituting eqs 7 and 15 into 10 and multiplying by the beam cross sectional area a the sectional force in its helical direction can be obtained as 17 f t e a cos 2 α i n i δ l l i n i sin 2 α i n i δ r r i n i sin 2 α i n i 2 r i n i δ θ l i n i p o p i a ν π r i n i δ r cos α i n i δ α n w subsequently the axial load and moment carried by a helical strip layer are evaluated by summing the contribution from all helical strips as 18 f z n f t cos α i n i δ α f b sin α i n i δ α 19 m z n f t sin α i n i δ α f b cos α i n i δ α r i n i δ r m t cos α i n i δ α m b sin α i n i δ α 2 3 anti birdcage tape layer consider a tape with a width w t a p e and thickness t t a p e helically wound with a lay angle α t a p e i n i over a straight cylinder with axial length l i n i and radius r i n i in the initial state as illustrated in fig 5 after loading the overall axial elongation radial expansion and axial rotation are respectively δ l δ r and δ θ the tape is assumed linear elastic in tension with tensile stiffness e a t a p e and breaking strain ε u t for the sake of comparison three modeling strategies for this layer are presented including helical tape orthotropic tube and isotropic tube 2 3 1 helical tape similarly the geometric relationships presented previously for a helical beam are still applicable for a helical tape nonetheless differing from a beam the bending torsional shear and compressive stiffnesses of a tape are all negligible besides as the helically wound tape layer is not continuous in its transversal direction the bi normal stress may exist but is merely held by friction thus it is not expected to be significant therefore only the tape tensile stiffness needs to be considered assuming that the aramid yarns deform uniformly the tape tensile force can be evaluated by 20 f t e a t a p e ε t where the axial strain ε t is given by eq 7 consequently considering that there are n tapes helically wound one above another the axial load and torque carried by the anti birdcage tape layer can be evaluated respectively by 21 f z n f t cos α t a p e i n i δ α t a p e 22 m z n f t sin α t a p e i n i δ α t a p e r i n i δ r while there exist spaces between steel helical strips the tape is usually applied with an overlap after each turn in the initial straight unloaded state to ensure that the entire underlying surface in a deformed state is covered accordingly the tape width and lay angle usually obey the following relationship 23 w t a p e 2 π r i n i cos α t a p e i n i as a consequence of overlapping the aramid yarns that constitute the tape may not be evenly distributed over the cylindrical surface which may lead to a non uniform radial expansion resistance nonetheless considering the average constraint eq 14 is still valid to describe the pressure variation across the tape layer thickness besides as the tape layer is very thin its thickness variation is not expected to interfere with the axisymmetric analysis then it may be disregarded the tape layer is deemed broken when the tensile strain obtained from eq 7 reaches the tape breaking strain 2 3 2 orthotropic tube alternatively as a simplification the tape layer may be represented by an orthotropic tubular shell with the same thickness the definition of orthotropic material involves 3 young s moduli e r e θ e z 3 poisson s ratios ν r θ ν θ z ν z r and 3 shear moduli g r θ g θ z g z r in which the subscripts r θ z represent respectively the radial angular and axial directions in this study the poisson s ratios are all assumed as zero to decouple deformations in different directions as a consequence of ignoring poisson s effect the radial expansion resistance from the tape layer may be slightly overestimated as the tape is usually applied with a large lay angle its resistance is principally in the circumferential direction therefore it is of vital importance to ensure that the resistance in the circumferential direction remains unchanged considering the tape layer as a thin walled tube the radial stress variation across its thickness can be evaluated by 24 p o p i e θ t t a p e r i n i δ r r i n i equalizing eqs 14 and 24 the hoop elastic modulus can be obtained approximately as 25 e θ n e a t a p e t t a p e sin 4 α t a p e i n i 2 π r i n i cos α t a p e i n i note that the elastic modulus given by eq 25 is only applicable to the condition of radial expansion otherwise the tape would be loose and the hoop elastic modulus negligible subsequently considering that the tape tension is principally attributed to pipe radial expansion the critical radial expansion ratio that causes tape breaking can be approximately evaluated from eq 7 by 26 δ r r i n i ε u t sin 2 α t a p e i n i combining eqs 25 and 26 the rupture stress in the circumferential direction is obtained as 27 σ θ n e a t a p e ε u t t t a p e sin 2 α t a p e i n i 2 π r i n i cos α t a p e i n i besides when the tape is tensioned the projection of the tape tensile load in the pipe axial direction would axially compress the pipe note that the tape is tensioned usually in a flexible pipe subjected to axial compression in other words the tape layer promotes axial compression on the other hand as the tape is usually loose in a flexible pipe subjected to axial tension its tensile elastic modulus in the pipe axial direction is negligible considering that the tape is applied with a large lay angle its tensile load projection in the pipe axial direction is relatively small for the sake of simplicity such a non linear elastic modulus in the axial direction e z is assumed as zero moreover as the tape layer is very thin and the poisson s effect is disregarded the elastic modulus in the radial direction e r is not expected to interfere with axisymmetric analysis which is herein assumed equal to that given by eq 25 also a unidirectional axial torque would be generated by the tape layer when it is tensioned it is noteworthy that the axial torque from the tape layer depends on the tape tensile force and laying direction rather than the pipe axial rotation magnitude and direction thus axial torque from the tape layer cannot be properly described by shear moduli in a tubular structure for the sake of simplicity the shear moduli g r θ g θ z g z r are all deemed zero 2 3 3 isotropic tube although the tape layer exhibits orthotropic properties it is often simplified as an isotropic tube in the axisymmetric analysis this simplification is based on the consideration that the tape tensile stiffness is much smaller than that of steel layers and their contribution to the pipe axial stiffness is negligible as the tape layer thickness is small the thin walled tube theory may describe its mechanical behavior alternatively the mathematical model based on thick walled tube theory presented in section 2 1 can also be used which is consistent with the thin walled tube theory in the condition of small thickness the elastic modulus of the isotropic tube is often considered as that of the filaments that constitute the tape or the average modulus over the tape cross sectional area herein to render the isotropic tube the equivalent radial expansion resistance and strength young s modulus and breaking criterion of the isotropic tube are defined respectively by eqs 25 and 26 besides a poisson s ratio of 0 3 is considered 2 4 assembling consider a flexible pipe with n layers subjected to axial tension f z t o t a l and torque m z t o t a l summing the axial tension and torque carried by each layer as discussed previously the overall axial tension and torque on the flexible pipe can be obtained respectively by 28 f z t o t a l n 1 n f z n t h l a y e r 29 m z t o t a l n 1 n m z n t h l a y e r besides boundary conditions in the radial direction need to be defined if two neighboring layers are in contact the inner radius of the outer layer and the outer radius of the inner layer should be the same i e 30 r o n t h l a y e r r i n 1 t h l a y e r on the other hand if a gap is opened between two neighboring layers the contact pressure at the interface should be zero i e 31 p o n t h l a y e r p i n 1 t h l a y e r 0 the internal pressure generated by bore fluids should be added to the internal surface of the fluid barrier the external hydrostatic pressure should be added respectively to the external surfaces of the outer sheath and the fluid barrier when the pipe annulus is dry or flooded 2 5 solution technique in summary for each layer the variables to be determined including internal and external radii pressures or gaps at the internal and external interfaces axial force and torque the external and bore pressures are considered known meanwhile the same number of equations are established the axisymmetric loads on a flexible pipe can be applied through either displacement and rotation or force and torque a matlab program is developed to solve this equations system using an incremental iterative algorithm as illustrated in fig 6 axisymmetric loads are applied linearly in n increments within each iterative increment this equations system is solved using newton s method and the results of the previous increment are taken as a guess for the roots of the next increment initially it is assumed that the tape would be tensioned in the applied loading condition if the tape tensile strain or radial displacement turns out to be negative respectively in the helical tape and orthotropic tube approaches the tape tensile stiffness should be neglected and the calculation needs to be restarted with this updated however for comparative purposes the tape tensile states are not verified in the isotropic tube approach besides the geometric continuity is assumed at all those interfaces at the beginning of the calculation if the contact pressure at an interface is evaluated as negative which is not possible in an unbonded structure the geometric continuity condition should be removed at this interface instead contact pressure at this interface needs to be defined directly as zero and unknown should be changed to the gap size if negative contact pressures are observed at several interfaces the geometric continuity conditions need to be modified tentatively at each interface until there is neither negative pressure nor penetration at all those interfaces 3 results and discussions in this section verification of the present mathematical model in axial tension rotation and compression against existing test data is presented the effects of different tape layer modeling strategies on flexible pipe mechanical behavior in each loading condition are discussed 3 1 axial tension a series of tests were reported by witz 1996 using a 2 5 in unbonded flexible pipe which serves as a good foundation for the verification of the present mathematical model in pure axial tension and rotation the main characteristics of this 2 5 in flexible pipe are summarized in table 1 the outer sheath was removed to facilitate the assembling of terminations as the anti birdcage tape layer possesses a thickness of merely 0 5 mm and exhibits overlapping according to eq 23 it is reasonable to consider that there is only one tape in this layer besides whether the given tape elastic modulus 600 mpa indicates the properties of the filaments that constitute the tape or the average modulus over the tape cross sectional area is ambiguous it is herein assumed as the average elastic modulus based on the cross sectional area with 75 mm width and 0 5 mm thickness accordingly the tape tensile stiffness can be evaluated as 22 5 kn m m and the equivalent hoop elastic modulus when the tape layer is represented by an orthotropic or isotropic tube can be obtained from eq 25 as 1 2 gpa two unpressurized tests were performed applying cyclic axial tension with end axial rotation free and restricted respectively ten research groups were invited to provide analytical estimations on this structure behavior fig 7 shows the axial force elongation data of the test with end free to rotate as well as the curves representing the mean tensile stiffness with one standard deviation on either side based on results provided by those research groups the present mathematical model indicates that the anti birdcage tape layer remains loose under this loading condition thus could be disregarded the results obtained from the present model disregarding the tape layer are presented by the dashed magenta curve in fig 7 for comparative purposes the results obtained through the approach in which the tape layer is represented by an isotropic tube with an elastic modulus of 1 2 gpa are also presented the pipe tensile stiffnesses obtained from both approaches are similar and approximately equal to 127 mn m m which coincides with the mean stiffnesses provided by other research groups this is because the tape tensile stiffness in this pipe is diminutive note that the anti birdcage tape constituted by aramid fibers such as kevlar exhibits a much larger tensile stiffness kevlar material possesses an elastic modulus as large as 124 gpa talgatti 2013 tensile tests of anti birdcage tape constituted by kevlar filaments were performed by sousa et al 2012 suggesting a tensile stiffness of 1341 kn m m to illustrate the deviation caused by the isotropic tube modeling approach for a stiff tape layer the tape tensile stiffness is now considered as 1341 kn m m in this 2 5 in flexible pipe under this circumstance the elastic modulus of the isotropic tube is obtained from eq 25 as 72 gpa the corresponding pipe axial force elongation curve applying the isotropic tube approach is shown in fig 7 for comparison which exhibits a tensile stiffness of 139 mn m m it is conspicuous that the pipe tensile stiffness is overestimated in this modeling approach thus although modeling the tape layer as an isotropic tube is not expected to cause a significant deviation on the flexible pipe tensile stiffness when the tape is relatively soft it results in an overestimated pipe tensile stiffness when the tape is stiff besides it needs to be noted that while nearly linear relationships are estimated by mathematical models non linear and hysteresis behavior was observed in the test indicating that those previously mentioned hypotheses widely employed in axisymmetric modeling may not be fully realized in the test 3 2 axial rotation moreover tests were performed using this flexible pipe sample applying twist in both directions with end axial elongation free or restricted and with no internal and external pressures the measured torque twist curves with ends prevented from moving axially are shown in fig 8 where the positive axial rotational direction is defined in fig 4 a for comparative purposes the results obtained from the present mathematical model applying different tape layer modeling approaches as well as the curves representing the mean torsional stiffnesses provided by those research groups are also presented in fig 8 according to the present mathematical model the tape is tensioned in all those loading conditions except for twisting in the positive direction with end elongation restricted it can be seen that the pipe torsional stiffnesses suggested by the present mathematical model are close to the mean values provided by those research groups no notable difference is observed applying different tape layer modeling approaches however this coincidence is no longer valid when the tape possesses a large tensile stiffness to illustrate the deviation caused by the orthotropic and isotropic tube modeling approaches the tape tensile stiffness is varied from zero to 1500 kn m m and the corresponding pipe torsional stiffnesses in both directions with end axial movement free or restricted applying those three tape layer modeling approaches are presented in fig 9 besides considering the tape laid with the same angle but in the opposite direction the pipe torsional stiffnesses obtained from the helical tape approach are also presented in fig 9 it is evident that the discrepancies between different modeling approaches grow with the tape tensile stiffness note that the tape layer is loose in the condition of positive twisting with end elongation restricted thus the pipe torsional stiffnesses in this condition applying the helical tape and orthotropic tube approaches are not affected by the tape tensile stiffness which is represented by the black dash dot line in fig 9 except for this condition it can be observed that applying the helical tape approach the pipe torsional stiffnesses are affected by reverting the tape laying direction as the reaction torque from the tape layer becomes opposite a flexible pipe would be torsional stiffer if the tape laying direction is along the axial rotational direction however the effect of tape laying direction is not represented when the tape layer is modeled as a tubular structure comparing those black blue and red curves in fig 9 the pipe rotational stiffness suggested by the orthotropic tube approach lies in the middle of those given by the helical tape approach considering opposite tape laying directions this is due to the ignorance of axial rotational stiffness in the orthotropic tube approach besides comparing the orthotropic and isotropic tube modeling approaches the pipe rotational stiffness obtained from the latter is always larger as the axial torque from the tape layer is improperly counted in this approach see the blue and green curves in fig 9 thus for a flexible pipe with a stiff tape layer in axial rotation more reasonable results can be obtained through the helical tape modeling approach observing those curves obtained through the helical tape approach in fig 9 except for those representing the condition of positive twisting with end elongation restricted it is noteworthy that the pipe torsional stiffnesses increase monotonically and verge upon limits asymptotically with increasing tape tensile stiffness the limits correspond to the state in which the tape layer is extremely stiff so that the tensile armour wires are not allowed to expand radially in the condition of positive twisting with end elongation free as the inner and outer tensile armour wires are squeezed and their radial movement tendencies are approximately balanced their radial expansion can be restricted by a relatively small resistance from the tape layer thus the pipe torsional stiffness in this condition is stabilized when the tape tensile stiffness reaches approximately 500 kn m m on the other hand in the condition of negative twisting the inner and outer tensile armour wires tend to be separated and a larger radial restriction is thus demanded to resist the outer armour wires radial expansions as a consequence the pipe torsional stiffnesses in the negative rotational direction are still increasing until the given maximum tape tensile stiffness in fig 9 3 3 axial compression a series of flexible pipe compressive tests as well as anti birdcage tape tensile tests were reported in sousa et al 2012 which will be used for the validation of the present model in axial compression the main characteristics of this 4 in flexible pipe are summarized in table 2 the anti birdcage tape is a fabric composed of various aramid yarns the tape number in the anti birdcage tape layer was not specified it is herein assumed as one 3 3 1 tape stiffness and strength tests using the anti birdcage tape extracted from this 4 in flexible pipe tape samples were prepared with ends fixed by aluminum plates with the help of acrylic resin with a free span length of 0 5 m a series of tape tensile tests were performed demonstrating an approximately linear force elongation relationship until tape breaking the measured tape tensile stiffness and breaking strain are respectively 1341 kn m m and 2 1 nevertheless caution should be exercised when applying those measured tape properties in tape layer modeling a series of tensile tests on a 130 mm wide anti birdcage tape constituted by 85 kevlar filaments was reported in petrobras 2009 besides the sample of complete tape samples were also prepared with respectively 1 3 5 10 kevlar filaments applying the average filament tensile stiffness obtained from those tests with 1 3 5 10 filaments the tensile stiffness of complete tape can be evaluated as 1245 kn m m which is similar to that reported in sousa et al 2012 however the tape tensile stiffness obtained from the test of complete tape is merely 650 kn m m this great discrepancy is due to the fact that tensile load distribution between the filaments is not uniform some filaments may be still in a loose state while others strongly tensioned consequently the breakage did not occur uniformly some filaments broke and others did not furthermore for a tape helically wound over a flexible pipe the tensile states of the filaments are more complex any small geometric asymmetry between the helically wound aramid yarns would cause non uniform tension distribution between them thus the acting tape layer resistance in a flexible pipe may be overestimated by applying the tape properties obtained in ideal test conditions 3 3 2 compressive tests and model validation three samples of 4 in flexible pipe with ends free to rotate axially and no internal and external pressures were tested applying axial compression until the formation of birdcaging the measured pipe end shortenings radial expansions and average axial rotations per unit length in axial compression as well as the results obtained from a finite element model developed by sousa et al 2012 are presented respectively in figs 10 12 in fig 11 the radial expansion ratio is defined as the ratio of pipe outer diameter increment to the initial pipe outer diameter as shown in fig 10 the measured pipe axial compressive stiffness and average buckling load are respectively 22 1 mn m m and 256 kn in wet annulus conditions this critical load can be generated by the reversed end cap effect at a water depth of 2236 m according to fig 11 the measured radial expansive stiffness defined by the ratio of axial compressive load to radial expansion ratio is approximately 14 0 mn m m besides although the pipe axial rotations are not repetitive in those three tests they demonstrate similar inclinations see fig 12 the increment of axial rotation per unit pipe length generated by a unit axial compressive load is approximately 2 0 1 0 6 deg mn good agreements were observed between the finite element results and test data the anti birdcage tape layer was modeled as an orthotropic cylindrical shell in this finite element model but no information was presented on the calculation of its properties applying the measured tape properties the flexible pipe mechanical responses obtained from the present mathematical model with different tape layer modeling strategies are also presented in figs 10 12 the ends of those curves represent the conditions of tape breakage it is verified that the other layers are still in the elastic stage when the tape layer breaks from fig 11 it can be observed that the radial expansions at the moments of tape layer breakage obtained from tests and the present model are approximate indicating that the tape layer failed approximately at the measured breaking strain however as shown in fig 10 the pipe axial compressive stiffnesses and the critical axial compressive loads to cause tape layer breakage obtained through the helical tape orthotropic tube and isotropic tube modeling approaches are respectively 38 9 mn m m 39 4 mn m m 44 0 mn m m and 564 kn 568 kn 619 kn they are approximately twice the corresponding measured values this indicates that the tape layer stiffness is significantly overestimated the discrepancy in the buckling load estimation applying tape breakage criterion was also observed by sævik and thorsen 2017 through an analytical model 32 p r tan 2 α n t σ u t a t sin 2 α t cos α t r t 2 π e s ε u t t s where r and r t are respectively the mean radii of tensile armour wires layers and anti birdcage tape layer n t is the number of tapes a t α t ε u t σ u t are respectively the tape cross sectional area lay angle breaking strain and ultimate stress e s is the outer sheath young s modulus and t s is the outer sheath thickness the first and second terms in eq 32 represent respectively the contributions from the anti birdcage tape layer and the outer sheath the critical load given by this analytical formulation is 592 kn where 523 kn is contributed by the anti birdcage tape layer and 69 kn is contributed by the outer sheath this is close to the limit loads obtained from the present mathematical model note that in the work from sævik and thorsen 2017 the tape number in this flexible pipe was assumed as two so that the critical load for tape breakage given by eq 32 was approximately doubled as 1110 kn no matter whether existing one or two tapes the analytical estimations on the critical loads for tape layer breakage are much larger than the measured buckling loads to bring the buckling load estimation closer to the measured ones other buckling criteria were proposed by sævik and thorsen 2017 including helical beam radial instability in an elastic foundation and armour wires yielding the buckling limit was then evaluated by the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals of those three critical loads obtained from each criterion although the critical loads obtained from every criterion are larger than the measured buckling loads the final estimation after this manipulation is close to the measured ones indeed flexible pipe birdcaging is a complex problem that may involve different triggering mechanisms however explanations for the divergence in the estimations of pipe axial compressive stiffness and radial expansion are still needed as previously declared the tape tensile stiffness obtained in ideal test conditions should be used with caution assuming that the acting tape tensile stiffness in this flexible pipe is 543 kn m m which is close to that reported in petrobras 2009 the corresponding pipe mechanical responses obtained from the present mathematical model are presented in figs 10 12 also the ends of those curves represent the conditions of tape layer breakage observing those curves obtained from the helical tape modeling approach it can be seen that by merely reducing the tape tensile stiffness the pipe axial compressive stiffness radial expansion as well as buckling limit all become approximate to the test data this proves the conjecture that the acting tape tensile stiffness may be overestimated on the other hand discrepancies between the calculated and measured pipe axial rotations are observed in fig 12 note that the pipe axial rotation in axial compression is very small and it is sensitive to the hypotheses employed in the mathematical model for instance considering uncertainties in fabrication and displacements induced by cyclic loadings the inner and outer tensile armour wires laying angles may not be precisely 35 degrees fig 13 shows the sensitivity of the pipe axial compressive and radial expansive stiffnesses and axial rotation per unit length per unit axial compressive load to the lay angles of inner and outer tensile armour wires the vertical coordinate denotes the ratios of the results obtained from the present model using the helical tape modeling approach to the corresponding measured data the coincidence between calculated and measured data is observed when this ratio is equal to one conspicuously while slightly modifying the armour wires lay angles has small effects on the axial compressive and radial expansive stiffnesses it significantly affects the pipe axial rotation good agreement on pipe axial rotation can be obtained when the inner and outer armour wires lay angles are respectively 35 4 degrees and 34 5 degrees apart from that the hypotheses related to the armour wires cross sectional areas geometric imperfections boundary effect etc may also affect the pipe axial rotation which renders the calibration difficult thus due to the uncertainties in flexible pipe tests and hypotheses adopted in the analytical model development it is difficult to precisely estimate flexible pipe axial rotation besides evident discrepancies between the results obtained from different tape layer modeling approaches are observed in figs 10 12 whose reasons will be discussed in the following section 3 3 3 parametric studies varying the tape tensile stiffness from zero to 1500 kn m m and considering different tape lay angles and directions the flexible pipe axial compressive stiffnesses radial expansion ratios and axial rotations per unit pipe length per unit axial compressive load obtained from different tape layer modeling approaches are shown respectively in figs 14 16 observing those curves obtained from the helical tape modeling approach in figs 14 and 15 it can be seen that increasing either the tape tensile stiffness or lay angle results in larger pipe axial compressive stiffnesses and smaller radial expansions besides the tape laying direction has a negligible effect on pipe axial compressive stiffness and radial expansion nevertheless evident discrepancies between the results obtained from different tape layer modeling approaches are observed although the present tape layer modeling approaches offer approximately identical hoop resistance they exhibit dissimilar axial mechanical behaviors in reality the projection of the tape tensile force in the pipe axial direction tends to compress the pipe however this is ignored when the tape layer is modeled as an orthotropic tube while the effect of this simplification is negligible when the tape lay angle is 85 degrees it becomes notable when the tape lay angle is 75 degrees see figs 14 and 15 thus when the tape is applied with a relatively small lay angle modeling the tape layer as an orthotropic tube would slightly overestimate the pipe axial compressive stiffness and underestimate the pipe radial expansion worse still representing the tape layer as an isotropic tube exhibits false resistance to axial compression therefore the pipe axial compressive stiffness is overestimated through this approach see fig 14 also as the isotropic tube exhibits axial resistance smaller compressive loads would be carried by the tensile armour wires layers consequently for a pipe subjected to a certain axial compressive load the radial expansion would be underestimated through this approach see fig 15 while the tape laying direction has a negligible effect on pipe axial compressive stiffness and radial expansion it is recognized as a significant inducement to pipe axial rotation observing the black and red curves in fig 16 changing the tape laying direction from positive to negative reverses the torque from the tape layer thus reduces the axial rotation as the axial torque is ignored in the orthotropic tube approach the blue curves are approximately in the middle of the corresponding black and red curves in fig 16 moreover as the isotropic tube approach offers a false rotational resistance the generated axial rotation is smaller than that obtained from the orthotropic tube approach moreover varying the tape tensile stiffness from zero to 1500 kn m m the ratios of axial compressive loads carried by each layer to the total applied axial compression are presented in fig 17 besides considering the tape tensile stiffness as 543 kn m m and varying the tape lay angle and direction the axial compressive load carrying ratios of each layer are presented in fig 18 observing those curves obtained from the helical tape modeling approach in fig 17 the axial compressive load carrying ratios of the tensile armour wires layers increase and verge upon limits asymptotically with increasing tape tensile stiffness the limits correspond to the condition of an unexpansive tape layer from the results obtained from the helical tape approach in fig 18 it can be seen that the axial compressive load carrying ratio of the anti birdcage tape layer is negative as this layer facilitates axial compression it is also noteworthy that the tensile armour wires layer with the same laying direction of the anti birdcage tape layer carries more axial compressive loads than the tensile armour wires layer with an opposite laying direction especially at a relatively small tape lay angle consider that in axial compression lateral buckling may take place in the inner armour wires layer due to less frictional resistance from this perspective it is preferable to apply the anti birdcage tape in the helical direction of outer armour wires so that smaller compressive loads are imposed on the inner armour wires layer this has been claimed by zhou et al 2015 still significant discrepancies are observed between those results obtained from different tape layer modeling approaches in figs 17 18 modeling the tape layer as an orthotropic tube disregards the torque from this layer thus results in imprecise estimations on axial compressive load distribution between the inner and outer tensile armour wires layers worse still larger deviations in axial compressive load distribution are observed applying the isotropic tube modeling approach as in which the tape layer rotational and axial resistance are improperly represented additionally employing tape layer breakage as the birdcaging triggering criterion the critical axial compression obtained at different tape tensile stiffnesses lay angles and directions are shown in figs 19 and 20 observing those results obtained from the helical tape approach birdcaging limit increases linearly with increasing tape tensile stiffness and exponentially and asymptotically with increasing tape lay angle besides the tape laying direction is recognized with a negligible effect on birdcaging limit moreover while the birdcaging limits suggested by the orthotropic tube approach are similar to those obtained from the helical tape approach the birdcaging limits are overestimated when the tape layer is modeled as an isotropic tube as an additional axial compressive load is needed to compress it 4 conclusions this paper presents a mathematical model for an unbonded flexible pipe subjected to axisymmetric loadings three modeling strategies for the anti birdcage tape layer are presented including helical tape orthotropic tube and isotropic tube although modeling the anti birdcage tape layer through those three approaches exhibit approximately identical radial expansive resistance and strength their mechanical behaviors in pipe axial and rotational directions are dissimilar in practical applications axial compression and unidirectional axial torque would be generated by the anti birdcage tape layer when it is tensioned when the tape layer is loose its effect on flexible pipe mechanical behavior can be disregarded while those non linear mechanical behaviors are represented in the helical tape modeling approach they cannot be fully replicated by either orthotropic or isotropic tubes consequently modeling the tape layer as a tubular structure results in deviation in the estimation of some mechanical behaviors of a flexible pipe this is especially the case when the tape is stiff based on the results obtained from the helical tape modeling approach either applying a tape with larger tensile stiffness or winding the tape at a larger lay angle would increase the radial expansive resistance and strength consequently larger pipe axial compressive stiffness and birdcaging limit can be obtained besides while reverting tape laying direction has a negligible effect on radial expansive resistance and strength it reverts the axial torque from the tape layer when it is tensioned this affects the flexible pipe torsional behavior and axial load distribution between different layers concerning the risk of lateral buckling in the inner tensile armour wires layer it is preferable to apply the anti birdcage tape in the helical direction of outer armour wires so that smaller axial compressive loads are imposed on the inner armour wires layer moreover as the filaments that constitute the tape may not deflect uniformly in a flexible pipe caution should be exercised when applying the tape tensile stiffness measured in ideal test conditions additional experimental tests are needed to further prove this conjecture and determine the deviation range of acting tape tensile stiffness in a flexible pipe lastly it needs to be emphasized that the present mathematical model is based on several hypotheses as summarized before those hypotheses may not always hold in a practical flexible pipe structure and their effects need to be carefully checked credit authorship

very different a ship with mathematical hull and an actual lng ship the existing results show the possibility of collecting reliable unsteady wave data for analysis or validation purposes image processing methods such as shigeru et al 1998 are promising for the methods mentioned above however light scattering diffusion or light source control under breaking conditions is imperfect in the current towing tank test system contact type wave probes have an intrinsic possibility of unintended disturbance on unsteady waves meanwhile the mean position change and motion variation in waves is an important parameter for disturbed wave elevation to this end unsteady wave analysis for a vertical motion free model is performed using a non contact measurement device measurement is carried out

levels during this process some important characteristics are observed and comparison between steady waves in deep and calm water and the time average of unsteady waves in regular waves is performed in addition validation examples with linear computation results using the rankine panel method are shown 2 analysis method unsteady wave elevation can be measured during the standard towing tanks including a resistance test and self propulsion test both with and without incident waves each towing tank test method is well described in the ittc 2014 2017a 2017b and seakeeping tests done in the towing tank at seoul national university are summarized in lee et al 2017 park et al 2015 and lee et al 2018 but the measurement of wave elevation requires additional effort from the experimental procedures for hydrodynamic forces and motion responses in this section only the measurement of wave elevation is explained let s consider a right hand cartesian coordinate system as shown in fig 1 the variable u is the advancing speed l is the length between perpendicular of the model and ζ x y t is the instantaneous free surface elevation at position x y and time t the origin of the coordinate system lies on the midship of the model center of the model and on the undisturbed free surface ultrasonic sensors are placed within a range which grid covers from the bow to the stern area 0 7 x l 0 7 0 y l 0 28 which includes up to 840 discrete measurement points for one wavelength a minimum 15 to 30 spatial grid is included fig 1 shows the two grid systems the locations of elevation sensors in the towing tank experiment and the solution grids for numerical computation which will be described later the measurement frequency is 40 hz which is sufficient to capture the considered signals the target variables achieved in this study and their functional relationship between target variable and related parameters are summarized in eqs 1 5 the measured free surface elevation in unsteady conditions can be broken down into mean 0 th linear 1 st and higher 2 nd 3 rd and so on harmonic components plus residual components as in eq 5 fourier transform or fourier series with the least squares method is used in this decomposition process 1 heave motion rao ξ 3 ξ 3 a f a u 2 p i t c h m o t i o n r a o ξ 5 ξ 5 k a f a k u 3 a d d e d r e s i s tan c e r a w r w r s w ρ g a 2 b 2 l f

5m deep and has a wave maker with 8 flaps fig 2 shows the experimental scheme and wave measurement system used in this study and the measurement parameters of devices are listed in table 1 although motion responses and added resistance in waves are measured simultaneously this paper focused on the observation of unsteady wave components and a more thorough investigation related to motion response added resistance mean position and other wave elevation components near the hull can be delivered through another paper wave elevations around the ship hull have been measured by using an array of 4 2 ultrasonic sensors due to the limited number of sensors many repeat runs should be performed to characterize the full wave pattern more importantly there is interaction between the sensors when they are too close this is a limitation factor in the arrangement of the sensors during these repeat tests up to three different position sets were achieved in single run considering the incident wave characteristics and towing tank dimension benjamin fier instability benjamin and feir 1967 should be considered in this type of the test in other words the wave amplitude and phase modulation should be considered in a long towing tank normalization with a measured incident wave tracking the model can solve this problem this normalization issue will be discussed in the following section the position of the fixed wave probe near the wave maker was set at 11 m from wave maker considering the wavelength of local evanescent mode the blockage effect was determined based on ittc 2017 ittc 2017b and the experimental conditions were considered to minimize the blockage effects in seakeeping test the waiting time was set to be regular for the same wave conditions between 15 and 20 min according to wave height the water temperature was 24 4 c and the temperature variation was less than 1 0 c throughout the entire measurement analysis of the experimental data was based on ittc 2014 2017a and more details are summarized in lee et al 2018 uncertainty must be mentioned in towing tank experiment as well known the uncertainty analysis of seakeeping experiment is not simple since the uncertainty level is a function of multiple parameters e g wave amplitude and frequencies ship speed and load conditions many repeated tests are essential for each wave condition but it is very hard to carry out numerous tests in practical point of view this experiment is a follow up experiment of park et al 2015 which adopts the procedure of ittc ittc 2017b therefore their uncertainty analysis is valid for this seakeeping experiment it should be mentioned that the wave pattern radiating from a ship is dependent on the brard number s t τ uω e g where ω e indicates the encounter wave frequency as well known the wave patterns are different when τ is greater than 0 25 or smaller than 0 25 and the difference of such cases due to the propagation speed of the group velocity of the waves generated by the ship motion and details can be found in many existing references e g faltinsen 1990 in this study all the wave conditions are greater than 0 25 however the present measurement is done in local area around ships and the decomposition of wave direction and pattern is beyond of this research that is the analysis is carried out focusing on for steady mean and n th order harmonic components 3 ship model and test conditions two ship models are considered in this study a real ship hull and a mathematical hull the former is the s lngc kim et al 2017 kim et al 2019 provided by samsung heavy industry and the other is a blunt modified wigley hull which is defined as eq 6 kashiwagi 2013 yang et al 2020 6 y 1 z 2 1 x 2 1 0 6 x 2 x 4 z 2 1 z 8 1 x 2 4 x x 2 l y y 2 b z z d here d is the ship draft for the modified wigley hull form the vertical wall side is set above the mean water level while the s lngc model has a practical hull shape including a bow flare bulbous bow and transom stern see fig 3 the main dimensions are listed in table 2 and each model is set to satisfy the original target parameter within the 3 error test conditions for the modified wigley in calm water and in waves are listed in table 3 for representative cases which are emphasized in table 3 1 measurements were performed over the entire range 0 7 x l 0 7 otherwise measurements were focused on the bow range 0 1 x l 0 7 test conditions for the s lngc in calm water and in waves are listed in table 4 measurements were conducted for the bow range 0 1 x l 0 7 and non dimensional wave conditions were set to be similar to those used for the modified wigley model towing speed was constant at the designed speed the surge heave and pitch motions were set to be free and a soft spring system of 380 n m was adopted for the surge motion of the ships the details about the soft spring can be found in the paper of lee et al 2017 4 sensitivity study for wave elevation measurement confirming the uniformity of the undisturbed incident wave is important to this end several parameters can be checked the frequency of the incident wave ω the first and second harmonic amplitudes ζ a 1 and ζ a 2 and spatial modulation along the advancing direction as the amplitude of generated wave increases a careful check is required particularly for higher order components since their magnitude becomes larger fig 4 shows the repeatability of the first and second harmonic amplitudes of incident waves here the results are normalized based on the input wave amplitude the normalized wave amplitudes are approximately 0 97 which means that the linear amplitudes of generated waves are about 3 lower than the input value see fig 4 a and this repeatability of the wave generation seems acceptable for the present analysis the magnitude of the second harmonic follows the 2nd order stokes wave theory but the standard deviation of the second harmonic component is higher than that of the first harmonic component therefore careful treatment is needed for analyzing the non linear parts in the small scale model test based on the present observation the overall repeatability of incident waves is in a reasonable range spatial modulation of the waves also should be considered during the towing tank test as described by lake et al 1977 modulation of the wave propagation along the longitudinal towing tank can be observed because of side wall friction and the instability of the nonlinear wave structure fig 5 shows a comparison of the measured wave signals at a fixed point near the wave maker and at the front position of the moving towing carriage the wave signal near the wave maker shows better uniformity then the signal measured at moving carriage this difference must be considered in the analysis of experimental data fig 6 shows an example of the normalized first harmonic wave amplitudes which were measured at eight sensors and 14 repeated tests for the blunt wigley hull each symbol represents the normalized linear amplitude of each repeated run and the normalization was done based on the both input wave amplitude and measured wave amplitude in this figure a earth fixed means the wave amplitude measured at a fixed point near the wave maker and a carriage is the wave amplitude measured in front of the moving carriage this figure shows also the standard deviations of 14 values for each condition this example shows that the suitable reliability can be achieved in the present experiment in this study it is hard to suggest any procedure which is more appropriate in the choice of reference wave elevation for normalization therefore this issue must be studied in a more systematic manner 5 results and discussions 5 1 steady wave and mean wave components the results of this study are displayed in several different manners including instant wave contours and amplitude contours fig 7 shows the elevation contour normalized by the ship length ζ l near the bow 0 1 x l 0 7 of the blunt wigley hull in calm water condition this modified wigley hull is not optimized for hydrodynamic performance and significant wave breaking and wake are observed see ① in fig 7 the measured wave pattern captures well the largest peak near the bow front see fig 7 upper around the ship shoulder a wave trough line is shown in the photo see ② in fig 7 overall the measured wave amplitude describes well the characteristics of bow waves under steady conditions in addition the wave cut at y b 0 7 for the steady wave is compared with published wave cut analysis data iwashita et al 2011 see fig 8 which used a 2 5 m ship model the wave length and bow and stern peak amplitudes are very similar despite some difference in crest and trough differences between the published paper and this study may come mostly from the difference of measurement scheme and resolution of elevation measurement breaking waves are clearly visible for fn 0 20 while not much breaking occurs for fn 0 15 see fig 9 for fn 0 2 breaking is so clear that the bow and shoulder separation wave is not clearly visible as can be seen in ① of fig 9 this difference affects the mean wave pattern in this study measurements were focused on fn 0 2 where clear nonlinear phenomena can be captured one interesting aspect of these results is the change in the mean wave or kevin wake characteristics in calm water and in regular waves the wigley model has a vertical wall above the wetted surface therefore the nonlinear hull form effect on the mean wave component is expected to be lower than that of the s lngc in fig 10 steady and mean wave contours near the bow and shoulder are divided by the ship length l the first row shows the time averaged steady wave component in calm water and the others show the mean wave component zero th order wave analyzed from the unsteady wave component with different incident waves in this case slight differences can be found in the detailed comparison but overall trends are very similar in detail the peaks and troughs in the presence of incident waves are smaller with respect to both range and amplitude in short wave conditions neither the motion nor the dynamic sinkage and trim meaningfully vary according to incident wave non linearity in other words with high frequency waves both the ship motion and change in static position are relatively small according to the wave amplitude variation in addition for the blunt modified wigley the bow wave is already high enough in the calm water case see figs 9 and 10 based on the above observation it is concluded that if there is no significant change in the position of the hull in either static or dynamic situations the mean value of the disturbed wave near the bow does not significantly differ in waves 5 2 unsteady wave component fig 11 a and b show the snapshots of the wave component for unsteady conditions in the physical scale the upper figure illustrates the experimentally measured results and the lower one presents the photometry captured during the experiment when the incident wave crest coincides with the ship front large pressure variation occurs and the peak amplitude can be observed for steeper waves as the diffracted waves go higher more resultant breaking waves are observed fig 11 b observing the wave cut near the ship hull fig 11 c nonlinearity is strong near the bow front and shoulder parts where disturbances are largest in fig 12 the wave amplitude contour of the entire domain 0 7 x l 0 7 is represented from the time averaged mean value to the 3rd order harmonic the wave amplitude plots show that the wave component is dominant around the ship bow for all components and the stern is also important for mean wave and linear wave components nonlinear components are mostly important in the bow and negligible in the stern furthermore speed effects are dominant for the mean wave component and less effective for the first and harmonic waves for the parametric study the wave components near the bow are compared for different wave lengths in fig 13 according to this result it seems that the first harmonic wave amplitude ζ 1 a is a little affected by the wave length as the wavelength increases the wave intensity and propagation angle become stronger and wider the diverging angle for the 2nd order component also changes although the magnitude is not high the combined elevation in fig 13 d shows the relative importance of the mean and first harmonic wave components for different wave conditions particularly it shows that the wave elevation nondimensionalized by incident wave amplitude becomes weaker as the length is shorter 5 3 comparison of different hull forms in the case of experiment for the s lngc hull the incident wave conditions and measurement domain are similar to those for the modified wigley model but the elevation sensors could not be installed close to the hull surface as much as the blunt wigley hull due to the flare above the still water level fig 14 shows that the steady wave elevation around the s lngc hull for fn 0 188 here the red line shows the waterline in calm water and the photo shows an upper deck flare fig 15 shows instantaneous wave elevation combination of the harmonic components up to the 3 rd order as expected the reconstructed elevation shows good consistency with snapshots fig 16 represents the harmonic amplitude plot for various wave periods and the overall trend is similar to that of the blunt wigley hull however there must be small difference due to different waterline profile and sectional profiles between the two ships unfortunately the wave elevation close to the ship bow is unavailable therefore the detailed difference near bow cannot be clearly observed from the observation on the results for the s lngc and blunt modified wigley hull forms several clear differences can be found the modified wigley model has a vertical side wall above the mean waterline and the s lngc has bow flare and transom stern parts in addition the modified wigley has no bulb and significant wave breaking occurs in steady wave conditions the modified wigley caused a far larger wave to form around the bow hull form see fig 17 a in fig 17 b the wave cuts for various positions y l are compared for each hull form and the dotted line in fig 17 a depicts locations the first peak value is nearly three times larger even for the side position y l 0 06 see fig 17 b and the following trough and second peak are also several times larger for the modified wigley these differences are obviously partly due to the difference of ship speed and also partly due to the bulb effect of the s lngc and the concave shape of the bow furthermore the wave length for the blunt wigley appears to be shorter than that of the s lngc in fig 17 a for the first harmonic wave amplitude the reflection angle is similar for the two hull forms and the peak amplitude is similar under the same wave conditions in these conditions the ship motions in the vertical plane are small therefore the diffraction component is dominant for unsteady waves the detailed disturbance range and intensity of the 1 st harmonic amplitude for the s lngc are smaller see fig 18 which may be due to the efficient hull shape of the s lngc however the direct comparison of the two ships must be cautious since the froude numbers are slightly different 6 comparison with computational solutions computational results are compared with the measured wave components the numerical wave component is obtained by solving the linear potential problem based on the rankine panel method particularly the wish program developed at seoul national university kim and kim 2009 2011 2011 lee et al 2017 has been applied the wish program is a well known program for seakeeping analysis which adopts the b spline scheme for velocity potential and wave elevation this program solves the linear weakly nonlinear and weak scatterer problems for the motion responses and wave loads on ships and structures since many papers about the application of the wish program were already published the details are not included in this paper an example of solution panels is shown in figs 1 and 19 and other conditions are set to be same as those used in the experiments three comparison sets include the steady wave component in calm water instantaneous wave contour at different time instants and linear wave amplitude contours in figs 20 23 comparison results for the blunt wigley are shown according to fig 20 the measured steady wave component is slightly larger and the wavelengths in downstream from the ship shoulder are a little different as described above the waves around this ship have significant nonlinearities such as wave breaking therefore some discrepancy with the computational results based on linear boundary value problem is inevitable however the agreement of overall wave pattern is obvious fig 21 shows two instantaneous elevation contours in regular wave conditions like the steady wave case the agreement of overall wave pattern between experiment and computation is very clear figs 22 and 23 represent the amplitude contours of unsteady wave train experimental results and numerical results have similar divergence angles although the intensity is different it should be stated that the intensity of wave amplitude is dependent on wave steepness and this is the case when the wave steepness is higher than the case of fig 22 therefore the amplitude intensity is larger than the case of fig 21 and computational results particularly such trend is clearly shown in fig 23 which compares the overall range measurement and numerical results for different advancing speeds similar validation sets can be observed for the s lngc hull form as shown in figs 24 and 25 overall trends like the wave divergence angle or position of the peak amplitude are similar between measurement and computation results and the phase and magnitude of unsteady waves are similar however experimental results show larger intensity than linear results which may arise because linear solution in this study does not consider the wake breaking waves viscosity or nonlinear hull form effects for the s lngc hull the bow flares which is related to plunging wave breaking the wave pattern differs near the position of the overturning wave at the bow shoulder this may lead to differences between linear calculation and model measurement even in steady calm water and linear wave conditions 7 conclusions in this study steady and unsteady wave elevations were measured around two hull forms in head sea condition the mean linear and second order components of wave elevation were compared for different wave steepness speed and hull forms based on this research the following conclusions are made data sets for unsteady wave components are obtained for a mathematical hull and a practical ship hull the instantaneous local and global free surface elevations were collected around the ships under free vertical motion in head waves and these data can be good reference data for benchmark test or validation data of numerical computation repeat tests showed the reliability of the present analysis scheme to achieve better accuracy of elevation measurement careful measurement and outlier analysis are needed particularly when the wave steepness becomes high moreover it should be aware that the wave signals measured near the model hull and near the wave maker may have some difference resulting in different normalized quantities of wave elevation such difference may be increased when the nonlinearity of incident waves and or bow waves are stronger and wave length is short it is obvious that uncertainty of measurement is sensitive to the accuracy of wave amplitude particularly in short waves this issue must be carefully studied in the future in the observation on the mean and harmonic components of the disturbed wave elevation around the ship hulls the nonlinearity is clear around the ship bow and stern where large pressure variation occurs although the linear component is dominant the nonlinear components are not ignorable and the degree of nonlinearity differs for each condition differences can be found related to wave breaking and the resultant disturbed wave for various advancing speeds the comparison of wave elevation and component between numerical computation and experimental measurement shows fair agreement the computational results based on linear potential theory and rankine panel method show very similar wave component and bow wave angle although the intensity of wave amplitude are slightly different this can justify the applicability of linear potential theory in seakeeping analysis even though it does not consider the ship wake wave breaking or nonlinear components credit authorship contribution statement jaehoon lee investigation experiment computation

procedures for hydrodynamic forces and motion responses in this section only the measurement of wave elevation is explained let s consider a right hand cartesian coordinate system as shown in fig 1 the variable u is the advancing speed l is the length between perpendicular of the model and ζ x y t is the instantaneous free surface elevation at position x y and time t the origin of the coordinate system lies on the midship of the model center of the model and on the undisturbed free surface ultrasonic sensors are placed within a range which grid covers from the bow to the stern area 0 7 x l 0 7 0 y l 0 28 which includes up to 840 discrete measurement points for one wavelength a minimum 15 to 30 spatial grid is included fig 1 shows the two grid systems the locations of elevation sensors in the towing tank experiment and the solution grids for numerical computation which will be described later the measurement frequency is 40 hz which is sufficient to capture the considered signals the target variables achieved in this study and their functional relationship between target variable and related parameters are summarized in eqs 1 5 the measured free surface elevation in unsteady conditions can be broken down into mean 0 th linear 1 st and higher 2 nd 3 rd and so on harmonic components plus residual components as in eq 5 fourier transform or fourier series with the least squares method is used in this decomposition process 1 heave motion rao ξ 3 ξ 3 a f a u 2 p i t c h m o t i o n r a o ξ 5 ξ 5 k a f a k u 3 a d d e d r e s i s tan c e r a w r w r s w ρ g a 2 b 2 l f

5m deep and has a wave maker with 8 flaps fig 2 shows the experimental scheme and wave measurement system used in this study and the measurement parameters of devices are listed in table 1 although motion responses and added resistance in waves are measured simultaneously this paper focused on the observation of unsteady wave components and a more thorough investigation related to motion response added resistance mean position and other wave elevation components near the hull can be delivered through another paper wave elevations around the ship hull have been measured by using an array of 4 2 ultrasonic sensors due to the limited number of sensors many repeat runs should be performed to characterize the full wave pattern more importantly there is interaction between the sensors when they are too close this is a limitation factor in the arrangement of the sensors during these repeat tests up to three different position sets were achieved in single run considering the incident wave characteristics and towing tank dimension benjamin fier instability benjamin and feir 1967 should be considered in this type of the test in other words the wave amplitude and phase modulation should be considered in a long towing tank normalization with a measured incident wave tracking the model can solve this problem this normalization issue will be discussed in the following section the position of the fixed wave probe near the wave maker was set at 11 m from wave maker considering the wavelength of local evanescent mode the blockage effect was determined based on ittc 2017 ittc 2017b and the experimental conditions were considered to minimize the blockage effects in seakeeping test the waiting time was set to be regular for the same wave conditions between 15 and 20 min according to wave height the water temperature was 24 4 c and the temperature variation was less than 1 0 c throughout the entire measurement analysis of the experimental data was based on ittc 2014 2017a and more details are summarized in lee et al 2018 uncertainty must be mentioned in towing tank experiment as well known the uncertainty analysis of seakeeping experiment is not simple since the uncertainty level is a function of multiple parameters e g wave amplitude and frequencies ship speed and load conditions many repeated tests are essential for each wave condition but it is very hard to carry out numerous tests in practical point of view this experiment is a follow up experiment of park et al 2015 which adopts the procedure of ittc ittc 2017b therefore their uncertainty analysis is valid for this seakeeping experiment it should be mentioned that the wave pattern radiating from a ship is dependent on the brard number s t τ uω e g where ω e indicates the encounter wave frequency as well known the wave patterns are different when τ is greater than 0 25 or smaller than 0 25 and the difference of such cases due to the propagation speed of the group velocity of the waves generated by the ship motion and details can be found in many existing references e g faltinsen 1990 in this study all the wave conditions are greater than 0 25 however the present measurement is done in local area around ships and the decomposition of wave direction and pattern is beyond of this research that is the analysis is carried out focusing on for steady mean and n th order harmonic components 3 ship model and test conditions two ship models are considered in this study a real ship hull and a mathematical hull the former is the s lngc kim et al 2017 kim et al 2019 provided by samsung heavy industry and the other is a blunt modified wigley hull which is defined as eq 6 kashiwagi 2013 yang et al 2020 6 y 1 z 2 1 x 2 1 0 6 x 2 x 4 z 2 1 z 8 1 x 2 4 x x 2 l y y 2 b z z d here d is the ship draft for the modified wigley hull form the vertical wall side is set above the mean water level while the s lngc model has a practical hull shape including a bow flare bulbous bow and transom stern see fig 3 the main dimensions are listed in table 2 and each model is set to satisfy the original target parameter within the 3 error test conditions for the modified wigley in calm water and in waves are listed in table 3 for representative cases which are emphasized in table 3 1 measurements were performed over the entire range 0 7 x l 0 7 otherwise measurements were focused on the bow range 0 1 x l 0 7 test conditions for the s lngc in calm water and in waves are listed in table 4 measurements were conducted for the bow range 0 1 x l 0 7 and non dimensional wave conditions were set to be similar to those used for the modified wigley model towing speed was constant at the designed speed the surge heave and pitch motions were set to be free and a soft spring system of 380 n m was adopted for the surge motion of the ships the details about the soft spring can be found in the paper of lee et al 2017 4 sensitivity study for wave elevation measurement confirming the uniformity of the undisturbed incident wave is important to this end several parameters can be checked the frequency of the incident wave ω the first and second harmonic amplitudes ζ a 1 and ζ a 2 and spatial modulation along the advancing direction as the amplitude of generated wave increases a careful check is required particularly for higher order components since their magnitude becomes larger fig 4 shows the repeatability of the first and second harmonic amplitudes of incident waves here the results are normalized based on the input wave amplitude the normalized wave amplitudes are approximately 0 97 which means that the linear amplitudes of generated waves are about 3 lower than the input value see fig 4 a and this repeatability of the wave generation seems acceptable for the present analysis the magnitude of the second harmonic follows the 2nd order stokes wave theory but the standard deviation of the second harmonic component is higher than that of the first harmonic component therefore careful treatment is needed for analyzing the non linear parts in the small scale model test based on the present observation the overall repeatability of incident waves is in a reasonable range spatial modulation of the waves also should be considered during the towing tank test as described by lake et al 1977 modulation of the wave propagation along the longitudinal towing tank can be observed because of side wall friction and the instability of the nonlinear wave structure fig 5 shows a comparison of the measured wave signals at a fixed point near the wave maker and at the front position of the moving towing carriage the wave signal near the wave maker shows better uniformity then the signal measured at moving carriage this difference must be considered in the analysis of experimental data fig 6 shows an example of the normalized first harmonic wave amplitudes which were measured at eight sensors and 14 repeated tests for the blunt wigley hull each symbol represents the normalized linear amplitude of each repeated run and the normalization was done based on the both input wave amplitude and measured wave amplitude in this figure a earth fixed means the wave amplitude measured at a fixed point near the wave maker and a carriage is the wave amplitude measured in front of the moving carriage this figure shows also the standard deviations of 14 values for each condition this example shows that the suitable reliability can be achieved in the present experiment in this study it is hard to suggest any procedure which is more appropriate in the choice of reference wave elevation for normalization therefore this issue must be studied in a more systematic manner 5 results and discussions 5 1 steady wave and mean wave components the results of this study are displayed in several different manners including instant wave contours and amplitude contours fig 7 shows the elevation contour normalized by the ship length ζ l near the bow 0 1 x l 0 7 of the blunt wigley hull in calm water condition this modified wigley hull is not optimized for hydrodynamic performance and significant wave breaking and wake are observed see ① in fig 7 the measured wave pattern captures well the largest peak near the bow front see fig 7 upper around the ship shoulder a wave trough line is shown in the photo see ② in fig 7 overall the measured wave amplitude describes well the characteristics of bow waves under steady conditions in addition the wave cut at y b 0 7 for the steady wave is compared with published wave cut analysis data iwashita et al 2011 see fig 8 which used a 2 5 m ship model the wave length and bow and stern peak amplitudes are very similar despite some difference in crest and trough differences between the published paper and this study may come mostly from the difference of measurement scheme and resolution of elevation measurement breaking waves are clearly visible for fn 0 20 while not much breaking occurs for fn 0 15 see fig 9 for fn 0 2 breaking is so clear that the bow and shoulder separation wave is not clearly visible as can be seen in ① of fig 9 this difference affects the mean wave pattern in this study measurements were focused on fn 0 2 where clear nonlinear phenomena can be captured one interesting aspect of these results is the change in the mean wave or kevin wake characteristics in calm water and in regular waves the wigley model has a vertical wall above the wetted surface therefore the nonlinear hull form effect on the mean wave component is expected to be lower than that of the s lngc in fig 10 steady and mean wave contours near the bow and shoulder are divided by the ship length l the first row shows the time averaged steady wave component in calm water and the others show the mean wave component zero th order wave analyzed from the unsteady wave component with different incident waves in this case slight differences can be found in the detailed comparison but overall trends are very similar in detail the peaks and troughs in the presence of incident waves are smaller with respect to both range and amplitude in short wave conditions neither the motion nor the dynamic sinkage and trim meaningfully vary according to incident wave non linearity in other words with high frequency waves both the ship motion and change in static position are relatively small according to the wave amplitude variation in addition for the blunt modified wigley the bow wave is already high enough in the calm water case see figs 9 and 10 based on the above observation it is concluded that if there is no significant change in the position of the hull in either static or dynamic situations the mean value of the disturbed wave near the bow does not significantly differ in waves 5 2 unsteady wave component fig 11 a and b show the snapshots of the wave component for unsteady conditions in the physical scale the upper figure illustrates the experimentally measured results and the lower one presents the photometry captured during the experiment when the incident wave crest coincides with the ship front large pressure variation occurs and the peak amplitude can be observed for steeper waves as the diffracted waves go higher more resultant breaking waves are observed fig 11 b observing the wave cut near the ship hull fig 11 c nonlinearity is strong near the bow front and shoulder parts where disturbances are largest in fig 12 the wave amplitude contour of the entire domain 0 7 x l 0 7 is represented from the time averaged mean value to the 3rd order harmonic the wave amplitude plots show that the wave component is dominant around the ship bow for all components and the stern is also important for mean wave and linear wave components nonlinear components are mostly important in the bow and negligible in the stern furthermore speed effects are dominant for the mean wave component and less effective for the first and harmonic waves for the parametric study the wave components near the bow are compared for different wave lengths in fig 13 according to this result it seems that the first harmonic wave amplitude ζ 1 a is a little affected by the wave length as the wavelength increases the wave intensity and propagation angle become stronger and wider the diverging angle for the 2nd order component also changes although the magnitude is not high the combined elevation in fig 13 d shows the relative importance of the mean and first harmonic wave components for different wave conditions particularly it shows that the wave elevation nondimensionalized by incident wave amplitude becomes weaker as the length is shorter 5 3 comparison of different hull forms in the case of experiment for the s lngc hull the incident wave conditions and measurement domain are similar to those for the modified wigley model but the elevation sensors could not be installed close to the hull surface as much as the blunt wigley hull due to the flare above the still water level fig 14 shows that the steady wave elevation around the s lngc hull for fn 0 188 here the red line shows the waterline in calm water and the photo shows an upper deck flare fig 15 shows instantaneous wave elevation combination of the harmonic components up to the 3 rd order as expected the reconstructed elevation shows good consistency with snapshots fig 16 represents the harmonic amplitude plot for various wave periods and the overall trend is similar to that of the blunt wigley hull however there must be small difference due to different waterline profile and sectional profiles between the two ships unfortunately the wave elevation close to the ship bow is unavailable therefore the detailed difference near bow cannot be clearly observed from the observation on the results for the s lngc and blunt modified wigley hull forms several clear differences can be found the modified wigley model has a vertical side wall above the mean waterline and the s lngc has bow flare and transom stern parts in addition the modified wigley has no bulb and significant wave breaking occurs in steady wave conditions the modified wigley caused a far larger wave to form around the bow hull form see fig 17 a in fig 17 b the wave cuts for various positions y l are compared for each hull form and the dotted line in fig 17 a depicts locations the first peak value is nearly three times larger even for the side position y l 0 06 see fig 17 b and the following trough and second peak are also several times larger for the modified wigley these differences are obviously partly due to the difference of ship speed and also partly due to the bulb effect of the s lngc and the concave shape of the bow furthermore the wave length for the blunt wigley appears to be shorter than that of the s lngc in fig 17 a for the first harmonic wave amplitude the reflection angle is similar for the two hull forms and the peak amplitude is similar under the same wave conditions in these conditions the ship motions in the vertical plane are small therefore the diffraction component is dominant for unsteady waves the detailed disturbance range and intensity of the 1 st harmonic amplitude for the s lngc are smaller see fig 18 which may be due to the efficient hull shape of the s lngc however the direct comparison of the two ships must be cautious since the froude numbers are slightly different 6 comparison with computational solutions computational results are compared with the measured wave components the numerical wave component is obtained by solving the linear potential problem based on the rankine panel method particularly the wish program developed at seoul national university kim and kim 2009 2011 2011 lee et al 2017 has been applied the wish program is a well known program for seakeeping analysis which adopts the b spline scheme for velocity potential and wave elevation this program solves the linear weakly nonlinear and weak scatterer problems for the motion responses and wave loads on ships and structures since many papers about the application of the wish program were already published the details are not included in this paper an example of solution panels is shown in figs 1 and 19 and other conditions are set to be same as those used in the experiments three comparison sets include the steady wave component in calm water instantaneous wave contour at different time instants and linear wave amplitude contours in figs 20 23 comparison results for the blunt wigley are shown according to fig 20 the measured steady wave component is slightly larger and the wavelengths in downstream from the ship shoulder are a little different as described above the waves around this ship have significant nonlinearities such as wave breaking therefore some discrepancy with the computational results based on linear boundary value problem is inevitable however the agreement of overall wave pattern is obvious fig 21 shows two instantaneous elevation contours in regular wave conditions like the steady wave case the agreement of overall wave pattern between experiment and computation is very clear figs 22 and 23 represent the amplitude contours of unsteady wave train experimental results and numerical results have similar divergence angles although the intensity is different it should be stated that the intensity of wave amplitude is dependent on wave steepness and this is the case when the wave steepness is higher than the case of fig 22 therefore the amplitude intensity is larger than the case of fig 21 and computational results particularly such trend is clearly shown in fig 23 which compares the overall range measurement and numerical results for different advancing speeds similar validation sets can be observed for the s lngc hull form as shown in figs 24 and 25 overall trends like the wave divergence angle or position of the peak amplitude are similar between measurement and computation results and the phase and magnitude of unsteady waves are similar however experimental results show larger intensity than linear results which may arise because linear solution in this study does not consider the wake breaking waves viscosity or nonlinear hull form effects for the s lngc hull the bow flares which is related to plunging wave breaking the wave pattern differs near the position of the overturning wave at the bow shoulder this may lead to differences between linear calculation and model measurement even in steady calm water and linear wave conditions 7 conclusions in this study steady and unsteady wave elevations were measured around two hull forms in head sea condition the mean linear and second order components of wave elevation were compared for different wave steepness speed and hull forms based on this research the following conclusions are made data sets for unsteady wave components are obtained for a mathematical hull and a practical ship hull the instantaneous local and global free surface elevations were collected around the ships under free vertical motion in head waves and these data can be good reference data for benchmark test or validation data of numerical computation repeat tests showed the reliability of the present analysis scheme to achieve better accuracy of elevation measurement careful measurement and outlier analysis are needed particularly when the wave steepness becomes high moreover it should be aware that the wave signals measured near the model hull and near the wave maker may have some difference resulting in different normalized quantities of wave elevation such difference may be increased when the nonlinearity of incident waves and or bow waves are stronger and wave length is short it is obvious that uncertainty of measurement is sensitive to the accuracy of wave amplitude particularly in short waves this issue must be carefully studied in the future in the observation on the mean and harmonic components of the disturbed wave elevation around the ship hulls the nonlinearity is clear around the ship bow and stern where large pressure variation occurs although the linear component is dominant the nonlinear components are not ignorable and the degree of nonlinearity differs for each condition differences can be found related to wave breaking and the resultant disturbed wave for various advancing speeds the comparison of wave elevation and component between numerical computation and experimental measurement shows fair agreement the computational results based on linear potential theory and rankine panel method show very similar wave component and bow wave angle although the intensity of wave amplitude are slightly different this can justify the applicability of linear potential theory in seakeeping analysis even though it does not consider the ship wake wave breaking or nonlinear components credit authorship contribution statement jaehoon lee investigation experiment computation

20577,this paper explores the applicability of envelope soliton solutions of the non linear schrödinger type equation as an innovative design wave for wave structure interaction investigations the major benefits of envelope solitons are the potential to generate non linear wave groups of certain frequency and physically possible wave steepness as well as the availability of an analytical solution furthermore the fact that envelope solitons are characterized by a limiting frequency bandwidth enables the tailor made generation of critical wave conditions for task specific wave structure investigations for the evaluation of the applicability of envelope solitons wave structure investigations with a chemical tanker were performed in a set of envelope solitons at certain frequencies and wave steepness the applicability of envelope solitons as design waves as well as their impact on the chemical tanker are compared to classical design wave concepts and tailored extreme wave events for the extreme wave events the peregrine breather solution and a real world abnormal wave reproduction the famous new year wave were selected the investigations comprised model tests as well as numerical simulations altogether this paper shows that envelope solitons are excellent design waves for extreme response investigations suitable for model tests as well as numerical investigations keywords wave

introduction ships and offshore structures are subjected to adverse environmental conditions the sheer untameable power of the sea causes short term e g peak loads in extreme conditions as well as long term effects e g fatigue during lifetime to be considered in the design process the focus of this paper lies on short term wave events leading to critical situations in terms of structure response for the design of a ship or offshore structure it is indispensable to identify and evaluate such short term but extreme conditions precisely in this context the identification of reliable limiting values of a design in terms of critical wave conditions is the key task and main challenge at once classically a series of individual long term simulations is required in order to obtain reliable extreme values by long term statistics to be considered during the design several methods of different complexity are available but the computational time needed increases significantly with increasing complexity of the applied method consequently investigations at advanced level are crucial in critical conditions but up to now not practical for holistic design approaches hence it is difficult to obtain accurate extreme value estimates by long term extreme value statistics as sufficiently long simulations are necessary but impractical to reduce statistical uncertainties contrary reducing the level of accuracy of the non linear simulations enables very long simulation durations in an adequate time span resulting in very small statistical uncertainties but increases the numerical model and extreme value uncertainties respectively several design wave concepts have been introduced to overcome this technical barrier so that statistical uncertainties and impractical simulation time spans are avoided the basic idea is to identify deterministic wave sequences which are relevant for extreme value investigations based on simplified methods i e small statistical but large numerical model uncertainties thus design wave concepts depict tailored critical wave sequences of short duration which represent a specific extreme event the structure will experience during its lifetime most of the design wave concepts are based on linear methods which depict an efficient approach for a fast holistic evaluation of a design so that the extreme conditions to be defined for the design wave concepts are commonly inferred from linear short term or long term statistics these critical wave groups of short duration are afterwards used as input for complex non linear simulations to obtain extreme values of the non linear response statistics the theoretical basis for the design wave concepts is the fundamental assumption that the non linear response is only a correction of the linear one the simplest design wave concept is the application of regular waves the critical wave length can be identified easily by the help of linear response amplitude operator rao for the selection of the wave height two approaches are applicable on the one hand the wave height can be directly taken from linear wave statistics defining a certain return period such as 20 or 100 years or on the other hand from linear long term response statistics by what the wave height can be determined indirectly by division of the long term extreme value with the linear rao e g adegeest et al 2000 combining the linear rao concept with irregular waves gives the linear response for certain sea states which illustrates the basis for the critical wave episode cwe concept torhaug et al 1998 the basic idea is to simulate a set of irregular sea states with random phases and identifying the wave sequence causing the highest response for each of the simulated irregular sea state realization these wave sequences are called cwe for the subsequent complex simulations a set of cwe s the mean of several cwe s or the cwe causing the highest response of all irregular sea states can be used the linear conditioning of short wave sequences based on probabilistic analysis are more straightforward methods for tailoring critical wave sequences the most likely storm wave mlw profile illustrates a most probable wave crest elevation as a result of the new wave model tromans et al 1991 friis hansen and nielsen 1995 hereby amplitudes and phases of wave spectra based on statistical irregular sea state parameters are condition in order to obtain the mlw profile applying these conditioning of amplitudes and phases on the response spectrum of the respective structure or ship results in the most likely extreme response most likely extreme response mler concept adegeest et al 2000 the most likely response wave mlrw adegeest et al 2000 dietz 2004 can be determined by applying linear rao s on the identified mler combining the mlrw profile with an irregular random background wave yields the conditional random response wave crrw concept dietz 2004 alford 2008 has developed a different approach for tailoring short wave sequences in terms of critical response this approach is based on the manipulation of the phases of the linear rao applying an optimization algorithm the objective function i e the target of the optimization is to obtain a maximum response klein 2015 developed a response based optimization tool similar to alford s approach the decisive difference lies in the underlying method for the determination of the maximum response in contrast to applying linear rao s a non linear time domain strip theory solver fonseca and guedes soares 1998a b has been used in order to predict the maximum response vertical wave bending moment vertical wave bending moment vbm for predefined irregular sea state parameters this strip theory solver takes the non linear hydrodynamic effects on the hull structure above mean water level into account assuming that the non linear effects relevant for vertical motions and global structural loads are to be dominated by buoyancy effects thus froude krylov as well as hydrostatic forces are considered non linear while the radiation as well as diffraction forces are kept linear consequently the obtained critical wave sequence relies on a more complex and accurate approach more generally this response based optimization tool can be combined with any kind of simulation tool i e any level of complexity enabling a tailored identification of critical wave sequences however the numerical efficiency of the chosen complex tools may limit this approach as a larger number of simulations is required for a successful application of the optimization algorithm i e to find an optimization strategy and the optimum all these concept are widely used for different applications e g dietz 2004 oberhagemann et al 2012 ley et al 2013 kim and troesch 2015 quon et al 2016 offering the deterministic identification of critical wave sequences for predefined statistical parameters however these simple and straightforward approaches have its advantages and drawbacks at once the identified wave sequences are based on linear methods requiring the definition of response levels to be reached and the resulting wave sequences are directly proportional to this level this can lead to physically impossible wave sequences regarding wave height and steepness as rayleigh statistics are not considering any physical limitation regarding response or excitation klein 2015 thus the reproduction of such wave groups whether by means of complex numerical methods or in model tests can be difficult or impossible due to the linear assumptions here it can happen that the identified wave group reaches non physical values with regard to wave height or wave steepness consequently the reproduced wave sequence will show wave breaking and deviates significantly from the theoretical wave shape in addition the validity of the concept that the critical wave sequences based on linear approaches are representing a global solution where only a non linear response correction has to be applied should be validated under different severe conditions when non linear effects are significant drummen et al 2009 in model tests it is common to investigate regular waves as well as irregular sea states whereby the sea state parameters are usually identified on the basis of previous numerical investigations in addition to the use of transfer functions the environmental contour line approach should be mentioned as another possibility for identifying the relevant sea state parameters haver and winterstein 2008 classically these identified sea state parameters are used to generate harsh irregular wave environments based on random phase distribution of the underlying wave components depending on the number of test runs as well as the duration such model tests may deliver the basis for statistical extreme value estimates tailoring critical wave sequences for model tests is challenging as the commonly applied standard model for ocean waves is inadequate for the precise generation of steep waves thus different experimental optimization schemes have been introduced in order to reproduce critical steep wave sequences more accurately the overall objective of such procedures is to obtain a control signal for the wave maker which results in the desired wave sequence at the target location e g chaplin 1996 clauss and schmittner 2005 schmittner 2005 clauss et al 2006 schmittner et al 2009 clauss and klein 2009 schmittner and hennig 2012 clauss et al 2013 clauss and klein 2013 the reproduction of critical wave sequences in a model basin is time consuming and very demanding and thus is not part of the day to day business of commercial test facilities consequently easy to use methods are necessary for tailored critical wave sequences in order to be applicable for test facilities for this purpose klein et al 2015 introduced the peregrine breather peregrine breather pb solution peregrine 1983 of the non linear schrödinger equation nlse as design wave for extreme wave structure investigation the pb is part of a class of breather solutions kuznetsov 1977 ma 1979 akhmediev et al 1985 1987 akhmediev and korneev 1986 which has been extensively investigated in the last years in terms of non linear wave evolution and freak wave formation e g dysthe 1979 dysthe and trulsen 1999 henderson et al 1999 osborne et al 2000 slunyaev et al 2005 chabchoub et al 2010 2011 clauss et al 2011b chabchoub et al 2012 shemer and alperovich 2013 zhang et al 2014 2015 as well as extreme wave structure interaction e g huijsmans et al 2005 andonowati et al 2006 clauss et al 2012 onorato et al 2013 klein et al 2015 houtani et al 2019 the pb is particularly in focus as this solution can be applied for the straightforward generation of realistic abnormal waves that appear from nowhere and disappear without trace akhmediev et al 2009 as this solution is localized in time and space it has been shown that the pb characteristics can be adjusted to real world abnormal waves such as the new year wave new year wave nyw chabchoub et al 2010 klein et al 2015 featuring many similarities so that they can be considered as prototypes for abnormal waves dysthe and trulsen 1999 osborne et al 2000 klein et al 2015 have shown that the pb can be used for systematic investigations as the analytical solution offers the straightforward generation of arbitrary wave length and steepness up to wave breaking such waves are predestined for the investigation of the impact of extreme wave events in terms of wave height steepness and breaking wave events in addition the pb model has also been established for numerical investigations on extreme wave events and its impact on offshore structures peric et al 2015 qin et al 2017 koukounas et al 2018 qin et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the critical wave groups of the design wave concepts have a slightly different shape compared to extreme waves they do not have an individual extreme wave within the wave group and the envelope of these design wave concept wave groups look very similar to the envelope soliton envelope soliton es solution of the nlse framework this close similarity is the motivation for this study similar to the wave group shapes of the design wave concepts the es offers the possibility to generate wave groups with tailored properties in terms of carrier frequency and wave steepness since an analytical solution is available zakharov and shabat 1971 hereby the width of the es is variable but directly linked to the maximum height of the envelope i e with increasing wave height the width decreases in contrast to the shape of the design wave concepts generally es s are characterized by balancing the wave dispersion and non linearity of the wave group in such a way that the envelope propagates with permanent form as the soliton is constituted by interacting coherent wave harmonics that prevents dispersion of the group slunyaev et al 2013 the general existence of envelope solitons have been shown by yuen and lake 1975 slunyaev et al 2013 have shown that the es solution can be applied for the generation of very steep wave groups in physical wave tanks the coherent structure of the es have been shown by slunyaev et al 2017 demonstrating experimentally that the collision of individual es can happen without any interaction among each other furthermore their study has shown that two es s with different propagation speeds do not interact during an overtaking process more recently it has been shown that soliton like wave groups persist in unidirectional irregular sea states by strongly non linear simulations and increase noticeably the probability of high waves even in moderately rough sea conditions slunyaev and kokorina 2017 moreover slunyaev 2021 has discussed the presence of a soliton like wave group in a non linear unidirectional irregular sea state this wave group has shown a stable behaviour over more than 200 periods the investigation has revealed that most of the extreme wave conditions within the non linear unidirectional irregular sea state have occurred on to this wave group resulting in more extreme events in terms of wave height and duration of existence thus es s may not only being specific cases of wave groups but occur more often and representing a natural shape in non linear irregular waves due to the deep water self modulation processes following the applicability of es for wave structure investigations will be explored therefore es of different wave steepnesses are generated in a wave tank afterwards their impact on the maximum vbm of a chemical tanker is investigated as application example model tests in tailor made extreme waves complete the experimental investigations the results obtained are evaluated against classical design wave approaches 2 theoretical basis following the methods applied for this study are briefly introduced the starting point is the standard model of ocean waves and structure response which depicts the basis for the design wave concepts afterwards the weakly non linear wave model leading to the es and pb solution is illustrated all following investigations are reduced to long crested waves i e all waves travelling in one direction in addition the theoretical basis is described on a general term without any claim of completeness 2 1 water wave problem the newtonian fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid and irrotational so that the evolution of water waves can be mathematically described by the following governing equations for long crested waves travelling in x direction 1 φ 0 2 φ z φ x ζ x ζ t 0 on z ζ x t 3 g z 1 2 φ 2 φ t 0 on z ζ x t 4 φ z 0 on z d with 2 x 2 2 z 2 x z and the subscripts represent the corresponding derivations the solution of the boundary value problem is considerably complicated by non linear terms in the two surface boundary conditions and by the fact that these conditions must be satisfied at the unknown free surface z ζ x t which makes an analytical solution of the exact boundary value problem infeasible therefore approximate solutions are essential with different approaches leading to solutions with different scopes on the one hand the solution can be approximated by numerical methods up to fully non linear simulations which is out of the scope of this study on the other hand the complexity can be reduced by simplifying the cauchy problem and the application of perturbation theory and taylor series expansion the solutions obtained differ due to the expansion order and the perturbation parameters standard model of ocean waves the standard model of ocean waves is based on linear wave theory the cauchy problem eqs 1 4 is reduced by applying perturbation theory for the unknown surface elevation and potential the perturbation parameter is the wave steepness ϵ ζ a k which relates the wave amplitude ζ a and wave number k in addition taylor series expansion is used for the approximation of the boundary value problem at the unknown surface under the assumption that the wave height is significantly smaller compared to the wave length the simplified boundary value problem is obtained by truncation of the taylor series expansion at order o ϵ 1 for which the analytical linear solution can be determined fig 1 presents the standard model of ocean waves and structure response the stochastic irregular sea state top left is regarded as superposition of independent harmonic component waves travelling in time and space 5 ζ x t j ζ a j cos k j x ω j t ϕ j with ζ a j k j ω j and ϕ j as amplitude wave number angular frequency and phase of the j th component wave in the middle of fig 1 the angular frequency and wave number are coupled via the dispersion relation 6 ω j k j g tanh k j d with water depth d and gravitational acceleration g the fourier transform depicts the analytical basis enabling a fast and simple evaluation and handling of complex sea states based on this the surface elevation can be easily manipulated in time and space by deterministic superposition of component waves so that tailored wave groups critical design wave sequences as well as extreme wave events can be modelled see top centre and top right of fig 1 in frequency domain spectral parameters and wave statistics can be easily determined in addition the spectral approach allows the definition and use of empirical standard wave spectra for design purposes see bottom left of fig 1 consequently this standard wave model is established in all relevant areas despite the known limitations the linear approach provides widely acceptable results for engineering applications forming the basis for holistic investigations of a design and subsequent complex investigations e g design wave concepts 2 2 wave structure interaction determining the behaviour of offshore structures in waves is as complex as describing the waves themselves the wave loads acting on the submerged part must be determined in order to obtain the corresponding response as aforementioned different approaches are used for the assessment of offshore structures from simple and fast linear methods to completely non linear calculations as the focus of this study lies on the fast determination of design waves yielding to critical response potential flow theory is applied for the determination of the exciting forces in addition hydrodynamic compact structures are addressed so that the flow around the structure can be described by superposition of independent potentials linearization of the problem assuming an ideal fluid 7 φ φ 0 m 1 6 φ m φ 7 with the potential φ 0 of the incident waves the potential φ j of the radiated waves due to motion m and the potential φ 7 of the scattered waves due to the presences of the structure integrating the dynamic pressure over the wetted surface of a submerged body results in the total force acting on the offshore structure knowing the total force acting on the submerged body the response of the structure s can be calculated by applying newtonian mechanics resulting in six differential equations of motion for stable linear systems lewis 1989 8 m a s b s c s f e with s and s representing the time derivatives of the structure motion the underline marks a vector with six components according to the six degrees of freedom m is the mass matrix a the hydrodynamic mass matrix b the damping matrix c the restoring forces matrix and f the excitation forces and moments matrix the system matrices are of dimension 6 6 according to the number of modes of motion i e the three translatory and three rotatory motion components of a free floating structure once the exciting forces and hydrodynamic coefficients of the floating structure are known the response can be determined assuming a linear relation between exciting forces and the structure response enables the utilization of rao s for the individual modes of motion 9 h ω j s a j ω j ζ a j ω j e i ϕ ˆ j ω j with h ω j the rao s a j ω j the amplitude of the response ζ a j ω j the amplitude of the excitation and ϕ ˆ j is the phase shift between excitation and response the rao concept is not limited to the motion s of floating structures and has many other applications for the application example of this study the identification of extreme conditions leading to a maximum vbm a linear vbm rao was used which was determined by a linear radiation diffraction programme standard model of offshore structure response the application of spectral analysis in ship dynamics started with the fundamental publication of st denis and pierson 1953 being the basis for the standard model of offshore structure response assuming a steady state system the sea state as well as the response are interpreted as a superposition of an infinite number of harmonic elementary components being linearly related as a consequence the system behaviour of offshore structures is describable by a set of rao s eq 9 fig 1 bottom displays the spectral approach for offshore structure response the spectral density s ζ ω see bottom left of fig 1 represents the energy distribution of a sea state as a function of wave frequency ω in analogy to the wave spectrum s ζ ω the response spectrum s s ω see bottom right of fig 1 represents the energy distribution of the output signal i e the structure response accordingly the spectral approach introduced for the sea state description can also be directly applied for the response spectrum wave and response spectra are related by 10 s s ω j h ω j 2 s ζ ω j with s s ω j δ ω 1 2 s a j 2 ω j s ζ ω j δ ω 1 2 ζ a j 2 ω j and δ ω 2 π δ f represents the frequency resolution cf bottom left of fig 1 again the fourier transform depicts the analytical basis providing the link between frequency and time domain the application of rao s enables a fast efficient and complete description of the hydrodynamic characteristics of offshore structures frequency domain investigations offer a holistic evaluation of offshore structures including short term and long term statistics as well as annual downtime time domain investigations are essential for task related evaluations of cause reaction effects in deterministic tailored wave sequences 2 3 design wave concepts for the objective of this study the evaluation of the applicability of es as design waves for wave structure investigations two design wave concepts were used namely the cwe as well as mler concept were utilized to classify the model test results with the es the two concepts are introduced briefly in the following 2 3 1 critical wave episode the concept of cwe s torhaug et al 1998 is a classical and straightforward application of the standard model of offshore structure response c f bottom of fig 1 once the relevant critical sea state parameters are identified standard wave spectra can be used to calculate very long realizations of the ship response by combining the linear rao with the wave spectrum eq 10 the wave group causing extraordinarily large response is called cwe due to the very efficient method for calculating the response a multitude of different cwe s can be identified by randomly varying the phase distribution based on this a set of cwe s the mean of several cwe s or the cwe causing the highest response of all irregular sea state realizations may be selected for detailed investigation 2 3 2 mler and mlrw the mler concept has been derived due to the fact that the extreme response must not be related to the mlw profile based on extreme wave crest height however the basic idea is taken from the mlw concept tromans et al 1991 friis hansen and nielsen 1995 conditioning of amplitudes and phases but applied on the response spectrum of the respective structure or ship adegeest et al 2000 the mlrw adegeest et al 2000 dietz 2004 can afterwards be determined by applying linear rao s on the identified mler the basis of the mler concept is the superposition principle of component waves c f eq 5 11 ζ m l r w x t j 1 n ζ a j v j cos k j x ω j t w j sin k j x ω j t with v j and w j as normally distributed random variables from eq 10 follows for the structure response s m l e r t 12 s m l e r x t j 1 n s a j v j cos k j x ω j t ϕ ˆ j w j sin k j x ω j t ϕ ˆ j the variables v j and w j can be derived with the following equations dietz 2004 13 v j s j m c m 2 m 0 m 1 2 m 2 ω j m 1 ω m ω j m 0 m 1 cos ϕ ˆ j 14 w j s j m c m 2 m 0 m 1 2 m 2 ω j m 1 ω m ω j m 0 m 1 sin ϕ ˆ j the variable m c in both equations depicts the desired structure response to be defined in order to arrive at the mler profile the spectral moments m i of the response can be calculated with 15 m i j 1 n ω j i s j ω and the mean wave frequency ω m m 1 m 0 consequently determining v j and w j enables to calculate the mler eq 12 as well as the mlrw eq 11 generally this method produces a response as well as wave profile which depends on the underlying rao it is worth mentioning that the width and shape of the profile is independent of the predefined extreme response thus the extreme structure response m c to be defined does not change the shape and width of the profile but the absolute values are rescaling to the actual response level thus mlrw can be easily rescaled in order to investigate different short term statistical loads 2 4 weakly non linear wave model weakly non linear wave models have been introduced to take some important aspects of non linearity into account e g benjamin and feir 1967 zakharov 1968 the classical nlse can be deduced by applying perturbation and taylor series expansion on the cauchy problem eqs 1 4 zakharov 1968 hasimoto and ono 1972 besides the small amplitude wave assumption which is similar to linear theory a narrow bandwidth spectrum is additionally assumed resulting in the perturbation parameters wave steepness ϵ k c ζ a and relative bandwidth μ δ k k c 1 applying taylor series expansion above still water level and separating into the different orders o ϵ n the nlse can be derived by solving each order sequentially beginning with the lowest order the nlse is obtained by truncating the series expansion at order o ϵ 3 mei 1989 finally the nlse describing the evolution of wave groups in space of a time series reads 16 a x 1 c g a t i α 2 a t 2 β a 2 a 0 eq 16 is required for wave tank experiments and all other applications where the wave sequences have to be available in time at specific locations in space this equation can be derived from the classical nlse by an iterative procedure exchanging the derivatives in space with derivatives in time and vice versa see e g mei 1989 the coefficients α and β are depending on the carrier angular frequency ω c and the corresponding carrier wave number k c for arbitrary water depth the coefficients are mei 1989 serio et al 2005 17 α 1 8 ω c k c 2 α c g 3 β 1 2 ω c k c 2 β c g 18 α ν 2 2 8 k c d 2 cosh 2 k c d sinh 2 2 k c d and 19 β cosh 4 k c d 8 2 tanh 2 k c d 8 sinh 4 k c d 2 cosh 2 k c d 0 5 ν 2 sinh 2 2 k c d k c d t a n h k c d ν 2 2 the coefficient ν 20 ν 1 2 k c d s i n h 2 k c d represents the correction term for the group velocity 21 c g ω c 2 k c ν in finite water depth 2 4 1 envelope soliton solution the es solution depict one exact solution of the nlse which has been discovered by zakharov and shabat 1971 via inverse scattering transform their existence has been firstly experimentally verified by yuen and lake 1975 later on slunyaev et al 2013 2017 have shown the general applicability for wave tank experiments envelope solitons are wave groups which are travelling with permanent form as the soliton is constituted by interacting coherent wave harmonics that prevents dispersion of the group slunyaev et al 2013 thus wave dispersion and non linearity within the wave group are perfectly balanced forming a stable wave group the es solution of eq 16 describing the evolution of the envelope in space of a time series reads 22 a s x t a c e i 1 2 a c 2 β x cosh a c β 2 α t x c g where a c is the soliton amplitude the corresponding surface elevation is obtained by 23 ζ x t 1 2 a s x t e i k c x ω c t ϕ s c c where c c stand for conjugate complex and ϕ s for the phase of the underlying carrier wave 2 4 2 peregrine breather solution breather solutions are also exact solutions of the nlse illustrating a class of extreme waves which are driven by modulational instability thus slightly perturbed quasi monochromatic waves in time or space grow into large amplifications of the initial amplitude during wave propagation the general form which can be derived from eq 16 reads 24 a b x t a c x g x t e i ϕ x 1 where g ϕ are real functions to be determined and 25 a c a c e i β a c 2 x a detailed discussion on the derivation of the different solutions can be found in van groesen et al 2006 as well as in karjanto and van groesen 2007 the pb solution also known as rational solution has been originally derived by peregrine 1983 the pb represents the limiting case of the time periodic kusnetzov ma breather kuznetsov 1977 ma 1979 and the space periodic akhmediev breather akhmediev et al 1985 akhmediev and korneev 1986 akhmediev et al 1987 it has the peculiarity of being not periodic in time and in space it is a wave that appears from nowhere and disappears without trace akhmediev et al 2009 and has been considered as special prototype of freak wave shrira and geogjaev 2010 its analytical form is karjanto and van groesen 2007 26 a b x t a c x 4 α 1 i 2 β a c 2 x α α 2 β a c 2 x 2 2 β a c 2 t 2 1 the corresponding surface elevation is obtained by 27 ζ x t 1 2 a b x t e i k c x ω c t ϕ b c c where c c stand for conjugate complex and ϕ b for the phase of the underlying carrier wave thus the pb is well defined by the plane wave amplitude a c as well as the carrier frequency ω c i e the initial steepness the amplitude amplification factor aaf which describes the grow rate between amplitude of the background wave and the maximum wave height is always equal to three and only the shape of the largest wave group changes depending on the initial steepness 3 application example the overall objective of this study is to show that es solutions can be applied as design waves in order to identify extreme responses not only for test facilities but also for efficient numerical investigations for this purpose the maximum vbm of a chemical tanker has been chosen as typical design questions the precise knowledge of maximum loads is indispensable to ensure a safe operation of ships in waves the continuing news of accidents in severe weather with disastrous consequences show that the topic is still very relevant and that not all questions have been answered satisfactorily yet in extreme conditions the waves causes the highest vbm at amidships being highly non linear hereby one may distinguish between hogging ship on wave crest and sagging ship in wave trough at which the latter one is the significant more critical condition the classification societies providing an empirical formulae for the dimensioning of the ship s transverse section also distinguishing between sagging and hogging dnv gl se 2021 for this study the permissible vertical wave bending moment sagging condition 28 m v w s 1 25 1 0 6 knm as well as the vertical hull girder ultimate bending capacity 29 m v w s u 1 51 1 0 6 knm are used as reference for the design wave concepts as well as model test results dnv gl se 2021 for this application example the basic considerations as well as investigations necessary in order to identify the relevant environmental conditions for detailed investigations are reduced to a bare minimum as aforementioned the linear vbm rao depicts the basis for the input for the design wave concepts furthermore the vbm rao is used for the identification of the critical wave lengths for the calculation of the vbm rao the established radiation diffraction programme wamit newman 1977 1986 lee 1995 were utilized based on the calculated vbm rao three wave length to be used for the es investigations were chosen based on a wave length to ship length ratio i e l w l p p hereby the most critical wave length in terms of maximum rao is approximately located around l w l p p 1 1 note that most critical wave length in terms of rao means that the ratio between response and excitation is maximum but the absolute value for the response depends on the rao and the corresponding wave height furthermore l w l p p 1 3 and l w l p p 1 5 were additionally chosen for all three wave lengths model test results of the chemical tanker encountering extreme waves based on pb solutions will serve as reference regarding extreme response for certain wave lengths furthermore the results obtained are discussed in the context of the design wave concepts following the chemical tanker the test set up and the test facility is briefly introduced before the design wave concepts were applied afterwards the model tests are introduced with the systematic generation of the es and the test results for the chemical tanker thereby the model test results are not only compared with the theoretical results of the design wave concepts but also with test data in deterministic extreme waves 3 1 experimental set up the main dimensions of the chemical tanker are presented in table 1 fig 2 presents the experimental set up of the chemical tanker model at a scale of 1 70 the model was made of glass fibre reinforced plastic grp and segmented at l p p 2 the two segments were connected with three force transducers two were mounted on deck one on each side the third one was mounted underneath the keel the force transducers registered the longitudinal forces during the model tests based on the measured forces and the given geometrical arrangement of the three force transducers the resulting vbm at water line level were obtained furthermore two wave gauges were installed on deck at the forecastle to detect the green water impact on deck absolute measurable green water height on deck is approx 13 m front gauge and 9 m rear gauge at full scale cf fig 2 the ship motions were recorded by an optical tracking system consisting of five cameras with a tracking range of 8 m 10 m during the tests the chemical tanker was towed with an elastic suspension system using a triangular towing arrangement the longitudinal motions were restricted by a spring in front of and a counter weight behind the model the suspension system was connected with the ship model by a thin elastic cross bar which was mounted on deck of the aft segment centre of gravity in x direction with this arrangement heave and pitch motions remained unrestrained the experimental programme were conducted in the seakeeping basin at technische universität berlin tub the seakeeping basin at tub is 110 m long with a measuring range of 90 m the width is 8 m and the water depth is 1 m on the one side an electrically driven wave generator is installed which can be utilized in flap type and piston type mode the wave generator is fully computer controlled and a software is implemented which enables the generation of regular waves transient wave packages deterministic irregular sea states with defined characteristics as well as tailored critical wave sequences on the opposite side a wave damping slope is installed to suppress disturbing wave reflections even if this wave damping slope is very efficient in cancelling out the waves complete prevention of wave reflection is not possible therefore the duration of the measurements must always be determined taking wave reflection into account i e the measurement may only go as far as the time of arrival of the first reflected wave however this does not matter for the test campaign presented in this paper as the wave groups examined were of short duration and the measurements were completed before the occurrence of possible wave reflections in this context the es are particularly noteworthy as this very short wave groups have a significantly positive influence on the surface calm down time between two test runs 3 2 design waves following the cwe and the mler concept were applied as aforementioned the basis was the vbm rao for d 70 m and a tma spectrum bouws et al 1985 which depicts the water depth dependent extension of the deep water jonswap spectrum as design sea state an irregular sea state with t p 12 5 s l p l p p 1 5 h s 12 4 m and γ 3 3 was assumed the cwe concept was performed for 1 0 4 random realizations and the maximum vbm was identified for each realization in order to take only critical responses into account the permissible vbm were defined as threshold i e only the maximum vbm of a random realization is considered as critical if the value is higher than the threshold the mler approach requires the definition of a maximum response which is set to the vertical hull girder ultimate bending capacity for this investigation note that the shape of the mler and mlrw depends on the selected sea state parameters but the height depends only on the defined maximum response fig 3 presents the outcome of the applied concepts fig 3 a shows the results of the cwe concept and fig 3 b for the mler concept the top diagram of fig 3 a shows all identified critical wave sequences causing a vbm higher than the permissible one as black curves the surface elevation causing the highest response green curve and the mean of all critical wave sequences red curve are additionally presented the bottom diagram presents the associated mean and maximum vbm the black curve in the top diagram of fig 3 b represents the mler profile hereby the extreme response m c to be predefined in order to determine the mler profile has set to be equal the vertical hull girder ultimate bending capacity m v w s u the corresponding mlrw is shown as black curve in the diagram below two further mler as well as mlrw profiles are additionally presented in grey curves to illustrate the scaling approach of the mler concept i e that only the absolute value changes but not the shape the grey curves show the results for three quarter and half m c looking at the diagram reveals the motivation of this study at the first glance on the one side the shape of the design wave profiles is strongly reminding of es solutions as the resemblance is striking on the other side the design wave concepts arrive at a solution on a non physical basis in terms of maximum wave height and wave breaking analysing the results for the cwe concept shows that the most critical wave episode results in a wave steepness of ϵ h 2 k 0 52 which is above the theoretical limit in nature steepness hardly reaches values larger than ϵ 0 4 toffoli et al 2010 because of wave breaking in this context the mean critical wave episode is more realistic as the steepness reaches ϵ 0 36 for the mlrw the steepness depends on the predefined response level and results for the selected maximum response to ϵ 0 39 generally the reproduction of these design waves for wave tank experiments is almost impossible even if the maximum steepness is below the physical limit as the non linearity inside such steep wave groups is not taken into account by the standard model of ocean waves hereby the main problem is the distance between the location of the wave board and the target location along the wave tank at where the wave group needs to be reproduced this problem does not exist for complex numerical simulations since the inlet is usually not far away from the position of the structure or ship nonetheless the physical validity of such steep wave groups is questionable in contrast to the es solution the shape of the wave group is just scaled according to the maximum response whereas es show a different shape in terms of length of the wave group and number of waves within this wave group depending on the steepness strictly speaking es are the physical representatives for design waves as they are providing a similar shape for very steep waves on a physical basis 3 3 experimental results the results of the experimental programme are presented in the following as aforementioned the chemical tanker was investigated in es of three different carrier wave length in addition three different wave steepnesses were selected for each wave length in order to show the applicability of the es solution the selected wave steepnesses represent steep wave groups whereby the steepest case ϵ 0 35 depicts a limiting case based on our experience generally the generation of the es were straightforward due to the available analytical solution nevertheless the analytical solution is based on weakly non linear wave theory which is why deviations can be observed for steeper wave groups thus for the steepest waves the deviation will increase and in particular wave dispersion and non linearity of the wave group may be out of balance this non stable behaviour can result in destruction of the wave group radiated wave trains detaching from the initial es if wave dispersion was dominant or occurrence of a single high wave up to wave breaking within the wave group if non linearity was dominant the former can be solved by calibrating the measured wave group and the latter depicts the limit in terms of wave steepness however from the objective of investigating ships and structures in extreme design wave groups the accurate reproduction of the analytical solution is not the primary target from this perspective the analytical solution provides an excellent basis for steep wave group generation it is also worth mentioning regarding the generation process that the selection of the phase ϕ s eq 23 of the waves at the wave board influences the shape at the target location in this study the objective was to generate a wave group at target location where the ship experiences a huge wave trough one could certainly also select a phase position at the wave board so that the wave group at target location has a wave crest in the middle of the group i e a phase shift of π compared to the generated waves fig 4 presents the results of the experimental test campaign the results for the es are shown on the left hand side the carrier wave length increases from top to bottom and three steepnesses were investigated for each wave length each subpicture consists of three diagrams representing the surface elevation top measured ms the corresponding vbm m v w centre and the green water column at fp bottom analysing the measured surface elevations for the different steepnesses reveals that the shape of the es wave groups look very similar to the classical design wave concepts in addition the steepness of the es is scalable in a similar way as the mlrw concept the key difference is that the wave group shape of es changes for different steepnesses however both the general shape as well as the scalability showing already the advantages of the es solution as design waves the corresponding vbm s result in the largest response for the steepest waves as expected in order to evaluate the absolute values the horizontal dashed lines mark the permissible vbm black and the vertical hull girder ultimate bending capacity magenta evaluating the measured loads with the permissible values shows that the investigated wave groups are causing extreme response for the steepest wave groups in order to evaluate the impact of es model test with pb were also performed on the right hand side of fig 4 are the results for the pb presented the subpictures are arranged as on the left hand side the carrier wave length was chosen to match with the critical wave lengths of the es for the three pb the wave steepness of each wave length were selected in such a way that it represents the limiting case of the selected wave length i e all breathers were plunging breaker at target location this denotes that the shown breather are representing the steepest wave for a certain carrier wave length comparing the maximum vbm measured in the steepest es with the pb results reveal that the es wave group causes a very similar extreme response the differences are less than 4 the main reason for this is that the steeper and larger wave crests of the pb do not cause an additional contribution to the vbm as the diagrams for green water on deck clearly show the steeper pb result in more green water on deck consequently the wetted surface at the bow and stern of the ship at which the hydrodynamic pressure acts does not change this shows that the steep es representing an outstanding extreme event for the selected carrier wave length furthermore the results already show that both pb and es are depicting useful tailored wave groups for task related design questions so pb are more appropriate for design questions related to highest possible waves and wave breaking such as green water on deck local loads at the bow or other structures as well as air gap investigations es solutions may be chosen for extreme waves where wave breaking does not contribute to the design question the main advantage of generating es instead of pb is the fact that only a wave group of short duration needs to be investigated consequently the tests can be done more efficiently as the calm down time for the water after the test is significantly reduced for numerical investigations the fact that only a very short wave group needs to be simulated is already advantageous for comparison purposes the impact of a real world extreme wave is additionally investigated in this study the nyw one of the most famous extraordinarily high waves in history recorded in the north sea at the draupner jacket platform on january 1st 1995 haver and anderson 2000 have been reproduced in the seakeeping basin clauss and klein 2011 and widely used to investigate the impact of freak waves on different floating structures e g clauss et al 2004 2010 2011a clauss and klein 2016 in addition the model scale of the nyw reproduction fits the crest shape and height of the pb with l w l p p 1 5 and the kinematics and dynamics of both extreme waves have already been compared in klein et al 2015 the comparison between nyw black curve reproduction and pb blue curve is shown in the top diagram of the bottom right subpicture of fig 4 the original real world measurement at the draupner platform is additionally shown in grey haver and anderson 2000 the impact of the reproduction in terms of vbm and green water on deck is shown in the other diagrams also as black curves from this data it is clearly visible that the pb and the es solutions result in a significantly higher extreme response both design wave groups pb and es are more severe compared to the real world nyw due to the critical characteristics in terms of wave length and height particularly the deep wave trough as well as the wave crest in front of this wave trough is more critical fig 5 presents comparison between the theoretical results from the mler concept red curves and the measured es results black curves for l w l p p 1 5 and ϵ 0 35 for a better comparability the target value m c for the vbm cf eq 12 and following is adjusted to the maximum measured value of the es thus the absolute values are identical but the shape of the two approaches can be compared note that the mler and mlrw profile in fig 3 b are based on a slightly higher target value m c comparing mler and es results reveal that the shape of the theoretical wave group is narrower i e the wave length is shorter in addition the wave height is larger compared to the envelope soliton nevertheless the resemblance is striking once again underpins the motivation for this study looking at the corresponding envelopes reveal that the larger wave height of the mlrw is associated with a deeper wave trough it also stands out that the shape of the es envelope deviates from the theoretical solution the reason is that the analytical es solution is based on a weakly non linear wave model which does not cover such steep wave groups from a theoretical point of view i e all non linear effects impact the steep es in the physical wave tank however the nls analytical soliton solution is found to be quite efficient for the generation of fairly steep solitary wave groups slunyaev et al 2013 4 conclusion this paper introduced es solutions of the nlse framework as design wave for wave structure interaction as an example case the maximum vbm of a chemical tanker were chosen the es solutions were used to generate a set of steep wave groups with varying wave length and steepness the results obtained were evaluated with results of classical design wave approaches in addition pb solutions as an alternative class of new design waves as well as an extraordinarily large real world wave were investigated during the experiments the general outcome of this study is that es solutions can be used for systematic steep wave group investigations of certain frequency up to very steep waves it is shown that the es feature a similar wave shape compared to the classical design wave approaches hereby the scalability of es in terms of wave steepness offers a wide range of task related applications the possibility to generate very steep wave groups which are equivalent to a classical design wave with the analytical nlse es solution offer a straightforward plug and play solution for test facilities this shows already the advantages as well as potential span of application of the es solution as design wave compared to extreme waves in the form of pb solutions as well as a real world reproduction steep es s representing an outstanding extreme event for the selected carrier wave length moreover it has been shown that both pb and es are useful tailored wave groups for task related design questions so pb are more appropriate for design questions related to highest possible waves and wave breaking e g green water on deck local loads at the bow or other structures as well as air gap investigations other design questions where steep wave events are relevant but wave breaking not may be better investigated by es due to the very short duration of such steep wave group due to that experiments can be done more efficiently as the calm down time of the water is significantly reduced for numerical investigations the fact that only a very short wave group needs to be simulated is already advantageous altogether this investigation verifies that the es solutions are applicable for the deterministic generation of

20577,this paper explores the applicability of envelope soliton solutions of the non linear schrödinger type equation as an innovative design wave for wave structure interaction investigations the major benefits of envelope solitons are the potential to generate non linear wave groups of certain frequency and physically possible wave steepness as well as the availability of an analytical solution furthermore the fact that envelope solitons are characterized by a limiting frequency bandwidth enables the tailor made generation of critical wave conditions for task specific wave structure investigations for the evaluation of the applicability of envelope solitons wave structure investigations with a chemical tanker were performed in a set of envelope solitons at certain frequencies and wave steepness the applicability of envelope solitons as design waves as well as their impact on the chemical tanker are compared to classical design wave concepts and tailored extreme wave events for the extreme wave events the peregrine breather solution and a real world abnormal wave reproduction the famous new year wave were selected the investigations comprised model tests as well as numerical simulations altogether this paper shows that envelope solitons are excellent design waves for extreme response investigations suitable for model tests as well as numerical investigations keywords wave

introduction ships and offshore structures are subjected to adverse environmental conditions the sheer untameable power of the sea causes short term e g peak loads in extreme conditions as well as long term effects e g fatigue during lifetime to be considered in the design process the focus of this paper lies on short term wave events leading to critical situations in terms of structure response for the design of a ship or offshore structure it is indispensable to identify and evaluate such short term but extreme conditions precisely in this context the identification of reliable limiting values of a design in terms of critical wave conditions is the key task and main challenge at once classically a series of individual long term simulations is required in order to obtain reliable extreme values by long term statistics to be considered during the design several methods of different complexity are available but the computational time needed increases significantly with increasing complexity of the applied method consequently investigations at advanced level are crucial in critical conditions but up to now not practical for holistic design approaches hence it is difficult to obtain accurate extreme value estimates by long term extreme value statistics as sufficiently long simulations are necessary but impractical to reduce statistical uncertainties contrary reducing the level of accuracy of the non linear simulations enables very long simulation durations in an adequate time span resulting in very small statistical uncertainties but increases the numerical model and extreme value uncertainties respectively several design wave concepts have been introduced to overcome this technical barrier so that statistical uncertainties and impractical simulation time spans are avoided the basic idea is to identify deterministic wave sequences which are relevant for extreme value investigations based on simplified methods i e small statistical but large numerical model uncertainties thus design wave concepts depict tailored critical wave sequences of short duration which represent a specific extreme event the structure will experience during its lifetime most of the design wave concepts are based on linear methods which depict an efficient approach for a fast holistic evaluation of a design so that the extreme conditions to be defined for the design wave concepts are commonly inferred from linear short term or long term statistics these critical wave groups of short duration are afterwards used as input for complex non linear simulations to obtain extreme values of the non linear response statistics the theoretical basis for the design wave concepts is the fundamental assumption that the non linear response is only a correction of the linear one the simplest design wave concept is the application of regular waves the critical wave length can be identified easily by the help of linear response amplitude operator rao for the selection of the wave height two approaches are applicable on the one hand the wave height can be directly taken from linear wave statistics defining a certain return period such as 20 or 100 years or on the other hand from linear long term response statistics by what the wave height can be determined indirectly by division of the long term extreme value with the linear rao e g adegeest et al 2000 combining the linear rao concept with irregular waves gives the linear response for certain sea states which illustrates the basis for the critical wave episode cwe concept torhaug et al 1998 the basic idea is to simulate a set of irregular sea states with random phases and identifying the wave sequence causing the highest response for each of the simulated irregular sea state realization these wave sequences are called cwe for the subsequent complex simulations a set of cwe s the mean of several cwe s or the cwe causing the highest response of all irregular sea states can be used the linear conditioning of short wave sequences based on probabilistic analysis are more straightforward methods for tailoring critical wave sequences the most likely storm wave mlw profile illustrates a most probable wave crest elevation as a result of the new wave model tromans et al 1991 friis hansen and nielsen 1995 hereby amplitudes and phases of wave spectra based on statistical irregular sea state parameters are condition in order to obtain the mlw profile applying these conditioning of amplitudes and phases on the response spectrum of the respective structure or ship results in the most likely extreme response most likely extreme response mler concept adegeest et al 2000 the most likely response wave mlrw adegeest et al 2000 dietz 2004 can be determined by applying linear rao s on the identified mler combining the mlrw profile with an irregular random background wave yields the conditional random response wave crrw concept dietz 2004 alford 2008 has developed a different approach for tailoring short wave sequences in terms of critical response this approach is based on the manipulation of the phases of the linear rao applying an optimization algorithm the objective function i e the target of the optimization is to obtain a maximum response klein 2015 developed a response based optimization tool similar to alford s approach the decisive difference lies in the underlying method for the determination of the maximum response in contrast to applying linear rao s a non linear time domain strip theory solver fonseca and guedes soares 1998a b has been used in order to predict the maximum response vertical wave bending moment vertical wave bending moment vbm for predefined irregular sea state parameters this strip theory solver takes the non linear hydrodynamic effects on the hull structure above mean water level into account assuming that the non linear effects relevant for vertical motions and global structural loads are to be dominated by buoyancy effects thus froude krylov as well as hydrostatic forces are considered non linear while the radiation as well as diffraction forces are kept linear consequently the obtained critical wave sequence relies on a more complex and accurate approach more generally this response based optimization tool can be combined with any kind of simulation tool i e any level of complexity enabling a tailored identification of critical wave sequences however the numerical efficiency of the chosen complex tools may limit this approach as a larger number of simulations is required for a successful application of the optimization algorithm i e to find an optimization strategy and the optimum all these concept are widely used for different applications e g dietz 2004 oberhagemann et al 2012 ley et al 2013 kim and troesch 2015 quon et al 2016 offering the deterministic identification of critical wave sequences for predefined statistical parameters however these simple and straightforward approaches have its advantages and drawbacks at once the identified wave sequences are based on linear methods requiring the definition of response levels to be reached and the resulting wave sequences are directly proportional to this level this can lead to physically impossible wave sequences regarding wave height and steepness as rayleigh statistics are not considering any physical limitation regarding response or excitation klein 2015 thus the reproduction of such wave groups whether by means of complex numerical methods or in model tests can be difficult or impossible due to the linear assumptions here it can happen that the identified wave group reaches non physical values with regard to wave height or wave steepness consequently the reproduced wave sequence will show wave breaking and deviates significantly from the theoretical wave shape in addition the validity of the concept that the critical wave sequences based on linear approaches are representing a global solution where only a non linear response correction has to be applied should be validated under different severe conditions when non linear effects are significant drummen et al 2009 in model tests it is common to investigate regular waves as well as irregular sea states whereby the sea state parameters are usually identified on the basis of previous numerical investigations in addition to the use of transfer functions the environmental contour line approach should be mentioned as another possibility for identifying the relevant sea state parameters haver and winterstein 2008 classically these identified sea state parameters are used to generate harsh irregular wave environments based on random phase distribution of the underlying wave components depending on the number of test runs as well as the duration such model tests may deliver the basis for statistical extreme value estimates tailoring critical wave sequences for model tests is challenging as the commonly applied standard model for ocean waves is inadequate for the precise generation of steep waves thus different experimental optimization schemes have been introduced in order to reproduce critical steep wave sequences more accurately the overall objective of such procedures is to obtain a control signal for the wave maker which results in the desired wave sequence at the target location e g chaplin 1996 clauss and schmittner 2005 schmittner 2005 clauss et al 2006 schmittner et al 2009 clauss and klein 2009 schmittner and hennig 2012 clauss et al 2013 clauss and klein 2013 the reproduction of critical wave sequences in a model basin is time consuming and very demanding and thus is not part of the day to day business of commercial test facilities consequently easy to use methods are necessary for tailored critical wave sequences in order to be applicable for test facilities for this purpose klein et al 2015 introduced the peregrine breather peregrine breather pb solution peregrine 1983 of the non linear schrödinger equation nlse as design wave for extreme wave structure investigation the pb is part of a class of breather solutions kuznetsov 1977 ma 1979 akhmediev et al 1985 1987 akhmediev and korneev 1986 which has been extensively investigated in the last years in terms of non linear wave evolution and freak wave formation e g dysthe 1979 dysthe and trulsen 1999 henderson et al 1999 osborne et al 2000 slunyaev et al 2005 chabchoub et al 2010 2011 clauss et al 2011b chabchoub et al 2012 shemer and alperovich 2013 zhang et al 2014 2015 as well as extreme wave structure interaction e g huijsmans et al 2005 andonowati et al 2006 clauss et al 2012 onorato et al 2013 klein et al 2015 houtani et al 2019 the pb is particularly in focus as this solution can be applied for the straightforward generation of realistic abnormal waves that appear from nowhere and disappear without trace akhmediev et al 2009 as this solution is localized in time and space it has been shown that the pb characteristics can be adjusted to real world abnormal waves such as the new year wave new year wave nyw chabchoub et al 2010 klein et al 2015 featuring many similarities so that they can be considered as prototypes for abnormal waves dysthe and trulsen 1999 osborne et al 2000 klein et al 2015 have shown that the pb can be used for systematic investigations as the analytical solution offers the straightforward generation of arbitrary wave length and steepness up to wave breaking such waves are predestined for the investigation of the impact of extreme wave events in terms of wave height steepness and breaking wave events in addition the pb model has also been established for numerical investigations on extreme wave events and its impact on offshore structures peric et al 2015 qin et al 2017 koukounas et al 2018 qin et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the critical wave groups of the design wave concepts have a slightly different shape compared to extreme waves they do not have an individual extreme wave within the wave group and the envelope of these design wave concept wave groups look very similar to the envelope soliton envelope soliton es solution of the nlse framework this close similarity is the motivation for this study similar to the wave group shapes of the design wave concepts the es offers the possibility to generate wave groups with tailored properties in terms of carrier frequency and wave steepness since an analytical solution is available zakharov and shabat 1971 hereby the width of the es is variable but directly linked to the maximum height of the envelope i e with increasing wave height the width decreases in contrast to the shape of the design wave concepts generally es s are characterized by balancing the wave dispersion and non linearity of the wave group in such a way that the envelope propagates with permanent form as the soliton is constituted by interacting coherent wave harmonics that prevents dispersion of the group slunyaev et al 2013 the general existence of envelope solitons have been shown by yuen and lake 1975 slunyaev et al 2013 have shown that the es solution can be applied for the generation of very steep wave groups in physical wave tanks the coherent structure of the es have been shown by slunyaev et al 2017 demonstrating experimentally that the collision of individual es can happen without any interaction among each other furthermore their study has shown that two es s with different propagation speeds do not interact during an overtaking process more recently it has been shown that soliton like wave groups persist in unidirectional irregular sea states by strongly non linear simulations and increase noticeably the probability of high waves even in moderately rough sea conditions slunyaev and kokorina 2017 moreover slunyaev 2021 has discussed the presence of a soliton like wave group in a non linear unidirectional irregular sea state this wave group has shown a stable behaviour over more than 200 periods the investigation has revealed that most of the extreme wave conditions within the non linear unidirectional irregular sea state have occurred on to this wave group resulting in more extreme events in terms of wave height and duration of existence thus es s may not only being specific cases of wave groups but occur more often and representing a natural shape in non linear irregular waves due to the deep water self modulation processes following the applicability of es for wave structure investigations will be explored therefore es of different wave steepnesses are generated in a wave tank afterwards their impact on the maximum vbm of a chemical tanker is investigated as application example model tests in tailor made extreme waves complete the experimental investigations the results obtained are evaluated against classical design wave approaches 2 theoretical basis following the methods applied for this study are briefly introduced the starting point is the standard model of ocean waves and structure response which depicts the basis for the design wave concepts afterwards the weakly non linear wave model leading to the es and pb solution is illustrated all following investigations are reduced to long crested waves i e all waves travelling in one direction in addition the theoretical basis is described on a general term without any claim of completeness 2 1 water wave problem the newtonian fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid and irrotational so that the evolution of water waves can be mathematically described by the following governing equations for long crested waves travelling in x direction 1 φ 0 2 φ z φ x ζ x ζ t 0 on z ζ x t 3 g z 1 2 φ 2 φ t 0 on z ζ x t 4 φ z 0 on z d with 2 x 2 2 z 2 x z and the subscripts represent the corresponding derivations the solution of the boundary value problem is considerably complicated by non linear terms in the two surface boundary conditions and by the fact that these conditions must be satisfied at the unknown free surface z ζ x t which makes an analytical solution of the exact boundary value problem infeasible therefore approximate solutions are essential with different approaches leading to solutions with different scopes on the one hand the solution can be approximated by numerical methods up to fully non linear simulations which is out of the scope of this study on the other hand the complexity can be reduced by simplifying the cauchy problem and the application of perturbation theory and taylor series expansion the solutions obtained differ due to the expansion order and the perturbation parameters standard model of ocean waves the standard model of ocean waves is based on linear wave theory the cauchy problem eqs 1 4 is reduced by applying perturbation theory for the unknown surface elevation and potential the perturbation parameter is the wave steepness ϵ ζ a k which relates the wave amplitude ζ a and wave number k in addition taylor series expansion is used for the approximation of the boundary value problem at the unknown surface under the assumption that the wave height is significantly smaller compared to the wave length the simplified boundary value problem is obtained by truncation of the taylor series expansion at order o ϵ 1 for which the analytical linear solution can be determined fig 1 presents the standard model of ocean waves and structure response the stochastic irregular sea state top left is regarded as superposition of independent harmonic component waves travelling in time and space 5 ζ x t j ζ a j cos k j x ω j t ϕ j with ζ a j k j ω j and ϕ j as amplitude wave number angular frequency and phase of the j th component wave in the middle of fig 1 the angular frequency and wave number are coupled via the dispersion relation 6 ω j k j g tanh k j d with water depth d and gravitational acceleration g the fourier transform depicts the analytical basis enabling a fast and simple evaluation and handling of complex sea states based on this the surface elevation can be easily manipulated in time and space by deterministic superposition of component waves so that tailored wave groups critical design wave sequences as well as extreme wave events can be modelled see top centre and top right of fig 1 in frequency domain spectral parameters and wave statistics can be easily determined in addition the spectral approach allows the definition and use of empirical standard wave spectra for design purposes see bottom left of fig 1 consequently this standard wave model is established in all relevant areas despite the known limitations the linear approach provides widely acceptable results for engineering applications forming the basis for holistic investigations of a design and subsequent complex investigations e g design wave concepts 2 2 wave structure interaction determining the behaviour of offshore structures in waves is as complex as describing the waves themselves the wave loads acting on the submerged part must be determined in order to obtain the corresponding response as aforementioned different approaches are used for the assessment of offshore structures from simple and fast linear methods to completely non linear calculations as the focus of this study lies on the fast determination of design waves yielding to critical response potential flow theory is applied for the determination of the exciting forces in addition hydrodynamic compact structures are addressed so that the flow around the structure can be described by superposition of independent potentials linearization of the problem assuming an ideal fluid 7 φ φ 0 m 1 6 φ m φ 7 with the potential φ 0 of the incident waves the potential φ j of the radiated waves due to motion m and the potential φ 7 of the scattered waves due to the presences of the structure integrating the dynamic pressure over the wetted surface of a submerged body results in the total force acting on the offshore structure knowing the total force acting on the submerged body the response of the structure s can be calculated by applying newtonian mechanics resulting in six differential equations of motion for stable linear systems lewis 1989 8 m a s b s c s f e with s and s representing the time derivatives of the structure motion the underline marks a vector with six components according to the six degrees of freedom m is the mass matrix a the hydrodynamic mass matrix b the damping matrix c the restoring forces matrix and f the excitation forces and moments matrix the system matrices are of dimension 6 6 according to the number of modes of motion i e the three translatory and three rotatory motion components of a free floating structure once the exciting forces and hydrodynamic coefficients of the floating structure are known the response can be determined assuming a linear relation between exciting forces and the structure response enables the utilization of rao s for the individual modes of motion 9 h ω j s a j ω j ζ a j ω j e i ϕ ˆ j ω j with h ω j the rao s a j ω j the amplitude of the response ζ a j ω j the amplitude of the excitation and ϕ ˆ j is the phase shift between excitation and response the rao concept is not limited to the motion s of floating structures and has many other applications for the application example of this study the identification of extreme conditions leading to a maximum vbm a linear vbm rao was used which was determined by a linear radiation diffraction programme standard model of offshore structure response the application of spectral analysis in ship dynamics started with the fundamental publication of st denis and pierson 1953 being the basis for the standard model of offshore structure response assuming a steady state system the sea state as well as the response are interpreted as a superposition of an infinite number of harmonic elementary components being linearly related as a consequence the system behaviour of offshore structures is describable by a set of rao s eq 9 fig 1 bottom displays the spectral approach for offshore structure response the spectral density s ζ ω see bottom left of fig 1 represents the energy distribution of a sea state as a function of wave frequency ω in analogy to the wave spectrum s ζ ω the response spectrum s s ω see bottom right of fig 1 represents the energy distribution of the output signal i e the structure response accordingly the spectral approach introduced for the sea state description can also be directly applied for the response spectrum wave and response spectra are related by 10 s s ω j h ω j 2 s ζ ω j with s s ω j δ ω 1 2 s a j 2 ω j s ζ ω j δ ω 1 2 ζ a j 2 ω j and δ ω 2 π δ f represents the frequency resolution cf bottom left of fig 1 again the fourier transform depicts the analytical basis providing the link between frequency and time domain the application of rao s enables a fast efficient and complete description of the hydrodynamic characteristics of offshore structures frequency domain investigations offer a holistic evaluation of offshore structures including short term and long term statistics as well as annual downtime time domain investigations are essential for task related evaluations of cause reaction effects in deterministic tailored wave sequences 2 3 design wave concepts for the objective of this study the evaluation of the applicability of es as design waves for wave structure investigations two design wave concepts were used namely the cwe as well as mler concept were utilized to classify the model test results with the es the two concepts are introduced briefly in the following 2 3 1 critical wave episode the concept of cwe s torhaug et al 1998 is a classical and straightforward application of the standard model of offshore structure response c f bottom of fig 1 once the relevant critical sea state parameters are identified standard wave spectra can be used to calculate very long realizations of the ship response by combining the linear rao with the wave spectrum eq 10 the wave group causing extraordinarily large response is called cwe due to the very efficient method for calculating the response a multitude of different cwe s can be identified by randomly varying the phase distribution based on this a set of cwe s the mean of several cwe s or the cwe causing the highest response of all irregular sea state realizations may be selected for detailed investigation 2 3 2 mler and mlrw the mler concept has been derived due to the fact that the extreme response must not be related to the mlw profile based on extreme wave crest height however the basic idea is taken from the mlw concept tromans et al 1991 friis hansen and nielsen 1995 conditioning of amplitudes and phases but applied on the response spectrum of the respective structure or ship adegeest et al 2000 the mlrw adegeest et al 2000 dietz 2004 can afterwards be determined by applying linear rao s on the identified mler the basis of the mler concept is the superposition principle of component waves c f eq 5 11 ζ m l r w x t j 1 n ζ a j v j cos k j x ω j t w j sin k j x ω j t with v j and w j as normally distributed random variables from eq 10 follows for the structure response s m l e r t 12 s m l e r x t j 1 n s a j v j cos k j x ω j t ϕ ˆ j w j sin k j x ω j t ϕ ˆ j the variables v j and w j can be derived with the following equations dietz 2004 13 v j s j m c m 2 m 0 m 1 2 m 2 ω j m 1 ω m ω j m 0 m 1 cos ϕ ˆ j 14 w j s j m c m 2 m 0 m 1 2 m 2 ω j m 1 ω m ω j m 0 m 1 sin ϕ ˆ j the variable m c in both equations depicts the desired structure response to be defined in order to arrive at the mler profile the spectral moments m i of the response can be calculated with 15 m i j 1 n ω j i s j ω and the mean wave frequency ω m m 1 m 0 consequently determining v j and w j enables to calculate the mler eq 12 as well as the mlrw eq 11 generally this method produces a response as well as wave profile which depends on the underlying rao it is worth mentioning that the width and shape of the profile is independent of the predefined extreme response thus the extreme structure response m c to be defined does not change the shape and width of the profile but the absolute values are rescaling to the actual response level thus mlrw can be easily rescaled in order to investigate different short term statistical loads 2 4 weakly non linear wave model weakly non linear wave models have been introduced to take some important aspects of non linearity into account e g benjamin and feir 1967 zakharov 1968 the classical nlse can be deduced by applying perturbation and taylor series expansion on the cauchy problem eqs 1 4 zakharov 1968 hasimoto and ono 1972 besides the small amplitude wave assumption which is similar to linear theory a narrow bandwidth spectrum is additionally assumed resulting in the perturbation parameters wave steepness ϵ k c ζ a and relative bandwidth μ δ k k c 1 applying taylor series expansion above still water level and separating into the different orders o ϵ n the nlse can be derived by solving each order sequentially beginning with the lowest order the nlse is obtained by truncating the series expansion at order o ϵ 3 mei 1989 finally the nlse describing the evolution of wave groups in space of a time series reads 16 a x 1 c g a t i α 2 a t 2 β a 2 a 0 eq 16 is required for wave tank experiments and all other applications where the wave sequences have to be available in time at specific locations in space this equation can be derived from the classical nlse by an iterative procedure exchanging the derivatives in space with derivatives in time and vice versa see e g mei 1989 the coefficients α and β are depending on the carrier angular frequency ω c and the corresponding carrier wave number k c for arbitrary water depth the coefficients are mei 1989 serio et al 2005 17 α 1 8 ω c k c 2 α c g 3 β 1 2 ω c k c 2 β c g 18 α ν 2 2 8 k c d 2 cosh 2 k c d sinh 2 2 k c d and 19 β cosh 4 k c d 8 2 tanh 2 k c d 8 sinh 4 k c d 2 cosh 2 k c d 0 5 ν 2 sinh 2 2 k c d k c d t a n h k c d ν 2 2 the coefficient ν 20 ν 1 2 k c d s i n h 2 k c d represents the correction term for the group velocity 21 c g ω c 2 k c ν in finite water depth 2 4 1 envelope soliton solution the es solution depict one exact solution of the nlse which has been discovered by zakharov and shabat 1971 via inverse scattering transform their existence has been firstly experimentally verified by yuen and lake 1975 later on slunyaev et al 2013 2017 have shown the general applicability for wave tank experiments envelope solitons are wave groups which are travelling with permanent form as the soliton is constituted by interacting coherent wave harmonics that prevents dispersion of the group slunyaev et al 2013 thus wave dispersion and non linearity within the wave group are perfectly balanced forming a stable wave group the es solution of eq 16 describing the evolution of the envelope in space of a time series reads 22 a s x t a c e i 1 2 a c 2 β x cosh a c β 2 α t x c g where a c is the soliton amplitude the corresponding surface elevation is obtained by 23 ζ x t 1 2 a s x t e i k c x ω c t ϕ s c c where c c stand for conjugate complex and ϕ s for the phase of the underlying carrier wave 2 4 2 peregrine breather solution breather solutions are also exact solutions of the nlse illustrating a class of extreme waves which are driven by modulational instability thus slightly perturbed quasi monochromatic waves in time or space grow into large amplifications of the initial amplitude during wave propagation the general form which can be derived from eq 16 reads 24 a b x t a c x g x t e i ϕ x 1 where g ϕ are real functions to be determined and 25 a c a c e i β a c 2 x a detailed discussion on the derivation of the different solutions can be found in van groesen et al 2006 as well as in karjanto and van groesen 2007 the pb solution also known as rational solution has been originally derived by peregrine 1983 the pb represents the limiting case of the time periodic kusnetzov ma breather kuznetsov 1977 ma 1979 and the space periodic akhmediev breather akhmediev et al 1985 akhmediev and korneev 1986 akhmediev et al 1987 it has the peculiarity of being not periodic in time and in space it is a wave that appears from nowhere and disappears without trace akhmediev et al 2009 and has been considered as special prototype of freak wave shrira and geogjaev 2010 its analytical form is karjanto and van groesen 2007 26 a b x t a c x 4 α 1 i 2 β a c 2 x α α 2 β a c 2 x 2 2 β a c 2 t 2 1 the corresponding surface elevation is obtained by 27 ζ x t 1 2 a b x t e i k c x ω c t ϕ b c c where c c stand for conjugate complex and ϕ b for the phase of the underlying carrier wave thus the pb is well defined by the plane wave amplitude a c as well as the carrier frequency ω c i e the initial steepness the amplitude amplification factor aaf which describes the grow rate between amplitude of the background wave and the maximum wave height is always equal to three and only the shape of the largest wave group changes depending on the initial steepness 3 application example the overall objective of this study is to show that es solutions can be applied as design waves in order to identify extreme responses not only for test facilities but also for efficient numerical investigations for this purpose the maximum vbm of a chemical tanker has been chosen as typical design questions the precise knowledge of maximum loads is indispensable to ensure a safe operation of ships in waves the continuing news of accidents in severe weather with disastrous consequences show that the topic is still very relevant and that not all questions have been answered satisfactorily yet in extreme conditions the waves causes the highest vbm at amidships being highly non linear hereby one may distinguish between hogging ship on wave crest and sagging ship in wave trough at which the latter one is the significant more critical condition the classification societies providing an empirical formulae for the dimensioning of the ship s transverse section also distinguishing between sagging and hogging dnv gl se 2021 for this study the permissible vertical wave bending moment sagging condition 28 m v w s 1 25 1 0 6 knm as well as the vertical hull girder ultimate bending capacity 29 m v w s u 1 51 1 0 6 knm are used as reference for the design wave concepts as well as model test results dnv gl se 2021 for this application example the basic considerations as well as investigations necessary in order to identify the relevant environmental conditions for detailed investigations are reduced to a bare minimum as aforementioned the linear vbm rao depicts the basis for the input for the design wave concepts furthermore the vbm rao is used for the identification of the critical wave lengths for the calculation of the vbm rao the established radiation diffraction programme wamit newman 1977 1986 lee 1995 were utilized based on the calculated vbm rao three wave length to be used for the es investigations were chosen based on a wave length to ship length ratio i e l w l p p hereby the most critical wave length in terms of maximum rao is approximately located around l w l p p 1 1 note that most critical wave length in terms of rao means that the ratio between response and excitation is maximum but the absolute value for the response depends on the rao and the corresponding wave height furthermore l w l p p 1 3 and l w l p p 1 5 were additionally chosen for all three wave lengths model test results of the chemical tanker encountering extreme waves based on pb solutions will serve as reference regarding extreme response for certain wave lengths furthermore the results obtained are discussed in the context of the design wave concepts following the chemical tanker the test set up and the test facility is briefly introduced before the design wave concepts were applied afterwards the model tests are introduced with the systematic generation of the es and the test results for the chemical tanker thereby the model test results are not only compared with the theoretical results of the design wave concepts but also with test data in deterministic extreme waves 3 1 experimental set up the main dimensions of the chemical tanker are presented in table 1 fig 2 presents the experimental set up of the chemical tanker model at a scale of 1 70 the model was made of glass fibre reinforced plastic grp and segmented at l p p 2 the two segments were connected with three force transducers two were mounted on deck one on each side the third one was mounted underneath the keel the force transducers registered the longitudinal forces during the model tests based on the measured forces and the given geometrical arrangement of the three force transducers the resulting vbm at water line level were obtained furthermore two wave gauges were installed on deck at the forecastle to detect the green water impact on deck absolute measurable green water height on deck is approx 13 m front gauge and 9 m rear gauge at full scale cf fig 2 the ship motions were recorded by an optical tracking system consisting of five cameras with a tracking range of 8 m 10 m during the tests the chemical tanker was towed with an elastic suspension system using a triangular towing arrangement the longitudinal motions were restricted by a spring in front of and a counter weight behind the model the suspension system was connected with the ship model by a thin elastic cross bar which was mounted on deck of the aft segment centre of gravity in x direction with this arrangement heave and pitch motions remained unrestrained the experimental programme were conducted in the seakeeping basin at technische universität berlin tub the seakeeping basin at tub is 110 m long with a measuring range of 90 m the width is 8 m and the water depth is 1 m on the one side an electrically driven wave generator is installed which can be utilized in flap type and piston type mode the wave generator is fully computer controlled and a software is implemented which enables the generation of regular waves transient wave packages deterministic irregular sea states with defined characteristics as well as tailored critical wave sequences on the opposite side a wave damping slope is installed to suppress disturbing wave reflections even if this wave damping slope is very efficient in cancelling out the waves complete prevention of wave reflection is not possible therefore the duration of the measurements must always be determined taking wave reflection into account i e the measurement may only go as far as the time of arrival of the first reflected wave however this does not matter for the test campaign presented in this paper as the wave groups examined were of short duration and the measurements were completed before the occurrence of possible wave reflections in this context the es are particularly noteworthy as this very short wave groups have a significantly positive influence on the surface calm down time between two test runs 3 2 design waves following the cwe and the mler concept were applied as aforementioned the basis was the vbm rao for d 70 m and a tma spectrum bouws et al 1985 which depicts the water depth dependent extension of the deep water jonswap spectrum as design sea state an irregular sea state with t p 12 5 s l p l p p 1 5 h s 12 4 m and γ 3 3 was assumed the cwe concept was performed for 1 0 4 random realizations and the maximum vbm was identified for each realization in order to take only critical responses into account the permissible vbm were defined as threshold i e only the maximum vbm of a random realization is considered as critical if the value is higher than the threshold the mler approach requires the definition of a maximum response which is set to the vertical hull girder ultimate bending capacity for this investigation note that the shape of the mler and mlrw depends on the selected sea state parameters but the height depends only on the defined maximum response fig 3 presents the outcome of the applied concepts fig 3 a shows the results of the cwe concept and fig 3 b for the mler concept the top diagram of fig 3 a shows all identified critical wave sequences causing a vbm higher than the permissible one as black curves the surface elevation causing the highest response green curve and the mean of all critical wave sequences red curve are additionally presented the bottom diagram presents the associated mean and maximum vbm the black curve in the top diagram of fig 3 b represents the mler profile hereby the extreme response m c to be predefined in order to determine the mler profile has set to be equal the vertical hull girder ultimate bending capacity m v w s u the corresponding mlrw is shown as black curve in the diagram below two further mler as well as mlrw profiles are additionally presented in grey curves to illustrate the scaling approach of the mler concept i e that only the absolute value changes but not the shape the grey curves show the results for three quarter and half m c looking at the diagram reveals the motivation of this study at the first glance on the one side the shape of the design wave profiles is strongly reminding of es solutions as the resemblance is striking on the other side the design wave concepts arrive at a solution on a non physical basis in terms of maximum wave height and wave breaking analysing the results for the cwe concept shows that the most critical wave episode results in a wave steepness of ϵ h 2 k 0 52 which is above the theoretical limit in nature steepness hardly reaches values larger than ϵ 0 4 toffoli et al 2010 because of wave breaking in this context the mean critical wave episode is more realistic as the steepness reaches ϵ 0 36 for the mlrw the steepness depends on the predefined response level and results for the selected maximum response to ϵ 0 39 generally the reproduction of these design waves for wave tank experiments is almost impossible even if the maximum steepness is below the physical limit as the non linearity inside such steep wave groups is not taken into account by the standard model of ocean waves hereby the main problem is the distance between the location of the wave board and the target location along the wave tank at where the wave group needs to be reproduced this problem does not exist for complex numerical simulations since the inlet is usually not far away from the position of the structure or ship nonetheless the physical validity of such steep wave groups is questionable in contrast to the es solution the shape of the wave group is just scaled according to the maximum response whereas es show a different shape in terms of length of the wave group and number of waves within this wave group depending on the steepness strictly speaking es are the physical representatives for design waves as they are providing a similar shape for very steep waves on a physical basis 3 3 experimental results the results of the experimental programme are presented in the following as aforementioned the chemical tanker was investigated in es of three different carrier wave length in addition three different wave steepnesses were selected for each wave length in order to show the applicability of the es solution the selected wave steepnesses represent steep wave groups whereby the steepest case ϵ 0 35 depicts a limiting case based on our experience generally the generation of the es were straightforward due to the available analytical solution nevertheless the analytical solution is based on weakly non linear wave theory which is why deviations can be observed for steeper wave groups thus for the steepest waves the deviation will increase and in particular wave dispersion and non linearity of the wave group may be out of balance this non stable behaviour can result in destruction of the wave group radiated wave trains detaching from the initial es if wave dispersion was dominant or occurrence of a single high wave up to wave breaking within the wave group if non linearity was dominant the former can be solved by calibrating the measured wave group and the latter depicts the limit in terms of wave steepness however from the objective of investigating ships and structures in extreme design wave groups the accurate reproduction of the analytical solution is not the primary target from this perspective the analytical solution provides an excellent basis for steep wave group generation it is also worth mentioning regarding the generation process that the selection of the phase ϕ s eq 23 of the waves at the wave board influences the shape at the target location in this study the objective was to generate a wave group at target location where the ship experiences a huge wave trough one could certainly also select a phase position at the wave board so that the wave group at target location has a wave crest in the middle of the group i e a phase shift of π compared to the generated waves fig 4 presents the results of the experimental test campaign the results for the es are shown on the left hand side the carrier wave length increases from top to bottom and three steepnesses were investigated for each wave length each subpicture consists of three diagrams representing the surface elevation top measured ms the corresponding vbm m v w centre and the green water column at fp bottom analysing the measured surface elevations for the different steepnesses reveals that the shape of the es wave groups look very similar to the classical design wave concepts in addition the steepness of the es is scalable in a similar way as the mlrw concept the key difference is that the wave group shape of es changes for different steepnesses however both the general shape as well as the scalability showing already the advantages of the es solution as design waves the corresponding vbm s result in the largest response for the steepest waves as expected in order to evaluate the absolute values the horizontal dashed lines mark the permissible vbm black and the vertical hull girder ultimate bending capacity magenta evaluating the measured loads with the permissible values shows that the investigated wave groups are causing extreme response for the steepest wave groups in order to evaluate the impact of es model test with pb were also performed on the right hand side of fig 4 are the results for the pb presented the subpictures are arranged as on the left hand side the carrier wave length was chosen to match with the critical wave lengths of the es for the three pb the wave steepness of each wave length were selected in such a way that it represents the limiting case of the selected wave length i e all breathers were plunging breaker at target location this denotes that the shown breather are representing the steepest wave for a certain carrier wave length comparing the maximum vbm measured in the steepest es with the pb results reveal that the es wave group causes a very similar extreme response the differences are less than 4 the main reason for this is that the steeper and larger wave crests of the pb do not cause an additional contribution to the vbm as the diagrams for green water on deck clearly show the steeper pb result in more green water on deck consequently the wetted surface at the bow and stern of the ship at which the hydrodynamic pressure acts does not change this shows that the steep es representing an outstanding extreme event for the selected carrier wave length furthermore the results already show that both pb and es are depicting useful tailored wave groups for task related design questions so pb are more appropriate for design questions related to highest possible waves and wave breaking such as green water on deck local loads at the bow or other structures as well as air gap investigations es solutions may be chosen for extreme waves where wave breaking does not contribute to the design question the main advantage of generating es instead of pb is the fact that only a wave group of short duration needs to be investigated consequently the tests can be done more efficiently as the calm down time for the water after the test is significantly reduced for numerical investigations the fact that only a very short wave group needs to be simulated is already advantageous for comparison purposes the impact of a real world extreme wave is additionally investigated in this study the nyw one of the most famous extraordinarily high waves in history recorded in the north sea at the draupner jacket platform on january 1st 1995 haver and anderson 2000 have been reproduced in the seakeeping basin clauss and klein 2011 and widely used to investigate the impact of freak waves on different floating structures e g clauss et al 2004 2010 2011a clauss and klein 2016 in addition the model scale of the nyw reproduction fits the crest shape and height of the pb with l w l p p 1 5 and the kinematics and dynamics of both extreme waves have already been compared in klein et al 2015 the comparison between nyw black curve reproduction and pb blue curve is shown in the top diagram of the bottom right subpicture of fig 4 the original real world measurement at the draupner platform is additionally shown in grey haver and anderson 2000 the impact of the reproduction in terms of vbm and green water on deck is shown in the other diagrams also as black curves from this data it is clearly visible that the pb and the es solutions result in a significantly higher extreme response both design wave groups pb and es are more severe compared to the real world nyw due to the critical characteristics in terms of wave length and height particularly the deep wave trough as well as the wave crest in front of this wave trough is more critical fig 5 presents comparison between the theoretical results from the mler concept red curves and the measured es results black curves for l w l p p 1 5 and ϵ 0 35 for a better comparability the target value m c for the vbm cf eq 12 and following is adjusted to the maximum measured value of the es thus the absolute values are identical but the shape of the two approaches can be compared note that the mler and mlrw profile in fig 3 b are based on a slightly higher target value m c comparing mler and es results reveal that the shape of the theoretical wave group is narrower i e the wave length is shorter in addition the wave height is larger compared to the envelope soliton nevertheless the resemblance is striking once again underpins the motivation for this study looking at the corresponding envelopes reveal that the larger wave height of the mlrw is associated with a deeper wave trough it also stands out that the shape of the es envelope deviates from the theoretical solution the reason is that the analytical es solution is based on a weakly non linear wave model which does not cover such steep wave groups from a theoretical point of view i e all non linear effects impact the steep es in the physical wave tank however the nls analytical soliton solution is found to be quite efficient for the generation of fairly steep solitary wave groups slunyaev et al 2013 4 conclusion this paper introduced es solutions of the nlse framework as design wave for wave structure interaction as an example case the maximum vbm of a chemical tanker were chosen the es solutions were used to generate a set of steep wave groups with varying wave length and steepness the results obtained were evaluated with results of classical design wave approaches in addition pb solutions as an alternative class of new design waves as well as an extraordinarily large real world wave were investigated during the experiments the general outcome of this study is that es solutions can be used for systematic steep wave group investigations of certain frequency up to very steep waves it is shown that the es feature a similar wave shape compared to the classical design wave approaches hereby the scalability of es in terms of wave steepness offers a wide range of task related applications the possibility to generate very steep wave groups which are equivalent to a classical design wave with the analytical nlse es solution offer a straightforward plug and play solution for test facilities this shows already the advantages as well as potential span of application of the es solution as design wave compared to extreme waves in the form of pb solutions as well as a real world reproduction steep es s representing an outstanding extreme event for the selected carrier wave length moreover it has been shown that both pb and es are useful tailored wave groups for task related design questions so pb are more appropriate for design questions related to highest possible waves and wave breaking e g green water on deck local loads at the bow or other structures as well as air gap investigations other design questions where steep wave events are relevant but wave breaking not may be better investigated by es due to the very short duration of such steep wave group due to that experiments can be done more efficiently as the calm down time of the water is significantly reduced for numerical investigations the fact that only a very short wave group needs to be simulated is already advantageous altogether this investigation verifies that the es solutions are applicable for the deterministic generation of

20578,dynamic response analysis for offshore structures plays an important role in the design stage to evaluate the performance of the designed structures this study proposes a novel time continuous dynamic response analysis algorithm for offshore structures which is implemented in the laplace domain depending on the decoupled vibrating differential equation and the complex exponential decomposition of external excitation one theoretical development is that time continuous dynamic response can be obtained according to discrete external excitation the other is that the initial conditions can be considered in the process thereby compensating for the weakness of the traditional frequency method concurrently the computational efficiency of the proposed method is good benefitting from initial conditions considerable and the algorithm is insensitive to the time step of the calculation compared with the time domain method to monitor the performance of the algorithm two numerical models and a physical model experiment are adopted the first example is a simple numerical model of a cantilever beam describing the entire process of the proposed method the results indicate that the dynamic response of the vibrating system calculated by employing the proposed method is in good agreement with that obtained by the newmark β method in addition the algorithm yields an accurate dynamic response using a longer time step in the calculation realizing better stability than the traditional newmark β method the second example is a numerical model of a jacket offshore platform located at liaodong bay bohai sea which extends the algorithm to dynamic response analysis of offshore structures the results of the studies show that the displacement response of the offshore structure calculated by the proposed method matches well with that yielded by the newmark β method under random initial conditions and exciting loads on the structure it is found that the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm is better than that of the time domain method finally a physical cantilever model is applied to verify the correctness of the proposed method keywords offshore structure laplace domain initial condition modal superposition time continuous dynamic response calculation 1 introduction offshore platform structures are the basic establishments for marine resource exploitation whose structural health and stability are important for the safe operation of their equipment dynamic response analysis of offshore structures such as of their displacement velocity and acceleration due to winds waves currents and ice excitation is required in the design stage to evaluate the stability fatigue life and numerous other engineering problems of structures the main problem of dynamic response analysis is solving the vibrating differential equation for a multiple degree of freedom mdof system depending on the resolution domain the algorithms to estimate the dynamic response of an offshore structure primarily include time and frequency domain methods modal superposition method is a commonly used method for dynamic response analysis which converts an mdof system into a single degree of freedom sdof system by decoupling the vibrating differential equation the dynamic response of a decoupled sdof can be calculated using the duhamel integral clough and penzien 1993 for a simple exciting force a continuous dynamic response is obtained by applying a convolution operation if an exciting force or a continuous convolution function is unavailable a numerical method should be used to solve the duhamel integral a more general class of methods to estimate the dynamic response of a vibrating system is direct integration method based on numerical integrals according to the dof the governing equation of a vibrating system is treated as a second order ordinary differential equation over 100000 dofs or an equivalent of a first order ordinary differential equation over 100 dofs craig and kurdila 2006 offshore structures are generally very large finite element fe models and second order methods are usually chosen to deal with dynamic problems which mainly include the central difference method runge kutta method newmark β method and wilson θ method bathe and wilson 1976 craig and kurdila 2006 newmark 1959 the direct integration method in the time domain can deal with the dynamic response excited by arbitrary loadings it calculates the response using a numerical method and yields an approximation of the true response consequently the factors affecting the performance of the approximation algorithms should be taken into account when employing the numerical integral methods which mainly include stability and accuracy conditional stability and unconditional stability are perhaps the most simple concepts of stability the time step is a key factor for obtaining a stable dynamic response in conditional stable methods the time step in the numerical integral must be shorter than the critical time step which depends on the algorithm and the physical parameters in the calculation however unconditionally stable methods do not rely on the time step constraint which is generally preferred in the simulation of a dynamic response chopra 2000 described in detail the newmark β method and emphasized that a method can be constructed as an unconditionally stable method the wilson θ method is another extensively used numerical integral method it is unconditionally stable only for θ 1 37 hilber and hughes 1978 nickell 1971 the accuracy of a direct integration method is an equally important factor when performing stepwise integration for the dynamic response analysis of offshore structures the accuracy of the numerical integration algorithms can be classified into amplitude accuracy and period accuracy and an inaccurate solution is typically manifested as a numerical dissipation and a period elongation craig and kurdila 2006 nickell 1971 simulated the free vibration response of an undamped sdof system using a numerical integration method which showed that amplitude decay is caused by numerical dissipation despite a short time step meanwhile the average acceleration method was used for a vibrating system which resulted in the elongation of the period of vibration hilber et al 1977 suggested that an inaccurate solution was a result of the time step ratio and he plotted the numerical damping factor and the relative period error versus the time step ratio the plots showed that the time step plays a key role in determining the stability and accuracy of a numerical solution time domain methods can only provide an approximate dynamic response and the high frequency components may be ignored when applying a direct integration method craig and kurdila 2006 different from time domain methods a frequency domain method for dynamic response estimation solves the vibrating differential equation in the frequency domain it does not require considering the negative influence of the time step as in time domain methods and can avoid the error due to numerical integrals venancio filho and claret 1995 solved a vibrating differential equation in the frequency domain and presented general formulations for the dynamic response analysis of mdof systems in physical and modal coordinates liu and bergdahl 1997 applied a frequency domain method to calculate the dynamic response of cables and compared the results with those of a time domain method exhibiting that the former has good accuracy and efficiency han et al 2019 introduced a simplified method to estimate the frequency domain response of a jacket platform excited by random wave forces it yielded a reliable and accurate prediction of the dynamic response skafte et al 2017 divided measured response into low frequency response and high frequency response and depended on experimental model shapes to predict strain response the traditional frequency domain method is extensively used in the simulation of the dynamic response however some problems occur simultaneously evidently the response calculated by a frequency domain method only includes the steady state response because of a fourier transform ft application however the dynamic response of an offshore structure typically comprises a transient response produced by the initial conditions and a steady state response due to an external excitation to consider the transient response mansur et al 2004 introduced a pseudo force to express the initial conditions and solved the vibrating differential equation in the frequency domain depending on a standard discrete fourier transform lee et al 2005 applied a fast fourier transform fft based spectral analysis method for the dynamic calculation of a linear vibrating system induced by the initial conditions martins et al 2006 used the concepts of classical mechanics for considering the initial conditions in the frequency domain when calculating a dynamic response and subsequently extended the method to three dimensional applications liu et al 2015 2016 considered the initial conditions according to the relationship between a laplace transform and an ft and used an inverse ft to yield the dynamic response in the time domain in addition to the initial conditions the external loading of a vibrating system should be in the period in which the ft is implemented only in this case the energy leakage problem of the ft can be considered as insignificant however the exciting force of an offshore structure is most probably nonperiodic and even influenced by the damping factor which limits the application of a frequency domain method based on the ft for this situation hu et al 2013 introduced a complex exponential decomposition method based on a state space model this method can deal with an external excitation synthesized by harmonic or damped signal components differing from the traditional time or frequency domain methods this study aimed to propose a method to obtain continuous dynamic responses of offshore structures this method can avoid the integral error of a numerical integration method and the limitations of an ft in frequency domain methods the proposed algorithm calculates the continuous dynamic response depending on poles and the corresponding residues which include the information of the initial conditions vibrating system and external exciting force two numerical examples and a physical model experiment are employed to monitor the performance of the proposed algorithm and compare the results with those of the newmark β method 1 a uniform cantilever bar model to exhibit the detailed process of the proposed method 2 a four leg offshore structure model to demonstrate the capability of the algorithm for solving the dynamic response of an actual engineering structure and 3 a physical cantilever model to further verify the proposed method 2 decoupling vibration differential equation of offshore structure 2 1 decoupling proportional damping system the vibration differential equation of an offshore structure can be expressed as a linear mdof system when considering the damping effect 1 m x t c x t k x t f t where x t x t and x t represent the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors of the vibrating system m c and k represent the system mass damping and stiffness matrices and f t is the subjected load of the offshore structure converting the physical coordinates of the vibrating system into modal coordinates and ensuring x t φ y t eq 1 is deformed as follows 2 m φ y t c φ y t k φ y t f t where y t y t and y t are the displacement velocity and acceleration vector in the modal coordinates and φ is the normal mode respectively premultiplying φ t in eq 2 yields the following relationship 3 y t φ t c φ y t λ y t φ t f t where λ diag ω 1 2 ω 2 2 ω n 2 ω j j 1 2 n are the natural frequencies of the vibrating system n is the dof of the vibrating system the viscously damping matrix cannot be decoupled by modal analysis directly hence the coefficient matrix of velocity φ t c φ is not diagonal in general to decouple a nonconservative vibrating system an extensively used method is expressing the damping matrix with a linear combination of the mass and stiffness rayleigh 1945 which is the so called rayleigh damping or proportional damping subsequently the damping matrix can be expressed as follows 4 c a m b k where a and b are real scalars in this case the term in eq 3 can be diagonalized as follows 5 φ c φ diag a b ω 1 2 a b ω 2 2 a b ω n 2 2 2 decoupling nonproportional damping system the rayleigh damping model applied to a nonconservative vibrating system preserves the simplicity of the real normal modes similar to the undamped case which is routinely applied in engineering caughey and o kelly 1965 extended the condition of the damping matrix diagonalization and indicated that the rayleigh damping is a distinct case under this condition m 1 c and m 1 k commute in the product 6 c m 1 k k m 1 c the relationship between the mass matrix and the normal mode can be expressed as follows 7 m 1 φ φ t subsequently substituting eq 7 into eq 6 premultiplying by φ t and postmultiplying φ yields 8 φ t c φ φ t k φ φ t k φ φ t c φ denoting s φ t c φ eq 8 can be rewritten as follows 9 s λ λ s eq 9 is equivalent to eq 6 and satisfaction of one implies satisfaction of the other because λ is a diagonal matrix consisting of the square of the radian frequencies eq 9 can be expressed using the element of the matrix as follows 10 ω k 2 s j k ω j 2 s j k j k 1 2 n where s j k is the element of matrix s with row j and column k depending on eq 10 the following relationship can be obtained 11 ω j 2 ω k 2 s j k 0 the natural frequencies of the vibrating system are distinct ω j ω k j k i e s j k 0 j k depending on the above equation therefore matrix s is diagonal which suggests that the damping matrix can be diagonalized when the system matrices of a nonconservative vibrating system satisfy eq 6 the nonconservative system is the so called classically damped system which can be decoupled by an equivalence transformation depending on the normal mode 3 continuous dynamic response estimation of offshore structure system 3 1 laplace transform of decoupled vibrating differential equation depending on the operator described above the vibrating differential equation of offshore structure eq 3 can be represented by a series of decoupled equations as follows 12 y j t 2 ζ j ω j y t ω j 2 y j t g j t j 1 2 n where y j t y j t and y j t are the elements of y t y t and y j t respectively ζ j φ j t c φ j 2 ω j is the j th damping ratio and g j t φ j t f t is the j th modal force implementing the laplace transform lt to eq 12 and ignoring the initial conditions the transfer function of the decoupled system is expressed as follows 13 t j s y j s g j s 1 s 2 2 ζ j ω j s ω j 2 n 1 2 υ n s τ n where y j s and g j s are the laplace transforms of y j t and g j t respectively τ n are the poles of the transfer function and υ n are the corresponding residues the poles are obtained by solving the equation of s 2 2 ζ j ω j s ω j 2 0 and the residues can be obtained using the relationship υ n lim s τ n s τ n t j s 3 2 complex exponential decomposition of modal force to solve the decoupled equations of a vibrating system in the laplace domain the laplace transform of the mode force should be calculated implementing complex exponential decomposition the mode force can be expressed as follows 14 g j t k 1 p γ j k e λ j k t where λ j k are the poles of the j th mode force and γ j k are the corresponding residues which can be estimated using the method described in reference hu et al 2013 liu et al 2019 considering that the exponential function γ e λ t and the pole residue form γ s λ are a laplace transform pair once the j th mode force g j t is decomposed using eq 14 the laplace transform of the mode force can obtained as follows 15 g j s k 1 p γ j k s λ j k based on those estimated poles and residues of the transfer function and the mode force the displacement response of each mode in the laplace domain can be calculated further however the signal decomposition of eq 14 is time consuming for an n dof offshore structure the decomposition of eq 14 should be done n times which makes the computation inefficient typically external exciting loads act on a few fe nodes of an offshore structure e g the wave force only impacts the nodes immersed in water for an n dofs offshore structure the external excitation of most nodes is zero therefore the exciting force vector can be divided into zero and non zero parts as follows 16 f t f 1 t f 2 t f n t l zero terms m non zero terms t where l is the number of zero terms of the exciting force vector m is the number of non zero terms n l m and l m to improve the poles and residues estimation efficiency of the mode force the non zero exciting forces in the physical coordinates are implemented by the complex exponential decomposition as follows liu et al 2017 17 f n m t l 1 p m γ n m l e λ n m l t where n is the index of the force vector n 1 2 n m is the index of the non zero term m 1 2 m p m is the number of decomposition terms of m th non zero external excitation λ n m l is the poles of f n m t and γ n m l is the corresponding residue depending on the relationship g j t φ j t f t and substituting eq 17 into the function the mode force can be calculated by the poles and corresponding residues of the external load as follows 18 g j t m 1 m ϕ n m j f n m t m 1 m ϕ n m j l 1 p m γ n m l e λ n m l t subsequently implementing the laplace transform to eq 18 yields 19 g j s m 1 m ϕ n m j l 1 p m γ n m l s λ n m l comparing eq 15 with eq 19 the poles of the mode force are expressed as follows 20 λ j k λ n m l k 1 2 m 1 m p m l 1 2 p m m 1 2 m and the corresponding residues of the mode force are calculated based on the poles and residues of a non zero external force using the following formulation 21 γ j k lim s λ j k s λ j k m 1 m ϕ n m j l 1 p m γ n m l s λ n m l ϕ n m j γ n m l according to the above equations only a few non zero exciting forces in the physical coordinate are decomposed using eq 17 the poles and corresponding residues of the decoupled mode force can be calculated based on the results of the complex exponential decomposition using eqs 20 and 21 which improve the calculation efficiency of poles and residues estimation of the mode force 3 3 estimation of continuous response the above analysis provides a method to estimate the poles and corresponding residues of a transfer function and the mode force subsequently the method to calculate the displacement response expressed by the poles and residues is explored in this section converting eq 12 using the laplace transform and considering the initial conditions the decoupled equations in the laplace domain can be expressed as follows tian et al 2019a 22 s 2 y j s s y 0 j v 0 j 2 ζ j ω j s y j s y 0 j ω j 2 y j s g j s where y 0 j y j 0 φ 1 j x 0 and v 0 j y j 0 φ 1 j x 0 are the initial displacement and velocity of the j th mode vibration respectively substituting eq 13 into eq 22 the displacement response of the j th mode vibration can be obtained as follows 23 y j s g j s t j s s 2 ζ j ω j y 0 j v 0 j t j s the first term in the above equation represents the steady state vibration response and the second term represents the transient response which indicates that the proposed method can consider the transient response caused by the non zero initial conditions the first term of eq 23 is a product of two pole residue forms the second term is a rational fraction the order of the numerator polynomial is 1 and the order of the denominator polynomial is 2 therefore eq 23 can also be expressed using pole residue form as follows 24 y j s n 1 p γ j k s λ j k n 1 2 υ n s τ n s 2 ζ j ω j y 0 j v 0 j n 1 2 υ n s τ n n 1 p 2 ν j n s μ j n where p m 1 m p m it is to be noted that the total p 2 response poles consist of p mode force poles and 2 transfer function poles the first p mode force poles are μ j n λ j n n 1 2 p and the last 2 transfer function poles are μ j p n τ j n n 1 2 for the response poles μ j n n 1 2 p associating with the mode force poles the corresponding residues can be calculated using the following formula 25 ν j n lim s λ j n s λ j n y j s γ j n t j λ j n n 1 2 p and the last two residues corresponding to the poles of the transfer function are 26 ν j p n lim s τ j n s τ j n y j s υ j n g j τ j n τ j n 2 ζ j n ω j n y 0 j v 0 j n 1 2 eqs 25 and 26 show that the residues of each mode response can be easily computed depending on the poles and the residues of the mode force and the transfer function table 1 lists the operations for calculating the poles residues of the mode response from those of the mode force and the transfer function after obtaining the poles and residues of eq 24 the continuous displacement response considering the initial conditions of the j th mode vibration can be calculated by applying an inverse laplace transform to eq 24 which is expressed as follows liu et al 2020a 27 y j t l 1 y j s n 1 p 2 ν j n e μ j n t once the responses of each mode vibration are obtained the displacement response in the physical coordinate can be computed using the modal superposition method on all the mode vibration components as follows 28 x t j 1 n φ j t n 1 p 2 ν j n e μ j n t 3 4 scheme of the proposed method the proposed time continuous dynamic response calculation method for offshore structures is implemented by the following five steps and the flowchart is displayed in fig 1 step 1 decoupling vibrating system of offshore structures depending on eqs 7 12 and implementing laplace transform to the vibrating equations in the modal coordinate system the poles and residues of transfer function are obtained using eq 13 step 2 dividing non zero exciting force and applying complex exponential decomposition to the non zero exciting force using eq 14 the laplace transform of loading forces are expressed as pole residue form step 3 depending on the poles and residues corresponding to the non zero exciting forces and mode vector the poles and residues of mode forces are calculated using eqs 18 21 step 4 substituting eqs 15 19 into eq 23 and considering initial conditions the laplace transform of dynamic response in the modal coordinate system is expressed as pole residue form using eq 24 step 5 implementing inverse laplace transform to eq 24 and applying modal superposition method the time continuous dynamic response of offshore structures is calculated using eq 28 4 test case uniform cantilever bar in this part a uniform cantilever bar will be used to illustrate the continuous response estimation procedure and the performance of the proposed algorithm the length of the bar is 2 4 m and the cross sectional area is a circle with radius 0 02 m the cantilever bar is formed of steel material with a mass density of 7800 kg m 3 young s modulus of 2 1 10 11 pa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 the cantilever bar is anchored at only one end and is divided into four equal truss elements by four nodes which is shown in fig 2 the transverse motion of the cantilever bar is considered in this example and each node contains two dofs i e translation perpendicular to the bar axis x n n 1 2 3 4 and rotation to the node θ n 4 1 poles and residues estimation of decoupled vibrating system a mathematical model of this vibrating system is constructed by implementing finite element method fem described by craig and kurdila 2006 the fe results for the 8 8 mass matrix m and stiffness mass k are expressed as following eqs 29 and 30 given in box i implementing modal analysis to the uniform cantilever bar the natural frequency ω j and corresponding mode φ j can be calculated by solving the eigenvalue equation of the system the natural frequencies f j ω j 2 π are list in table 2 and the mode shapes depending on the eigenvectors φ j j 1 2 8 are plotted as figs 3 and 4 comparing with the first four fig 3 and last four fig 4 modes it is obvious that the amplitude of the first four modes are larger than the last four modes and the amplitudes of the two part modes are at the same level which can be considered as the basis to estimate the damping matrix to calculate the response of the uniform cantilever bar the rayleigh damping model is applied to calculate the damping matrix of the vibrating system let damping ratio ζ 0 03 then the coefficients of eq 4 can be computed by the following formulas and the first order frequency and the fifth order frequency are applied 31 a 4 π f 1 f 5 f 1 f 5 ζ 1 67303 32 b 1 π f 1 f 5 ζ 2 32295 10 4 substituting eqs 31 and 32 into eq 4 the damping matrix of the uniform cantilever bar can be estimated based on the rayleigh damping model the rayleigh damping model satisfies eq 6 and the vibrating differential equation can be decoupled using the normal mode φ depending on the decoupled vibrating differential equations of eq 12 the poles and residues of the transfer function in the modal coordinate system can be calculated using eq 13 which includes 8 conjugate complex pairs corresponding to 8 modes and are listed in table 2 the poles and residues are equivalent to the decoupled transfer functions and contain all the inherent information of the vibrating system which suggests that the response estimation can be conducted only by depending on the poles and residues of the system the decoupled transfer functions are represented by the poles and residues in the proposed method according to the relationship of s i ω the amplitude of the decoupled transfer functions change with the frequency as shown as fig 5 using the calculated poles and residues the peak frequencies corresponds to the results of the modal analysis 4 2 transient response calculation induced by initial conditions for the traditional frequency domain method based on fft of the response calculation a steady state response of the offshore structure can only be obtained it is invalid to analyze the transient response by the individual initial conditions the proposed algorithm considers the transient response of offshore structures in theory the initial conditions are applied to the uniform cantilever bar to survey the performance in the transient analysis of the proposed algorithm consider initial displacement x 4 0 0 05 m the initial displacements of the other dofs can be calculated depending on stiffness matrix as follows x 0 0 004193 0 013845 0 015506 0 023734 0 031566 0 029668 0 05000 0 031646 t m meanwhile the initial translational velocities of the four nodes are 0 1 m s 0 2 m s 0 3 m s and 0 4 m s and the corresponding initial rotational velocities are zeros substituting the non zero initial conditions into eq 24 the poles of the transient response are same to decoupled transfer function list in table 2 and the corresponding residues can be calculated by eq 26 the estimated poles listed in table 2 show that the fifth to eighth modes will rapidly decay to zero because of the large damping i e the real part of the poles depending on eq 26 the first four residues of the transient response are 0 03902 0 01263i 0 001776 0 0005449i 0 0002647 0 0001040i and 0 00002818 0 00002679i substituting the calculated poles and residues into eq 27 the first four mode responses are obtained shown as fig 6 which indicates that the first mode is dominant the responses in the modal coordinate system are substituted into eq 28 and the transient responses of the cantilever bar in the physical coordinate system are obtained via modal superposition to examine the correctness of the proposed algorithm the newmark β method is adopted to calculate the transient responses of the cantilever bar induced by the initial conditions and the calculated results are regarded as the reference values the newmark β method is an extensively used numerical integration method to compute the dynamic response of a vibrating system specifically the accuracy of the calculated result is associated with the time step of the integral and smaller time step corresponds to a more accurate result to obtain the appropriate reference values time steps δ t 0 001 s 0 001 s and 0 00001 s are used to estimate the transient responses of the cantilever bar using the newmark β method with α 0 25 and β 0 5 average acceleration operator the calculated results with the different time steps are shown in fig 7 the results indicate that the response calculated with δ t 0 01 s deviates from those calculated with time intervals δ t 0 001 s and 0 00001 s and the components induced by integral error is obvious in the frequency domain shown as fig 7 b which means the integral error caused by time interval is considerable even at time step δ t 0 001 s there are still significant errors compared to the results calculated with δ t 0 00001 s and the first four natural frequencies can only be captured when using time interval δ t 0 00001 s therefore the results calculated by the newmark β method with δ t 0 00001 s are selected as the reference values to survey the proposed method the proposed method calculates the transient responses in the laplace domain and yields the dynamic response in the time domain by implementing an inverse laplace transform i e the proposed algorithm is insensitive to the time step setting the calculation time step as δ t 0 01 s and 0 001 s the proposed algorithm is adopted to calculate the transient response of the cantilever bar under the initial conditions the calculated responses are compared to the reference values estimated by the newmark β method using time interval δ t 0 00001 s the comparison diagram is shown as fig 8 which indicates that the transient responses computed using the proposed method match well with the reference results calculated using the newmark β in the time and even frequency domain concurrently the proposed algorithm can provide accurate results using a large time step 4 3 response calculation impacted by external excitation and initial conditions to survey the performance of the proposed algorithm for steady response calculation the external excitation of the cantilever bar is simulated by applying the following expression 33 f t n 1 3 a n e δ n t cos 2 π f n t θ n where a n δ n f n and θ n are the amplitude damping frequency and phase of the vertical force components respectively the parameter values in above equation are listed in table 3 the uniform cantilever bar is divided equally into four elements with coordinates x n n 1 2 3 4 and the cantilever bar is excited by vertical force f t at node 4 implementing the complex exponential decomposition to the exciting force using eq 17 with order 6 i e p m 6 the poles of the external excitation are obtained as 0 01 30 159 i 0 05 37 699 i and 0 02 56 549 i and the corresponding residues are 8 6603 5i 7 5 12 99 i and 2 1213 2 1213 i subsequently the poles and the residues are substituted into eq 17 to reconstruct the time history signal of the exciting force the comparison of the reconstructed signal and the original force is displayed in fig 9 which exhibits that the two signals match well with each other i e the original exciting force can be represented using the estimated poles and the corresponding residues to survey the performance of the proposed algorithm in the process of calculating the dynamic response induced by the initial conditions and an exciting force two cases are adopted specifically the vibrating system of the cantilever is excited by 1 the initial displacement and the exciting force and 2 the initial velocity and the exciting force depending on the superposition principle of the linear vibrating system the other exciting cases can be obtained based on the two cases in this part the initial displacement and the velocity are same as in section 4 2 depending on the dynamic analysis of transient response the newmark β method with time interval δ t 0 00001 s is adopted to obtain a more accurate reference values substituting the poles and residues of the exciting forced into eq 19 the poles and residues of mode force can be obtained using eq 20 and 21 for case 1 the dynamic response is calculated applying eqs 24 28 after substituting the initial displacement and the poles and residues of the mode force to illustrate the characteristic of the proposed method the frequency domain method is also adopted to calculate the dynamic response in this case the comparison of the response using the three methods is shown as fig 10 from which it can be inferred that the result of the frequency domain method is deviating markedly from reference values at the initial stage and exists subtle discrepancy at the stable stage and the result of the proposed algorithm is in good agreement with that of the newmark β method subsequently the three methods are employed to calculate the displacement response of the cantilever vibrating system when it is excited by the initial velocity and the exciting force case 2 the calculated results are shown as fig 11 depending on the comparison plots of fig 11 the same conclusion as case 1 can be obtained the dynamic response analysis of the cantilever bar shows that the proposed method can be used to accurately estimate the transient and state steady responses of the cantilever which makes up the weakness of the traditional frequency domain method in transient analysis and avoids the deviation induced by ft meanwhile the proposed method can avoid the calculation error caused by the time domain integral method with larger time step 5 test case jacket offshore platform structure this numerical case is adopted to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm for a true jacket offshore platform structure the jacket offshore platform used in this analysis is a typical jacket platform with four legs which

wave f ˆ q is the representative frequency of q th component and φ q is the corresponding phase the spectrum value s f ˆ q can be easily obtained by substituting considered frequencies into eq 34 which ranges from 0 0625 hz to 0 333 hz and the corresponding phase obeys the uniform distribution from 0 to 2 π the wave height of the irregular input wave changing with time is plotted in fig 14 a after obtaining the wave surface the morison formula will be applied to calculate the wave force acting on the jacket platform the velocity and acceleration of water particle are the inputs of the morison formula which are calculated using following formula 36 u x q g h q k q 2 ω q cosh k q z d cosh k d cos k q x ω q t 37 u x q g h q k q 2 cosh k q z d cosh k d sin k q x ω q t where ω q is the radian frequency of q th wave component h q and k q are the corresponding wave height and wave number g is the acceleration of gravity d is the water depth and z is the depth of water particle the wave height and depth are available before calculating the velocity and acceleration of water particle the wave number should be obtained the dispersion equation described the relationship between

the velocity and acceleration of water particle can be obtained based on eqs 36 and 37 which are shown as fig 14 b and c at water level for the wave force acting on pipe element the morison formula is applied to calculate the drag force and inertia force the distributed force impacting on the pipe elements of the jacket platform is obtained using following morison formula 39 f w q 1 2 c d ρ d u x q u x q c m ρ π d 2 4 u x q where ρ is the density of water d is the diameter of pipe c d and c m are the drag force coefficient and inertia force coefficient the size take c d 1 2 and c m 2 0 is this example the wave force calculated using morison formula is a distributed force to estimate the dynamic response of the jacket platform the distributed force should be converted to a equivalent nodal force depending on the finite element method the equivalent nodal force of the jacket platform is calculated using following formula 40 f j q e x c t 0 l f w q x t ψ j x d x where f w q x t are the distributed wave forces along axis of the pipe elements ψ j x are the shape functions expressed as follows 41 ψ 1 x 1 3 x l 2 2 x l 3 ψ 2 x x 2 l x l 2 l x l 3 ψ 3 x 3 x l 2 2 x l 3 ψ 4 x l x l 2 l x l 3 x is the coordinate along axis direction l is the length of pipe element of the jacket platform depending on eqs 36 41 and considering the phase induced by pile spacing the nodal wave forces of the jacket platform are obtained the nodal force of node 5 in x direction is shown as fig 15 5 2 dynamic response calculation for offshore platform with random initial conditions the nodes submersed in water are subjected to wave force the wave force duration of 0 100 s in fig 15 is selected to calculate the dynamic response of the jacket platform the wave force should be implemented complex exponential decomposition by applying eq 17 the comparison of the original wave force acting on node 5 and the reconstructed signal based on the estimated poles and residues are presented in fig 16 the figure shows that the two time history curves are in good agreement which means that the estimated poles and residues can replace the original wave forces to estimate the dynamic response of the jacket platform structure there typically exist an initial displacement or velocity when conducting the dynamic response analysis on an offshore structure to survey the performance of the proposed algorithm the initial conditions are added to the dynamic response analysis without the loss of generality two series of random numbers are used to simulate the initial conditions one series is for the initial displacements obeying normal distribution n 0 1 10 4 2 and the other is for the initial velocities obeying normal distribution n 0 5 10 5 2 which are shown in fig 17 substituting the exciting wave force and the initial conditions into the vibrating differential equation and employing the proposed algorithm the displacement response of the jacket platform structure are calculated to obtain a more accurate reference time step δ t 0 01 s is used with the newmark β method to compute the dynamic response in this case the calculated dynamic responses of the two methods are presented in fig 18 where the displacement responses of node 45 in the x direction are shown in fig 18 a and c and those in the y direction are displayed in fig 18 b and d the results of the two methods indicate that the calculated dynamic responses of the proposed method and the newmark β method are in good agreement 5 3 analysis of computational efficiency the proposed method solves the vibrating differential equation in the laplace domain which indicates that the proposed algorithm need not calculate the response stepwise to examine the calculation efficiency of the proposed algorithm the durations of 30 s 60 s 90 s 120 s 150 s 180 s 210 s 240 s 270 s 300 s 330 s and 360 s are utilized in the above case the consuming times of the proposed algorithm and the newmark β method are shown as fig 19 the comparison shows that the proposed method has a higher calculation efficiency than the newmark β method when the computing durations are small however the cpu time of the proposed method is growing faster than that of the newmark β method and the cpu time of the two methods are almost equal when the computing duration is 360 s the proposed method will lose the advantage of high computational efficiency with the length of duration increasing further newmark β method is a numerical integration method whose consuming time of cpu increases linearly with the simulation time of dynamic response however the singular value decomposition svd will be applied to the hankel matrix consisting of the external exciting force when implementing complex exponential decomposition of the proposed method liu et al 2020c b the size of hankel matrix is equal to the point number of simulation duration and the computing time increases rapidly as the size of hankel matrix growing when employing svd which leads to low computational efficiency in the case of the large duration one method to improve the computational efficiency of a long time dynamic response calculation is dividing the whole external loading into small segments and estimating the dynamic response induced by small exciting segments step by step the last velocity and displacement point of the previous response segment can be regarded as the initial conditions of the next segment with segment length 15 s 1500 points the comparison of reconstructed and original exciting force is shown as fig 20 a and the calculated dynamic response compared with those of the newmark β is exhibited as fig 20 b in this case the cpu time using segment method is plotted in fig 19 with red dash line which indicates that the computational efficiency of the proposed method improves significantly 6 experimental study physical cantilever model the physical cantilever model is formed of steel with young s

of other dofs can be calculated by the equation of static equilibrium depending on the recorded acceleration data the modal parameters can be identified by implementing stochastic subspace identification ssi method which are listed in table 4 the modal frequencies of the fe model obtained by employing the fem are different from the measured frequencies which indicate that the fe model

20578,dynamic response analysis for offshore structures plays an important role in the design stage to evaluate the performance of the designed structures this study proposes a novel time continuous dynamic response analysis algorithm for offshore structures which is implemented in the laplace domain depending on the decoupled vibrating differential equation and the complex exponential decomposition of external excitation one theoretical development is that time continuous dynamic response can be obtained according to discrete external excitation the other is that the initial conditions can be considered in the process thereby compensating for the weakness of the traditional frequency method concurrently the computational efficiency of the proposed method is good benefitting from initial conditions considerable and the algorithm is insensitive to the time step of the calculation compared with the time domain method to monitor the performance of the algorithm two numerical models and a physical model experiment are adopted the first example is a simple numerical model of a cantilever beam describing the entire process of the proposed method the results indicate that the dynamic response of the vibrating system calculated by employing the proposed method is in good agreement with that obtained by the newmark β method in addition the algorithm yields an accurate dynamic response using a longer time step in the calculation realizing better stability than the traditional newmark β method the second example is a numerical model of a jacket offshore platform located at liaodong bay bohai sea which extends the algorithm to dynamic response analysis of offshore structures the results of the studies show that the displacement response of the offshore structure calculated by the proposed method matches well with that yielded by the newmark β method under random initial conditions and exciting loads on the structure it is found that the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm is better than that of the time domain method finally a physical cantilever model is applied to verify the correctness of the proposed method keywords offshore structure laplace domain initial condition modal superposition time continuous dynamic response calculation 1 introduction offshore platform structures are the basic establishments for marine resource exploitation whose structural health and stability are important for the safe operation of their equipment dynamic response analysis of offshore structures such as of their displacement velocity and acceleration due to winds waves currents and ice excitation is required in the design stage to evaluate the stability fatigue life and numerous other engineering problems of structures the main problem of dynamic response analysis is solving the vibrating differential equation for a multiple degree of freedom mdof system depending on the resolution domain the algorithms to estimate the dynamic response of an offshore structure primarily include time and frequency domain methods modal superposition method is a commonly used method for dynamic response analysis which converts an mdof system into a single degree of freedom sdof system by decoupling the vibrating differential equation the dynamic response of a decoupled sdof can be calculated using the duhamel integral clough and penzien 1993 for a simple exciting force a continuous dynamic response is obtained by applying a convolution operation if an exciting force or a continuous convolution function is unavailable a numerical method should be used to solve the duhamel integral a more general class of methods to estimate the dynamic response of a vibrating system is direct integration method based on numerical integrals according to the dof the governing equation of a vibrating system is treated as a second order ordinary differential equation over 100000 dofs or an equivalent of a first order ordinary differential equation over 100 dofs craig and kurdila 2006 offshore structures are generally very large finite element fe models and second order methods are usually chosen to deal with dynamic problems which mainly include the central difference method runge kutta method newmark β method and wilson θ method bathe and wilson 1976 craig and kurdila 2006 newmark 1959 the direct integration method in the time domain can deal with the dynamic response excited by arbitrary loadings it calculates the response using a numerical method and yields an approximation of the true response consequently the factors affecting the performance of the approximation algorithms should be taken into account when employing the numerical integral methods which mainly include stability and accuracy conditional stability and unconditional stability are perhaps the most simple concepts of stability the time step is a key factor for obtaining a stable dynamic response in conditional stable methods the time step in the numerical integral must be shorter than the critical time step which depends on the algorithm and the physical parameters in the calculation however unconditionally stable methods do not rely on the time step constraint which is generally preferred in the simulation of a dynamic response chopra 2000 described in detail the newmark β method and emphasized that a method can be constructed as an unconditionally stable method the wilson θ method is another extensively used numerical integral method it is unconditionally stable only for θ 1 37 hilber and hughes 1978 nickell 1971 the accuracy of a direct integration method is an equally important factor when performing stepwise integration for the dynamic response analysis of offshore structures the accuracy of the numerical integration algorithms can be classified into amplitude accuracy and period accuracy and an inaccurate solution is typically manifested as a numerical dissipation and a period elongation craig and kurdila 2006 nickell 1971 simulated the free vibration response of an undamped sdof system using a numerical integration method which showed that amplitude decay is caused by numerical dissipation despite a short time step meanwhile the average acceleration method was used for a vibrating system which resulted in the elongation of the period of vibration hilber et al 1977 suggested that an inaccurate solution was a result of the time step ratio and he plotted the numerical damping factor and the relative period error versus the time step ratio the plots showed that the time step plays a key role in determining the stability and accuracy of a numerical solution time domain methods can only provide an approximate dynamic response and the high frequency components may be ignored when applying a direct integration method craig and kurdila 2006 different from time domain methods a frequency domain method for dynamic response estimation solves the vibrating differential equation in the frequency domain it does not require considering the negative influence of the time step as in time domain methods and can avoid the error due to numerical integrals venancio filho and claret 1995 solved a vibrating differential equation in the frequency domain and presented general formulations for the dynamic response analysis of mdof systems in physical and modal coordinates liu and bergdahl 1997 applied a frequency domain method to calculate the dynamic response of cables and compared the results with those of a time domain method exhibiting that the former has good accuracy and efficiency han et al 2019 introduced a simplified method to estimate the frequency domain response of a jacket platform excited by random wave forces it yielded a reliable and accurate prediction of the dynamic response skafte et al 2017 divided measured response into low frequency response and high frequency response and depended on experimental model shapes to predict strain response the traditional frequency domain method is extensively used in the simulation of the dynamic response however some problems occur simultaneously evidently the response calculated by a frequency domain method only includes the steady state response because of a fourier transform ft application however the dynamic response of an offshore structure typically comprises a transient response produced by the initial conditions and a steady state response due to an external excitation to consider the transient response mansur et al 2004 introduced a pseudo force to express the initial conditions and solved the vibrating differential equation in the frequency domain depending on a standard discrete fourier transform lee et al 2005 applied a fast fourier transform fft based spectral analysis method for the dynamic calculation of a linear vibrating system induced by the initial conditions martins et al 2006 used the concepts of classical mechanics for considering the initial conditions in the frequency domain when calculating a dynamic response and subsequently extended the method to three dimensional applications liu et al 2015 2016 considered the initial conditions according to the relationship between a laplace transform and an ft and used an inverse ft to yield the dynamic response in the time domain in addition to the initial conditions the external loading of a vibrating system should be in the period in which the ft is implemented only in this case the energy leakage problem of the ft can be considered as insignificant however the exciting force of an offshore structure is most probably nonperiodic and even influenced by the damping factor which limits the application of a frequency domain method based on the ft for this situation hu et al 2013 introduced a complex exponential decomposition method based on a state space model this method can deal with an external excitation synthesized by harmonic or damped signal components differing from the traditional time or frequency domain methods this study aimed to propose a method to obtain continuous dynamic responses of offshore structures this method can avoid the integral error of a numerical integration method and the limitations of an ft in frequency domain methods the proposed algorithm calculates the continuous dynamic response depending on poles and the corresponding residues which include the information of the initial conditions vibrating system and external exciting force two numerical examples and a physical model experiment are employed to monitor the performance of the proposed algorithm and compare the results with those of the newmark β method 1 a uniform cantilever bar model to exhibit the detailed process of the proposed method 2 a four leg offshore structure model to demonstrate the capability of the algorithm for solving the dynamic response of an actual engineering structure and 3 a physical cantilever model to further verify

the vibrating system n is the dof of the vibrating system the viscously damping matrix cannot be decoupled by modal analysis directly hence the coefficient matrix of velocity φ t c φ is not diagonal in general to decouple a nonconservative vibrating system an extensively used method is expressing the damping matrix with a linear combination of the mass and stiffness rayleigh 1945 which is the so called rayleigh damping or proportional damping subsequently the damping matrix can be expressed as follows 4 c a m b k where a and b are real scalars in this case the term in eq 3 can be diagonalized as follows 5 φ c φ diag a b ω 1 2 a b ω 2 2 a b ω n 2 2 2 decoupling nonproportional damping system the rayleigh damping model applied to a nonconservative vibrating system preserves the simplicity of the real normal modes similar to the undamped case which is routinely applied in engineering caughey and o kelly 1965 extended the condition of the damping matrix diagonalization and indicated that the rayleigh damping is a distinct case under this condition m 1 c and m 1 k commute in the product 6 c m 1 k k m 1 c the relationship between the mass matrix and the normal mode can be expressed as

obtained 11 ω j 2 ω k 2 s j k 0 the natural frequencies of the vibrating system are distinct ω j ω k j k i e s j k 0 j k depending on the above equation therefore matrix s is diagonal which suggests that the damping matrix can be diagonalized when the system matrices of a nonconservative vibrating system satisfy eq 6 the nonconservative system is the so called classically damped system which can be decoupled by an equivalence transformation depending on the normal mode 3 continuous dynamic response estimation of offshore structure system 3 1 laplace transform of decoupled vibrating

in reference hu et al 2013 liu et al 2019 considering that the exponential function γ e λ t and the pole residue form γ s λ are a laplace transform pair once the j th mode force g j t is decomposed using eq 14 the laplace transform of the mode force can obtained as follows 15 g j s k 1 p γ j k s λ j k based on those estimated poles and residues of the transfer function and the mode force the displacement response of each mode in the laplace domain can be calculated further however the signal decomposition of eq 14 is time consuming for an n dof offshore structure the decomposition of eq 14 should be done n times which makes the computation inefficient typically external exciting loads act on a few fe nodes of an offshore structure e g the wave force only impacts the nodes immersed in water for an n dofs offshore structure the external excitation of most nodes is zero therefore the exciting force vector can be divided into zero and non zero parts as follows 16 f t f 1 t f 2 t f n t l zero terms m non zero terms t where l is the number of zero terms of the exciting force vector m is the number of non zero terms n l m and l m to improve the poles and residues estimation efficiency of the mode force the non zero exciting forces in the physical coordinates are implemented by the complex exponential decomposition as follows liu et al 2017 17 f n m t l 1 p m γ n m l e λ n m l t where n is the index of the force vector n 1 2 n m is the index of the non zero term m 1 2 m p m is the number of decomposition terms of m th non zero external excitation λ n m l is the poles of f n m

according to the above equations only a few non zero exciting forces in the physical coordinate are decomposed using eq 17 the poles and corresponding residues of the decoupled mode force can be calculated based on the results of the complex exponential decomposition using eqs 20 and 21 which improve the calculation efficiency of poles and residues estimation of the mode force 3 3 estimation of continuous response the above analysis provides a method to estimate the poles and corresponding residues of a transfer function and the mode force subsequently the method to calculate the displacement response expressed by the poles and residues is explored in this section converting eq 12 using the laplace transform and considering the initial conditions the decoupled equations in the laplace domain can be expressed as follows tian et al 2019a 22 s 2 y j s s y 0 j v 0 j 2 ζ j ω j s y j s y 0 j ω j 2 y j s g j s where y 0 j y j 0 φ 1 j x 0 and v 0 j y j 0 φ 1 j x 0 are the initial

ζ j ω j y 0 j v 0 j t j s the first term in the above equation represents the steady state vibration response and the second term represents the transient response which indicates that the proposed method can consider the transient response caused by the non zero initial conditions the first term of eq 23 is a product of two pole residue forms the second term is a rational fraction the order of the numerator polynomial is 1 and the order of the denominator polynomial is 2 therefore eq 23 can also be expressed using pole residue form as follows 24 y j s n 1 p γ j k s λ j k n 1 2 υ n s τ n s 2 ζ j ω j y 0 j v 0 j n 1 2 υ n s τ n n 1 p 2 ν j n s μ j n where p m 1 m p m it is to be noted that the total p 2 response poles consist of p mode force poles and 2 transfer function poles the first p mode force poles are μ j n λ j n n 1 2 p and the last 2 transfer function poles are μ j p n τ j n n 1 2 for the response poles μ j n n 1 2 p associating with the mode force poles the corresponding residues can be calculated using the following formula 25 ν j n lim s λ j n s λ j n y j s γ j n t j λ j n n 1 2 p and the last two residues corresponding to the poles of the transfer function are 26 ν j p n lim s τ j n s τ j n y j s υ j n g j τ j n τ j n 2 ζ j n ω j n y 0 j v 0 j n 1 2 eqs 25 and 26 show that the residues of each mode response can be easily computed depending on the poles and the

first four fig 3 and last four fig 4 modes it is obvious that the amplitude of the first four modes are larger than the last four modes and the amplitudes of the two part modes are at the same level which can be considered as the basis to estimate the damping matrix to calculate the response of the uniform cantilever bar the rayleigh damping model is applied to calculate the damping matrix of the vibrating system let damping ratio ζ 0 03 then the coefficients of eq 4 can be computed by the following formulas and the first order frequency and the fifth order frequency are applied 31 a 4 π f 1 f 5 f 1 f 5 ζ 1 67303 32 b 1 π f 1 f 5 ζ 2 32295 10 4 substituting eqs 31 and 32 into eq 4 the damping matrix of the uniform cantilever bar can be estimated based on the rayleigh damping model the rayleigh damping model satisfies eq 6 and the vibrating differential equation can be decoupled using the normal mode φ depending on the decoupled vibrating differential equations of eq 12 the poles and residues of the transfer function in the modal coordinate system can be calculated using eq 13 which includes 8 conjugate complex pairs corresponding to 8 modes and are listed in table 2 the poles and residues are equivalent to the decoupled transfer functions and contain all the inherent information of the vibrating system which suggests that the response estimation can be conducted only by depending on the poles and residues of the system the decoupled transfer functions are represented by the poles and residues in the proposed method according to the relationship of s i ω the amplitude

transient response calculation induced by initial conditions for the traditional frequency domain method based on fft of the response calculation a steady state response of the offshore structure can only be obtained it is invalid to analyze the transient response by the individual initial conditions the proposed algorithm considers the transient response of offshore structures in theory the initial conditions are applied to the uniform cantilever bar to survey the performance in the transient analysis of the proposed algorithm consider initial displacement x 4 0 0 05 m the initial displacements of the other dofs can be calculated depending on stiffness matrix as follows x 0 0 004193 0 013845 0 015506 0 023734 0 031566 0 029668 0 05000 0 031646 t m meanwhile the initial translational velocities of the four nodes are 0 1 m s 0 2 m s 0 3 m s and 0 4 m s and the corresponding initial rotational velocities are zeros substituting the non zero initial conditions into eq 24 the poles of the transient response are same to decoupled transfer function list in table 2 and the corresponding residues can be calculated by eq 26 the estimated poles listed in table 2 show that the fifth to eighth modes will rapidly decay to zero because of the large damping i e the real part of the poles depending on eq 26 the first four residues of the transient response are 0 03902 0 01263i 0 001776 0 0005449i 0 0002647 0 0001040i and 0 00002818 0 00002679i substituting the calculated poles and residues into eq 27 the first four mode responses are obtained shown as fig 6 which indicates that the first mode is dominant the responses in the modal coordinate system are substituted into eq 28 and the transient responses of the cantilever bar in the physical coordinate system are obtained via modal superposition to examine the correctness of the proposed algorithm the newmark β method is adopted to calculate the transient responses of the cantilever bar induced by the initial conditions and the calculated results are regarded as the reference values the newmark β method is an extensively used numerical integration method to compute the dynamic response of a vibrating system specifically the accuracy of the calculated result is associated with the time step of the integral and smaller time step corresponds to a more accurate result to obtain the appropriate reference values time steps δ t 0 001 s 0 001 s and 0 00001 s are used to estimate the transient responses of the cantilever bar using the newmark β method with α 0 25 and β 0 5 average acceleration operator the calculated results with the different time steps are shown in fig 7 the results indicate that the response calculated with δ t 0 01 s deviates from those calculated with time intervals δ t 0 001 s and 0 00001 s and the components induced by integral error is obvious in the frequency domain shown as fig 7 b which means the integral error caused by time interval is considerable even at time step δ t 0 001 s there are still significant errors compared to the results calculated with δ t 0 00001 s and the first four natural frequencies can only be captured when using time interval δ t 0 00001 s therefore the results calculated by the newmark β method with δ t 0 00001 s are selected as the reference values to survey the proposed method the proposed method calculates the transient responses in the laplace domain and yields the dynamic response in the time domain by implementing an inverse laplace transform i e the proposed algorithm is insensitive to the time step setting the calculation time step as δ t 0 01 s and 0 001 s the proposed algorithm is adopted to calculate the transient response of the cantilever bar under the initial conditions the calculated responses are compared to the reference values estimated by the newmark β method using time interval δ t 0 00001 s the comparison diagram is shown as fig 8 which indicates that the transient responses computed using the proposed method match well with the reference results calculated using the newmark β in the time and even frequency domain concurrently the proposed algorithm can provide accurate results using a large time step 4 3 response calculation impacted by external excitation and initial conditions to survey the performance of the proposed algorithm for steady

amplitude damping frequency and phase of the vertical force components respectively the parameter values in above equation are listed in table 3 the uniform cantilever bar is divided equally into four elements with coordinates x n n 1 2 3 4 and the cantilever bar is excited by vertical force f t at node 4 implementing the complex exponential decomposition to the exciting force using eq 17 with order 6 i e p m 6 the poles of the external excitation are obtained as 0 01 30 159 i 0 05 37 699 i and 0 02 56 549 i and the corresponding residues are 8 6603 5i 7 5 12 99 i and 2 1213 2 1213 i subsequently the poles and the residues are substituted into eq 17 to reconstruct the time history signal of the exciting force the comparison of the reconstructed signal and the original force is displayed in fig 9 which exhibits that the two signals match well with each other i e the original exciting force can be represented using the estimated poles and the corresponding residues to survey the performance of the proposed algorithm in the process of calculating the dynamic response induced by the initial conditions and an exciting force two cases are adopted specifically the vibrating system of the cantilever is excited by 1 the initial displacement and the exciting force and 2 the initial velocity and the exciting force depending on the superposition principle of the linear vibrating system the other exciting cases can be obtained based on the two cases in this part the initial displacement and the velocity are same as in section 4 2 depending on the dynamic analysis of transient response the newmark β method with time interval δ t 0 00001 s is adopted to obtain a more accurate reference values substituting the poles and residues of the exciting forced into eq 19 the poles and residues of mode force can be obtained using eq 20 and 21 for case 1 the dynamic response is calculated applying eqs 24 28 after substituting the initial displacement and the poles and residues of the mode force to illustrate the characteristic of the proposed method the frequency domain method is also adopted to calculate the dynamic response in this case the comparison of the response using the three methods is shown as fig 10 from which it can be inferred that the result of the frequency domain method is deviating markedly from reference values at the initial stage and exists subtle discrepancy at the stable stage and the result of the proposed algorithm is in good agreement with that of the newmark β method subsequently the three methods are employed to calculate the displacement response of the cantilever vibrating system when it is excited by the initial velocity and the exciting force case 2 the calculated results are shown as fig 11 depending on the comparison plots of fig 11 the same conclusion as case 1 can be obtained the dynamic response analysis of the cantilever bar shows that the proposed method can be used to accurately estimate the transient and state steady responses of the cantilever which makes up the weakness of the traditional frequency domain method in transient analysis and avoids the deviation induced by ft meanwhile the proposed method can avoid the calculation error caused by the time domain integral method with larger time step 5 test case jacket offshore platform structure this numerical case is adopted to

exponential decomposition by applying eq 17 the comparison of the original wave force acting on node 5 and the reconstructed signal based on the estimated poles and residues are presented in fig 16 the figure shows that the two time history curves are in good agreement which means that the estimated poles and residues can replace the original wave forces to estimate the dynamic response of the jacket platform structure there typically exist an initial displacement or velocity when conducting the dynamic response analysis on an offshore structure to survey the performance of the proposed

the proposed method is growing faster than that of the newmark β method and the cpu time of the two methods are almost equal when the computing duration is 360 s the proposed method will lose the advantage of high computational efficiency with the length of duration increasing further newmark β method is a numerical integration method whose consuming time of cpu increases linearly with the

analysis as summarized in table 4 the modal frequencies are close to the measured results the damping matrix c is simulated depending on the rayleigh model with ζ 0 002606 f 1 5 2908 hz and f 2 26 7299 hz the parameters of the rayleigh damping are a 0 14464 and b 2 5907 10 5 and the damping matrix is calculated by eq 4 applying a complex exponential decomposition to the recorded dynamic force with order 10 the comparison of the exciting force and the reconstructed signal based on the estimated poles and residues is shown in fig 22 the dynamic displacement response computed by the proposed algorithm at node 11 is in good agreement with the measured result as shown in fig 23 which further verifies the performance of the proposed algorithm 7 conclusions in this study a continuous dynamic response analysis method of fixed offshore structures based on the modal superposition method and complex exponential decomposition is proposed the proposed method can be mainly implemented in three steps the first step is decoupling the vibrating differential equation and calculating the poles and residues of the decoupled transfer function in the laplace domain the second step implements a complex exponential decomposition on the exciting forces and calculates the poles and residues of the mode forces depending on the relationship of the exciting and mode forces the last step computes the poles and residues of the dynamic response and performs an inverse laplace transform to obtain the displacement response in the time domain which considers a transient response caused by the initial conditions two numerical examples and a physical model experiments were conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm the numerical study indicates that 1 the proposed method can calculate the transient response with a large time step and avoid the calculation error caused by the time step compared to the traditional newmark β method 2 under the excitation of random initial conditions and exciting forces the calculated response of the jacket platform structure using the proposed method matches well that obtained with the newmark β method specifically the proposed method can consider the initial condition and estimate the dynamic response accurately 3 the proposed method has a better calculation efficiency than the time domain method and is insensitive to time step which can improve the calculation efficiency further using larger time step the physical model experiment study shows that the estimated dynamic response of the physical cantilever model using the proposed algorithm is in good agreement with the measured displacement response under the excitation of the initial condition and exciting force which further indicates the correctness of the proposed method credit authorship contribution statement hongchao lu conceptualization methodology software validation writing tianhui fan methodology software xiaochen li writing review editing

20579,wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations have been conducted on composite bodies consisting of a sphere connected atop a cylinder as well as the individual component shapes drag forces were measured in order to determine the interference drag caused by the junction between the two shapes at varying diameter ratios and reynolds numbers increasing the sphere cylinder diameter ratio was found to increase the interference drag a dimensional analysis of these results allows the data to collapse to a single trend line useful for calculating interference drag or in combination with historical sphere and cylinder data total drag on such composite shapes simulation results reveal that the drag on the sphere component of the composite body increases substantially in comparison to the drag on an individual sphere largely due to decreases in the pressure on the downstream side for the composite body in comparison to the individual shapes an increasing sphere diameter results in wake modifications including increased vorticity turbulence intensity and regions of low velocity downstream of the cylinder sphere junction keywords interference drag wind tunnel cfd simulation fluid

cylinder or close approximations to this shape are commonly found in applications including water towers streetlights chimneys and antennae in regards to ocean applications composite body interactions involving cylinder or sphere shapes are relevant to appendages on submersible vehicles zhihua et al 2011 floating wind turbines buoys energy storage systems vasel be hagh et al 2015 measurement sensors subsurface floats nets zhou et al 2015 and other trawling gear despite their prevalence there appears to be little research documenting the interference drag and flow fields around a cylinder sphere composite body introductory fluid mechanics texts advocate that the total drag force on a composite body can be approximated by summing the drag on the individual parts munson et al 2006 while acknowledging that this approach has limitations however it has been shown that interference drag can be as high as 20 of the total drag sakellaridis and lazaridis 2002 a significant increase that provides motivation for continued study of composite bodies past studies point to important variations in boundary layers and modified wake structures as key differences between individual bodies and composite bodies that can result in interference drag kubendran et al 1984 tetrault et al 2001 kornilov 2017 pierce and nath 1990 in considering the drag and flow around a cylinder sphere composite body it is natural to consider the flow fields and drag forces on individual spheres and cylinders the flow field over spheres and infinite circular cylinders has been fully explored by many e g white 1999 duan et al 2015 wieselsberger 1921 delany and sorensen 1953 roshko 1961 almedeij 2008 and barati et al 2014 provide correlations for calculating smooth sphere drag coefficient as a function of reynolds number details on vortical structure shape and shedding frequencies in the wakes of spheres in uniform flows for a large of reynolds are reported by achenbach 1974a taneda 1978 and sakamoto and haniu 1990 with strouhal numbers near 0 2 for 10 000 re 300 000 however research has shown that as a sphere is moved closer to another body the forces and wake characteristics are altered ozgoren et al 2013 reveal that as a sphere is brought in contact with a flat plate that the wake features become asymmetric as vortex shedding and flow separation is modified at re 83 000 tsutsui 2008 shows that the drag and lift coefficients for a sphere sitting on a plate are larger than the corresponding coefficients when the sphere is moved away from the plate early studies of the flow field associated with circular cylinders considered the bodies to be two dimensional thus ignoring or correcting for the end effects as the cylinder sphere composite body represents a modification of a cylinder free end the two dimensional assumption for the cylinder is inappropriate for finite height cylinders with two free ends tip vortices are generated cylinder aspect ratio strongly influences the vortex patterns and the wake field gao et al 2018 and in general the downwash caused by the tip vortices results in a decrease in drag potts et al 2019 zdravkovich et al 1989 found that using hemispherical cylinder ends as compared to flat ends further reduced cylinder drag for a given aspect ratio a more extreme modification of the cylinder end involves mounting the cylinder to a surface a topic which has been reviewed by sumner 2013 wall mounted cylinders include a weaker vortex near the junction a stronger vortex from the tip and an inhibited vortex shedding process okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 sumner et al 2004 baban et al 1989 iungo et al 2012 these interactions can lead to a mean streamwise velocity defect in the wake region of the cylinder resulting from a downwash effect that depends on aspect ratio adaramola et al 2006 rostamy et al 2012 similar to a cylinder with two free ends the tip vortex from the free end of a surface mounted cylinder generates a downwash that results in a higher pressure on the back of the body and a lower overall drag farivar 1981 fox and west 1993 this downwash and corresponding vorticity effects are modified by the corner shape of the cylinder end as shown by park and lee 2004 cylinder cylinder and cylinder sphere composite shapes have been studied in consideration of their relevance to nets klebert et al 2013 provide a nice review of available research on this subject for knotless nets which can be treated as a series of intersecting cylinders the drag is shown to primarily depend on reynolds number solidity ratio and angle relative to the current though mesh patterns angles are also considered of relevance zhou et al 2015 bi et al 2017 solidity ratio is also related to flow velocity attenuation downstream of the cylinders with higher solidity resulting in a larger reduction tu et al 2020 lader et al 2014 treated the net as a cruciform shape where a sphere was used for the knot and rigid cylinders as the twine their results reveal that the drag coefficient for the sphere on the cruciform shape is much higher than for an individual sphere at the same reynolds number a result that also depends on the sphere cylinder diameter ratio it can be seen that flow fields associated with cylinders and spheres are affected by the presence of junctions the current study aims to add to this understanding by examining the interference drag caused by the presence of the junction between a sphere and cylinder through wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations this study examines the interference drag on cylinder sphere composite bodies of varying sphere cylinder diameter ratio and reynolds numbers the experiments serve to quantify the interference drag validate the numerical method and provide an expression for calculating the non dimensional interference drag details of the surface pressure and wake are then determined from simulation results these results are important for quantifying the limitations of the composite body drag approach and for design considerations of drag and wake characteristics in marine applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental methods experimental drag measurements were conducted in a flotek 1440 wind tunnel with a 30 48 cm 30 48 cm x 91 44 cm test section the wind tunnel turbulence intensity measured as 1 of mean velocity with a hot wire probe tsi cta 1750 air speeds ranged from 10 to 30 m s and were measured using a pitot static probe flowkinetics p06 cf connected to a differential pressure sensor dwyer 668b 05 3 the air density in the tunnel was determined by measuring the absolute pressure measurement specialties us331 000005 015 pa and temperature u s sensor pr103j2 the average air density was 1 146 kg m3 a two component dynamometer engineering laboratory design was used for measuring drag this system uses a strut assembly that is shrouded from the airstream and connected to a linear voltage differential transformer module a calibration procedure was conducted before and after taking each experimental data point while time consuming this approach ensured that the calibration did not shift during data collection and allowed careful monitoring of drag uncertainty repeated measurements of all data were taken at a given flow condition for use in the uncertainty analysis whose results are summarized in table 1 the variables in table 1 for which uncertainty range is unspecified had consistent relative uncertainty for each measurement condition the test models consisted of wood spheres and delrin cylinders five sphere diameters were used 31 4 mm 43 6 mm 56 7 mm 62 5 mm and 73 9 mm it is noted that the smaller spheres were used only at the higher wind speeds in order to produce drag measurements with acceptable uncertainty the cylinder dimensions were 14 36 mm in diameter and 152 5 mm in length the wood spheres were made smooth using fine grit sandpaper and the bottom of each sphere was machined to have a flat circular section identical to the cross section of the cylinder the reynolds number ranges studied for the cylinder and sphere were 9200 28 000 and 42 600 141 000 respectively which are both in the subcritical range the surface roughness of the delrin and sanded wood was measured phase ii srg 2000 giving a cylinder relative roughness ε d c of 3 8 10 5 and a sphere relative roughness ε d s range of 1 10 5 to 2 5 10 5 for d s 73 9 and d s 31 4 mm respectively for cylinders and spheres in the subcritical reynolds range these levels of relative roughness do not affect drag in comparison to a smooth surface achenbach 1971 1974b models were made by connecting two shapes into a composite body via an inset screw as seen in fig 1 a each sphere was additionally drilled and tapped for mounting to the dynamometer by itself as seen in fig 1b in this way an individual cylinder as well as each individual sphere could be tested on its own as well as being part of a composite body the mounting point of each composite shape was selected to minimize torque about the mounting point thus the mounting point on the composite shape with the largest sphere was higher than that for the smallest sphere composite shape as seen in fig 1a the experimental domain was limited by constraints such as wind tunnel blockage maximum wind speed and minimum drag forces that could be accurately measured the blockage for the different shapes ranged from 0 8 to 7 the influence of blockage was examined using two methods first maskell s theory as presented by anthoine et al 2009 was applied to each shape second extra numerical simulations detailed in section 2 2 were conducted for the largest composite body i e highest blockage case when the simulated wind tunnel cross section was expanded from 30 48 30 48 cm 50 cm 50 cm the change in the drag was 1 0 between the original and enlarged wind tunnel cross sectional areas both analyses show that the influence of blockage is minimal and would be captured within the specified uncertainties in this study thus the results presented are not corrected for blockage 2 2 numerical methods simulations were conducted using ansys fluent 2019 a finite volume computational fluid dynamics cfd software in the present work the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm was employed three dimensional simulations were performed to match experimental conditions the composite and individual component shapes were positioned in the lengthwise center of the channel the inlet was assigned a velocity boundary condition while the outlet was designated a outflow boundary condition all walls were assigned symmetry boundary conditions whereas the submerged geometry surfaces were assigned a no slip wall condition a least square cell based method was used for gradient reconstruction second order discretization method was used for the pressure variable whereas bounded central differencing method was employed for all the convective terms second order implicit transient formulation was used to advance dependent variables in time all dependent variables were set with a convergence criterion of 1 10 8 a large eddy simulation les with smagorinsky lilly subgrid scale turbulence model was used for all cases inlet turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation rate boundary conditions were specified based on turbulence intensity mean inlet velocity and turbulence length scale composite and individual shape component s surface y values were ensured to be around 1 0 by refining mesh near the surface grid independent results were reasonably attained for all cases and the number of tetrahedral meshes utilized for all cases ranges from two to three million mesh elements each simulation case was performed under transient conditions using a 0 000001 s time step based on courant friedrichs lewy cfl stability number less than 1 with 100 sub iterations per time step for a total time of 2 0 s and results were time averaged from 1 0 to 2 0 s 2 3 numerical validation validations of the numerical methods were performed for flows over an individual sphere and cylinder at re 5000 by showing good agreement between the current numerical methods and previous results relating to velocity reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy tke contours and drag coefficients for both the cylinder and sphere confidence is gained in the validity of the methods used for the sake of brevity we present a subset of all of the validation comparisons which all demonstrated excellent agreement fig 2 shows the time averaged streamwise and transverse velocity distributions around a sphere with comparisons of current numerical simulations and to results of hassanzadeh et al 2011 it is noted that the locations and magnitude of the min max velocity features in the wake region are in good agreement likewise fig 3 presents a comparison of normalized reynolds stress contours with experimental results of ozgoren et al 2011 the experimental results show positive and negative reynolds stress peaks of 0 037 and 0 039 occurring one diameter downstream of the sphere which agree with the values of 0 035 and 0 037 found in the same relative position using the current numerical methods fig 4 compares the simulated and experimental normalized time averaged tke results in the wake of a cylinder both methods demonstrate a peak magnitude of 0 22 positioned two diameters downstream finally the simulated drag coefficients of sphere and cylinder at re 5000 are 0 40 and 1 10 respectively and they are in good agreement with historical data barati et al 2014 wieselsberger 1921 3 results and discussion in total 19 different experimental conditions were studied each of these conditions included a test of the individual sphere and cylinder as well as the composite shape at a given wind speed an accompanying simulation was done for twelve of these conditions to validate the numerical method for obtaining additional insights about the wake and drag comparison of the simulation and experimental results showed an average drag deviation of 1 8 which is within the experimental uncertainty the dimensional and non dimensional sphere cylinder and composite body drag results for all simulations and experiments are presented in the appendix tables 2 4 3 1 drag results the results of this study demonstrate that the drag force on a cylinder sphere composite body f comp is greater than the sum of the drag forces on the cylinder and sphere f c f s as seen in fig 5 the increase in drag on the composite shape is affected by the ratio of the sphere and cylinder diameters d s d c when this diameter ratio is 2 19 the increase in drag is 5 but for a diameter ratio of 5 14 the increase in drag is 20 cylinder reynolds number re c is shown to have a smaller and inconsistent impact on the increase in force for the range studied the average uncertainty in the force ratio presented in fig 5 is 4 7 thus the trends seen by varying diameter ratio are discernible outside of the uncertainty it is noted that figs 5 7 present the experimental data as opposed to the simulation data the interference drag is the difference in the drag force between the composite shape and individual shapes interference drag f comp f s f c there are clear trends shown in fig 6 relating an increase in interference drag to increases in cylinder reynolds number and diameter ratio based on the distinct trends seen in fig 6 a dimensional analysis was performed starting from interference drag f d s d c l c u ρ μ in addition to the relevant diameters and free stream velocity u this analysis includes cylinder length l c fluid density ρ and dynamic viscosity μ the dimensional analysis results in four non dimensional terms as seen in eqs 1 4 1 i d i d 0 5 ρ u 2 d c 2 2 r e c ρ u d c μ 3 d s d c 4 l c d c the term in eq 1 id is a non dimensional form of the interference drag id noting that the cylinder length and diameter were held constant in this study the relationship between the first three terms is presented in fig 7 non dimensional interference drag is very weakly dependent on the reynolds number and increases with increasing sphere cylinder diameter ratio it is noted that the average experimental uncertainty in id is 5 5 the data in fig 7 can be collapsed onto a single trend line whose equation is 5 id 0 5665 re c 0 00316 d s d c 1 32 1 004 in comparing this equation with the experimental data one finds a median deviation of 6 8 the finding that composite drag can be more than 20 higher than the simple sum of drag on the individual components shows that its impact can be of sufficient magnitude that it should not be ignored equation 5 in combination with historical data on sphere and cylinder drag e g barati et al 2014 blevins 1984 wang et al 2012 potts et al 2019 allows the composite drag to be determined within the bounds of this study 3 2 surface pressure results to further understand how the junction of the two bodies influences drag pressure details were extracted from numerical simulations fig 8 provides time averaged pressure coefficient distributions on the front and back of the individual shapes and composite bodies for different sphere diameters when u 30 m s re c 28 000 the front view demonstrates that the junction forms an asymmetry in pressure on the sphere with higher pressure near the junction than is present on an individual sphere this effect has also been found for a sphere connected to a flat plate tsutsui 2008 for the lowest d s d c case the high pressure regions on the front of the sphere and cylinder merge the interference affects the pressure on the backside of both the sphere and cylinder portions of the composite shape for spheres on the back surface it is shown that there is a reduced central area of higher pressure as compared to the individual sphere as pressure acts normal to the surface this effect on the central part of the sphere will result in a greater streamwise i e drag impact than pressure modification near the shoulder junction on the sphere which also demonstrate lower pressures for the sphere on the composite shape considering the back view of the cylinder portions in fig 8 a few interesting phenomena arise the junction effect produces a higher pressure on the back of the cylinder near the junction as compared to a cylinder free end this trend holds for the range of d s d c studied while the lower end of the cylinder is largely unaffected by the junction it is noted that the results shown for re c 28 000 in figs 8 10 and 11 qualitatively agree with simulations conducted at re c 14 000 which are not shown for the sake of brevity the simulation results allowed the drag on the sphere portion of the composite body to be quantified comparing the drag from an individual sphere to the sphere portion on the composite body it is found that the composite body sphere shows an average increase in drag of 38 compared to a sphere in isolation comparing the drag from an individual cylinder to the cylinder portion on the composite body it is found that the composite body cylinder shows an average decrease in drag of 6 8 these results are illustrated in fig 9 hollow markers the result of the increase in drag for the sphere and the decrease in drag for the cylinder taking into consideration their different areas is an overall increase in the drag of the composite body as demonstrated in fig 5 fig 9 also presents the drag coefficients found for the individual cylinder and spheres determined via numerical simulation in comparison with historical data solid markers the sphere data agrees well with the data of roos and willmarth 1971 both in terms of magnitude as well as showing some scatter as reynolds number is varied in order to compare the drag coefficients from our cylinder with an aspect ratio of 10 6 and two free ends the procedure detailed by potts et al 2019 was employed this allowed for a small adjustment to be made in order to compare current data against wieselsberger 1921 data from an aspect ratio 10 cylinder with two free ends showing good agreement it is noteworthy that the interference effect would also produce a shift in the center of force acting on a composite body from that anticipated from a simple moment calculation on the individual components of the composite body this would be of particular relevance to situations where torque and or bending of the body is critical for each composite body simulation the center of force was determined and compared against the center of force calculated from a moment balance done using drag force values of the individual spheres and cylinder it was found that the position of the center of force on the composite body shifts to be 5 11 higher on the cylinder i e closer to the junction than was found using data from the individual components 3 3 velocity and streamline results the streamwise velocity fields in a plane parallel to the flow and centered on the solid body are shown in fig 10 for the individual cylinder and spheres the wake structure is approximately symmetric about the midpoint of each body the individual cylinder demonstrates a downwash effect at its upper free end and an upwash effect on its lower free end on the composite body the flow near the lower cylinder free end is largely unaffected by the addition of the sphere though the wake region elsewhere is modified resulting in asymmetries behind that cylinder and sphere that grow with increasing sphere cylinder diameter ratio the composite bodies demonstrate a downwash effect that originates at the top of the sphere and extends down to the cylinder correlating with a net increase in velocity in the wake region of the sphere on the composite body compared to an individual sphere this effect shares similarities with the wake of a sphere placed close to a flat plate tsutsui 2008 also there are pockets of low velocity fluid extending downstream of the junction whose size are shown to scale with sphere diameter to further capture wake features hotwire data was taken behind the midpoint of the cylinder at x d c 2 and y d c 0 75 at this position the average individual cylinder strouhal number was 0 193 for 9200 re c 28 000 for this same position behind the cylinder when a sphere was connected to one end the strouhal number was found to increase slightly for the diameter ratios of d s d c 2 19 3 95 and 5 14 the strouhal number measured downstream of the cylinder midpoint were 0 21 0 216 and 0 23 respectively no distinct frequencies were observed consistently when measuring downstream of the sphere cylinder junction at x d c 2 and y d c 0 75 hotwire data was also taken behind spheres at x d s 1 5 and y d s 0 5 for individual spheres with 54 000 re s 132 000 strouhal numbers of 0 195 0 225 were recorded however when the cylinder was connected frequency peaks were not consistently observed these results demonstrate how the formation of the composite body can affect not just time averaged wake features but also time varying processes 3 4 turbulence results streamwise turbulence distributions along a streamwise plane centered on the bodies are shown in fig 11 though not directly examined through the lens of drag modification these plots provide another view into the modifying effects of forming a composite body in the wake of the composite bodies the localized regions of high turbulence correspond with low velocity areas downstream of the cylinder sphere junction for the composite bodies the wake turbulence has a larger maximum magnitude and remains turbulent for a larger area downstream than for the individual shapes there is an increase in the maximum turbulence intensity with increasing sphere diameter for the composite body the position of the maximum turbulence remains at the height of the junction for the composite body and is positioned approximately one sphere diameter downstream of the junction 3 5 vorticity results figs 12 17 compare time averaged streamwise and spanwise vertical wake vorticities at increasing distance downstream of the individual bodies and their respective composite shapes figs 12 13 present that the counter rotating vortices form near a cylinder free end are apparent whereas figs 14 15 show that only the counter rotating spanwise but not the streamwise wake vortices are profound for the individual sphere the simulated streamwise wake vorticity patterns of individual cylinder and sphere shown in figs 12 and 14 are consistent with the work of hassanzadeh et al 2011 and sumner et al 2004 respectively the streamwise wake vorticity of individual sphere generally demonstrates a scattered pattern whereas the streamwise wake vorticity of individual cylinder demonstrates a counter rotating pair pattern each in the wake of a free end of the cylinder extending to the center of the cylinder it is noted that the strength and physical size of the wake vorticity generally increases with sphere diameter especially for the cases of spanwise vertical component wake vorticities the spanwise wake vorticity generally shows an increase in vorticity size and a more balanced counter rotating pair compared with the streamwise wake vorticity counterpart figs 16 17 show that the wake region near the interface of a composite body is modified from that of the individual sphere or cylinder fig 16 shows that the wake of the sphere no longer exhibits a scattered vorticity pattern but a counter rotating pair in which it seems to be expanded from the streamwise wake vorticity of the cylinder in comparison to the individual spheres fig 16 further shows that the vorticity downstream of the sphere portion of the composite body is shifted towards the junction position and as opposed to being centered on the sphere fig 17 demonstrates that the spanwise wake vorticity of a composite body seems to be combined by wake vorticities of individual sphere and cylinder generally the results demonstrate an increase in vorticity magnitude and size downstream of the sphere portion of the composite shape in comparison to an individual sphere the effect of increasing vorticity in the near wake of a body has been correlated to increases in drag in previous work as well sumner et al 2004 gao et al 2018 whereas the vorticity was roughly centered behind the individual spheres there is a downward shift of the vortices towards the cylinder sphere junction height on the composite body 4 conclusions the interference drag on a cylinder sphere composite body was studied through experiments and numerical simulations for a range of sphere cylinder diameter ratios 2 19 5 14 and sub critical reynolds numbers the additional drag due to interference as compared to the drag on the individual bodies was seen to vary from 4 to 22 the higher the sphere cylinder diameter ratio the greater the interference drag a dimensional analysis was used to collapse data to a single trend line that showed reasonable agreement and demonstrated that reynolds number variation was of minor importance for the conditions studied the use of this new correlation in combination with historical data for individual smooth spheres and cylinders allows for the calculation of drag on a cylinder sphere composite body within the limits of the reynolds numbers considered numerical simulations revealed that the increase in drag found on a composite shape in comparison to the individual components results from a substantial increase in sphere drag and a relatively small decrease in cylinder drag the pressure distribution on the back of the bodies is more significantly impacted than on the front of the bodies when they are combined into a composite shape for the composite body in comparison to the individual shapes an increase in sphere diameter results in wake modifications including increased vorticity increased turbulence intensity and increased regions of low velocity downstream of the cylinder sphere junction as well as an increased strouhal number behind the cylinder junction effects on wake frequencies vorticity and turbulence are particularly relevant to mixing phenomenon while the modification of pressure distributions would be of relevance for structural drag energy considerations as the current study held the cylinder length diameter ratio constant future work may be required to better understand the impact of cylinder aspect ratio as well as higher reynolds numbers credit authorship contribution statement thomas g shepard conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing supervision deify law

20579,wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations have been conducted on composite bodies consisting of a sphere connected atop a cylinder as well as the individual component shapes drag forces were measured in order to determine the interference drag caused by the junction between the two shapes at varying diameter ratios and reynolds numbers increasing the sphere cylinder diameter ratio was found to increase the interference drag a dimensional analysis of these results allows the data to collapse to a single trend line useful for calculating interference drag or in combination with historical sphere and cylinder data total drag on such composite shapes simulation results reveal that the drag on the sphere component of the composite body increases substantially in comparison to the drag on an individual sphere largely due to decreases in the pressure on the downstream side for the composite body in comparison to the individual shapes an increasing sphere diameter results in wake modifications including increased vorticity turbulence intensity and regions of low velocity downstream of the cylinder sphere junction keywords interference drag wind tunnel cfd simulation fluid

cylinder or close approximations to this shape are commonly found in applications including water towers streetlights chimneys and antennae in regards to ocean applications composite body interactions involving cylinder or sphere shapes are relevant to appendages on submersible vehicles zhihua et al 2011 floating wind turbines buoys energy storage systems vasel be hagh et al 2015 measurement sensors subsurface floats nets zhou et al 2015 and other trawling gear despite their prevalence there appears to be little research documenting the interference drag and flow fields around a cylinder sphere composite body introductory fluid mechanics texts advocate that the total drag force on a composite body can be approximated by summing the drag on the individual parts munson et al 2006 while acknowledging that this approach has limitations however it has been shown that interference drag can be as high as 20 of the total drag sakellaridis and lazaridis 2002 a significant increase that provides motivation for continued study of composite bodies past studies point to important variations in boundary layers and modified wake structures as key differences between individual bodies and composite bodies that can result in interference drag kubendran et al 1984 tetrault et al 2001 kornilov 2017 pierce and nath 1990 in considering the drag and flow around a cylinder sphere composite body it is natural to consider the flow fields and drag forces on individual spheres and cylinders the flow field over spheres and infinite circular cylinders has been fully explored by many e g white 1999 duan et al 2015 wieselsberger 1921 delany and sorensen 1953 roshko 1961 almedeij 2008 and barati et al 2014 provide correlations for calculating smooth sphere drag coefficient as a function of reynolds number details on vortical structure shape and shedding frequencies in the wakes of spheres in uniform flows for a large of reynolds are reported by achenbach 1974a taneda 1978 and sakamoto and haniu 1990 with strouhal numbers near 0 2 for 10 000 re 300 000 however research has shown that as a sphere is moved closer to another body the forces and wake characteristics are altered ozgoren et al 2013 reveal that as a sphere is brought in contact with a flat plate that the wake features become asymmetric as vortex shedding and flow separation is modified at re 83 000 tsutsui 2008 shows that the drag and lift coefficients for a sphere sitting on a plate are larger than the corresponding coefficients when the sphere is moved away from the plate early studies of the flow field associated with circular cylinders considered the bodies to be two dimensional thus ignoring or correcting for the end effects as the cylinder sphere composite body represents a modification of a cylinder free end the two dimensional assumption for the cylinder is inappropriate for finite height cylinders with two free ends tip vortices are generated cylinder aspect ratio strongly influences the vortex patterns and the wake field gao et al 2018 and in general the downwash caused by the tip vortices results in a decrease in drag potts et al 2019 zdravkovich et al 1989 found that using hemispherical cylinder ends as compared to flat ends further reduced cylinder drag for a given aspect ratio a more extreme modification of the cylinder end involves mounting the cylinder to a surface a topic which has been reviewed by sumner 2013 wall mounted cylinders include a weaker vortex near the junction a stronger vortex from the tip and an inhibited vortex shedding process okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 sumner et al 2004 baban et al 1989 iungo et al 2012 these interactions can lead to a mean streamwise velocity defect in the wake region of the cylinder resulting from a downwash effect that depends on aspect ratio adaramola et al 2006 rostamy et al 2012 similar to a cylinder with two free ends the tip vortex from the free end of a surface mounted cylinder generates a downwash that results in a higher pressure on the back of the body and a lower overall drag farivar 1981 fox and west 1993 this downwash and corresponding vorticity effects are modified by the corner shape of the cylinder end as shown by park and lee 2004 cylinder cylinder and cylinder sphere composite shapes have been studied in consideration of their relevance to nets klebert et al 2013 provide a nice review of available research on this subject for knotless nets which can be treated as a series of intersecting cylinders the drag is shown to primarily depend on reynolds number solidity ratio and angle relative to the current though mesh patterns angles are also considered of relevance zhou et al 2015 bi et al 2017 solidity ratio is also related to flow velocity attenuation downstream of the cylinders with higher solidity resulting in a larger reduction tu et al 2020 lader et al 2014 treated the net as a cruciform shape where a sphere was used for the knot and rigid cylinders as the twine their results reveal that the drag coefficient for the sphere on the cruciform shape is much higher than for an individual sphere at the same reynolds number a result that also depends on the sphere cylinder diameter ratio it can be seen that flow fields associated with cylinders and spheres are affected by the presence of junctions the current study aims to add to this understanding by examining the interference drag caused by the presence of the junction between a sphere and cylinder through wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations this study examines the interference drag on cylinder sphere composite bodies of varying sphere cylinder diameter ratio and reynolds numbers the experiments serve to quantify the interference drag validate the numerical method and provide an expression for calculating the non dimensional interference drag details of the surface pressure and wake are then determined from simulation results these results are important for quantifying the limitations of the composite body drag approach and for design considerations of drag and wake characteristics in marine applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental methods experimental drag measurements were conducted in a flotek 1440 wind tunnel with a 30 48 cm 30 48 cm x 91 44 cm test section the wind tunnel turbulence intensity measured as 1 of mean velocity with a hot wire probe tsi cta 1750 air speeds ranged from 10 to 30 m s and were measured using a pitot static probe flowkinetics p06 cf connected to a differential pressure sensor dwyer 668b 05 3 the air density in the tunnel was determined by measuring the absolute pressure measurement specialties us331 000005 015 pa and temperature u s sensor pr103j2 the average air density was 1 146 kg m3 a two component dynamometer engineering laboratory design was used for measuring drag this system uses a strut assembly that is shrouded from the airstream and connected to a linear voltage differential transformer module a calibration procedure was conducted before and after taking each experimental data point while time consuming this approach ensured that the calibration did not shift during data collection and allowed careful monitoring of drag uncertainty repeated measurements of all data were taken at a given flow condition for use in the uncertainty analysis whose results are summarized in table 1 the variables in table 1 for which uncertainty range is unspecified had consistent relative uncertainty for each measurement condition the test models consisted of wood spheres and delrin cylinders five sphere diameters were used 31 4 mm 43 6 mm 56 7 mm 62 5 mm and 73 9 mm it is noted that the smaller spheres were used only at the higher wind speeds in order to produce drag measurements with acceptable uncertainty the cylinder dimensions were 14 36 mm in diameter and 152 5 mm in length the wood spheres were made smooth using fine grit sandpaper and the bottom of each sphere was machined to have a flat circular section identical to the cross section of the cylinder the reynolds number ranges studied for the cylinder and sphere were 9200 28 000 and 42 600 141 000 respectively which are both in the subcritical range the surface roughness of the delrin and sanded wood was measured phase ii srg 2000 giving a cylinder relative roughness ε d c of 3 8 10 5 and a sphere relative roughness ε d s range of 1 10 5 to 2 5 10 5 for d s 73 9 and d s 31 4 mm respectively for cylinders and spheres in the subcritical reynolds range these levels of relative roughness do not affect drag in comparison to a smooth surface achenbach 1971 1974b models were made by connecting two shapes into a composite body via an inset screw as seen in fig 1 a each sphere was additionally drilled and tapped for mounting to the dynamometer by itself as seen in fig 1b in this way an individual cylinder as well as each individual sphere could be tested on its own as well as being part of a composite body the mounting point of each composite shape was selected to minimize torque about the mounting point thus the mounting point on the composite shape with the largest sphere was higher than that for the smallest sphere composite shape as seen in fig 1a the experimental domain was limited by constraints such as wind tunnel blockage maximum wind speed and minimum drag forces that could be accurately measured the blockage for the different shapes ranged from 0 8 to 7 the influence of blockage was examined using two methods first maskell s theory as presented by anthoine et al 2009 was applied to each shape second extra numerical simulations detailed in section 2 2 were conducted for the largest composite body i e highest blockage case when the simulated wind tunnel cross section was expanded from 30 48 30 48 cm 50 cm 50 cm the change in the drag was 1 0 between the original and enlarged wind tunnel cross sectional areas both analyses show that the influence of blockage is minimal and would be captured within the specified uncertainties in this study thus the results presented are not corrected for blockage 2 2 numerical methods simulations were conducted using ansys fluent 2019 a finite volume computational fluid dynamics cfd software in the present work the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm was employed three dimensional simulations were performed to match experimental conditions the composite and individual component shapes were positioned in the lengthwise center of the channel the inlet was assigned a velocity boundary condition while the outlet was designated a outflow boundary condition all walls were assigned symmetry boundary conditions whereas the submerged geometry surfaces were assigned a no slip wall condition a least square cell based method was used for gradient reconstruction second order discretization method was used for the pressure variable whereas bounded central differencing method was employed for all the convective terms second order implicit transient formulation was used to advance dependent variables in time all dependent variables were set with a convergence criterion of 1 10 8 a large eddy simulation les with smagorinsky lilly subgrid scale turbulence model was used for all cases inlet turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation rate boundary conditions were specified based on turbulence intensity mean inlet velocity and turbulence length scale composite and individual shape component s surface y values were ensured to be around 1 0 by refining mesh near the surface grid independent results were reasonably attained for all cases and the number of tetrahedral meshes utilized for all cases ranges from two to three million mesh elements each simulation case was performed under transient conditions using a 0 000001 s time step based on courant friedrichs lewy cfl stability number less than 1 with 100 sub iterations per time step for a total time of 2 0 s and results were time averaged from 1 0 to 2 0 s 2 3 numerical validation validations of the numerical methods were performed for flows over an individual sphere and cylinder at re 5000 by showing good agreement between the current numerical methods and previous results relating to velocity reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy tke contours and drag coefficients for both the cylinder and sphere confidence is gained in the validity of the methods used for the sake of brevity we present a subset of all of the validation comparisons which all demonstrated excellent agreement fig 2 shows the time averaged streamwise and transverse velocity distributions around a sphere with comparisons of current numerical simulations and to results of hassanzadeh et al 2011 it is noted that the locations and magnitude of the min max velocity features in the wake region are in good agreement likewise fig 3 presents a comparison of normalized reynolds stress contours with experimental results of ozgoren et al 2011 the experimental results show positive and negative reynolds stress peaks of 0 037 and 0 039 occurring one diameter downstream of the sphere which agree with the values of 0 035 and 0 037 found in the same relative position using the current numerical methods fig 4 compares the simulated and experimental normalized time averaged tke results in the wake of a cylinder both methods demonstrate a peak magnitude of 0 22 positioned two diameters downstream finally the simulated drag coefficients of sphere and cylinder at re 5000 are 0 40 and 1 10 respectively and they are in good agreement with historical data barati et al 2014 wieselsberger 1921 3 results and discussion in total 19 different experimental conditions were studied each of these conditions included a test of the individual sphere and cylinder as well as the composite shape at a given wind speed an accompanying simulation was done for twelve of these conditions to validate the numerical method for obtaining additional insights about the wake and drag comparison of the simulation and experimental results showed an average drag deviation of 1 8 which is within the experimental uncertainty the dimensional and non dimensional sphere cylinder and composite body drag results for all simulations and experiments are presented in the appendix tables 2 4 3 1 drag results the results of this study demonstrate that the drag force on a cylinder sphere composite body f comp is greater than the sum of the drag forces on the cylinder and sphere f c f s as seen in fig 5 the increase in drag on the composite shape is affected by the ratio of the sphere and cylinder diameters d s d c when this diameter ratio is 2 19 the increase in drag is 5 but for a diameter ratio of 5 14 the increase in drag is 20 cylinder reynolds number re c is shown to have a smaller and inconsistent impact on the increase in force for the range studied the average uncertainty in the force ratio presented in fig 5 is 4 7 thus the trends seen by varying diameter ratio are discernible outside of the uncertainty it is noted that figs 5 7 present the experimental data as opposed to the simulation data the interference drag is the difference in the drag force between the composite shape and individual shapes interference drag f comp f s f c there are clear trends shown in fig 6 relating an increase in interference drag to increases in cylinder reynolds number and diameter ratio based on the distinct trends seen in fig 6 a dimensional analysis was performed starting from interference drag f d s d c l c u ρ μ in addition to the relevant diameters and free stream velocity u this analysis includes cylinder length l c fluid density ρ and dynamic viscosity μ the dimensional analysis results in four non dimensional terms as seen in eqs 1 4 1 i d i d 0 5 ρ u 2 d c 2 2 r e c ρ u d c μ 3 d s d c 4 l c d c the term in eq 1 id is a non dimensional form of the interference drag id noting that the cylinder length and diameter were held constant in this study the relationship between the first three terms is presented in fig 7 non dimensional interference drag is very weakly dependent on the reynolds number and increases with increasing sphere cylinder diameter ratio it is noted that the average experimental uncertainty in id is 5 5 the data in fig 7 can be collapsed onto a single trend line whose equation is 5 id 0 5665 re c 0 00316 d s d c 1 32 1 004 in comparing this equation with the experimental data one finds a median deviation of 6 8 the finding that composite drag can be more than 20 higher than the simple sum of drag on the individual components shows that its impact can be of sufficient magnitude that it should not be ignored equation 5 in combination with historical data on sphere and cylinder drag e g barati et al 2014 blevins 1984 wang et al 2012 potts et al 2019 allows the composite drag to be determined within the bounds of this study 3 2 surface pressure results to further understand how the junction of the two bodies influences drag pressure details were extracted from numerical simulations fig 8 provides time averaged pressure coefficient distributions on the front and back of the individual shapes and composite bodies for different sphere diameters when u 30 m s re c 28 000 the front view demonstrates that the junction forms an asymmetry in pressure on the sphere with higher pressure near the junction than is present on an individual sphere this effect has also been found for a sphere connected to a flat plate tsutsui 2008 for the lowest d s d c case the high pressure regions on the front of the sphere and cylinder merge the interference affects the pressure on the backside of both the sphere and cylinder portions of the composite shape for spheres on the back surface it is shown that there is a reduced central area of higher pressure as compared to the individual sphere as pressure acts normal to the surface this effect on the central part of the sphere will result in a greater streamwise i e drag impact than pressure modification near the shoulder junction on the sphere which also demonstrate lower pressures for the sphere on the composite shape considering the back view of the cylinder portions in fig 8 a few interesting phenomena arise the junction effect produces a higher pressure on the back of the cylinder near the junction as compared to a cylinder free end this trend holds for the range of d s d c studied while the lower end of the cylinder is largely unaffected by the junction it is noted that the results shown for re c 28 000 in figs 8 10 and 11 qualitatively agree with simulations conducted at re c 14 000 which are not shown for the sake of brevity the simulation results allowed the drag on the sphere portion of the composite body to be quantified comparing the drag from an individual sphere to the sphere portion on the composite body it is found that the composite body sphere shows an average increase in drag of 38 compared to a sphere in isolation comparing the drag from an individual cylinder to the cylinder portion on the composite body it is found that the composite body cylinder shows an average decrease in drag of 6 8 these results are illustrated in fig 9 hollow markers the result of the increase in drag for the sphere and the decrease in drag for the cylinder taking into consideration their different areas is an overall increase in the drag of the composite body as demonstrated in fig 5 fig 9 also presents the drag coefficients found for the individual cylinder and spheres determined via numerical simulation in comparison with historical data solid markers the sphere data agrees well with the data of roos and willmarth 1971 both in terms of magnitude as well as showing some scatter as reynolds number is varied in order to compare the drag coefficients from our cylinder with an aspect ratio of 10 6 and two free ends the procedure detailed by potts et al 2019 was employed this allowed for a small adjustment to be made in order to compare current data against wieselsberger 1921 data from an aspect ratio 10 cylinder with two free ends showing good agreement it is noteworthy that the interference effect would also produce a shift in the center of force acting on a composite body from that anticipated from a simple moment calculation on the individual components of the composite body this would be of particular relevance to situations where torque and or bending of the body is critical for each composite body simulation the center of force was determined and compared against the center of force calculated from a moment balance done using drag force values of the individual spheres and cylinder it was found that the position of the center of force on the composite body shifts to be 5 11 higher on the cylinder i e closer to the junction than was found using data from the individual components 3 3 velocity and streamline results the streamwise velocity fields in a plane parallel to the flow and centered on the solid body are shown in fig 10 for the individual cylinder and spheres the wake structure is approximately symmetric about the midpoint of each body the individual cylinder demonstrates a downwash effect at its upper free end and an upwash effect on its lower free end on the composite body the flow near the lower cylinder free end is largely unaffected by the addition of the sphere though the wake region elsewhere is modified resulting in asymmetries behind that cylinder and sphere that grow with increasing sphere cylinder diameter ratio the composite bodies demonstrate a downwash effect that originates at the top of the sphere and extends down to the cylinder correlating with a net increase in velocity in the wake region of the sphere on the composite body compared to an individual sphere this effect shares similarities with the wake of a sphere placed close to a flat plate tsutsui 2008 also there are pockets of low velocity fluid extending downstream of the junction whose size are shown to scale with sphere diameter to further capture wake features hotwire data was taken behind the midpoint of the cylinder at x d c 2 and y d c 0 75 at this position the average individual cylinder strouhal number was 0 193 for 9200 re c 28 000 for this same position behind the cylinder when a sphere was connected to one end the strouhal number was found to increase slightly for the diameter ratios of d s d c 2 19 3 95 and 5 14 the strouhal number measured downstream of the cylinder midpoint were 0 21 0 216 and 0 23 respectively no distinct frequencies were observed consistently when measuring downstream of the sphere cylinder junction at x d c 2 and y d c 0 75 hotwire data was also taken behind spheres at x d s 1 5 and y d s 0 5 for individual spheres with 54 000 re s 132 000 strouhal numbers of 0 195 0 225 were recorded however when the cylinder was connected frequency peaks were not consistently observed these results demonstrate how the formation of the composite body can affect not just time averaged wake features but also time varying processes 3 4 turbulence results streamwise turbulence distributions along a streamwise plane centered on the bodies are shown in fig 11 though not directly examined through the lens of drag modification these plots provide another view into the modifying effects of forming a composite body in the wake of the composite bodies the localized regions of high turbulence correspond with low velocity areas downstream of the cylinder sphere junction for the composite bodies the wake turbulence has a larger maximum magnitude and remains turbulent for a larger area downstream than for the individual shapes there is an increase in the maximum turbulence intensity with increasing sphere diameter for the composite body the position of the maximum turbulence remains at the height of the junction for the composite body and is positioned approximately one sphere diameter downstream of the junction 3 5 vorticity results figs 12 17 compare time averaged streamwise and spanwise vertical wake vorticities at increasing distance downstream of the individual bodies and their respective composite shapes figs 12 13 present that the counter rotating vortices form near a cylinder free end are apparent whereas figs 14 15 show that only the counter rotating spanwise but not the streamwise wake vortices are profound for the individual sphere the simulated streamwise wake vorticity patterns of individual cylinder and sphere shown in figs 12 and 14 are consistent with the work of hassanzadeh et al 2011 and sumner et al 2004 respectively the streamwise wake vorticity of individual sphere generally demonstrates a scattered pattern whereas the streamwise wake vorticity of individual cylinder demonstrates a counter rotating pair pattern each in the wake of a free end of the cylinder extending to the center of the cylinder it is noted that the strength and physical size of the wake vorticity generally increases with sphere diameter especially for the cases of spanwise vertical component wake vorticities the spanwise wake vorticity generally shows an increase in vorticity size and a more balanced counter rotating pair compared with the streamwise wake vorticity counterpart figs 16 17 show that the wake region near the interface of a composite body is modified from that of the individual sphere or cylinder fig 16 shows that the wake of the sphere no longer exhibits a scattered vorticity pattern but a counter rotating pair in which it seems to be expanded from the streamwise wake vorticity of the cylinder in comparison to the individual spheres fig 16 further shows that the vorticity downstream of the sphere portion of the composite body is shifted towards the junction position and as opposed to being centered on the sphere fig 17 demonstrates that the spanwise wake vorticity of a composite body seems to be combined by wake vorticities of individual sphere and cylinder generally the results demonstrate an increase in vorticity magnitude and size downstream of the sphere portion of the composite shape in comparison to an individual sphere the effect of increasing vorticity in the near wake of a body has been correlated to increases in drag in previous work as well sumner et al 2004 gao et al 2018 whereas the vorticity was roughly centered behind the individual spheres there is a downward shift of the vortices towards the cylinder sphere junction height on the composite body 4 conclusions the interference drag on a cylinder sphere composite body was studied through experiments and numerical simulations for a range of sphere cylinder diameter ratios 2 19 5 14 and sub critical reynolds numbers the additional drag due to interference as compared to the drag on the individual bodies was seen to vary from 4 to 22 the higher the sphere cylinder diameter ratio the greater the interference drag a dimensional analysis was used to collapse data to a single trend line that showed reasonable agreement and demonstrated that reynolds number variation was of minor importance for the conditions studied the use of this new correlation in combination with historical data for individual smooth spheres and cylinders allows for the calculation of drag on a cylinder sphere composite body within the limits of the reynolds numbers considered numerical simulations revealed that the increase in drag found on a composite shape in comparison to the individual components results from a substantial increase in sphere drag and a relatively small decrease in cylinder drag the pressure distribution on the back of the bodies is more significantly impacted than on the front of the bodies when they are combined into a composite shape for the composite body in comparison to the individual shapes an increase in sphere diameter results in wake modifications including increased vorticity increased turbulence intensity and increased regions of low velocity downstream of the cylinder sphere junction as well as an increased strouhal number behind the cylinder junction effects on wake frequencies vorticity and turbulence are particularly relevant to mixing phenomenon while the modification of pressure distributions would be of relevance for structural drag energy considerations as the current study held the cylinder length diameter ratio constant future work may be required to better understand the impact of cylinder aspect ratio as well
