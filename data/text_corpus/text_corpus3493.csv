17465,the uv chlorine process is efficient for the abatement of micropollutants yet the formation of disinfection by products dbps and the toxicity can be altered during the treatment this study investigated effluent organic matter characterization dbp formation and toxicity alteration after the uv chlorine treatment of wastewater particularly typical water matrix components in wastewater namely ammonia and bromide were studied the raw wastewater contained low levels of ammonia 3 µm and bromide 0 5 µm the uv chlorine treatment efficiently eliminated 90 94 of fluorescent components compared with chlorination alone a 20 min uv chlorine treatment increased the formation of trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas chloral hydrate ch haloacetonitriles hans trichloronitromethane tcnm and haloacetamides hacams by 90 508 in post chlorination after the uv chlorine treatment the formation of ch hans tcnm and hacams increased by 77 274 whereas the formation of both thms and haas increased slightly by 11 meanwhile the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps increased considerably after the uv chlorine treatment and in post chlorination primarily due to the increased formation of haas and nitrogenous dbps n dbps however the acute toxicity of the wastewater to vibrio fischeri and genotoxicity determined by the umu test decreased by 19 and 76 respectively after the 20 min uv chlorine treatment an additional 200 µm ammonia decreased the formation of all detected dbps during the uv chlorine treatment and 24 h post chlorination except that tcnm formation increased by 11 during post chlorination the acute toxicity of wastewater spiked with 200 µm ammonia was 32 lower than that of raw wastewater after the uv chlorine treatment but the genotoxicity was 58 higher the addition of 1 mg l bromide to the uv chlorine process dramatically increased the formation of brominated dbps and the overall calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps however the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the wastewater decreased by 7 and 100 respectively when bromide was added to the uv chlorine treatment this study illuminated that uv chlorine treatment can decrease acute and geno toxicities of wastewater efficiently graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv chlorine disinfection by products toxicity ammonia bromide wastewater nomenclature 3 5 dcp 3 5

total organic carbon wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction uv chlorine treatment is an emerging advanced oxidation process aop that has already been applied in water and wastewater treatment and potable water reuse guo et al 2018 chuang et al 2019 its efficiency in micropollutant degradation and its lower energy consumption than uv h2o2 treatment are desirable in wastewater treatment sichel et al 2011 guo et al 2018 the formed reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 have been shown to have a higher reactivity towards target compounds with electron rich moieties than hydroxyl radicals ho fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 hua et al 2019a the formation of disinfection by products dbps is one of the major concerns when considering the application of uv chlorine in water treatment because rcs are formed and expected to react with organic matter remucal and manley 2016 compared with chlorination alone uv chlorine treatment in full scale drinking water treatment plants wang et al 2015 wang et al 2019 and natural organic matter nom solutions wang et al 2017 gao et al 2019 was reported to significantly increase the formation of trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and adsorbable organic halogen aox whereas a slight decrease in trichloromethane tcm and trichloroacetic acid tcaa formation in a humic acid ha solution was also observed li et al 2016 the discrepancy could be caused by different experimental conditions and water matrices compared with nom in drinking water sources wastewater effluent organic matter efom contains more hydrophilic substances ma et al 2001 which are more reactive towards chlorine the quantities of dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater effluents are always higher than those in drinking water sources and the components in wastewater are much more complex therefore dbp formation after the uv chlorine treatment of wastewater requires further investigation toxicity alteration during water treatment is linked to the transformation products of dom and water matrices many indicators such as the acute toxicity to luminous bacteria vibrio fischeri parvez et al 2006 genotoxicity to genetically modified strains s typhimurium determined by the in vitro umu test reifferscheid and heil 1996 and chronic cytotoxicity and acute genotoxicity to chinese hamster ovary cho cells plewa et al 2004 can represent the toxicity of water samples the acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri decreased when the uv chlorine process was applied to the abatement of trimethoprim wu et al 2016 and naphthenic acid shu et al 2014 the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity to cho cells were observed to decrease significantly when uv photolysis and chlorine were combined in a drinking water plant and applied to reclaimed water plewa et al 2012 lv et al 2017 the cytotoxicity of nom increased after uv chlorine treatment and was higher than that after chlorination alone wang et al 2017 hence toxicity alteration after the uv chlorine treatment of wastewater must be investigated further in addition the water matrices of wastewater are more complex than those of drinking water for example the concentrations of ammonia and bromide are relatively higher in wastewater which can significantly affect the chlorine and radical chemistry in uv chlorine systems ammonia can quickly transform chlorine into chloramine which can increase the formation of nitrogenous dbps n dbps huang et al 2017 with higher toxicity than regulated dbps e g thms and haas muellner et al 2007 also the uv chlorine process converts to the uv chloramine process which has a significantly different chemistry from the former the uv monochloramine nh2cl process primarily produces cl and nh2 then cl reacts with h2o oh and chloride to generate ho and cl2 respectively and nh2 can be transformed into other rns such as no and no2 in the presence of dissolved oxygen li and blatchley iii 2009 wu et al 2019 the steady state concentrations of ho and cl in uv nh2cl under neutral conditions were higher than those in uv chlorine chuang et al 2017 the involvement of no and no2 can increase the formation of trichloronitromethane tcnm during the uv nh2cl treatment of ibuprofen wu et al 2019 however dbp formation and toxicity alteration after the uv chlorine treatment of wastewater in the presence of a high concentration ammonia are largely unstudied the concentration of bromide can reach 4 1 mg l in a surface water magazinovic et al 2004 and over 1 mg l in wastewater effluents soltermann et al 2016 the presence of bromide increases the formation of brominated dbps which are more toxic than chlorinated dbps during chlorination sun et al 2009 however the presence of bromide significantly decreases the genotoxicity of wastewater wu et al 2010 in the uv chlorine process bromide quickly forms free bromine which is then photolysed by uv radiation to produce bromine containing species such as br and br2 wu et al 2017b guo et al 2020 the presence of bromide in the uv chlorine process can significantly promote the degradation of some micropollutants while inhibiting that of others wu et al 2017b cheng et al 2018 compared with the medium pressure uv photolysis of chlorine in the absence of bromide that in the presence of bromide significantly increased the formation of total organic bromine in a nom solution but decreased the formation of aox zhao et al 2011 bromide in the uv chlorine process can decrease the formation of thms haas and haloacetonitriles hans in a ha solution at a uv fluence rate of 1200 mj cm2 gao et al 2020 however studies of the effects of bromide on specific dbp formation in wastewater and toxicity alteration of wastewater during uv chlorine treatment are rare the purposes of this study were to 1 investigate the alteration of efom characteristics after uv chlorine treatment 2 evaluate dbp formation in the uv chlorine process and post chlorination 3 assess the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps and the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of wastewater after uv chlorine treatment and 4 explore the effects of high concentrations of ammonia and bromide in the uv chlorine process on efom characteristics dbp formation and toxicity alteration 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all solutions were prepared from reagent grade chemicals and ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm

stock solution was diluted from a 4 00 4 99 naocl solution and periodically standardized by dpd fas titration apha awwa wef 2012 a secondary wastewater effluent sample was obtained from the datansha wastewater treatment plant wwtp in guangdong province china and then filtered through glass fibre filters whatman gf f the parameters of the wwtp effluent are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental procedures the photochemical experiments were performed in a 700 ml cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor with a low pressure mercury lamp 254 nm gph 212t5l 4 10 w heraeus contained in a quartz tube in the centre a thermostat thd 0515 tianheng china was used to control the solution temperature at 25 0 2 c the photon flux i0 entering the solution was determined to be 0 57 µeinstein s 1 using iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton et al 2011 the effective optical path length l was determined to be 3 32 cm by measuring the h2o2 photolysis kinetics baxendale and wilson 1957 the corresponding average uv fluence rate ep0 was 1 27 mw cm 2 a 700 ml wastewater effluent was dosed with 200 µm free chlorine or h2o2 and simultaneously exposed to uv light for 20 min samples were collected and divided into five portions the first portion 10 ml was analysed to determine the residual chlorine or h2o2 the second and third portions 40 ml were quenched by ascorbic acid to analyse the volatile dbps and haas respectively the fourth portion 20 ml was quenched by sodium sulfite for the analyses of fluorescence spectroscopy and uv absorbance the fifth portion 550 ml was quenched by sodium sulfite to analyse the acute toxicity and genotoxicity which involved the acidification to ph 2 with 10 dilute sulfuric acid v v and solid phase extraction spe using hydrophile lipophilic balance hlb cartridges 200 mg 6 ml cnw control tests were conducted by applying uv or chlorine alone under parallel conditions to explore the effects of high concentrations of ammonia and bromide during uv chlorine treatment 200 µm ammonia or 1 mg l bromide was spiked into wastewater before the uv chlorine treatment to investigate the dbp formation potential during post chlorination samples subjected to uv chlorine uv h2o2 uv and chlorination treatments for 20 min were chlorinated in headspace free amber bottles in the dark at 25 c for 24 h and the residual chlorine was greater than 1 mg l the samples treated by the uv h2o2 process were spiked with aliquots of chlorine to remove residual h2o2 and ensure a chlorine dosage of 200 µm before 24 h chlorination all experiments were performed at least twice and the error bars in the figures represent the maximum and minimum of the replicates the significance of observed differences was evaluated by using student s t test to calculate p values and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 2 3 analytical methods chlorine concentrations were determined by the dpd colorimetric method apha awwa wef 2012 the volatile dbps including thms of tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and tribromomethane tbm ch hans of dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetonitrile tcan bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dibromoacetonitrile dban tcnm and haloacetamides hacams of dichloroacetamide dcacam trichloroacetamide tcacam bromochloroacetamide bcacam dibromoacetamide dbacam and bromodichloroacetamide bdcacam were analysed based on usepa method 551 1 usepa 1995 and haas of dichloroacetic acid dcaa tcaa bromoacetic acid mbaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa chlorodibromoacetic acid cdbaa and tribromoacetic acid tbaa were analysed based on usepa method 552 3 usepa 2003 using a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a usa coupled with an electron capture detector ecd the ph was measured with a ph meter mettler toledo fe20 the dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using a total organic carbon toc analyser shimadzu toc vcph japan the concentrations of cl br no3 no2 and so4 2 in the wastewater were measured by an ion chromatography system ics 900 dionex equipped with a conductivity detector the concentration of ammonia was determined by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry while alkalinity was measured by titration method with methyl orange as an indicator the uv absorbance was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1900 persee china fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer horiba aqualog uv 800 the collected eems were further examined by parallel factor parafac analysis to extract various fluorescence components in matlab murphy et al 2013 the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the dbps were calculated by dividing the concentrations of the detected dbps by their lethal concentration to 50 lc50 values and 50 tail dna or midpoint of tail moment respectively chuang et al 2019 which were obtained from the toxicity data reported by wagner and plewa 2017 determined using cho cells table s2 the total cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the dbps were calculated by summing the values for each dbp to evaluate the toxicity alteration induced by the dbps during different treatments the acute toxicity was analysed using a lumistox toxicity analyser hach usa and vibrio fischeri strains wu et al 2016 after 30 min reaction the luminescence intensities of the samples were measured and reported as the luminescence inhibition the acute toxicity was reported as the equivalent concentration of 3 5 dichlorophenol 3 5 dcp mg 3 5 dcp l the genotoxicity was analysed by sos umu tests using salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 according to a previous study wu et al 2017a the genotoxicity was expressed as the equivalent concentration of 4 nitroquinoline n oxide 4 nqo µg 4 nqo l it was noted that nearly all the volatile dbps and inorganic dbps were lost due to spe extraction and nitrogen dry up zhong et al 2019 therefore the acute toxicity and genotoxicity were the toxicities of organic extracts including efom and non volatile organic transformation products in the wastewater 2 4 kinetic model simulation the steady state concentrations of the reactive species in the uv chlorine processes were simulated by a kinetic model using kintecus v4 55 ianni 2015 according to previous studies guo et al 2018 wu et al 2019 ammonia and bromine related reactions were considered when modelling the concentrations of radicals in wastewater details of the reactions employed in the model are listed in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 impacts of uv chlorine treatment on efom characterization dbp formation and toxicity alteration 3 1 1 efom characterization in uv chlorine treated wastewater fig 1 shows the degradation of different fluorescent components and the alteration of the uv absorbance of the wastewater at 254 nm uva254 after uv photolysis chlorination and the uv chlorine treatment the eem spectra were divided into three regions according to the parafac analysis c1 c2 and c3 exhibited maximum fluorescence intensities at ex em 325 400 nm 240 460 nm and 280 320 nm respectively fig s1 which were attributed to humic acid fulvic acid and protein like components respectively chen et al 2003 uv photolysis and chlorination alone could degrade 9 10 and 20 42 respectively of the diverse fluorescent components in the wastewater the uv chlorine treatment improved the removal efficiency of fluorescent components to 90 94 most of the components in the wastewater were resistant to uv photolysis chlorination tended to react with humic substances such as humic acid and fulvic acid c1 and c2 korshin et al 1999 the reactive species formed in the uv chlorine process such as ho and rcs led to decreases of more than 90 in diverse components in the wastewater p 0 05 these results were consistent with those of a previous study which reported that uv chlorine treatment accelerated the destruction of chromophoric components pisarenko et al 2013 during uv h2o2 treatment c1 and c2 in the wastewater were degraded by 47 48 and c3 was degraded by 77 after 20 min at the same dosage of oxidant 200 µm fig s2 indicating that ho preferred to consume protein like components in the wastewater the rate constant of efom with ho was 3 3 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 yang et al 2016 the steady state concentrations of ho determined by the kinetic model were 6 78 10 14 m and 5 64 10 13 m in the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes respectively the steady state concentrations of cl clo and cl2 were 1 01 10 14 m 1 77 10 12 m and 7 79 10 13 m respectively in the uv chlorine process cl and clo reacted with efom with rate constants of 1 3 104 and 1 8 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 respectively guo et al 2018 while the rate constant of cl2 with efom was estimated to be 200 mg l 1 1 s 1 brigante et al 2014 in addition so4 2 does not affect the radical chemistry in the uv chlorine process while alkalinity components of hco3 co3 2 can react with ho and rcs to generate co3 with the concentration of 9 66 10 11 m the rate constant of efom with co3 was reported to be 76 mg l 1 1 s 1 yan et al 2019 then the transformation rates of efom by ho cl cl2 clo and co3 were estimated to be 2 7 10 5 s 1 1 6 10 6 s 1 1 9 10 6 s 1 3 8 10 4 s 1 and 8 8 10 5 s 1 respectively therefore clo played a more important role in degrading diverse fluorescent components of wastewater in the uv chlorine process after uv photolysis and chlorination alone uva254 decreased by 9 and 25 respectively whereas it decreased by 62 after the uv chlorine treatment uva254 represents the aromaticity and or hydrophobicity of dom hwang et al 2002 reactive species could be responsible for the significant decrease in uva254 in the uv chlorine process in the uv h2o2 process uva254 only decreased by 18 fig s2 which was consistent with the results of a previous study in which a much higher decrease in the uva254 of wastewater was observed after uv chlorine treatment than after uv h2o2 treatment miklos et al 2019 chlorination and rcs were likely the causes of the higher efficiency in decreasing the aromaticity 3 1 2 dbp formation in uv chlorine treated wastewater fig 2 shows the dbp formation during 20 min treatments by uv chlorination and uv chlorine and 24 h post chlorination compared to chlorination alone the 20 min uv chlorine treatment significantly promoted the formation of detected dbps by 90 508 p 0 05 rcs is more reactive towards organic compounds than chlorine guo et al 2017 resulting in more reaction sites cl can directly form chlorinated transformation products via radical addition lei et al 2019 bulman and remucal 2020 which could explain the enhanced dbp formation during the uv chlorine treatment during 24 h post chlorination after the 20 min uv chlorine treatment the regulated dbps of thms and haas increased slightly by 11 relative to those obtained by chlorination alone p 0 05 whereas the formation of unregulated dbps such as ch hans tcnm and hacams increased significantly by 77 274 p 0 05 in addition uv photolysis of the wastewater increased the formation of ch tcnm and hacams by 38 67 and 43 respectively p 0 05 after 24 h post chlorination the involvement of ho and rcs can alter the properties of organic matter producing more intermediates that readily react with chlorine to form more dbps in post chlorination wang et al 2015 gao et al 2020 cl can react with organic substances via hydrogen abstraction electron transfer and addition whereas the reaction mechanisms of clo and cl2 are mainly electron transfer alfassi et al 1988 lei et al 2019 thus rcs accelerated the formation of chlorinated products and dbps bulman and remucal 2020 meanwhile ho and rcs could activate some precursors in wastewater which readily reacted with chlorine in post chlorination ho increased the formation of aldehydes from organic substances xie et al 2015 providing ch precursors during post chlorination on the other hand the reduced aromaticity could decrease the formation potential of thms and haas lamsal et al 2011 doc decreased by 15 during the uv chlorine treatment primarily via radical oxidation fig s3 resulting in the decrease of some dbp precursors therefore the formation of thms and haas increased modestly after the uv chlorine treatment compared with chlorination alone in terms of n dbps the uv chlorine treatment accelerated the formation of hans in a short period wang et al 2015 the base hydrolysis of hans can increase the formation of hacams reckhow et al 2001 both ho and rcs can transform the amine moieties of organic compounds into nitro moieties deng et al 2014 hua et al 2019b leading to increased tcnm formation the formation of n dbps in post chlorination after the uv chlorine treatment was 77 101 higher than that after the uv h2o2 treatment fig s4 indicating that rcs enhanced the formation of n dbps much more than ho a previous study reported that ho can decrease the formation of n dbps in post chlorination after the uv h2o2 treatment of filtered drinking water chu et al 2015 therefore the enhancement in n dbp formation after the uv chlorine treatment could be attributed to rcs in addition the uv photolysis of inorganic precursors e g nitrite and nitrate can result in the formation of rns eqs 1 and 2 lyon et al 2012 which might have contributed to the increased formation of some n dbps in post chlorination 1 n o 3 hv n o 2 o 2 n o 2 hv n o o 3 1 3 toxicity alteration in uv chlorine treated wastewater fig 3 shows the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the dbps during the 20 min uv chlorine treatment and 24 h post chlorination cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the dbps are the chronic toxicity that inhibits cell growth and the acute toxicity that damages genomic dna respectively wagner and plewa 2017 the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the dbps in the uv chlorine process were 2 2 and 2 8 times respectively those after chlorination alone of these haas hans and hacams contributed to over 90 of the calculated cytotoxicity of both chlorination and the uv chlorine treatment haas contributed more than 65 of the highest genotoxicity primarily due to the high genotoxicity of mbaa during 24 h post chlorination the calculated dbp cytotoxicity and genotoxicity after the uv chlorine treatment were 79 and 50 respectively higher than those after chlorination alone due to the increased formation of haas hans and hacams fig 4 shows the changes in the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of organic extracts in the wastewater after 20 min chlorination uv photolysis and uv chlorine treatments the acute toxicity and genotoxicity are comprehensive assessments of toxic organic compounds other than dbps the equivalent acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri and genotoxicity of untreated wastewater determined by the umu test were 0 75 mg 3 5 dcp l and 1 54 µg 4 nqo l chlorination alone and uv photolysis of the wastewater slightly increased the acute toxicity by 12 and 9 respectively whereas the uv chlorine treatment decreased the acute toxicity by 19 the genotoxicity decreased by 30 39 and 76 after 20 min chlorination uv and uv chlorine treatments respectively p 0 05 toxicity alteration in wastewater depends on the degradation of existing toxic substances during the treatment and the formation of new toxic transformation products the transformation products formed during chlorination exhibited higher acute toxicity leading to an increase in the acute toxicity of the wastewater the acute toxicity was lower after the uv chlorine treatment of trimethoprim than after chlorination because ho and rcs decreased the acute toxicity wu et al 2016 rcs not only formed toxic chlorinated products but also tended to reduce the acute toxicity when degrading target pollutants shu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 chlorination and uv photolysis can eliminate some genotoxic materials in wastewater wu et al 2012 huang et al 2019 ho and rcs further eliminated genotoxic materials in the wastewater during the uv chlorine treatment co3 could also decrease the genotoxicity of some organic compounds zhou et al 2020 hence the uv chlorine treatment efficiently degraded diverse organic compounds and simultaneously decreased the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the wastewater 3 2 effects of ammonia on efom characterization dbp formation and toxicity alteration in uv chlorine treated wastewater the initial ammonia concentration of the wastewater was 0 04 mgn l 3 µm additional 200 µm ammonia was added in the wastewater firstly before spiking free chlorine to simulate the wastewater with high concentration ammonia the addition of 200 µm ammonia to the wastewater significantly decreased the removal efficiencies of fluorescent components and uva254 by 37 43 and 26 respectively p 0 05 in the uv chlorine process fig 1 the additional 200 µm ammonia completely converted chlorine into monochloramine when the chlorine dosage was 200 µm which could mimic the application of a uv chlorine treatment to wastewater with high ammonia levels or uv monochloramine treatment monochloramine is a weak oxidant with a much lower degradation efficiency of organic compounds than free chlorine according to the kinetic model the steady state concentrations of ho cl and cl2 increased by 14 2 6 times and 2 7 times respectively whereas that of clo decreased by 87 during uv chlorine treatment of wastewater with 200 µm ammonia table 2 clo was primarily generated from the reaction of free chlorine hocl ocl with ho and cl the conversion of free chlorine to monochloramine led to the significant decrease of clo as previously mentioned of the radicals in the uv chlorine process clo was responsible for the degradation of efom the conversion of free chlorine to chloramine led to decreases in clo and the removal efficiencies of fluorescent components and aromaticity the formation of all the dbps decreased considerably by 64 97 during 20 min uv chlorine treatment of wastewater with 200 µm ammonia fig 2 during the 24 h post treatment the formation of c dbps hans and hacams decreased by 88 98 66 and 43 respectively whereas that of tcnm increased by 11 p 0 05 monochloramine had a lower reactivity towards efom to form c dbps the photolysis of monochloramine can generate reactive nitrate species rns such as no and no2 according to eqs 3 5 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019 also nitrite is the inorganic product of chloramine photolysis de laat et al 2010 and can consume ho and cl to form no2 bu et al 2020 the formation of rns is likely to yield nitrogenous by products especially nitro products which can act as tcnm precursors hence the tcnm formation potential increased when ammonia was added to the uv chlorine treatment 3 n h 2 o 2 n h 2 o 2 4 n h 2 o 2 n o h 2 o 5 2 n o o 2 2 n o 2 during the uv chlorine treatment and 24 h post chlorination with additional ammonia the calculated dbp cytotoxicity decreased substantially by 90 and 78 respectively whereas the calculated dbp genotoxicity decreased by 92 and 73 respectively fig 3 hans and hacams accounted for more than 85 of the cytotoxicity during the uv chlorine treatment of wastewater with additional ammonia whereas haas and tcnm were responsible for more than 82 of the genotoxicity the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the wastewater decreased to 0 41 mg 3 5 dcp l and 0 58 µg 4 nqo l respectively after the uv chlorine treatment with additional ammonia fig 4 the acute toxicity of wastewater spiked with 200 µm ammonia was 32 lower than that of unspiked wastewater after the uv chlorine treatment but the genotoxicity was 58 higher p 0 05 chloramination alone decreased the acute toxicity of the wastewater whereas chlorination increased it the decrease in clo led to a reduced removal efficiency of genotoxic materials meanwhile nitrosated and nitrated products which are expected to be more genotoxic chen et al 2020 could form in the uv monochloramine process wu et al 2019 3 3 effects of bromide on efom characterization dbp formation and toxicity alteration in uv chlorine treated wastewater the initial bromide concentration in the wastewater was 40 µg l 0 5 µm the degradation of different fluorescent components and the reduction in uva254 were slightly different for the uv chlorine processes without and with additional 1 mg l 12 5 µm bromide fig 1 with the additional 1 mg l bromide the concentration of ho increased slightly by 18 whereas the concentrations of rcs decreased by 8 24 table 2 on the other hand the concentrations of br br2 and brcl increased by 1 3 orders of magnitude to 7 28 10 14 m 1 56 10 12 m and 2 86 10 13 m respectively in the uv chlorine process reactive bromine species rbs can attack organic compounds via electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction with rate constants in the range of 105 1010 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2020 nist 2020 therefore the degradation rates of diverse components barely changed in the uv chlorine process with additional bromide compared with the uv chlorine treatment without bromide addition the uv chlorine process with 1 mg l bromide resulted in an increase in the formation of thms by 86 but decreases in the haas by 24 hans by 31 and hacams by 27 fig 2 p 0 05 additional bromide led to an increases of 122 and 36 in the formation of thms and hans respectively relative to the results obtained for post chlorination preceded by the uv chlorine treatment whereas the formation of haas and hacams decreased by 24 and 14 respectively the formation of bromine and rbs in the uv chlorine process significantly increased the formation of brominated dbps bromine tends to react with organic matter by substitution but chlorine tends to cleave carbon bonds westerhoff et al 2004 bromine preferred to react with humic acid c1 and fulvic acid c2 which were reported to play a greater role in the formation of thms than chlorine richardson et al 2003 the presence of bromide in the uv chlorine process can further produce organic matter with lower mws zhao et al 2011 providing more precursors of thms bromine reacted with dom via electrophilic substitution by lower than 40 to form brominated dbps while the remaining reaction occurred via electron transfer to form bromide langsa et al 2017 the released bromide was recycled by chlorine to form bromine resulting in further electrophilic substitution to generate more brominated dbps compared with the 20 min chlorination with additional bromide the uv chlorine treatment led to a significant increase in the formation of bromo dbps and bromochloro dbps the degree of bromination is often indicated by the bromine incorporation factor bif which is defined as follows 6 bif thms n 1 3 n chcl 3 n br n total thms 7 bif haas n 1 3 m 1 4 n n c 2 h m o 2 cl 4 m n br n total haas 8 bif hans n 1 2 n c 2 hncl 2 n br n total hans 9 bif hacams n 1 2 n c 2 h 3 nocl 2 n br n c 2 h 2 nocl 2 br total hacams the bifs of the thms haas hans and hacams during the 20 min chlorination treatment with additional bromide were 61 48 45 and 48 respectively whereas they increased to 62 59 47 and 76 respectively during the uv chlorine treatment with additional bromide the additional bromide significantly increased the calculated dbp cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by 2 6 times during the 20 min uv chlorine treatment and subsequent 24 h chlorination the brominated dbps exhibited much higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity to cho cells than the chlorinated dbps wagner and plewa 2017 with the additional bromide the acute toxicity of the wastewater decreased to 0 56 mg 3 5 dcp l which was 7 lower than that during the uv chlorine treatment without additional bromide p 0 05 the genotoxicity of the wastewater decreased to less than the limit of detection p 0 05 the genotoxicity of wastewater is responsible for some genotoxic materials that exist in wastewater such as ofloxacin wu et al 2010 the removal efficiency of genotoxic materials was higher during chlorination with bromide than during chlorination without bromide as determined by umu tests wu et al 2010 rbs could further decrease the genotoxic materials despite the increase in brominated dbps the presence of bromide during the uv chlorine treatment efficiently eliminated toxic organic fractions from the wastewater 4 conclusions and engineering implications this study investigated dbp formation and toxicity alteration in wastewater after uv chlorine treatment and examined the effects of ammonia and bromide rcs accelerated the degradation of components in the wastewater but dbp formation increased during the uv chlorine treatment however compared with chlorination alone the uv chlorine treatment reduced the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of organic matter in the wastewater the addition of 200 µm ammonia decreased the concentration of clo but increased the concentrations of ho cl and cl2 in the uv chlorine process which decreased the removal efficiency of organic substances from the wastewater however compared with the uv chlorine treatment without ammonia the addition of ammonia slightly decreased the acute toxicity and increased the genotoxicity of the wastewater the high concentration of ammonia increased the formation of tcnm in post chlorination after the uv chlorine treatment an additional 1 mg l bromide in the uv chlorine process led to the formation of bromine and rbs which considerably increased the formation of brominated dbps and the corresponding cytotoxicity and genotoxicity however the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the wastewater were further decreased compared with the traditional uv h2o2 treatment the uv chlorine treatment exhibited a better performance in terms of the removal efficiency of organic components from the wastewater the formation of thms in post chlorination after the uv chlorine treatment was 18 lower than that after the uv h2o2 treatment whereas the formation of n dbps was 77 101 higher after the uv chlorine treatment fig s4 ammonia and bromide are common ions in wastewater that affect the chlorine and radical chemistry in the uv chlorine process and thus dbp and toxicity alteration the trends in dbp formation and the calculated dbp cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were not consistent with those in the acute toxicity and mutability more toxicity bioassays should be conducted to further evaluate the effects of the uv chlorine treatment on wastewater quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17465,the uv chlorine process is efficient for the abatement of micropollutants yet the formation of disinfection by products dbps and the toxicity can be altered during the treatment this study investigated effluent organic matter characterization dbp formation and toxicity alteration after the uv chlorine treatment of wastewater particularly typical water matrix components in wastewater namely ammonia and bromide were studied the raw wastewater contained low levels of ammonia 3 µm and bromide 0 5 µm the uv chlorine treatment efficiently eliminated 90 94 of fluorescent components compared with chlorination alone a 20 min uv chlorine treatment increased the formation of trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas chloral hydrate ch haloacetonitriles hans trichloronitromethane tcnm and haloacetamides hacams by 90 508 in post chlorination after the uv chlorine treatment the formation of ch hans tcnm and hacams increased by 77 274 whereas the formation of both thms and haas increased slightly by 11 meanwhile the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps increased considerably after the uv chlorine treatment and in post chlorination primarily due to the increased formation of haas and nitrogenous dbps n dbps however the acute toxicity of the wastewater to vibrio fischeri and genotoxicity determined by the umu test decreased by 19 and 76 respectively after the 20 min uv chlorine treatment an additional 200 µm ammonia decreased the formation of all detected dbps during the uv chlorine treatment and 24 h post chlorination except that tcnm formation increased by 11 during post chlorination the acute toxicity of wastewater spiked with 200 µm ammonia was 32 lower than that of raw wastewater after the uv chlorine treatment but the genotoxicity was 58 higher the addition of 1 mg l bromide to the uv chlorine process dramatically increased the formation of brominated dbps and the overall calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps however the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the wastewater decreased by 7 and 100 respectively when bromide was added to the uv chlorine treatment this study illuminated that uv chlorine treatment can decrease acute and geno toxicities of wastewater efficiently graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv chlorine disinfection by products toxicity ammonia bromide wastewater nomenclature 3 5 dcp 3 5

total organic carbon wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction uv chlorine treatment is an emerging advanced oxidation process aop that has already been applied in water and wastewater treatment and potable water reuse guo et al 2018 chuang et al 2019 its efficiency in micropollutant degradation and its lower energy consumption than uv h2o2 treatment are desirable in wastewater treatment sichel et al 2011 guo et al 2018 the formed reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 have been shown to have a higher reactivity towards target compounds with electron rich moieties than hydroxyl radicals ho fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 hua et al 2019a the formation of disinfection by products dbps is one of the major concerns when considering the application of uv chlorine in water treatment because rcs are formed and expected to react with organic matter remucal and manley 2016 compared with chlorination alone uv chlorine treatment in full scale drinking water treatment plants wang et al 2015 wang et al 2019 and natural organic matter nom solutions wang et al 2017 gao et al 2019 was reported to significantly increase the formation of trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and adsorbable organic halogen aox whereas a slight decrease in trichloromethane tcm and trichloroacetic acid tcaa formation in a humic acid ha solution was also observed li et al 2016 the discrepancy could be caused by different experimental conditions and water matrices compared with nom in drinking water sources wastewater effluent organic matter efom contains more hydrophilic substances ma et al 2001 which are more reactive towards chlorine the quantities of dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater effluents are always higher than those in drinking water sources and the components in wastewater are much more complex therefore dbp formation after the uv chlorine treatment of wastewater requires further investigation toxicity alteration during water treatment is linked to the transformation products of dom and water matrices many indicators such as the acute toxicity to luminous bacteria vibrio fischeri parvez et al 2006 genotoxicity to genetically modified strains s typhimurium determined by the in vitro umu test reifferscheid and heil 1996 and chronic cytotoxicity and acute genotoxicity to chinese hamster ovary cho cells plewa et al 2004 can represent the toxicity of water samples the acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri decreased when the uv chlorine process was applied to the abatement of trimethoprim wu et al 2016 and naphthenic acid shu et al 2014 the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity to cho cells were observed to decrease significantly when uv photolysis and chlorine were combined in a drinking water plant and applied to reclaimed water plewa et al 2012 lv et al 2017 the cytotoxicity of nom increased after uv chlorine treatment and was higher than that after chlorination alone wang et al 2017 hence toxicity alteration after the uv chlorine treatment of wastewater must be investigated further in addition the water matrices of wastewater are more complex than those of drinking water for example the concentrations of ammonia and bromide are relatively higher in wastewater which can significantly affect the chlorine and radical chemistry in uv chlorine systems ammonia can quickly transform chlorine into chloramine which can increase the formation of nitrogenous dbps n dbps huang et al 2017 with higher toxicity than regulated dbps e g thms and haas muellner et al 2007 also the uv chlorine process converts to the uv chloramine process which has a significantly different chemistry from the former the uv monochloramine nh2cl process primarily produces cl and nh2 then cl reacts with h2o oh and chloride to generate ho and cl2 respectively and nh2 can be transformed into other rns such as no and no2 in the presence of dissolved oxygen li and blatchley iii 2009 wu et al 2019 the steady state concentrations of ho and cl in uv nh2cl under neutral conditions were higher than those in uv chlorine chuang et al 2017 the involvement of no and no2 can increase the formation of trichloronitromethane tcnm during the uv nh2cl treatment of ibuprofen wu et al 2019 however dbp formation and toxicity alteration after the uv chlorine treatment of wastewater in the presence of a high concentration ammonia are largely unstudied the concentration of bromide can reach 4 1 mg l in a surface water magazinovic et al 2004 and over 1 mg l in wastewater effluents soltermann et al 2016 the presence of bromide increases the formation of brominated dbps which are more toxic than chlorinated dbps during chlorination sun et al 2009 however the presence of bromide significantly decreases the genotoxicity of wastewater wu et al 2010 in the uv chlorine process bromide quickly forms free bromine which is then photolysed by uv radiation to produce bromine containing species such as br and br2 wu et al 2017b guo et al 2020 the presence of bromide in the uv chlorine process can significantly promote the degradation of some micropollutants while inhibiting that of others wu et al 2017b cheng et al 2018 compared with the medium pressure uv photolysis of chlorine in the absence of bromide that in the presence of bromide significantly increased the formation of total organic bromine in a nom solution but decreased the formation of aox zhao et al 2011 bromide in the uv chlorine process can decrease the formation of thms haas and haloacetonitriles hans in a ha solution at a uv fluence rate of 1200 mj cm2 gao et al 2020 however studies of the effects of bromide on specific dbp formation in wastewater and toxicity alteration of wastewater during uv chlorine treatment are rare the purposes of this study were to 1 investigate the alteration of efom characteristics after uv chlorine treatment 2 evaluate dbp formation in the uv chlorine process and post chlorination 3 assess the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps and the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of wastewater after uv chlorine treatment and 4 explore the effects of high concentrations of ammonia and bromide in the uv chlorine process on efom characteristics dbp formation and toxicity alteration 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all solutions were prepared from reagent grade chemicals and ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm

stock solution was diluted from a 4 00 4 99 naocl solution and periodically standardized by dpd fas titration apha awwa wef 2012 a secondary wastewater effluent sample was obtained from the datansha wastewater treatment plant wwtp in guangdong province china and then filtered through glass fibre filters whatman gf f the parameters of the wwtp effluent are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental procedures the photochemical experiments were performed in a 700 ml cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor with a low pressure mercury lamp 254 nm gph 212t5l 4 10 w heraeus contained in a quartz tube in the centre a thermostat thd 0515 tianheng china was used to control the solution temperature at 25 0 2 c the photon flux i0 entering the solution was determined to be 0 57 µeinstein s 1 using iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton et al 2011 the effective optical path length l was determined to be 3 32 cm by measuring the h2o2 photolysis kinetics baxendale and wilson 1957 the corresponding average uv fluence rate ep0 was 1 27 mw cm 2 a 700 ml wastewater effluent was dosed with 200 µm free chlorine or h2o2 and simultaneously exposed to uv light for 20 min samples were collected and divided into five portions the first portion 10 ml was analysed to determine the residual chlorine or h2o2 the second and third portions 40 ml were quenched by ascorbic acid to analyse the volatile dbps and haas respectively the fourth portion 20 ml was quenched by sodium sulfite for the analyses of fluorescence spectroscopy and uv absorbance the fifth portion 550 ml was quenched by sodium sulfite to analyse the acute toxicity and genotoxicity which involved the acidification to ph 2 with 10 dilute sulfuric acid v v and solid phase extraction spe using hydrophile lipophilic balance hlb cartridges 200 mg 6 ml cnw control tests were conducted by applying uv or chlorine alone under parallel conditions to explore the effects of high concentrations of ammonia and bromide during uv chlorine treatment 200 µm ammonia or 1 mg l bromide was spiked into wastewater before the uv chlorine treatment to investigate the dbp formation potential during post chlorination samples subjected to uv chlorine uv h2o2 uv and chlorination treatments for 20 min were chlorinated in headspace free amber bottles in the dark at 25 c for 24 h and the residual chlorine was greater than 1 mg l the samples treated by the uv h2o2 process were spiked with aliquots of chlorine to remove residual h2o2 and ensure a chlorine dosage of 200 µm before 24 h chlorination all experiments were performed at least twice and the error bars in the figures represent the maximum and minimum of the replicates the significance of observed differences was evaluated by using student s t test to calculate p values and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 2 3 analytical methods chlorine concentrations were determined by the dpd colorimetric method apha awwa wef 2012 the volatile dbps including thms of tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and tribromomethane tbm ch hans of dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetonitrile tcan bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dibromoacetonitrile dban tcnm and haloacetamides hacams of dichloroacetamide dcacam trichloroacetamide tcacam bromochloroacetamide bcacam dibromoacetamide dbacam and bromodichloroacetamide bdcacam were analysed based on usepa method 551 1 usepa 1995 and haas of dichloroacetic acid dcaa tcaa bromoacetic acid mbaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa chlorodibromoacetic acid cdbaa and tribromoacetic acid tbaa were analysed based on usepa method 552 3 usepa 2003 using a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a usa coupled with an electron capture detector ecd the ph was measured with a ph meter mettler toledo fe20 the dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using a total organic carbon toc analyser shimadzu toc vcph japan the concentrations of cl br no3 no2 and so4 2 in the wastewater were measured by an ion chromatography system ics 900 dionex equipped with a conductivity detector the concentration of ammonia was determined by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry while alkalinity was measured by titration method with methyl orange as an indicator the uv absorbance was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1900 persee china fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer horiba aqualog uv 800 the collected eems were further examined by parallel factor parafac analysis to extract various fluorescence components in matlab murphy et al 2013 the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the dbps were calculated by dividing the concentrations of the detected dbps by their lethal concentration to 50 lc50 values and 50 tail dna or midpoint of tail moment respectively chuang et al 2019 which were obtained from the toxicity data reported by wagner and plewa 2017 determined using cho cells table s2 the total cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the dbps were calculated by summing the values for each dbp to evaluate the toxicity alteration induced by the dbps during different treatments the acute toxicity was analysed using a lumistox toxicity analyser hach usa and vibrio fischeri strains wu et al 2016 after 30 min reaction the luminescence intensities of the samples were measured and reported as the luminescence inhibition the acute toxicity was reported as the equivalent concentration of 3 5 dichlorophenol 3 5 dcp mg 3 5 dcp l the genotoxicity was analysed by sos umu tests using salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 according to a previous study wu et al 2017a the genotoxicity was expressed as the equivalent concentration of 4 nitroquinoline n oxide 4 nqo µg 4 nqo l it was noted that nearly all the volatile dbps and inorganic dbps were lost due to spe extraction and nitrogen dry up zhong et al 2019 therefore the acute toxicity and genotoxicity were the toxicities of organic extracts including efom and non volatile organic transformation products in the wastewater 2 4 kinetic model simulation the steady state concentrations of the reactive species in the uv chlorine processes were simulated by a kinetic model using kintecus v4 55 ianni 2015 according to previous studies guo et al 2018 wu et al 2019 ammonia and bromine related reactions were considered when modelling the concentrations of radicals in wastewater details of the reactions employed in the model are listed in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 impacts of uv chlorine treatment on efom characterization dbp formation and toxicity alteration 3 1 1 efom characterization in uv chlorine treated wastewater fig 1 shows the degradation of different fluorescent components and the alteration of the uv absorbance of the wastewater at 254 nm uva254 after uv photolysis chlorination and the uv chlorine treatment the eem spectra were divided into three regions according to the parafac analysis c1 c2 and c3 exhibited maximum fluorescence intensities at ex em 325 400 nm 240 460 nm and 280 320 nm respectively fig s1 which were attributed to humic acid fulvic acid and protein like components respectively chen et al 2003 uv photolysis and chlorination alone could degrade 9 10 and 20 42 respectively of the diverse fluorescent components in the wastewater the uv chlorine treatment improved the removal efficiency of fluorescent components to 90 94 most of the components in the wastewater were resistant to uv photolysis chlorination tended to react with humic substances such as humic acid and fulvic acid c1 and c2 korshin et al 1999 the reactive species formed in the uv chlorine process such as ho and rcs led to decreases of more than 90 in diverse components in the wastewater p 0 05 these results were consistent with those of a previous study which reported that uv chlorine treatment accelerated the destruction of chromophoric components pisarenko et al 2013 during uv h2o2 treatment c1 and c2 in the wastewater were degraded by 47 48 and c3 was degraded by 77 after 20 min at the same dosage of oxidant 200 µm fig s2 indicating that ho preferred to consume protein like components in the wastewater the rate constant of efom with ho was 3 3 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 yang et al 2016 the steady state concentrations of ho determined by the kinetic model were 6 78 10 14 m and 5 64 10 13 m in the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes respectively the steady state concentrations of cl clo and cl2 were 1 01 10 14 m 1 77 10 12 m and 7 79 10 13 m respectively in the uv chlorine process cl and clo reacted with efom with rate constants of 1 3 104 and 1 8 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 respectively guo et al 2018 while the rate constant of cl2 with efom was estimated to be 200 mg l 1 1 s 1 brigante et al 2014 in addition so4 2 does not affect the radical chemistry in the uv chlorine process while alkalinity components of hco3 co3 2 can react with ho and rcs to generate co3 with the concentration of 9 66 10 11 m the rate constant of efom with co3 was reported to be 76 mg l 1 1 s 1 yan et al 2019 then the transformation rates of efom by ho cl cl2 clo and co3 were estimated to be 2 7 10 5 s 1 1 6 10 6 s 1 1 9 10 6 s 1 3 8 10 4 s 1 and 8 8 10 5 s 1 respectively therefore clo played a more important role in degrading diverse fluorescent components of wastewater in the uv chlorine process after uv photolysis and chlorination alone uva254 decreased by 9 and 25 respectively whereas it decreased by 62 after the uv chlorine treatment uva254 represents the aromaticity and or hydrophobicity of dom hwang et al 2002 reactive species could be responsible for the significant decrease in uva254 in the uv chlorine process in the uv h2o2 process uva254 only decreased by 18 fig s2 which was consistent with the results of a previous study in which a much higher decrease in the uva254 of wastewater was observed after uv chlorine treatment than after uv h2o2 treatment miklos et al 2019 chlorination and rcs were likely the causes of the higher efficiency in decreasing the aromaticity 3 1 2 dbp formation in uv chlorine treated wastewater fig 2 shows the dbp formation during 20 min treatments by uv chlorination and uv chlorine and 24 h post chlorination compared to chlorination alone the 20 min uv chlorine treatment significantly promoted the formation of detected dbps by 90 508 p 0 05 rcs is more reactive towards organic compounds than chlorine guo et al 2017 resulting in more reaction sites cl can directly form chlorinated transformation products via radical addition lei et al 2019 bulman and remucal 2020 which could explain the enhanced dbp formation during the uv chlorine treatment during 24 h post chlorination after the 20 min uv chlorine treatment the regulated dbps of thms and haas increased slightly by 11 relative to those obtained by chlorination alone p 0 05 whereas the formation of unregulated dbps such as ch hans tcnm and hacams increased significantly by 77 274 p 0 05 in addition uv photolysis of the wastewater increased the formation of ch tcnm and hacams by 38 67 and 43 respectively p 0 05 after 24 h post chlorination the involvement of ho and rcs can alter the properties of organic matter producing more intermediates that readily react with chlorine to form more dbps in post chlorination wang et al 2015 gao et al 2020 cl can react with organic substances via hydrogen abstraction electron transfer and addition whereas the reaction mechanisms of clo and cl2 are mainly electron transfer alfassi et al 1988 lei et al 2019 thus rcs accelerated the formation of chlorinated products and dbps bulman and remucal 2020 meanwhile ho and rcs could activate some precursors in wastewater which readily reacted with chlorine in post chlorination ho increased the formation of aldehydes from organic substances xie et al 2015 providing ch precursors during post chlorination on the other hand the reduced aromaticity could decrease the formation potential of thms and haas lamsal et al 2011 doc decreased by 15 during the uv chlorine treatment primarily via radical oxidation fig s3 resulting in the decrease of some dbp precursors therefore the formation of thms and haas increased modestly after the uv chlorine treatment compared with chlorination alone in terms of n dbps the uv chlorine treatment accelerated the formation of hans in a short period wang et al 2015 the base hydrolysis of hans can increase the formation of hacams reckhow et al 2001 both ho and rcs can transform the amine moieties of organic compounds into nitro moieties deng et al 2014 hua et al 2019b leading to increased tcnm formation the formation of n dbps in post chlorination after the uv chlorine treatment was 77 101 higher than that after the uv h2o2 treatment fig s4 indicating that rcs enhanced the formation of n dbps much more than ho a previous study reported that ho can decrease the formation of n dbps in post chlorination after the uv h2o2 treatment of filtered drinking water chu et al 2015 therefore the enhancement in n dbp formation after the uv chlorine treatment could be attributed to rcs in addition the uv photolysis of inorganic precursors e g nitrite and nitrate can result in the formation of rns eqs 1 and 2 lyon et al 2012 which might have contributed to the increased formation of some n dbps in post chlorination 1 n o 3 hv n o 2 o 2 n o 2 hv n o o 3 1 3 toxicity alteration in uv chlorine treated wastewater fig 3 shows the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the dbps during the 20 min uv chlorine treatment and 24 h post chlorination cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the dbps are the chronic toxicity that inhibits cell growth and the acute toxicity that damages genomic dna respectively wagner and plewa 2017 the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the dbps in the uv chlorine process were 2 2 and 2 8 times respectively those after chlorination alone of these haas hans and hacams contributed to over 90 of the calculated cytotoxicity of both chlorination and the uv chlorine treatment haas contributed more than 65 of the highest genotoxicity primarily due to the high genotoxicity of mbaa during 24 h post chlorination the calculated dbp cytotoxicity and genotoxicity after the uv chlorine treatment were 79 and 50 respectively higher than those after chlorination alone due to the increased formation of haas hans and hacams fig 4 shows the changes in the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of organic extracts in the wastewater after 20 min chlorination uv photolysis and uv chlorine treatments the acute toxicity and genotoxicity are comprehensive assessments of toxic organic compounds other than dbps the equivalent acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri and genotoxicity of untreated wastewater determined by the umu test were 0 75 mg 3 5 dcp l and 1 54 µg 4 nqo l chlorination alone and uv photolysis of the wastewater slightly increased the acute toxicity by 12 and 9 respectively whereas the uv chlorine treatment decreased the acute toxicity by 19 the genotoxicity decreased by 30 39 and 76 after 20 min chlorination uv and uv chlorine treatments respectively p 0 05 toxicity alteration in wastewater depends on the degradation of existing toxic substances during the treatment and the formation of new toxic transformation products the transformation products formed during chlorination exhibited higher acute toxicity leading to an increase in the acute toxicity of the wastewater the acute toxicity was lower after the uv chlorine treatment of trimethoprim than after chlorination because ho and rcs decreased the acute toxicity wu et al 2016 rcs not only formed toxic chlorinated products but also tended to reduce the acute toxicity when degrading target pollutants shu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 chlorination and uv photolysis can eliminate some genotoxic materials in wastewater wu et al 2012 huang et al 2019 ho and rcs further eliminated genotoxic materials in the wastewater during the uv chlorine treatment co3 could also decrease the genotoxicity of some organic compounds zhou et al 2020 hence the uv chlorine treatment efficiently degraded diverse organic compounds and simultaneously decreased the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the wastewater 3 2 effects of ammonia on efom characterization dbp formation and toxicity alteration in uv chlorine treated wastewater the initial ammonia concentration of the wastewater was 0 04 mgn l 3 µm additional 200 µm ammonia was added in the wastewater firstly before spiking free chlorine to simulate the wastewater with high concentration ammonia the addition of 200 µm ammonia to the wastewater significantly decreased the removal efficiencies of fluorescent components and uva254 by 37 43 and 26 respectively p 0 05 in the uv chlorine process fig 1 the additional 200 µm ammonia completely converted chlorine into monochloramine when the chlorine dosage was 200 µm which could mimic the application of a uv chlorine treatment to wastewater with high ammonia levels or uv monochloramine treatment monochloramine is a weak oxidant with a much lower degradation efficiency of organic compounds than free chlorine according to the kinetic model the steady state concentrations of ho cl and cl2 increased by 14 2 6 times and 2 7 times respectively whereas that of clo decreased by 87 during uv chlorine treatment of wastewater with 200 µm ammonia table 2 clo was primarily generated from the reaction of free chlorine hocl ocl with ho and cl the conversion of free chlorine to monochloramine led to the significant decrease of clo as previously mentioned of the radicals in the uv chlorine process clo was responsible for the degradation of efom the conversion of free chlorine to chloramine led to decreases in clo and the removal efficiencies of fluorescent components and aromaticity the formation of all the dbps decreased considerably by 64 97 during 20 min uv chlorine treatment of wastewater with 200 µm ammonia fig 2 during the 24 h post treatment the formation of c dbps hans and hacams decreased by 88 98 66 and 43 respectively whereas that of tcnm increased by 11 p 0 05 monochloramine had a lower reactivity towards efom to form c dbps the photolysis of monochloramine can generate reactive nitrate species rns such as no and no2 according to eqs 3 5 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019 also nitrite is the inorganic product of chloramine photolysis de laat et al 2010 and can consume ho and cl to form no2 bu et al 2020 the formation of rns is likely to yield nitrogenous by products especially nitro products which can act as tcnm precursors hence the tcnm formation potential increased when ammonia was added to the uv chlorine treatment 3 n h 2 o 2 n h 2 o 2 4 n h 2 o 2 n o h 2 o 5 2 n o o 2 2 n o 2 during the uv chlorine treatment and 24 h post chlorination with additional ammonia the calculated dbp cytotoxicity decreased substantially by 90 and 78 respectively whereas the calculated dbp genotoxicity decreased by 92 and 73 respectively fig 3 hans and hacams accounted for more than 85 of the cytotoxicity during the uv chlorine treatment of wastewater with additional ammonia whereas haas and tcnm were responsible for more than 82 of the genotoxicity the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the wastewater decreased to 0 41 mg 3 5 dcp l and 0 58 µg 4 nqo l respectively after the uv chlorine treatment with additional ammonia fig 4 the acute toxicity of wastewater spiked with 200 µm ammonia was 32 lower than that of unspiked wastewater after the uv chlorine treatment but the genotoxicity was 58 higher p 0 05 chloramination alone decreased the acute toxicity of the wastewater whereas chlorination increased it the decrease in clo led to a reduced removal efficiency of genotoxic materials meanwhile nitrosated and nitrated products which are expected to be more genotoxic chen et al 2020 could form in the uv monochloramine process wu et al 2019 3 3 effects of bromide on efom characterization dbp formation and toxicity alteration in uv chlorine treated wastewater the initial bromide concentration in the wastewater was 40 µg l 0 5 µm the degradation of different fluorescent components and the reduction in uva254 were slightly different for the uv chlorine processes without and with additional 1 mg l 12 5 µm bromide fig 1 with the additional 1 mg l bromide the concentration of ho increased slightly by 18 whereas the concentrations of rcs decreased by 8 24 table 2 on the other hand the concentrations of br br2 and brcl increased by 1 3 orders of magnitude to 7 28 10 14 m 1 56 10 12 m and 2 86 10 13 m respectively in the uv chlorine process reactive bromine species rbs can attack organic compounds via electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction with rate constants in the range of 105 1010 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2020 nist 2020 therefore the degradation rates of diverse components barely changed in the uv chlorine process with additional bromide compared with the uv chlorine treatment without bromide addition the uv chlorine process with 1 mg l bromide resulted in an increase in the formation of thms by 86 but decreases in the haas by 24 hans by 31 and hacams by 27 fig 2 p 0 05 additional bromide led to an increases of 122 and 36 in the formation of thms and hans respectively relative to the results obtained for post chlorination preceded by the uv chlorine treatment whereas the formation of haas and hacams decreased by 24 and 14 respectively the formation of bromine and rbs in the uv chlorine process significantly increased the formation of brominated dbps bromine tends to react with organic matter by substitution but chlorine tends to cleave carbon bonds westerhoff et al 2004 bromine preferred to react with humic acid c1 and fulvic acid c2 which were reported to play a greater role in the formation of thms than chlorine richardson et al 2003 the presence of bromide in the uv chlorine process can further produce organic matter with lower mws zhao et al 2011 providing more precursors of thms bromine reacted with dom via electrophilic substitution by lower than 40 to form brominated dbps while the remaining reaction occurred via electron transfer to form bromide langsa et al 2017 the released bromide was recycled by chlorine to form bromine resulting in further electrophilic substitution to generate more brominated dbps compared with the 20 min chlorination with additional bromide the uv chlorine treatment led to a significant increase in the formation of bromo dbps and bromochloro dbps the degree of bromination is often indicated by the bromine incorporation factor bif which is defined as follows 6 bif thms n 1 3 n chcl 3 n br n total thms 7 bif haas n 1 3 m 1 4 n n c 2 h m o 2 cl 4 m n br n total haas 8 bif hans n 1 2 n c 2 hncl 2 n br n total hans 9 bif hacams n 1 2 n c 2 h 3 nocl 2 n br n c 2 h 2 nocl 2 br total hacams the bifs of the thms haas hans and hacams during the 20 min chlorination treatment with additional bromide were 61 48 45 and 48 respectively whereas they increased to 62 59 47 and 76 respectively during the uv chlorine treatment with additional bromide the additional bromide significantly increased the calculated dbp cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by 2 6 times during the 20 min uv chlorine treatment and subsequent 24 h chlorination the brominated dbps exhibited much higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity to cho cells than the chlorinated dbps wagner and plewa 2017 with the additional bromide the acute toxicity of the wastewater decreased to 0 56 mg 3 5 dcp l which was 7 lower than that during the uv chlorine treatment without additional bromide p 0 05 the genotoxicity of the wastewater decreased to less than the limit of detection p 0 05 the genotoxicity of wastewater is responsible for some genotoxic materials that exist in wastewater such as ofloxacin wu et al 2010 the removal efficiency of genotoxic materials was higher during chlorination with bromide than during chlorination without bromide as determined by umu tests wu et al 2010 rbs could further decrease the genotoxic materials despite the increase in brominated dbps the presence of bromide during the uv chlorine treatment efficiently eliminated toxic organic fractions from the wastewater 4 conclusions and engineering implications this study investigated dbp formation and toxicity alteration in wastewater after uv chlorine treatment and examined the effects of ammonia and bromide rcs accelerated the degradation of components in the wastewater but dbp formation increased during the uv chlorine treatment however compared with chlorination alone the uv chlorine treatment reduced the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of organic matter in the wastewater the addition of 200 µm ammonia decreased the concentration of clo but increased the concentrations of ho cl and cl2 in the uv chlorine process which decreased the removal efficiency of organic substances from the wastewater however compared with the uv chlorine treatment without ammonia the addition of ammonia slightly decreased the acute toxicity and increased the genotoxicity of the wastewater the high concentration of ammonia increased the formation of tcnm in post chlorination after the uv chlorine treatment an additional 1 mg l bromide in the uv chlorine process led to the formation of bromine and rbs which considerably increased the formation of brominated dbps and the corresponding cytotoxicity and genotoxicity however the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the wastewater were further decreased compared with the traditional uv h2o2 treatment the uv chlorine treatment exhibited a better performance in terms of the removal efficiency of organic components from the wastewater the formation of thms in post chlorination after the uv chlorine treatment was 18 lower than that after the uv h2o2 treatment whereas the formation of n dbps was 77 101 higher after the uv chlorine treatment fig s4 ammonia and bromide are common ions in wastewater that affect the chlorine and radical chemistry in the uv chlorine process and thus dbp and toxicity alteration the trends in dbp formation and the calculated dbp cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were not consistent with those in the acute toxicity and mutability more toxicity bioassays should be conducted to further evaluate the effects of the uv chlorine treatment on wastewater quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17466,two methods were examined to improve methane production efficiency in anaerobic digestion ad based on adding a large amount of surface area using a single electrically conductive carbon brush or by adding electrodes as done in microbial electrolysis cells mecs to form a hybrid ad mec to examine the impact of surface area relative to electrodes ad reactors were fitted with a single large brush without electrodes fb half a large brush with two electrodes with an applied voltage 0 8 v and operated in closed circuit hb cc or open circuit hb oc mode or only two electrodes with a closed circuit and no large brush nb cc equivalent to an mec the three configurations with a half or full brush all had improved performance as shown by 57 82 higher methane generation rate parameters in the gompertz model compared to nb cc the retained biomass was much higher in the reactors with large brush which likely contributed to the rapid consumption of volatile fatty acids vfas and therefore improved ad performance a different microbial community structure was formed in the large size brushes compared to the electrodes methanothrix was predominant in the biofilm of large size carbon brush while geobacter anode and methanobacterium cathode were highly abundant in the electrode biofilms these results demonstrate that adding a high surface area carbon fiber brush will be a more effective method of improving ad performance than using mec electrodes with an applied voltage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion carbon brush microbial community structure microbial electrolysis cell surface area 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is an efficient method to degrade organic matter in wastewaters and produce methane but the process can require long hydraulic retention times for stable performance the syntrophic relationship between fatty acid degrading bacteria and methanogens is often considered as the rate limiting step for soluble organic acid conversion to methane baek et al 2018 therefore methane generation rates can be improved by reducing the background concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfas produced from fermentation inserting electrodes like those used in a microbial electrolysis cell mec into ad i e ad mec and applying a voltage to generate an electrical current and hydrogen gas has been proposed to improve overall ad performance vu et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 ad mec systems use exoelectrogenic bacteria on the anode to oxidize organic matter and reduce vfa concentrations and the cathode can improve methane production either through electromethanogenesis 8h 8e co2 ch4 2h2o or by providing h2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 4h2 co2 ch4 2h2o cheng et al 2009 yu et al 2018 ad mec systems have therefore been shown to increase methane production and organic removal efficiencies feng et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 the main function of the electrodes in an ad mec has not been clearly distinguished between improvements due to additional surface area for biomass retention and benefits of electrochemical processes that can remove additional organics and produce hydrogen gas the operation of homogenized and continuously fed ad reactors is dependent on the retention of biomass especially methanogens choong et al 2018 adding supporting media with a high surface area into reactors has therefore been used to ensure a high biomass concentration show and tay 1999 most of the materials used for bioelectrodes in ad mecs provide a relatively high surface area compared to controls without electrodes carbon felt or carbon cloth materials have porous structures which could benefit ad performance by retaining biomass and preventing washout in addition to stimulating electrochemical reactions despite of the importance of this surface area effect the electrode packing density i e electrode surface area to reactor volume ratio has not been well documented or specifically examined in ad mec studies electrode packing densities have varied over a wide range in ad mec studies from 0 7 to 15 1 m2 m3 of reactor volume which could have impacted ad performance even without current production baek et al 2020 cai et al 2016 de vrieze et al 2014 feng et al 2015 liu et al 2016 vu et al 2020 low electrode packing densities 1 m2 m3 would not be expected to impact methane production rates by more than a small amount 0 6 1 2 due to a small percentage of the substrate being used for current generation relative to that for overall methane production baek et al 2020 feng et al 2015 however ad mec systems with a relatively small amount of current through the circuit have shown to achieve higher or more stable ad performance than conventional ad systems baek et al 2020 in addition to increasing surface area available for microorganisms the use of electrically conductive materials can also provide a beneficial platform for direct interspecies electron transfer diet between electroactive bacteria and methanogens even in the absence of current generation baek et al 2015 cruz viggi et al 2014 li et al 2015 through diet the electrons from organic oxidation can be transferred directly toward methanogens without redox intermediate i e hydrogen which could make the ad process more efficient and contribute to enhanced methane generation rates baek et al 2018 in this study we investigated the impact of surface area relative to current generation using electrodes by adding carbon fiber brushes of different sizes into ad reactors we hypothesized that the large surface area provided by the brushes was more critical to ad performance than current generation using smaller size mec electrodes carbon brushes were chosen for these tests because they provide a very high surface area to volume ratio and the open brush structure has advantages of less potential for clogging compared to other carbon based woven materials e g pieces of carbon felt or carbon cloth logan et al 2007 in addition the potential for diet is enhanced by using carbon brushes due to their high electrical conductivity 650 s cm for brushes used here this strategy to add brushes into ad provide additional advantages compared to adding particles to stimulate diet e g magnetite carbon nanotube activated carbon baek et al 2015 li et al 2015 liu et al 2012 because there is no possibility of material washout using the brushes compared to particles the impact of large carbon brushes on methane generation rates and cod removal rates was examined by adding brushes that filled or half filled the reactor volume compared to reactors with two smaller size brush electrodes in the presence and absence of current production the amount of attached biofilm to these different brushes was quantified in terms of protein with the contribution of current generation evaluated in terms of coulombic efficiency and total internal resistances based on the electrode potential slope eps method cario et al 2019 to obtain a more comprehensive insight into process performance the microbial communities on the brushes and in suspension were characterized using illumina sequencing of both active 16s rrna and total 16s rrna gene microbial populations 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and substrate sludge was collected from the anaerobic digester at the pennsylvania state university wastewater treatment plant and used as the inoculum the sludge was sieved using a screen mesh size of 850 μm to remove large particles that lead to clogging of the sampling port and obtain a homogenous inoculum and then stored at 4 c before utilization as an inoculum the sludge was held for 24 h at 35 c to activate microorganisms and decrease concentrations of easily degraded biodegradable organic matter the sludge composition was total chemical oxygen demand tcod of 22 500 500 mg l soluble cod scod of 540 30 mg l total suspended solids tss of 19 000 700 mg l and a volatile suspended solid vss of 14 800 400 mg l a synthetic substrate used for ad tests was prepared with glucose as the sole carbon source 2 5 g l in 100 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs containing 4 9 g l nah2po4 h2o 9 2 g l na2hpo4 0 6 g l nh4cl 0 3 g l kcl mineral 12 5 ml l and vitamin 5 ml l solutions ph 7 1 conductivity 12 1 ms cm cheng et al 2009 the concentration of pbs solution was changed from 50 to 100 mm from the third batch cycle since a low ph 6 6 6 7 was measured at the end of the second batch cycle 2 2 preparation of brushes and reactor configurations two large brushes were used to provide high surface areas for microbial growth and two smaller brushes were used as electrodes for the four different reactor conditions fig 1 the full size brush 6 cm long and 4 cm in diameter half size brush 3 cm long and 4 cm in diameter and small size anode brush 1 cm long and 1 5 cm in diameter were made from carbon fibers wound into two twisted titanium wires mill rose the bristles for the carbon brushes were 0 00072 mm in diameter and had an electrical conductivity of 650 s cm zoltek com products px35 the carbon brushes were heat treated at 450 c for 30 min before use stainless steel ss brushes used for the cathodes had the same length and diameter as the anodes but the bristles were 0 005 cm in diameter the ad reactors duplicates for each test condition were glass bottles filled with 270 ml of liquid and they had 60 or 80 ml of headspace two different bottle types the bottles were sealed with a rubber stopper held on with a screw cap ad reactors were tested with four different configurations a full size brush with no electrodes fb a half size brush to provide a high surface area along with two electrodes either with an applied voltage of 0 8 v hb cc or with an open circuit hb oc or only the electrodes and no large brush operated with an applied voltage of 0 8 v to simulate ad with mec nb cc fig 1 the fb reactor was used to show the maximum possible impact of conductive surface area on ad performance while the nb cc condition represented ad mecs with low electrode packing density as used in several previous studies baek et al 2020 feng et al 2015 the hb cc configuration was examined as a possible method to improve ad using both approaches i e current generation and adding a large surface area hb oc configuration was used as a control to provide same surface area as hb cc but remove the impact of current generation on performance to prevent short circuiting in the reactors with the half brush between the brush and electrodes a piece of insulative rubber was installed at the bottom of the electrodes by piercing the titanium tip into the rubber fig 1c the tip was sealed by epoxy treatment to make it be electrically insulated the surface area of brushes was calculated for all reactor configurations based on the bristle geometry of each carbon and ss brushes table 1 the cylindrical area was calculated as ac 2πr r h v where h is the height and r is the radius of the brush and v is the liquid volume the specific bristle area for carbon brushes was calculated as as 2πrbn rb r v where rb is the radius of bristle 0 00036 cm and n is the total number of bristles 400 000 bristles per inch the specific bristle area for ss brush was estimated as as 2m rbρv where m is the total mass of the bristles and ρ is the density of the ss fiber 2 3 repeated batch operation for the first cycle a glucose medium with 20 v v of inoculum was used producing a final glucose concentration of 2 5 g l the reactors were operated under fed batch mode by replacing 50 of the liquid with fresh medium at the end of each cycle before starting each batch cycle the reactor liquid was sparged with pure nitrogen gas for 3 min the duration of the cycle was defined based on the end of gas production or a low electrical current from all reactors a fixed external voltage of 0 8 v between two electrodes was applied to the nb cc and hb cc reactors using a potentiostat vmp3 biologic knoxville tn consistent with applied voltages used in previous tests to enhance ad efficiency ding et al 2016 vu et al 2020 the fb reactor did not contain electrodes and the hb oc reactors were operated under open circuit conditions biogas was collected by gas collection bag cali 5 bond calibrated instruments ny and liquid samples were collected from the middle of the reactors through sampling ports all ad reactors were operated in duplicate and in a temperature controlled room at 35 c the current was recorded at 10 min intervals using a potentiostat vmp3 biologic knoxville tn 2 4 protein assay the attached and suspended biomass were quantified based on total protein concentration using a bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay kit sigma aldrich following previously described procedures bond and lovley 2003 ishii et al 2008 rossi et al 2018 for the extraction of the attached biomass the pieces of brushes were cut with sterile scissors and placed in a petri dish with 5 ml small brushes or 10 ml large brushes of 0 2 n naoh the 1 h extraction was performed by withdrawing and re adding the naoh solution several times over the surface of brushes 15 min of intervals using a pipette to improve protein extraction the resulting solution was removed and weighed an equal amount of deionized water was used for further rinsing the brushes to collect any remaining solution the liquids were pooled together yielding a sample containing 0 1 n naoh for suspended biomass 10 ml of mixed liquor was centrifuged 13 000 g 3 min the suspension was discarded and pellet was re suspended in 0 1 n naoh the pretreated samples both attached and suspended biomass were frozen 20 c followed by thawing at 100 c for 10 min and this freeze thaw cycle was repeated three times then the sample was centrifuged 13 000 g 3 min to remove any cell debris the protein concentration was quantified by the bca method against a bovine serum albumin standard bond and lovley 2003 the measured protein was normalized by the weight of used brushes for attached biomass or the volume of used suspension for suspended biomass total protein in each reactor was presented by multiplying by total weight of brushes or total working volume of the reactor 2 5 nucleic acid extraction library preparation amplicon sequencing bioinformatics processing and statistical analysis the attached

prepared by using a syringe filter with 0 45 μm of pore size the total and suspended solid concentrations were measured according to a standard method association et al 1920 all chemical analyses were performed in duplicate the coulombic efficiency ce was calculated as ce ct cc where ct is the total coulombs calculated by integrating the current over time and cc is the total charge consumed based on the scod removal the contribution of current generation to methane production was estimated by the ratio of the theoretical methane production from current to total methane production as rth tot we wch4 where we is the electrical energy input and wch4 is the energy content of the methane produced the methane generation rate over time was fitted using the gompertz equation to interpret the experimental results and directly compare each parameter among the different reactor configurations baek et al 2015 m t p e x p e x p r m e p λ t 1 where m t is the accumulated methane production at

polarization data obtained by applying voltage step by step with an interval as done in a previous study cario et al 2019 or by using linear sweep voltammetry kang et al 2017 nam et al 2017 here the polarization data were obtained by reducing the applied voltage from 0 8 v to 0 2 v at 0 1 v intervals with 20 min at each applied voltage current was recorded at 1 min intervals with the last five minutes averaged and used for polarization curve the electrode potential slope eps method was used to obtain the total internal resistance of the hb cc and nb cc for the eps method the whole cell potentials were plotted with the potential on the y axis and the current density on the x axis the linear portion was fitted by e mi b where i is the current density a m3 the slope m is defined as the total internal resistance mω m3 and the y intercept was open circuit potential of the cells 3 results discussion 3 1 methane production and cod removal after successful biofilm acclimation cycles fig s1 the reactors with the high surface area brushes produced methane faster than the reactor containing only the mec electrodes nb cc fig 2 a methane production during the third batch cycle showed the lowest accumulated volume for the nb cc reactor 208 24 ml and the highest gas volume for the fb reactor 249 2 ml the three configurations with the full or half brushes all showed similar overall trends in gas production with similar final methane volumes 235 249 ml despite of the presence of the electrodes in the nb cc reactors gas production was much less by the end of the cycle than that of the other reactors there was negligible h2 production 0 2 in biogas in all cycles and for all days except day 1 where acidogenesis mainly occurred in all reactors the performance of the different reactors in terms of methane production was consistent with parameters fitted to the modified gompertz model table 2 with all results having r2 0 99 the three reactors with full or half brushes fb hb cc and hb oc reactors had 3 7 9 0 higher values of the maximum methane potential p and 57 82 higher values in the maximum methane production rate parameter rm compared to the nb cc reactor these higher rates with the large brush area indicated that the presence of the brush was more critical for methane production than electrodes in the ad reactors the methane production estimated from the p values from the model agreed with the experimental data indicating that the incubation period of the third cycle i e 8 days was enough to observe the difference in ad efficiency among the reactors the estimated lag phase λ was similar and low for all reactors 0 31 0 43 days indicating the microbial community was well acclimated for the fed batch cycles the scod removals were consistent with methane production showing slower removal rates in the nb cc bottles compared to the other reactors fig 2b the final scod removal at the end of the cycle was above 93 for the three reactors with the large brushes 93 3 fb 93 3 hb cc and 94 2 hb oc compared to 86 3 for the nb cc reactors 3 2 vfa production and removal total vfa concentrations were always lower in the ad reactors with the large brushes compared to the electrode only nb cc reactors fig 3 acetate propionate and butyrate were the dominant acidogenic products from glucose fermentation consistent with previous reports lu et al 2020 qin et al 2020 after the total vfa concentrations reached a maximum on day 2 with slight drop in ph from 6 9 to 6 4 fig s2 more rapid conversion of butyrate to acetate was observed during days 2 4 in fb hb cc and hb oc while butyrate remained on days 4 and 6 in nb cc reactors in addition the propionate degradation rate was much slower in nb cc resulting in 175 mg as cod l of propionate at the end of the cycle the lower propionate accumulation in the reactors with large carbon brushes could have been due to enhanced syntrophic propionate oxidation by diet stimulated by the presence of the electrically conductive surface area baek et al 2018 cruz viggi et al 2014 having a carbon brush with large surface therefore could have improved ad because anaerobic propionate oxidation is a highly endergonic reaction δgo 76 1 kj mol this speculation is supported by previous reports which observed diet in both pure and mixed culture systems when electrically conductive carbon based woven materials were added chen et al 2014 dang et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 3 3 current production and its impact on performance the reactors with the electrodes and no brush nb cc showed better electrochemical performance than the hb cc reactors with the large half sized brush in terms of current density and ce values despite identical electrode configurations fig 4 a polarization data for the two reactors was similar resulting in comparable slopes using the eps method cario et al 2019 the internal resistances of the two types of reactors calculated from the slopes were not appreciably different based on the overlap of the standard error of the slopes at lower current densities and applied voltages 96 6 for hb cc reactor and 93 6 mω m3 for nb cc reactor fig 4b however for applied voltages above 0 5 v for the hb cc reactors and 0 7 v for nb cc reactors there was no increase in current density cario et al 2019 at an applied voltage of 0 8 v i e a set potential in this experiment a 2 7 fold higher current was produced in nb cc than hb cc which explained their different performance and current densities in the constant applied voltage tests the lower electrochemical performance for the hb cc reactor was due to the presence of the large half sized brush as this was the only difference between the hb cc and nb cc reactors the presence of the half sized brush resulted in a more rapid consumption of vfas that are used for current generation which could have explained the lower current density in the hb cc reactors there was no appreciable difference in performance for the reactors with the half brush operated in either open circuit hb oc or with current generation hb cc due to an applied voltage indicating that current production did not measurably influence overall ad rates figs 2 and 3 in addition current production alone for the nb cc reactor resulted in reduced overall performance compared to the other reactors analysis of the fraction of the substrate removed on the basis of the coulombic efficiencies showed that the closed circuit reactors had 7 of the substrate used by the anode bacteria with ce values of 3 4 hb cc and 6 9 nb cc thus there was a negligible impact of current generation on performance the lack of an impact of current production on methane generation or cod removal rates was likely due to the small electrode packing density 6 1 m2 m3 as cylindrical area and 200 m2 m3 as specific bristle area higher electrode brush densities 63 0 m2 m3 as cylindrical area produced a higher maximum current density 31 9 a m3 with same substrate type of medium glucose at 2 5 g l vu et al 2020 than those obtained in this study 2 7 a m3 for hb cc and 4 9 a m3 for nb cc however asshown by using a large brush in our studies the rates would be improved just due to the large surface area of the brush even in the absence of current production 3 4 biomass on brushes protein was measured on the brushes and in the mixed liquor of each reactor to compare biomass retention among the reactors fig 5 the biomass measured for the half 120 121 mg and full size 118 mg brushes were similar and much higher than those on the small size brushes 1 15 mg or in the mixed liquor 6 57 mg the amount of protein was 3 1 9 5 fold higher in the mixed liquor of nb cc than other reactors presumably owing to the less surface area for the attached growth the differences in suspended biomass concentrations among the reactors also could be visually observed based on less turbidity of solution for the reactors with large brushes than that of the nb cc reactors without the large brushes fig s3 the sum of protein was much higher in hb oc 136 5 mg hb cc 135 1 mg and fb 133 1 mg configurations compared to nb cc 37 2 mg suggesting the biomass retention by the large surface area brushes was the crucial factor in ad performance of the reactors with the different configurations the lack of a difference in total protein amount among fb hb cc and hb oc reactors suggests that the differences in brush shapes and materials could have impacted overall biomass retention on the brushes although the fb configuration provided twice as much surface area than hb reactors hb cc or hb oc the portion of active surface area which was favorable for microbial attachment might have not been much larger due to the inaccessibility of the inner parts of the brushes similar protein amounts among these three reactors did seem to be in good agreement with the similar ad efficiencies of these three configurations fig 2 3 5 spatial distribution of the microbial community the biomass samples taken from different locations biofilms on brushes and the solutions were analyzed for both 16s rrna gene and 16s rrna to compare the total and active microbial community among the four reactors a total of 584 971 rrna gene library and 678 884 rrna library non chimeric quality filtered reads were obtained and they were clustered into 906 otus at 97 identity the most abundant 20 otus in each sample were presented in a heatmap with their relative abundance and taxonomic classification at the genus and phylum level fig 6 the dominant methanogen family varied depending on the location of the biomass sampling based on 16s rrna gene sequencing the relative abundance of methanobacteriaceae was much higher on the cathodes of the hb cc 40 and nb cc 36 reactors compared to the others 1 9 fig 7 a and most of them were assigned to the genus methanobacterium fig 6a although the relative abundance of this group decreased in 16s rrna sequencing fig 6b methanobacteriaceae was still the most predominant methanogenic family on the cathodes of the hb cc and nb cc reactors fig 7b this finding is consistent with previous studies on biocathodes of mecs or electromethanogenesis cells where the relative abundance of methanobacterium was the highest among methanogens and they were mainly responsible for ch4 production in h2 or electrons accepting conditions baek et al 2017 siegert et al 2015 zhen et al 2016 methanotrichaceae was the predominant methanogen family on brushes which did not function as electrodes i e small size brushes in hb oc and half or full size carbon brushes most of these methanogens were assigned to the genus methanothrix fig 6a whose members are acetoclastic methanogens although recently they were found to be capable of participating in diet by converting co2 to ch4 directly rotaru et al 2014b given that their relative abundance was much higher in the 16s rrna library members of methanothrix may have substantially contributed to the metabolic activity of methane production in brushes that did not function as electrodes although we did not conclusively show diet here on the graphite fiber brushes previous reports on diet between methanothrix and vfa degrading partners has been shown by others using other electrically conductive materials liu et al 2020a xu et al 2020 methanomicrobiaceae showed extremely low relative abundance 0 04 in 16s rrna gene libraries while it increased significantly 1 17 in 16s rrna libraries for these brushes fig 7 their abundance was higher in solutions consistent with a previous ad study which found that methanomicrobiaceae were more abundant in solutions than biofilms on carbon cloth or biochar de vrieze et al 2016 among the 41 known phyla classified from bacterial 16s rrna gene and 16s rrna sequences firmicutes bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were dominant in all samples although their relative abundance varied fig 8 for example proteobacteria showed 3 1 6 2 fold higher relative abundance on the anodes than cathodes in both 16s rrna gene and 16s rrna libraries of the hb cc and nb cc reactors however there was negligible difference in the relative abundance of proteobacteria between the small size carbon brush and ss brush in the hb oc reactor despite having the same reactor configuration as the hb cc reactor this suggests that the electron producing or accepting mechanism around the electrode developed a substantially different bacterial community from the community that developed on the brushes in the absence of current chloroflexi showed a higher relative abundance on the large carbon brush 7 7 8 5 in 16s rrna gene and 4 9 6 2 in 16s rrna libraries with much lower abundances in the other samples this is consistent with their reported role in diet showing their dominance on conductive materials added into ad reactors baek et al 2020 feng et al 2018 at the otu level otu 2 which belonged to alistipes was highly abundant in all mixed liquor samples 27 in the 16s rrna gene library fig 6 although alistipes has been reported in several ad reactors liu et al 2020b sposob et al 2020 it might not have made only a small contribution to the overall metabolic activities because their relative abundance in the 16s rrna library was much lower some of the otus belonging to firmicutes e g otu 1 3 4 and 6 were highly abundant in most of the samples and they likely were responsible for fermentation of glucose and production of vfas feng et al 2015 lin et al 2007 the otu 10 which was classified into the genus geobacter showed higher relative abundance only in the anode samples of hb cc and nb cc with much greater abundance in 16s rrna 19 7 24 7 than in 16s rrna gene 5 8 6 2 libraries indicating they are highly active members of the anodic community the dominance of geobacter at the anode in ad mec or mec has been extensively reported due to their ability to export electrons directly to the anode yu et al 2018 syntrophomonas otu 16 known as syntrophic butyrate oxidizing bacteria was generally more abundant in the 16s rrna library for the biomass samples obtained from the large size brushes compared to the other brushes this greater abundance could partially reflect recent reports on putative diet between syntrophomonas and methanothrix in the presence of conductive materials zhao et al 2018 considering the high relative abundance of methanothrix here for the large size brushes although there has been no direct evidence of diet for syntrophomonas species their enrichment in diet stimulating condition has been frequently reported zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 there were some other dominant otus in brush biofilms without current which were affiliated with acetothermiia thermovirga victivallis and candidatus cloacamonas all classified to be fermentative bacteria fig 6 chen et al 2018 pampillón gonzález et al 2017 suarez et al 2019 zoetendal et al 2003 in contrast the microbial populations of the brushes functioning as electrodes were dominated only by several major groups possibly due to the selective pressure regarding current production figs 7 and 8 not only for the fermentative bacteria whole microbial communities were generally less diverse in electrode biofilms this was shown by the two alpha diversity indices the shannon index which gives more weight to abundant otus and the chao1 index which considers rare otus ragab et al 2019 both indices were generally higher in large and small size open circuit brushes compared to the electrode samples fig s4 suggesting that more diverse functional microbial groups flourished due to the electrically conductive fibers in the brushes 3 6 overall analysis overall the experimental results indicated that the large surface area of carbon brush was more beneficial than current generation in terms of total biogas production and rates of organic matter degradation the enhanced performance by the ad reactors with the half or full sized brushes fb hb cc and hb oc reactors was likely due to at least two reasons first the half or full size brush provided a large supporting medium due to the higher surface area than that of the smaller brush electrodes for attached biomass in comparison to a suspended growth system attached growth is known to sustain more biomass inside the reactors and thus to provide greater biological stability and efficiency of cod removal rajeshwari et al 2000 second the carbon brushes used in this study were electrically conductive 650 s cm zoltek com products px35 so the brush fibers could have promoted diet between electroactive vfa degrading bacteria and methanogens consistent with previous reports using electrically conductive materials rotaru et al 2014a rotaru et al 2014b several other studies have also shown enhanced ad efficiency by diet stimulation by adding conductive carbon based materials chen et al 2014 dang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 the addition of conductive materials improved for example methane production and the degradation rate of acetate kato et al 2012 propionate jing et al 2017 and butyrate li et al 2015 in mixed culture ad process which were the major vfas in the present study considering that half and full size carbon brushes can provide very large conductive surface areas for microorganisms to be attached both beneficial effects i e large area for attached growth and increased diet might be achieved in the reactors with relatively large brushes based on chemical and microbial community results a potential schematic was presented to describe the major microbial activity occurring in each biofilm on the brush fig 9 the presence of large carbon brush was the main factor in improving ad performance with methanothrix dominant methanogen in carbon brush possibly responsible for the improved performance the more critical impact of surface area than current generation observed here suggests that the role of bioelectrodes in ad mec systems should be reconsidered in terms of their impact in some ad mec studies the contribution of current to overall methane production i e rth tot values was quite low for example 0 6 feng et al 2015 and 1 2 baek et al 2020 the rth tot values here were 2 9 hb cc and 7 7 nb cc which was larger than in these previous studies but apparently still too low to produce differences in methane production efficiency among reactors with electrodes the common factor in the reactor configuration for these three studies baek et al 2020 feng et al 2015 and this study was a low electrode packing density 0 6 0 7 m2 m3 based on the cathode projected area to reactor volume this indicated that current generation was not the only factor to enhance methane productivity or the stability of ad operation in previous studies rather than current high biomass concentration on the large electrode surface with less washout effect could make a major contribution to methane production consistent with this observation was the fact that there was no significant difference in ad mec performance observed between closed and open circuit in the presence of electrodes in previous study de vrieze et al 2014 as an extension of our results we suggest that enhanced ad can be achieved simply by maximizing the surface area through addition of large graphite fiber brushes rather than by adding electrodes with current generation 4 conclusions the addition of a large amount of conductive surface area using carbon brush was proved to be more efficient for ad performance than current generation through electrodes fb hb cc and hb oc showed 57 82 higher methane generation rate parameters in the gompertz model compared to the nb cc as well as the enhancement in vfa removals much higher amounts of protein in the large size brushes and negligible impact of current production on the ch4 production were observed suggesting a more important role of adding large surface area than producing current methanothrix was the dominant methanogen on the large size carbon brush while geobacter anode and methanobacterium cathode were most abundant on the electrodes these results highlight that providing surface area by using electrically conductive carbon fiber brushes could be a better strategy for enhancing ad performance than using only mec

17466,two methods were examined to improve methane production efficiency in anaerobic digestion ad based on adding a large amount of surface area using a single electrically conductive carbon brush or by adding electrodes as done in microbial electrolysis cells mecs to form a hybrid ad mec to examine the impact of surface area relative to electrodes ad reactors were fitted with a single large brush without electrodes fb half a large brush with two electrodes with an applied voltage 0 8 v and operated in closed circuit hb cc or open circuit hb oc mode or only two electrodes with a closed circuit and no large brush nb cc equivalent to an mec the three configurations with a half or full brush all had improved performance as shown by 57 82 higher methane generation rate parameters in the gompertz model compared to nb cc the retained biomass was much higher in the reactors with large brush which likely contributed to the rapid consumption of volatile fatty acids vfas and therefore improved ad performance a different microbial community structure was formed in the large size brushes compared to the electrodes methanothrix was predominant in the biofilm of large size carbon brush while geobacter anode and methanobacterium cathode were highly abundant in the electrode biofilms these results demonstrate that adding a high surface area carbon fiber brush will be a more effective method of improving ad performance than using mec electrodes with an applied voltage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion carbon brush microbial community structure microbial electrolysis cell surface area 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is an efficient method to degrade organic matter in wastewaters and produce methane but the process can require long hydraulic retention times for stable performance the syntrophic relationship between fatty acid degrading bacteria and methanogens is often considered as the rate limiting step for soluble organic acid conversion to methane baek et al 2018 therefore methane generation rates can be improved by reducing the background concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfas produced from fermentation inserting electrodes like those used in a microbial electrolysis cell mec into ad i e ad mec and applying a voltage to generate an electrical current and hydrogen gas has been proposed to improve overall ad performance vu et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 ad mec systems use exoelectrogenic bacteria on the anode to oxidize organic matter and reduce vfa concentrations and the cathode can improve methane production either through electromethanogenesis 8h 8e co2 ch4 2h2o or by providing h2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 4h2 co2 ch4 2h2o cheng et al 2009 yu et al 2018 ad mec systems have therefore been shown to increase methane production and organic removal efficiencies feng et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 the main function of the electrodes in an ad mec has not been clearly distinguished between improvements due to additional surface area for biomass retention and benefits of electrochemical processes that can remove additional organics and produce hydrogen gas the operation of homogenized and continuously fed ad reactors is dependent on the retention of biomass especially methanogens choong et al 2018 adding supporting media with a high surface area into reactors has therefore been used to ensure a high biomass concentration show and tay 1999 most of the materials used for bioelectrodes in ad mecs provide a relatively high surface area compared to controls without electrodes carbon felt or carbon cloth materials have porous structures which could benefit ad performance by retaining biomass and preventing washout in addition to stimulating electrochemical reactions despite of the importance of this surface area effect the electrode packing density i e electrode surface area to reactor volume ratio has not been well documented or specifically examined in ad mec studies electrode packing densities have varied over a wide range in ad mec studies from 0 7 to 15 1 m2 m3 of reactor volume which could have impacted ad performance even without current production baek et al 2020 cai et al 2016 de vrieze et al 2014 feng et al 2015 liu et al 2016 vu et al 2020 low electrode packing densities 1 m2 m3 would not be expected to impact methane production rates by more than a small amount 0 6 1 2 due to a small percentage of the substrate being used for current generation relative to that for overall methane production baek et al 2020 feng et al 2015 however ad mec systems with a relatively small amount of current through the circuit have shown to achieve higher or more stable ad performance than conventional ad systems baek et al 2020 in addition to increasing surface area available for microorganisms the use of electrically conductive materials can also provide a beneficial platform for direct interspecies electron transfer diet between electroactive bacteria and methanogens even in the absence of current generation baek et al 2015 cruz viggi et al 2014 li et al 2015 through diet the electrons from organic oxidation can be transferred directly toward methanogens without redox intermediate i e hydrogen which could make the ad process more efficient and contribute to enhanced methane generation rates baek et al 2018 in this study we investigated the impact of surface area relative to current generation using electrodes by adding carbon fiber brushes of different sizes into ad reactors we hypothesized that the large surface area provided by the brushes was more critical to ad performance than current generation using smaller size mec electrodes carbon brushes were chosen for these tests because they provide a very high surface area to volume ratio and the open brush structure has advantages of less potential for clogging compared to other carbon based woven materials e g pieces of carbon felt or carbon cloth logan et al 2007 in addition the potential for diet is enhanced by using carbon brushes due to their high electrical conductivity 650 s cm for brushes used here this strategy to add brushes into ad provide additional advantages compared to adding particles to stimulate diet e g magnetite carbon nanotube activated carbon baek et al 2015 li et al 2015 liu et al 2012 because there is no possibility of material washout using the brushes compared to particles the impact of large carbon brushes on methane generation rates and cod removal rates was examined by adding brushes that filled or half filled the reactor volume compared to reactors with two smaller size brush electrodes in the presence and absence of current production the amount of attached biofilm to these different brushes was quantified in terms of protein with the contribution of current generation evaluated in terms of coulombic efficiency and total internal resistances based on the electrode potential slope eps method cario et al 2019 to obtain a more comprehensive insight into process performance the microbial communities on the brushes and in suspension were characterized using illumina sequencing of both active 16s rrna and total 16s rrna gene microbial populations 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and substrate sludge was collected from the anaerobic digester at the pennsylvania state university wastewater treatment plant and used as the inoculum the sludge was sieved using a screen mesh size of 850 μm to remove large particles that lead to clogging of the sampling port and obtain a homogenous inoculum and then stored at 4 c before utilization as an inoculum the sludge was held for 24 h at 35 c to activate microorganisms and decrease concentrations of easily degraded biodegradable organic matter the sludge composition was total chemical oxygen demand tcod of 22 500 500 mg l soluble cod scod of 540 30 mg l total suspended solids tss of 19 000 700 mg l and a volatile suspended solid vss of 14 800 400 mg l a synthetic substrate used for ad tests was prepared with glucose as the sole carbon source 2 5 g l in 100 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs containing 4 9 g l nah2po4 h2o 9 2 g l na2hpo4 0 6 g l nh4cl 0 3 g l kcl mineral 12 5 ml l and vitamin 5 ml l solutions ph 7 1 conductivity 12 1 ms cm cheng et al 2009 the concentration of pbs solution was changed from 50 to 100 mm from the third batch cycle since a low ph 6 6 6 7 was measured at the end of the second batch cycle 2 2 preparation of brushes and reactor configurations two large brushes were used to provide high surface areas for microbial growth and two smaller brushes were used as electrodes for the four different reactor conditions fig 1 the full size brush 6 cm long and 4 cm in diameter half size brush 3 cm long and 4 cm in diameter and small size anode brush 1 cm long and 1 5 cm in diameter were made from carbon fibers wound into two twisted titanium wires mill rose the bristles for the carbon brushes were 0 00072 mm in diameter and had an electrical conductivity of 650 s cm zoltek com products px35 the carbon brushes were heat treated at 450 c for 30 min before use stainless steel ss brushes used for the cathodes had the same length and diameter as the anodes but the bristles were 0 005 cm in diameter the ad reactors duplicates for each test condition were glass bottles filled with 270 ml of liquid and they had 60 or 80 ml of headspace two different bottle types the bottles were sealed with a rubber stopper held on with a screw cap ad reactors were tested with four different configurations a full size brush with no electrodes fb a half size brush to provide a high surface area along with two electrodes either with an applied voltage of 0 8 v hb cc or with an open circuit hb oc or only the electrodes and no large brush operated with an applied voltage of 0 8 v to simulate ad with mec nb cc fig 1 the fb reactor was used to show the maximum possible impact of conductive surface area on ad performance while the nb cc condition represented ad mecs with low electrode packing density as used in several previous studies baek et al 2020 feng et al 2015 the hb cc configuration was examined as a possible method to improve ad using both approaches i e current generation and adding a large surface area hb oc configuration was used as a control to provide same surface area as hb cc but remove the impact of current generation on performance to prevent short circuiting in the reactors with the half brush between the brush and electrodes a piece of insulative rubber was installed at the bottom of the electrodes by piercing the titanium tip into the rubber fig 1c the tip was sealed by epoxy treatment to make it be electrically insulated the surface area of brushes was calculated for all reactor configurations based on the bristle geometry of each carbon and ss brushes table 1 the cylindrical area was calculated as ac 2πr r h v where h is the height and r is the radius of the brush and v is the liquid volume the specific bristle area for carbon brushes was calculated as as 2πrbn rb r v where rb is the radius of bristle 0 00036 cm and n is the total number of bristles 400 000 bristles per inch the specific bristle area for ss brush was estimated as as 2m rbρv where m is the total mass of the bristles and ρ is the density of the ss fiber 2 3 repeated batch operation for the first cycle a glucose medium with 20 v v of inoculum was used producing a final glucose concentration of 2 5 g l the reactors were operated under fed batch mode by replacing 50 of the liquid with fresh medium at the end of each cycle before starting each batch cycle the reactor liquid was sparged with pure nitrogen gas for 3 min the duration of the cycle was defined based on the end of gas production or a low electrical current from all reactors a fixed external voltage of 0 8 v between two electrodes was applied to the nb cc and hb cc reactors using a potentiostat vmp3 biologic knoxville tn consistent with applied voltages used in previous tests to enhance ad efficiency ding et al 2016 vu et al 2020 the fb reactor did not contain electrodes and the hb oc reactors were operated under open circuit conditions biogas was collected by gas collection bag cali 5 bond calibrated instruments ny and liquid samples were collected from the middle of the reactors through sampling ports all ad reactors were operated in duplicate and in a temperature controlled room at 35 c the current was recorded at 10 min intervals using a potentiostat vmp3 biologic knoxville tn 2 4 protein assay the attached and suspended biomass were quantified based on total protein concentration using a bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay kit sigma aldrich following previously described procedures bond and lovley 2003 ishii et al 2008 rossi et al 2018 for the extraction of the attached biomass the pieces of brushes were cut with sterile scissors and placed in a petri dish with 5 ml small brushes or 10 ml large brushes of 0 2 n naoh the 1 h extraction was performed by withdrawing and re adding the naoh solution several times over the surface of brushes 15 min of intervals using a pipette to improve protein extraction the resulting solution was removed and weighed an equal amount of deionized water was used for further rinsing the brushes to collect any remaining solution the liquids were pooled together yielding a sample containing 0 1 n naoh for suspended biomass 10 ml of mixed liquor was centrifuged 13 000 g 3 min the suspension was discarded and pellet was re suspended in 0 1 n naoh the pretreated samples both attached and suspended biomass were frozen 20 c followed by thawing at 100 c for 10 min and this freeze thaw cycle was repeated three times then the sample was centrifuged 13 000 g 3 min to remove any cell debris the protein concentration was quantified by the bca method against a bovine serum albumin standard bond and lovley 2003 the measured protein was normalized by the weight of used brushes for attached biomass or the volume of used suspension for suspended biomass total protein in each reactor was presented by multiplying by total weight of brushes or total working volume of the reactor 2 5 nucleic acid extraction library preparation amplicon sequencing bioinformatics processing and statistical analysis the attached

performed in duplicate the coulombic efficiency ce was calculated as ce ct cc where ct is the total coulombs calculated by integrating the current over time and cc is the total charge consumed based on the scod removal the contribution of current generation to methane production was estimated by the ratio of the theoretical methane production from current to total methane production as rth tot we wch4 where we is the electrical energy input and wch4 is the energy content of the methane produced the methane generation rate over time was fitted using the gompertz equation to interpret the

polarization data obtained by applying voltage step by step with an interval as done in a previous study cario et al 2019 or by using linear sweep voltammetry kang et al 2017 nam et al 2017 here the polarization data were obtained by reducing the applied voltage from 0 8 v to 0 2 v at 0 1 v intervals with 20 min at each applied voltage current was recorded at 1 min intervals with the last five minutes averaged and used for polarization curve the electrode potential slope eps method was used to obtain the total internal resistance of the hb cc and nb cc for the eps method the whole cell potentials were plotted with the potential on the y axis and the current density on the x axis the linear portion was fitted by e mi b where i is the current density a m3 the slope m is defined as the total internal resistance mω m3 and the y intercept was open circuit potential of the cells 3 results discussion 3 1 methane production and cod removal after successful biofilm acclimation cycles fig s1 the reactors with the high surface area brushes produced methane faster than the reactor containing only the mec electrodes nb cc fig 2 a methane production during the third batch cycle showed the lowest accumulated volume for the nb cc reactor 208 24 ml and the highest gas volume for the fb reactor 249 2 ml the three configurations with the full or half brushes all showed similar overall trends in gas production with similar final methane volumes 235 249 ml despite of the presence of the electrodes in the nb cc reactors gas production was much less by the end of the cycle than that of the other reactors there was negligible h2 production 0 2 in biogas in all cycles and for all days except day 1 where acidogenesis mainly occurred in all reactors the performance of the different reactors in terms of methane production was consistent with parameters fitted to the modified gompertz model table 2 with all results having r2 0 99 the three reactors with full or half brushes fb hb cc and hb oc reactors had 3 7 9 0 higher values of the maximum methane potential p and 57 82 higher values in the maximum methane production rate parameter rm compared to the nb cc reactor these higher rates with the large brush area indicated that the presence of the brush was more critical for methane production than electrodes in the ad reactors the methane production estimated from the p values from the model agreed with the experimental data indicating that the incubation period of the third cycle i e 8 days was enough to observe the difference in ad efficiency among the reactors the estimated lag phase λ was similar and low for all reactors 0 31 0 43 days indicating the microbial community was well acclimated for the fed batch cycles the scod removals were consistent with methane production showing slower removal rates in the nb cc bottles compared to the other reactors fig 2b the final scod removal at the end of the cycle was above 93 for the three reactors with the large brushes 93 3 fb 93 3 hb cc and 94 2 hb oc compared to 86 3 for the nb cc reactors 3 2 vfa production and removal total vfa concentrations were always lower in the ad reactors with the large brushes compared to the electrode only nb cc reactors fig 3 acetate propionate and butyrate were the dominant acidogenic products from glucose fermentation consistent with previous reports lu et al 2020 qin et al 2020 after the total vfa concentrations reached a maximum on day 2 with slight drop in ph from 6 9 to 6 4 fig s2 more rapid conversion of butyrate to acetate was observed during days 2 4 in fb hb cc and hb oc while butyrate remained on days 4 and 6 in nb cc reactors in addition the propionate degradation rate was much slower in nb cc resulting in 175 mg as cod l of propionate at the end of the cycle the lower propionate accumulation in the reactors with large carbon brushes could have been due to enhanced syntrophic propionate oxidation by diet stimulated by the presence of the electrically conductive surface area baek et al 2018 cruz viggi et al 2014 having a carbon brush with large surface therefore could have improved ad because anaerobic propionate oxidation is a highly endergonic reaction δgo 76 1 kj mol this speculation is supported by previous reports which observed diet in both pure and mixed culture systems when electrically conductive carbon based woven materials were added chen et al 2014 dang et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 3 3 current production and its impact on performance the reactors with the electrodes and no brush nb cc showed better electrochemical performance than the hb cc reactors with the large half sized brush in terms of current density and ce values despite identical electrode configurations fig 4 a polarization data for the two reactors was similar resulting in comparable slopes using the eps method cario et al 2019 the internal resistances of the two types of reactors calculated from the slopes were not appreciably different based on the overlap of the standard error of the slopes at lower current densities and applied voltages 96 6 for hb cc reactor and 93 6 mω m3 for nb cc reactor fig 4b however for applied voltages above 0 5 v for the hb cc reactors and 0 7 v for nb cc reactors there was no increase in current density cario et al 2019 at an applied voltage of 0 8 v i e a set potential in this experiment a 2 7 fold higher current was produced in nb cc than hb cc which explained their different performance and current densities in the constant applied voltage tests the lower electrochemical performance for the hb cc reactor was due to the presence of the large half sized brush as this was the only difference between the hb cc and nb cc reactors the presence of the half sized brush resulted in a more rapid consumption of vfas that are used for current generation which could have explained the lower current density in the hb cc reactors there was no appreciable difference in performance for the reactors with the half brush operated in either open circuit hb oc or with current generation hb cc due to an applied voltage indicating that current production did not measurably influence overall ad rates figs 2 and 3 in addition current production alone for the nb cc reactor resulted in reduced overall performance compared to the other reactors analysis of the fraction of the substrate removed on the basis of the coulombic efficiencies showed that the closed circuit reactors had 7 of the substrate used by the anode bacteria with ce values of 3 4 hb cc and 6 9 nb cc thus there was a negligible impact of current generation on performance the lack of an impact of current production on methane generation or cod removal rates was likely due to the small electrode packing density 6 1 m2 m3 as cylindrical area and 200 m2 m3 as specific bristle area higher electrode brush densities 63 0 m2 m3 as cylindrical area produced a higher maximum current density 31 9 a m3 with same substrate type of medium glucose at 2 5 g l vu et al 2020 than those obtained in this study 2 7 a m3 for hb cc and 4 9 a m3 for nb cc however asshown by using a large brush in our studies the rates would be improved just due to the large surface area of the brush even in the absence of current production 3 4 biomass on brushes protein was measured on the brushes and in the mixed liquor of each reactor to compare biomass retention among the reactors fig 5 the biomass measured for the half 120 121 mg and full size 118 mg brushes were similar and much higher than those on the small size brushes 1 15 mg or in the mixed liquor 6 57 mg the amount of protein was 3 1 9 5 fold higher in the mixed liquor of nb cc than other reactors presumably owing to the less surface area for the attached growth the differences in suspended biomass concentrations among the reactors also could be visually observed based on less turbidity of solution for the reactors with large brushes than that of the nb cc reactors without the large brushes fig s3 the sum of protein was much higher in hb oc 136 5 mg hb cc 135 1 mg and fb 133 1 mg configurations compared to nb cc 37 2 mg suggesting the biomass retention by the large surface area brushes was the crucial factor in ad performance of the reactors with the different configurations the lack of a difference in total protein amount among fb hb cc and hb oc reactors suggests that the differences in brush shapes and materials could have impacted overall biomass retention on the brushes although the fb configuration provided twice as much surface area than hb reactors hb cc or hb oc the portion of active surface area which was favorable for microbial attachment might have not been much larger due to the inaccessibility of the inner parts of the brushes similar protein amounts among these three reactors did seem to be in good agreement with the similar ad efficiencies of these three configurations fig 2 3 5 spatial distribution of the microbial community the biomass samples taken from different locations biofilms on brushes and the solutions were analyzed for both 16s rrna gene and 16s rrna to compare the total and active microbial community among the four reactors a total of 584 971 rrna gene library and 678 884 rrna library non chimeric quality filtered reads were obtained and they were clustered into 906 otus at 97 identity the most abundant 20 otus in each sample were presented in a heatmap with their relative abundance and taxonomic classification at the genus and phylum level fig 6 the dominant methanogen family varied depending on the location of the biomass sampling based on 16s rrna gene sequencing the relative abundance of methanobacteriaceae was much higher on the cathodes of the hb cc 40 and nb cc 36 reactors compared to the others 1 9 fig 7 a and most of them were assigned to the genus methanobacterium fig 6a although the relative abundance of this group decreased in 16s rrna sequencing fig 6b methanobacteriaceae was still the most predominant methanogenic family on the cathodes of the hb cc and nb cc reactors fig 7b this finding is consistent with previous studies on biocathodes of mecs or electromethanogenesis cells where the relative abundance of methanobacterium was the highest among methanogens and they were mainly responsible for ch4 production in h2 or electrons accepting conditions baek et al 2017 siegert et al 2015 zhen et al 2016 methanotrichaceae was the predominant methanogen family on brushes which did not function as electrodes i e small size brushes in hb oc and half or full size carbon brushes most of these methanogens were assigned to the genus methanothrix fig 6a whose members are acetoclastic methanogens although recently they were found to be capable of participating in diet by converting co2 to ch4 directly rotaru et al 2014b given that their relative abundance was much higher in the 16s rrna library members of methanothrix may have substantially contributed to the metabolic activity of methane production in brushes that did not function as electrodes although we did not conclusively show diet here on the graphite fiber brushes previous reports on diet between methanothrix and vfa degrading partners has been shown by others using other electrically conductive materials liu et al 2020a xu et al 2020 methanomicrobiaceae showed extremely low relative abundance 0 04 in 16s rrna gene libraries while it increased significantly 1 17 in 16s rrna libraries for these brushes fig 7 their abundance was higher in solutions consistent with a previous ad study which found that methanomicrobiaceae were more abundant in solutions than biofilms on carbon cloth or biochar de vrieze et al 2016 among the 41 known phyla classified from bacterial 16s rrna gene and 16s rrna sequences firmicutes bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were dominant in all samples although their relative abundance varied fig 8 for example proteobacteria showed 3 1 6 2 fold higher relative abundance on the anodes than cathodes in both 16s rrna gene and 16s rrna libraries of the hb cc and nb cc reactors however there was negligible difference in the relative abundance of proteobacteria between the small size carbon brush and ss brush in the hb oc reactor despite having the same reactor configuration as the hb cc reactor this suggests that the electron producing or accepting mechanism around the electrode developed a substantially different bacterial community from the community that developed on the brushes in the absence of current chloroflexi showed a higher relative abundance on the large carbon brush 7 7 8 5 in 16s rrna gene and 4 9 6 2 in 16s rrna libraries with much lower abundances in the other samples this is consistent with their reported role in diet showing their dominance on conductive materials added into ad reactors baek et al 2020 feng et al 2018 at the otu level otu 2 which belonged to alistipes was highly abundant in all mixed liquor samples 27 in the 16s rrna gene library fig 6 although alistipes has been reported in several ad reactors liu et al 2020b sposob et al 2020 it might not have made only a small contribution to the overall metabolic activities because their relative abundance in the 16s rrna library was much lower some of the otus belonging to firmicutes e g otu 1 3 4 and 6 were highly abundant in most of the samples and they likely were responsible for fermentation of glucose and production of vfas feng et al 2015 lin et al 2007 the otu 10 which was classified into the genus geobacter showed higher relative abundance only in the anode samples of hb cc and nb cc with much greater abundance in 16s rrna 19 7 24 7 than in 16s rrna gene 5 8 6 2 libraries indicating they are highly active members of the anodic community the dominance of geobacter at the anode in ad mec or mec has been extensively reported due to their ability to export electrons directly to the anode yu et al 2018 syntrophomonas otu 16 known as syntrophic butyrate oxidizing bacteria was generally more abundant in the 16s rrna library for the biomass samples obtained from the large size brushes compared to the other brushes this greater abundance could partially reflect recent reports on putative diet between syntrophomonas and methanothrix in the presence of conductive materials zhao et al 2018 considering the high relative abundance of methanothrix here for the large size brushes although there has been no direct evidence of diet for syntrophomonas species their enrichment in diet stimulating condition has been frequently reported zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 there were some other dominant otus in brush biofilms without current which were affiliated with acetothermiia thermovirga victivallis and candidatus cloacamonas all classified to be fermentative bacteria fig 6 chen et al 2018 pampillón gonzález et al 2017 suarez et al 2019 zoetendal et al 2003 in contrast the microbial populations of the brushes functioning as electrodes were dominated only by several major groups possibly due to the selective pressure regarding current production figs 7 and 8 not only for the fermentative bacteria whole microbial communities were generally less diverse in electrode biofilms this was shown by the two alpha diversity indices the shannon index which gives more weight to abundant otus and the chao1 index which considers rare otus ragab et al 2019 both indices were generally higher in large and small size open circuit brushes compared to the electrode samples fig s4 suggesting that more diverse functional microbial groups flourished due to the electrically conductive fibers in the brushes 3 6 overall analysis overall the experimental results indicated that the large surface area of carbon brush was more beneficial than current generation in terms of total biogas production and rates of organic matter degradation the enhanced performance by the ad reactors with the half or full sized brushes fb hb cc and hb oc reactors was likely due to at least two reasons first the half or full size brush provided a large supporting medium due to the higher surface area than that of the smaller brush electrodes for attached biomass in comparison to a suspended growth system attached growth is known to sustain more biomass inside the reactors and thus to provide greater biological stability and efficiency of cod removal rajeshwari et al 2000 second the carbon brushes used in this study were electrically conductive 650 s cm zoltek com products px35 so the brush fibers could have promoted diet between electroactive vfa degrading bacteria and methanogens consistent with previous reports using electrically conductive materials rotaru et al 2014a rotaru et al 2014b several other studies have also shown enhanced ad efficiency by diet stimulation by adding conductive carbon based materials chen et al 2014 dang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 the addition of conductive materials improved for example methane production and the degradation rate of acetate kato et al 2012 propionate jing et al 2017 and butyrate li et al 2015 in mixed culture ad process which were the major vfas in the present study considering that half and full size carbon brushes can provide very large conductive surface areas for microorganisms to be attached both beneficial effects i e large area for attached growth and increased diet might be achieved in the reactors with relatively large brushes based on chemical and microbial community results a potential schematic was presented to describe the major microbial activity occurring in each biofilm on the brush fig 9 the presence of large carbon brush was the main factor in improving ad performance with methanothrix dominant methanogen in carbon brush possibly responsible for the improved performance the more critical impact of surface area than current generation observed here suggests that the role of bioelectrodes in ad mec systems should be reconsidered in terms of their impact in some ad mec studies the contribution of current to overall methane production i e rth tot values was quite low for example 0 6 feng et al 2015 and 1 2 baek et al 2020 the rth tot values here were 2 9 hb cc and 7 7 nb cc which was larger than in these previous studies but apparently still too low to produce differences in methane production efficiency among reactors with electrodes the common factor in the reactor configuration for these three studies baek et al 2020 feng et al 2015 and this study was a low electrode packing density 0 6 0 7 m2 m3 based on the cathode projected area to reactor volume this indicated that current generation was not the only factor to enhance methane productivity or the stability of ad operation in previous studies rather than current high biomass concentration on the large electrode surface with less washout effect could make a major contribution to methane production consistent with this observation was the fact that there was no significant difference in ad mec performance observed between closed and open circuit in the presence of electrodes in previous study de vrieze et al 2014 as an extension of our results we suggest that enhanced ad can be achieved simply by maximizing the surface area through addition of large graphite fiber brushes rather than by adding electrodes with current generation 4 conclusions the addition of a large amount of conductive surface area using carbon brush was proved to be more efficient for ad performance than current generation through electrodes fb hb cc and hb oc showed 57 82 higher methane generation rate parameters in the gompertz model compared to the nb cc as well as the enhancement in vfa removals much higher amounts of protein in the large size brushes and negligible impact of current production on the ch4 production were observed suggesting a more important role of adding large surface area than producing current methanothrix was the dominant methanogen on the large size carbon brush while geobacter anode and methanobacterium cathode were most abundant on the electrodes these results highlight that providing surface area by using electrically conductive carbon fiber brushes could be a better strategy for enhancing ad performance than using only mec

17467,in recent years to meet the needs of economic development an increasing number of coastal nuclear power plants and thermal power plants cnatpps have used seawater as the source and sink of cooling water considering six cnatpps along the coast of china based on the model of conservation of mass and energy for an environmental fluid medium this study quantitatively evaluates the thermal diffusion capacity tdc and contribution rate of factors influencing the thermal plume the results showed that 1 the current velocity shoreline topography and horizontal diffusion coefficient are linearly correlated with the tdc the former two variables were the same and the largest and are highly sensitive parameters 2 the average contribution rates of the current velocity and shoreline topography were the largest at 0 32 and that of the water depth ranged from 0 to 0 28 3 the shoreline topography close to the outfall affects the tdc of the emitting source of cnatpps rather than the geographical location and 4 this study can provide a comprehensive measurement tool for the planning site selection and layout of cnatpps to reduce the impact of their thermal pollution on aquatic organisms in the receiving water considering the tdc and thermal sensitivity of marine organisms it might be assumed that the same heat and the same volume of thermal pollution may have smaller impacts on marine organisms in the east china sea than in the south china sea graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords thermal discharge thermal diffusion capacity contribution rate sensitivity 1 introduction anthropogenic excess heat such as cooling water discharged from thermal and nuclear power plants has been recognized as a form of pollution in reservoirs lakes and rivers since the middle of the twentieth century davidson and bradshaw 1967 dracup and fogabty 1974 scherer 1975 in recent years to satisfy the demands for water intake and thermal discharge an increasing number of thermal power plants and nuclear power plants have been built in coastal areas with seawater as the source and sink of cooling water these emissions of heat commonly known as thermal pollution affect ambient water temperature and consequently impact the entire aquatic food web on the one hand the increase in seawater temperature directly affects the environmental temperature impacting both the abundance and community structure of marine organisms lo et al 2004 chew et al 2015 worthington et al 2015 jiang 2016 on the other hand the increase in seawater temperature affects marine organisms through the food web lin et al 2018 found that the elevated temperature caused by thermal discharge from a power plant affected the growth of macrobenthos in the study area by significantly affecting the abundance and community structure of the phytoplankton and zooplankton therein the impact on aquatic ecology has become an important issue in the field of ocean and environmental protection shiers and marks 1973 the magnitude and range of thermal plume influences on receiving water bodies in different coastal nuclear power plants and thermal power plants cnatpps are quite different wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2015a xu 2014 many factors influence thermal effluent behavior including tidal waves and the velocity and direction of tidal currents zhang et al 2013 jia et al 2016 the location of emitting sources jia et al 2016 cheng et al 2011 seabed topography cheng et al 2011 waves hu 2009 water depth liu et al 2017 and the direction and velocity of the wind lentz and largier 2006 hydrodynamic conditions are considered to be the main factors affecting thermal effluent behavior wang and xiong 2013 wang et al 2013 1 some studies have shown that when the area of the bay is sufficiently large tidal prism has little influence on thermal plume diffusion since the amount of water actually involved in mixing close to the emitting source plays a decisive role in the dilution and diffusion of the thermal plume tang et al 2016 the influence range of the thermal plume is larger in neap tide than in spring tide larger in winter than in summer jia et al 2016 and also larger in ebb tide than in flood tide wang and xiong 2013 2 among the estuary bay and open sea area which are three locations of outfall the influence range of thermal plume is believed to be largest in the bay and smallest in the open sea jia et al 2016 some researchers found that in near shore regions heat plumes can be trapped by coastal currents without being dispersed across the water body salgueiro et al 2015 råman et al 2017 3 a larger slope of the topography corresponds to stronger orientation of the diffusion of thermal discharge in the horizontal direction in contrast thermal discharge has a greater impact in the vertical direction cheng et al 2011 the temperature difference among the water column is significant when the thermal plume is transported from the submarine shoal to the deep water area and passes through the sharp slope area zhu 2014 4 the water depth and velocity close to the outfall are considered to be the major factors affecting the diffusion range of a thermal plume liu et al 2017 the influence range of a thermal plume becomes smaller when the flow velocity is relatively large and the flow moves toward the open sea jia et al 2016 however systematic and quantitative studies on the contributions of cnatpp factors influencing thermal plume behavior in the affected area are lacking several methodologies ranging from physical models to numerical models are available two dimensional mathematical models are commonly used in the numerical simulation of thermal discharge from cnatpps such as the k ε turbulence model mcguirk et al 1978 and mike 21 model feng et al 2018 three dimensional mathematical models must be established under the conditions of complex tidal effects and bottom discharge such as the princeton ocean model pom cai et al 2014 finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom zhu 2014 rma 10 model yan et al 2016 and cornell mixing zone expert system cormix zhang et al 2017 in recent years the combination of two numerical models suh 2001 råman vinnå et al 2017 or combining a two dimensional numerical model with a physical model has also been used to study thermal plume behavior guo et al 2018 whether using a numerical model or a physical model the modeling process is time consuming and laborious and requires a tremendous amount of basic data moreover these models are commonly used in the process of cnatpp planning and site selection comprehensive quantitative indices that can reflect the thermal diffusion capacity tdc at the outfall and therefore help us make sound decisions easily and quickly are lacking especially those involving comparisons among multiple regions based on the model of conservation of mass and energy for an environmental fluid medium this study quantitatively evaluates the contribution rates of factors influencing thermal plumes from cnatpps such as the current velocity water depth and shoreline topography near the outfall the coefficient of tdc was also defined to establish a comprehensive evaluation tool for cnatpp planning and site selection in this paper only the surface discharge of cnatpps is involved 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sites in this study six study sites with concentrated distributions large installed capacities and surface discharge were selected including hyh tw hzw nd fq and hm fig 1 and table 1 the abbreviations and their corresponding full names are shown in table 2 these six sites represent the cnatpps in all four major sea areas of china and also the cnatpps in different geographic settings with different offshore distances to the outlet for example hyh hzw fq and hm represent cnatpps in a bay and tw and nd represent cnatpps in the open sea at all the study sites except for fq the cooling water from the cnatpps discharges near the shore by the end of 2017 the discharging outlet in hyh is hyh in tw the outlet is tw in hzw the discharging outlets are qs phase i qs phase ii qs phase iii qs phase i extension jx phase i jx phase ii jx phase iii and cj in nd the discharging outlet is nd in the fq the outlet is fq and in hm the discharging outlet is hm among these sites the duration of tides in the area near the outfalls of hyh and hm are irregular semidiurnal tides while those of tw hzw nd and fq are regular semidiurnal tides the tidal current in all study sites shows rectilinear current movement see the attached table 1 for the characteristics of the sea area at outlets in the study area 2 2 method 2 2 1 construction of a three dimensional basic model the basic assumption of the model of conservation of mass and energy for an environmental fluid medium is that heat exists in a fluid and the particles of high heat fluid have the same hydrodynamic characteristics as those of a normal fluid that is no stratification exists and differences in the current direction and current velocity in the whole water column are minimally affected after entering a small volume element heat can be evenly dispersed without condensation precipitation and volatilization particles with heat can be considered normal fluid particles for research based on the assumption mentioned above a three dimensional basic model is proposed to reflect the tdc of study area with parameters such as current velocity flow direction water depth and shoreline topography near the emitting source 1 basic model if pollutant concentration gradients exist in the three directions of x y and z the basic environmental quality model can be written as follows 1 c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 d z 2 c z 2 u x c x u y c

current velocity in the x y and z directions m s k reaction rate constant 1 2 steady state mass and heat transfer model for the three dimensional basic model the following assumptions are made considering the current velocity and ignoring the thermal diffusion in the x axis direction and ignoring the velocity and considering the thermal diffusion in the y axis and z axis directions we also assume that the heat will not be consumed or increased in the fluid that is k 0 based on the above assumptions the integration is performed in a uniform flow field i e steady state 2 c x y z q 4 π x d

change in the x direction it is a function of σ d therefore with the boundary of d 3 σ d we can draw a flow field distribution affected by heat it is a flat bell shaped cone with an elliptical cross

of literature research the vertical diffusion coefficient dz is taken as 0 0005 m2 s fisher et al 1987 huang 1996 and the horizontal diffusion coefficients dx and dy are both taken as 5 m2 s zhang et al 2014 chen 2007 2 2 2 contribution rate based on the morris screening method the sensitive indices of each variable in each combination are calculated the contribution rate of each influencing factor in a combination is the ratio of the sensitive indices of each influencing factor to the sum of the sensitive indices of all influencing factors in the combination sensitivity analyses are performed to observe changes in model output caused by a small change in model parameters within the value range beck 1983 morris 1991 the traditional local parameter sensitivity analysis method causes an artificial disturbance near the best estimate value of a certain parameter and calculates the change rate of model output caused by fluctuations in parameters in this small range the morris screening method is a widely used local sensitivity analysis method francos et al 2003 xu and mynett 2006 hao et al 2004 the morris screening method randomly changes one of the parameters xi within the threshold range of variables and then runs the model to obtain the objective function y x y x1 x2 x3 xn in this method we use ee the output value of the influence to determine the influential degree of the parameter change morris 1991 francos et al 2003 12 e i y y δ i where y is the output value after the parameter change y is the output value before the parameter change and δ i is the change range of parameter i 13 e e i y x 1 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k y x δ where x is a value in the value range of ω and the value range of x δ is also ω δ is a multiple of 1 1 p representing the amplitude of each factor the modified morris screening method uses independent variables to change in a fixed step and the sensitivity index requires multiple average values as shown in the following formula 14 s i 0 n 1 y i 1 y i y 0 p i 1 p i 100 n 1 s is the sensitivity index yi is the output value of the ith operation of the model yi 1 is the output value of the i 1th operation of the model y0

percentage of change in the i 1th operation with respect to the parameter value after calibration and n is the number of model operations based on the morris screening method the sensitivity index and the contribution rates of influencing factors are calculated under various combinations of possible values for all variables in the process of sensitivity index calculation the percentages of changes in parameters were in small ranges of 10 5 5 and 10 the value range interval and basis of each parameter are shown in table 3 j variables value within their value range in any combination the objective function is y x1 x2 x3 xj and the formula of the contribution rate of any variable xi is as follows 15 c x i s x i 0 i s x i where c xi is the contribution rate of xi and s xi is the sensitivity index of xi 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of factors influencing tdc 3 1 1 tdcs close to outlets at each study site as shown in fig 2 the tdcs close to the fq and jx phase iii outlets were the largest at ebb tide at more than 5 106 m3 h the tdcs close to the qs phase iii jx phase i and jx phase ii outlets were the second largest and that of nd was the smallest at approximately 4 105 m3 h concerning the tdcs at the six study sites that in the fq was the largest and that in the nd was the smallest at ebb tide the tdc close to cnatpp outlets at flood tide was quite different with a maximum difference of approximately 6 times the tdc close to the qs phase ii was the largest at greater than 8 5 106 m3 h the tdcs close to the qs phase i and qs phase iii were the second largest and that of tw was the smallest at approximately 1 5 106 m3 h the tdc in the six study sites at flood tide was largest in the hzw followed by that in the fq and the tdc in the nd was smallest according to the comparison at flood tide and ebb tide except for those near the hyh tw and hm the tdcs close to the outlets of each power plant at flood tide were greater than those at ebb tide the tdcs during flood tide are close to the outlet of cnatpps in nd and in hzw except that cj is far greater than that during ebb tide the sums of tdcs of cnatpps during flood tide and ebb tide were quite different with a maximum difference of approximately 6 times the tdcs close to the outlet of qs phase i qs phase iii jx phase iii and fq were largest at approximately 1 2 107 m3 h in the study sites fq had the largest value hzw had the second largest value and nd had the smallest value 3 1 2 contribution rate of influencing factors to assess the calculated sensitivity indices are ranked in four classes s 1 indicates very high sensitivity 0 2 s 1 indicates high sensitivity 0 05 s 0 2 indicates medium sensitivity and 0 s 0 05 indicates small to negligible sensitivity lenhart et al 2002 from the sensitivity analysis of five influencing factors only values of the sensitivity of μ x shoreline topography st and dywere observed in each combination that is these parameters are linearly related to the tdc the sensitivity indices of μ x and st were the same and the largest indices the largest index was 1 representing a highly sensitive parameter the sensitivity index of dy was 0 50 which was classified as a sensitive parameter μ x dyand st are linearly correlated with tdc the sensitivity indices of dz and h are variable the former was 0 35 0 01 0 50 and the latter was 0 31 0 0 97 which were between the small to negligible parameters and the sensitive parameters as shown in fig 3 a in any condition the contribution rates of u x and st were the same and ranked first in the whole combination within the range of parameter values the percentages of the contribution rates of h ranking third fourth and fifth were 32 6 and 62 respectively the percentages of the contribution rates of dy ranking third and fourth were 54 and 46 respectively the percentages of the contribution rates of dz ranking third and fourth were 29 and 38 respectively as shown in fig 3b in all combinations the average contribution rates of u x and st were the largest at 0 32 0 287 0 333 the average contribution rates of dy dz and h were 0 16 0 144 0 167 0 11 0 004 0 167 and 0 09 0 0 279 respectively in terms of contribution rate dispersion in all combinations those of dy and st were relatively small and those of dz and h were relatively large regardless of the values that parameters take within their value ranges their contribution rates were only related to h and dz when h takes values from 1 0 m to 7 0 m the contribution rate ranges of μ x dy dz h and st are 0 29 0 33 0 26 0 00 0 15 0 17 0 02 0 17 and 0 29 0 33 respectively fig 3c the change in h had little effect on the contribution rates of μ x dyand st but had a considerable effect on the contribution rates of h and dz the contribution rate of h decreased with increasing h and the contribution rates of the other parameters increased with increasing h when dz takes values from 0 00005 m2 s 0 00055 m2 s the contribution rate ranges of μ x dy dz h and st are 0 33 0 31 0 02 0 14 0 17 0 15 0 15 0 08 and 0 33 0 31 respectively fig 3d the change in dzhad little effect on the contribution rates of μ x dyand st but had a considerable effect on the contribution rates of h and dz the contribution rate of h increased with increasing dz and the contribution rates of the other parameters decreased with increasing dz 3 1 3 identifying factors influencing tdc among these five influencing factors current velocity and shoreline topography contributed the most to the tdc although the average contribution rate of water depth to the tdc was relatively small the variation was greatest furthermore current velocity water depth and shoreline topography all have specific physical significance therefore only these three influencing factors were analyzed below in the six study sites the smallest μ x was in nd and the largest value was in hzw μ x in tw nd and hm was lower than 0 5 m s in fq and hyh the value was in the range of 0 5 1 0 m s in hzw the value was greater than 1 0 m s h in tw and hzw except for qs phase ⅰ extension was lower than 5 m s in nd fq and hm the value was in the range of 5 10 m s in hyh the value was greater than 10 m s st in hm was lower than 0 5 in hyh tw and hzw except for qs phase ⅰ and qs phase ⅲ the value was in the range of 0 5 0 8 in nd and fq the value was greater than 0 8 from the parameter values of cnatpps table 4 the st at the fq outlet is 1 00 therefore st was not the factor restricting the tdc the sensitivity index and contribution rates of h at the hyh qs phase i extension nd fq and hm outlets were all 0 table 2 that is the h at these five outlets was not the factor restricting the tdc as mentioned above μ x and st were the main factors restricting the tdc at the outlets in hyh qs phase i extension nd and hm μ x h and st together restricted the tdc of the outlets in tw qs phase i qs phase ii qs phase iii jx phase i jx phase ii jx phase iii cj and fq μ x was the main influencing factor that restricted the tdc at the outlet in fq in addition hangzhou bay has the strongest tidal current area along the coast of china with a large tidal current velocity feng et al 2015 except for cj the average current velocity at other outlets was above 1 00 m s the h values close to the outlet in tw and outlets in hzw except for the qs phase i extension were less than 5 m for st the emitting source at fq was offshore no shelter was identified near the outlet and the diffusion condition was the best although the outlet at qs phase i and qs phase iii was set along the coast the st values were greater than 0 8 and had only a small impact on heat diffusion in summary shoreline topography was the main influencing factor that restricted the tdc at the outlet in the qs phase i extension water depth was the main factor that restricted the tdcs at the outlets in qs phase i and qs phase iii the main factor influencing the tdc close to the outlet of fq was current velocity velocity and topography both restricted the tdcs of the outlets at hyh hm and nd water depth and shoreline topography were the main influencing factors that restricted the tdcs close to the outlets of qs phase ⅱ jx phase ⅰ jx phase ⅱ and jx phase ⅲ and the influencing factors of current velocity water depth and shoreline topography all restricted the heat diffusion near the outlets in tw and cj 3 2 general rules of influencing factors 1 water depth as shown in fig 4 when dz 0 0005 m2 s and dy 5 m2 s if h 3 0 m the sensitivity index of h was 0 7 sensitive parameter and the contribution rate of h was 21 if 3 0 m h 5 0 m the sensitivity index of h was 0 2 0 7 sensitive parameter and the contribution rate of h was 5 21 if h 5 0 m the sensitivity index of h was 0 2 medium sensitive parameter or small to negligible parameter and the contribution rate of h was 5 based on field observation data yin et al 2006 and lin et al 2018 as well as zhang et al 2015b wu and zhu 2017 cui 2008 zhu 2014 and zhang 2015 who employed the estuarine coastal and ocean modeling system with sediment ecomsed and fvcom found that the thermal discharge from cnatpps induces stratification in the surrounding outlet the report by wu and zhu 2017 regarding the yangtze river indicated that stratification occurs from the shore close to the outlet to a water depth of 3 m wang et al 2013 found stratification above a water depth of 5 m in the yellow sea while suh et al 2001 observed stratification in the upper layer above a water depth of 7 m in chonsu bay korea a study by cui 2008 in the south china sea found that the diffusion of warm water mainly occurred in the upper half of the total water depth 0 5 h in contrast zhang et al 2015b investigated the bohai sea and found that vertical stratification appeared in the upper 1 5 of the total water depth 0 2 h a study in the sines thermal power plant on the west portuguese coast salgueiro et al 2015 showed that the impact of the thermal plume was within the upper 4 m water depths huang et al 2019 by analyzing a study area with different tidal dynamic conditions in the east china sea and south china sea concluded that the thermocline caused by thermal pollution mostly occurred at water depths shallower than 7 m the results of this study are basically consistent with those of the studies mentioned above therefore h 3 0 m is not conducive to the diffusion of the thermal plume 3 0 m h 5 0 m restricts heat diffusion and h 5 0 m is conducive to thermal diffusion 2 shoreline topography in all combinations the sensitivity indices of st were always 1 and the contribution rates of st were between 29 and 33 st is an important factor affecting the tdc of cnatpps as shown in table 2 the current flow and water depth at the outlets of qs phase i qs phase ii and qs phase iii were the same the tdcs of qs phase ⅰ and qs phase ⅲ with an st greater than 0 8 ranked in the top five while those of the outlets of qs phase ii with an st of only 0 72 ranked eighth therefore st 0 8 is considered conducive to the diffusion of warm water 0 5 st 0 8 restricts the diffusion of the thermal plume and st 0 5 is not conducive to thermal diffusion based on the geographical location of each study site tw and nd are located in the open sea and other study sites are located in the bay the st values of tw and nd are less than 0 8 those of hyh and hm are less than 0 8 and that of fq is 1 in hzw the st values of different outlets vary substantially st can be inferred to have little relevance to the geographical location of the sea area where the study area is located compared with the emitting sources of cnatpps in estuaries bays and open seas jia et al 2016 found that the influential range of thermal plumes was the largest in bays and the smallest in open seas tang et al 2016 concluded that if the bay area was sufficiently large the distribution range of thermal pollution was less affected by the tidal prism the amount of water involved in mixing near the outfall plays a decisive role in the dilution and diffusion of the thermal plume råman vinnå et al 2017 believed that when thermal discharge occurs in the near shore region a heat plume can be trapped by coastal currents without being dispersed across the water body therefore we inferred that the shoreline topography close to the outfall affects the tdc of the emitting source of cnatpps rather than the geographical location of the sea area where the study area is located because the sea area near the outlet is open especially in the direction of current velocity the block of thermal diffusion near the outlet is small therefore it is conducive to the diffusion of heat this finding also indicates that if the area of the bay was sufficiently large it will not affect the diffusion of the thermal plume meanwhile if the shoreline topography is less sheltered it was not conducive to the heat plume being trapped by coastal currents 3 current velocity current velocity is one of the two influential factors that contribute most for the current velocity in the four sea areas in china certain rules apply the current velocity in bohai is generally 0 5 1 0 m s feng et al 2015 and that in laizhou bay and the center of bohai is relatively weak with a velocity mainly between 0 2 0 4 m s luo and liu 2015 the current velocity in the eastern yellow sea is larger than that in the western yellow sea the strong current area in the west of the yellow sea appears near the laotieshan channel and chengshantou sea area reaching 1 5 m s and some areas can reach 2 5 m s feng et al 2015 the current velocity of the south yellow sea is 0 2 1 6 m s ni 2014 the current velocity in the east china sea is larger near the shore than offshore the velocity can reach 1 5 m s along the zhejiang and fujian coasts the yangtze river estuary hangzhou bay and zhoushan islands are the strongest current areas along the coast of china which can reach 3 0 3 5 m s the current velocity in the south china sea is weak at less than 0 5 m s in most sea areas beibu bay is a relatively strong current area however it is less than 1 m s the strongest tidal current in qiongzhou bay can reach 2 5 m s feng et al 2015 as shown in table 2 the current velocity in the south china sea is the smallest and that in the east china sea except for nd is higher than that in the bohai sea therefore we inferred that μ x 1 0 m s is beneficial to the diffusion of thermal plumes 0 5 m s μ x 1 0 m s restricts thermal diffusion and μ x 0 5 m s is not conducive to the diffusion of warm water therefore in general if the study area is located in the bohai sea the current velocity restricts thermal diffusion if it is located in the east china sea the current velocity is conducive to thermal diffusion and if the study area is located in the south china sea the current velocity is not conducive to the diffusion of warm water 3 3 comprehensive suggestions based on influential factors according to the single influencing factor analysis in section 4 4 2 when h 3 0 m st 0 5 and μ x 0 5 m s these conditions are not conducive to the diffusion of the thermal plume when h 5 0 m st 0 8 and μ x 1 0 m s the conditions are conducive to thermal diffusion otherwise the joint effect of these influential factors on the tdc is difficult to judge as shown in section 3 2 1 the sensitivity indices of μ x and st were 1 indicating that they were directly proportional to the tdc while the sensitivity indices of h change with the change in h which is disproportional to the tdc therefore we define a ratio of tdc to classify the combination of influencing factors based on whether it is conducive to thermal diffusion the ratio of tdc is defined as the tdc of each combination of influencing factors divided by the tdc with the minimum requirement for good diffusion that is h 5 0 m st 0 8 and μ x 1 0 m s α 1 represents conditions that are greatly conducive to thermal diffusion when 0 8 α 1 the conditions are conducive to thermal diffusion 0 5 α 0 8 represents conditions that restrict the diffusion of thermal plumes and α 0 5 represents conditions that are not conducive to the diffusion of warm water the formula is as follows α μ x 1 β st 0 8 α is the ratio of tdc and β is the coefficient of h according to the tdc formula the value of β is shown in table 5 within the range of h mentioned in table 3 h and the coefficient of h are approximately linearly distributed based on the formula above the order of α of each outlet in this study is consistent with that in table 3 and the ratio of tdc has a good linear correlation with tdc fig 5 which proves that the formula is reasonable in the south china sea the water depth condition is more conducive to thermal diffusion than those in other three major sea areas of china however the current velocity there is the weakest always less than 0 5 m s feng et al 2015 under this condition the maximum value of α in the south china sea is 0 63 when the emission source is set offshore and with a great water depth the current velocity in the east china sea is the highest with an average of 1 5 m s feng et al 2015 if h 2 m and st 0 94 or h 3 5 m and st 0 6 α 0 8 that is conducive or greatly conducive to thermal diffusion in the bohai sea area μ x is generally 0 5 1 0 m s feng et al 2015 only when μ x 0 8 and offshore deep water discharge occurs are conditions more conducive to the diffusion of thermal plumes the range of current velocity in the yellow sea is very wide according to the three dimensional basic model and the ratio of tdc mentioned above the hydrodynamic condition in the east china sea is more conducive to the diffusion of warm water than that in the south china sea moreover the basic assumption of the model is that the particles of high heat fluid have the same hydrodynamic characteristics as those of a normal fluid in the south china sea a weak stratification phenomenon appears in summer which confines the warm thermal plume within the upper few meters of water the discharge of warm water further increases the surface water temperature which enhances stratification tang et al 2003 therefore the tdc in the south china sea may be lower than the theoretical value of the model especially in summer secondly takesue and tsuruta 1978 found that decreases in chlorophyll a and photosynthetic activity caused by thermal discharge were lower where the natural seawater temperature was lower in addition some researchers found that the impact of marine phytoplankton zeng 2008 briand 1975 copepods and other zooplankton hoffmeyer et al 2005 caused by thermal discharge was lower in winter when the natural seawater temperature was lower than that in summer when the natural seawater temperature was higher in contrast some studies have indicated that if the background water temperature is below 26 c a slight increase in the temperature increases the macrobenthic abundance hu and yang 2001 han 2012 found that elevated temperatures in spring and autumn have positive impacts on the number of taxa and the density of polychaeta and arthropoda furthermore in the north temperate regions of china the seasonal variation of temperature of the receiving water is large marine organisms have acclimate the fluctuation of seawater temperature otherwise in the subtropical and tropical regions of china the seasonal variation in seawater temperature is relatively small marine organisms have acclimate the approximate same seawater temperature a little increment of seawater temperature may have a great impact on marine organisms on the whole a further southward location of a cnatpp corresponds to a greater maximum temperature which increases the possibility of reaching the upper limit of sensitive biological temperature and corresponds to a smaller seasonal gap in temperature resulting in poorer marine organism adaptability to temperature changes therefore the adverse effects of thermal pollution on aquatic organisms are generally more obvious in subtropical and tropical regions smythe and sawyko 2000 wei et al 2018 briand 1975 in summary the results of this study can provide a comprehensive measurement tool for the planning site selection and layout of cnatpps to reduce the impact of its thermal pollution on aquatic organisms in receiving water on the coast of china the east china sea has the largest current velocity which is conducive to the diffusion of warm water especially in hangzhou bay where the current velocity is large and in the northern jiangsu province which has a warm temperate zone monsoon climate the impact of thermal pollution caused by cnatpps on aquatic organisms is relatively small however in the south china sea although the water depth condition is the best the current velocity is the smallest belonging to the tropical area the thermal discharge from cnatpps has a relatively large impact on aquatic organisms 4 conclusions among these five influencing factors the sensitivity indices of current velocity and shoreline topography were the same and the largest which were classed as highly sensitive parameters the sensitivity index of the horizontal diffusion coefficient was classified as a sensitive parameter current velocity the horizontal diffusion coefficient and shoreline topography are linearly correlated with tdc the sensitivity indices of the horizontal diffusion coefficient and water depth are variable and were between the small to negligible parameters and the sensitive parameters the contribution rates of the current velocity and shoreline topography were both 0 32 ranging from 0 287 0 333 while those of the horizontal diffusion coefficient vertical diffusion coefficient and water depth were 0 16 0 144 0 167 0 11 0 004 0 167 and 0 09 0 0 279 respectively in terms of the contribution rate distribution the rates of the horizontal diffusion coefficient and shoreline topography were relatively small while those of the vertical diffusion coefficient and water depth were relatively large the shoreline topography close to the outfall affects the tdc of the emitting source of cnatpps rather than the geographical location of the sea area where the study area is located the results of this study can provide a comprehensive measurement tool for the planning site selection and layout of cnatpps to reduce the impact of its thermal pollution on aquatic organisms in receiving water considering the tdc and thermal sensitivity of marine organisms it might be assumed that the same heat and the same volume of thermal pollution may have smaller impacts on marine organisms in the east china sea than in the south china sea declaration of

17467,in recent years to meet the needs of economic development an increasing number of coastal nuclear power plants and thermal power plants cnatpps have used seawater as the source and sink of cooling water considering six cnatpps along the coast of china based on the model of conservation of mass and energy for an environmental fluid medium this study quantitatively evaluates the thermal diffusion capacity tdc and contribution rate of factors influencing the thermal plume the results showed that 1 the current velocity shoreline topography and horizontal diffusion coefficient are linearly correlated with the tdc the former two variables were the same and the largest and are highly sensitive parameters 2 the average contribution rates of the current velocity and shoreline topography were the largest at 0 32 and that of the water depth ranged from 0 to 0 28 3 the shoreline topography close to the outfall affects the tdc of the emitting source of cnatpps rather than the geographical location and 4 this study can provide a comprehensive measurement tool for the planning site selection and layout of cnatpps to reduce the impact of their thermal pollution on aquatic organisms in the receiving water considering the tdc and thermal sensitivity of marine organisms it might be assumed that the same heat and the same volume of thermal pollution may have smaller impacts on marine organisms in the east china sea than in the south china sea graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords thermal discharge thermal diffusion capacity contribution rate sensitivity 1 introduction anthropogenic excess heat such as cooling water discharged from thermal and nuclear power plants has been recognized as a form of pollution in reservoirs lakes and rivers since the middle of the twentieth century davidson and bradshaw 1967 dracup and fogabty 1974 scherer 1975 in recent years to satisfy the demands for water intake and thermal discharge an increasing number of thermal power plants and nuclear power plants have been built in coastal areas with seawater as the source and sink of cooling water these emissions of heat commonly known as thermal pollution affect ambient water temperature and consequently impact the entire aquatic food web on the one hand the increase in seawater temperature directly affects the environmental temperature impacting both the abundance and community structure of marine organisms lo et al 2004 chew et al 2015 worthington et al 2015 jiang 2016 on the other hand the increase in seawater temperature affects marine organisms through the food web lin et al 2018 found that the elevated temperature caused by thermal discharge from a power plant affected the growth of macrobenthos in the study area by significantly affecting the abundance and community structure of the phytoplankton and zooplankton therein the impact on aquatic ecology has become an important issue in the field of ocean and environmental protection shiers and marks 1973 the magnitude and range of thermal plume influences on receiving water bodies in different coastal nuclear power plants and thermal power plants cnatpps are quite different wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2015a xu 2014 many factors influence thermal effluent behavior including tidal waves and the velocity and direction of tidal currents zhang et al 2013 jia et al 2016 the location of emitting sources jia et al 2016 cheng et al 2011 seabed topography cheng et al 2011 waves hu 2009 water depth liu et al 2017 and the direction and velocity of the wind lentz and largier 2006 hydrodynamic conditions are considered to be the main factors affecting thermal effluent behavior wang and xiong 2013 wang et al 2013 1 some studies have shown that when the area of the bay is sufficiently large tidal prism has little influence on thermal plume diffusion since the amount of water actually involved in mixing close to the emitting source plays a decisive role in the dilution and diffusion of the thermal plume tang et al 2016 the influence range of the thermal plume is larger in neap tide than in spring tide larger in winter than in summer jia et al 2016 and also larger in ebb tide than in flood tide wang and xiong 2013 2 among the estuary bay and open sea area which are three locations of outfall the influence range of thermal plume is believed to be largest in the bay and smallest in the open sea jia et al 2016 some researchers found that in near shore regions heat plumes can be trapped by coastal currents without being dispersed across the water body salgueiro et al 2015 råman et al 2017 3 a larger slope of the topography corresponds to stronger orientation of the diffusion of thermal discharge in the horizontal direction in contrast thermal discharge has a greater impact in the vertical direction cheng et al 2011 the temperature difference among the water column is significant when the thermal plume is transported from the submarine shoal to the deep water area and passes through the sharp slope area zhu 2014 4 the water depth and velocity close to the outfall are considered to be the major factors affecting the diffusion range of a thermal plume liu et al 2017 the influence range of a thermal plume becomes smaller when the flow velocity is relatively large and the flow moves toward the open sea jia et al 2016 however systematic and quantitative studies on the contributions of cnatpp factors influencing thermal plume behavior in the affected area are lacking several methodologies ranging from physical models to numerical models are available two dimensional mathematical models are commonly used in the numerical simulation of thermal discharge from cnatpps such as the k ε turbulence model mcguirk et al 1978 and mike 21 model feng et al 2018 three dimensional mathematical models must be established under the conditions of complex tidal effects and bottom discharge such as the princeton ocean model pom cai et al 2014 finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom zhu 2014 rma 10 model yan et al 2016 and cornell mixing zone expert system cormix zhang et al 2017 in recent years the combination of two numerical models suh 2001 råman vinnå et al 2017 or combining a two dimensional numerical model with a physical model has also been used to study thermal plume behavior guo et al 2018 whether using a numerical model or a physical model the modeling process is time consuming and laborious and requires a tremendous amount of basic data moreover these models are commonly used in the process of cnatpp planning and site selection comprehensive quantitative indices that can reflect the thermal diffusion capacity tdc at the outfall and therefore help us make sound decisions easily and quickly are lacking especially those involving comparisons among multiple regions based on the model of conservation of mass and energy for an environmental fluid medium this study quantitatively evaluates the contribution rates of factors influencing thermal plumes from cnatpps such as the current velocity water depth and shoreline topography near the outfall the coefficient of tdc was also defined to establish a comprehensive evaluation tool for cnatpp planning and site selection in this paper only the surface discharge of cnatpps is involved 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sites in this study six study sites with concentrated distributions large installed capacities and surface discharge were selected including hyh tw hzw nd fq and hm fig 1 and table 1 the abbreviations and their corresponding full names are shown in table 2 these six sites represent the cnatpps in all four major sea areas of china and also the cnatpps in different geographic settings with different offshore distances to the outlet for example hyh hzw fq and hm represent cnatpps in a bay and tw and nd represent cnatpps in the open sea at all the study sites except for fq the cooling water from the cnatpps discharges near the shore by the end of 2017 the discharging outlet in hyh is hyh in tw the outlet is tw in hzw the discharging outlets are qs phase i qs phase ii qs phase iii qs phase i extension jx phase i jx phase ii jx phase iii and cj in nd the discharging outlet is nd in the fq the outlet is fq and in hm the discharging outlet is hm among these sites the duration of tides in the area near the outfalls of hyh and hm are irregular semidiurnal tides while those of tw hzw nd and fq are regular semidiurnal tides the tidal current in all study sites shows rectilinear current movement see the attached table 1 for the characteristics of the sea area at outlets in the study area 2 2 method 2 2 1 construction of a three dimensional basic model the basic assumption of the model of conservation of mass and energy for an environmental fluid medium is that heat exists in a fluid and the particles of high heat fluid have the same hydrodynamic characteristics as those of a normal fluid that is no stratification exists and differences in the current direction and current velocity in the whole water column are minimally affected after entering a small volume element heat can be evenly dispersed without condensation precipitation and volatilization particles with heat can be considered normal fluid particles for research based on the assumption mentioned above a three dimensional basic model is proposed to reflect the tdc of study area with parameters such as current velocity flow direction water depth and shoreline topography near the emitting source 1 basic model if pollutant concentration gradients exist in the three directions of x y and z the basic environmental quality model can be written as follows 1 c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 d z 2 c z 2 u x c x u y c

current velocity in the x y and z directions m s k reaction rate constant 1 2 steady state mass and heat transfer model for the three dimensional basic model the following assumptions are made considering the current velocity and ignoring the thermal diffusion in the x axis direction and ignoring the velocity and considering the thermal diffusion in the y axis and z axis directions we also assume that the heat will not be consumed or increased in the fluid that is k 0 based on the above assumptions the integration is performed in a uniform flow field i e steady state 2 c x y z q 4 π x d

al 2014 chen 2007 2 2 2 contribution rate based on the morris screening method the sensitive indices of each variable in each combination are calculated the contribution rate of each influencing factor in a combination is the ratio of the sensitive indices of each influencing factor to the sum of the sensitive indices of all influencing factors in the combination sensitivity analyses are performed to observe changes in model output caused by a small change in model parameters within the value range beck 1983 morris 1991 the traditional local parameter sensitivity analysis method causes an artificial disturbance near the best estimate value of a certain parameter and calculates the change rate of model output caused by fluctuations in parameters in this small range the morris screening method is a widely used local sensitivity analysis method francos et al 2003 xu and mynett 2006 hao et al 2004 the morris screening method randomly changes one of the parameters xi within the threshold range of variables and then runs the model to obtain the objective function y x y x1 x2 x3 xn in this method we use ee the output value of the influence to determine the influential degree of the parameter change morris 1991 francos et al 2003 12 e i y y δ i where y is the output value after the parameter change y is the output value before the parameter change and δ i is the

percentage of change in the i 1th operation with respect to the parameter value after calibration and n is the number of model operations based on the morris screening method the sensitivity index and the contribution rates of influencing factors are calculated under various combinations of possible values for all variables in the process of sensitivity index calculation the percentages of changes in parameters were in small ranges of 10 5 5 and 10 the value range interval and basis of each parameter are shown in table 3 j variables value within their value range in any combination the objective function is y x1 x2 x3 xj and the formula of the contribution rate of any variable xi is as follows 15 c x i s x i 0 i s x i where c xi is the contribution rate of xi and s xi is the sensitivity index of xi 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of factors influencing tdc 3 1 1 tdcs close to outlets at each study site as shown in fig 2 the tdcs close to the fq and jx phase iii outlets were the largest at ebb tide at more than 5 106 m3 h the tdcs close to the qs phase iii jx phase i and jx phase ii outlets were the second largest and that of nd was the smallest at approximately 4 105 m3 h concerning the tdcs at the six study sites that in the fq was the largest and that in the nd was the smallest at ebb tide the tdc close to cnatpp outlets at flood tide was quite different with a maximum difference of approximately 6 times the tdc close to the qs phase ii was the largest at greater than 8 5 106 m3 h the tdcs close to the qs phase i and qs phase iii were the second largest and that of tw was the smallest at approximately 1 5 106 m3 h the tdc in the six study sites at flood tide was largest in the hzw followed by that in the fq and the tdc in the nd was smallest according to the comparison at flood tide and ebb tide except for those near the hyh tw and hm the tdcs close to the outlets of each power plant at flood tide were greater than those at ebb tide the tdcs during flood tide are close to the outlet of cnatpps in nd and in hzw except that cj is far greater than that during ebb tide the sums of tdcs of cnatpps during flood tide and ebb tide were quite different with a maximum difference of approximately 6 times the tdcs close to the outlet of qs phase i qs phase iii jx phase iii and fq were largest at approximately 1 2 107 m3 h in the study sites fq had the largest value hzw had the second largest value and nd had the smallest value 3 1 2 contribution rate of influencing factors to assess the calculated sensitivity indices are ranked in four classes s 1 indicates very high sensitivity 0 2 s 1 indicates high sensitivity 0 05 s 0 2 indicates medium sensitivity and 0 s 0 05 indicates small to negligible sensitivity lenhart et al 2002 from the sensitivity analysis of five influencing factors only values of the sensitivity of μ x shoreline topography st and dywere observed in each combination that is these parameters are linearly related to the tdc the sensitivity indices of μ x and st were the same and the largest indices the largest index was 1 representing a highly sensitive parameter the sensitivity index of dy was 0 50 which was classified as a sensitive parameter μ x dyand st are linearly correlated with tdc the sensitivity indices of dz and h are variable the former was 0 35 0 01 0 50 and the latter was 0 31 0 0 97 which were between the small to negligible parameters and the sensitive parameters as shown in fig 3 a in any condition the contribution rates of u x and st were the same and ranked first in the whole combination within the range of parameter values the percentages of the contribution rates of h ranking third fourth and fifth were 32 6 and 62 respectively the percentages of the contribution rates of dy ranking third and fourth were 54 and 46 respectively the percentages of the contribution rates of dz ranking third and fourth were 29 and 38 respectively as shown in fig 3b in all combinations the average contribution rates of u x and st were the largest at 0 32 0 287 0 333 the average contribution rates of dy dz and h were 0 16 0 144 0 167 0 11 0 004 0 167 and 0 09 0 0 279 respectively in terms of contribution rate dispersion in all combinations those of dy and st were relatively small and those of dz and h were relatively large regardless of the values that parameters take within their value ranges their contribution rates were only related to h and dz when h takes values from 1 0 m to 7 0 m the contribution rate ranges of μ x dy dz h and st are 0 29 0 33 0 26 0 00 0 15 0 17 0 02 0 17 and 0 29 0 33 respectively fig 3c the change in h had little effect on the contribution rates of μ x dyand st but had a considerable effect on the contribution rates of h and dz the contribution rate of h decreased with increasing h and the contribution rates of the other parameters increased with increasing h when dz takes values from 0 00005 m2 s 0 00055 m2 s the contribution rate ranges of μ x dy dz h and st are 0 33 0 31 0 02 0 14 0 17 0 15 0 15 0 08 and 0 33 0 31 respectively fig 3d the change in dzhad little effect on the contribution rates of μ x dyand st but had a considerable effect on the contribution rates of h and dz the contribution rate of h increased with increasing dz and the contribution rates of the other parameters decreased with increasing dz 3 1 3 identifying factors influencing tdc among these five influencing factors current velocity and shoreline topography contributed the most to the tdc although the average contribution rate of water depth to the tdc was relatively small the variation was greatest furthermore current velocity water depth and shoreline topography all have specific physical significance therefore only these three influencing factors were analyzed below in the six study sites the smallest μ x was in nd and the largest value was in hzw μ x in tw nd and hm was lower than 0 5 m s in fq and hyh the value was in the range of 0 5 1 0 m s in hzw the value was greater than 1 0 m s h in tw and hzw except for qs phase ⅰ extension was lower than 5 m s in nd fq and hm the value was in the range of 5 10 m s in hyh the value was greater than 10 m s st in hm was lower than 0 5 in hyh tw and hzw except for qs phase ⅰ and qs phase ⅲ the value was in the range of 0 5 0 8 in nd and fq the value was greater than 0 8 from the parameter values of cnatpps table 4 the st at the fq outlet is 1 00 therefore st was not the factor restricting the tdc the sensitivity index and contribution rates of h at the hyh qs phase i extension nd fq and hm outlets were all 0 table 2 that is the h at these five outlets was not the factor restricting the tdc as mentioned above μ x and st were the main factors restricting the tdc at the outlets in hyh qs phase i extension nd and hm μ x h and st together restricted the tdc of the outlets in tw qs phase i qs phase ii qs phase iii jx phase i jx phase ii jx phase iii cj and fq μ x was the main influencing factor that restricted the tdc at the outlet in fq in addition hangzhou bay has the strongest tidal current area along the coast of china with a large tidal current velocity feng et al 2015 except for cj the average current velocity at other outlets was above 1 00 m s the h values close to the outlet in tw and outlets in hzw except for the qs phase i extension were less than 5 m for st the emitting source at fq was offshore no shelter was identified near the outlet and the diffusion condition was the best although the outlet at qs phase i and qs phase iii was set along the coast the st values were greater than 0 8 and had only a small impact on heat diffusion in summary shoreline topography was the main influencing factor that restricted the tdc at the outlet in the qs phase i extension water depth was the main factor that restricted the tdcs at the outlets in qs phase i and qs phase iii the main factor influencing the tdc close to the outlet of fq was current velocity velocity and topography both restricted the tdcs of the outlets at hyh hm and nd water depth and shoreline topography were the main influencing factors that restricted the tdcs close to the outlets of qs phase ⅱ jx phase ⅰ jx phase ⅱ and jx phase ⅲ and the influencing factors of current velocity water depth and shoreline topography all restricted the heat diffusion near the outlets in tw and cj 3 2 general rules of influencing factors 1 water depth as shown in fig 4 when dz 0 0005 m2 s and dy 5 m2 s if h 3 0 m the sensitivity index of h was 0 7 sensitive parameter and the contribution rate of h was 21 if 3 0 m h 5 0 m the sensitivity index of h was 0 2 0 7 sensitive parameter and the contribution rate of h was 5 21 if h 5 0 m the sensitivity index of h was 0 2 medium sensitive parameter or small to negligible parameter and the contribution rate of h was 5 based on field observation data yin et al 2006 and lin et al 2018 as well as zhang et al 2015b wu and zhu 2017 cui 2008 zhu 2014 and zhang 2015 who employed the estuarine coastal and ocean modeling system with sediment ecomsed and fvcom found that the thermal discharge from cnatpps induces stratification in the surrounding outlet the report by wu and zhu 2017 regarding the yangtze river indicated that stratification occurs from the shore close to the outlet to a water depth of 3 m wang et al 2013 found stratification above a water depth of 5 m in the yellow sea while suh et al 2001 observed stratification in the upper layer above a water depth of 7 m in chonsu bay korea a study by cui 2008 in the south china sea found that the diffusion of warm water mainly occurred in the upper half of the total water depth 0 5 h in contrast zhang et al 2015b investigated the bohai sea and found that vertical stratification appeared in the upper 1 5 of the total water depth 0 2 h a study in the sines thermal power plant on the west portuguese coast salgueiro et al 2015 showed that the impact of the thermal plume was within the upper 4 m water depths huang et al 2019 by analyzing a study area with different tidal dynamic conditions in the east china sea and south china sea concluded that the thermocline caused by thermal pollution mostly occurred at water depths shallower than 7 m the results of this study are basically consistent with those of the studies mentioned above therefore h 3 0 m is not conducive to the diffusion of the thermal plume 3 0 m h 5 0 m restricts heat diffusion and h 5 0 m is conducive to thermal diffusion 2 shoreline topography in all combinations the sensitivity indices of st were always 1 and the contribution rates of st were between 29 and 33 st is an important factor affecting the tdc of cnatpps as shown in table 2 the current flow and water depth at the outlets of qs phase i qs phase ii and qs phase iii were the same the tdcs of qs phase ⅰ and qs phase ⅲ with an st greater than 0 8 ranked in the top five while those of the outlets of qs phase ii with an st of only 0 72 ranked eighth therefore st 0 8 is considered conducive to the diffusion of warm water 0 5 st 0 8 restricts the diffusion of the thermal plume and st 0 5 is not conducive to thermal diffusion based on the geographical location of each study site tw and nd are located in the open sea and other study sites are located in the bay the st values of tw and nd are less than 0 8 those of hyh and hm are less than 0 8 and that of fq is 1 in hzw the st values of different outlets vary substantially st can be inferred to have little relevance to the geographical location of the sea area where the study area is located compared with the emitting sources of cnatpps in estuaries bays and open seas jia et al 2016 found that the influential range of thermal plumes was the largest in bays and the smallest in open seas tang et al 2016 concluded that if the bay area was sufficiently large the distribution range of thermal pollution was less affected by the tidal prism the amount of water involved in mixing near the outfall plays a decisive role in the dilution and diffusion of the thermal plume råman vinnå et al 2017 believed that when thermal discharge occurs in the near shore region a heat plume can be trapped by coastal currents without being dispersed across the water body therefore we inferred that the shoreline topography close to the outfall affects the tdc of the emitting source of cnatpps rather than the geographical location of the sea area where the study area is located because the sea area near the outlet is open especially in the direction of current velocity the block of thermal diffusion near the outlet is small therefore it is conducive to the diffusion of heat this finding also indicates that if the area of the bay was sufficiently large it will not affect the diffusion of the thermal plume meanwhile if the shoreline topography is less sheltered it was not conducive to the heat plume being trapped by coastal currents 3 current velocity current velocity is one of the two influential factors that contribute most for the current velocity in the four sea areas in china certain rules apply the current velocity in bohai is generally 0 5 1 0 m s feng et al 2015 and that in laizhou bay and the center of bohai is relatively weak with a velocity mainly between 0 2 0 4 m s luo and liu 2015 the current velocity in the eastern yellow sea is larger than that in the western yellow sea the strong current area in the west of the yellow sea appears near the laotieshan channel and chengshantou sea area reaching 1 5 m s and some areas can reach 2 5 m s feng et al 2015 the current velocity of the south yellow sea is 0 2 1 6 m s ni 2014 the current velocity in the east china sea is larger near the shore than offshore the velocity can reach 1 5 m s along the zhejiang and fujian coasts the yangtze river estuary hangzhou bay and zhoushan islands are the strongest current areas along the coast of china which can reach 3 0 3 5 m s the current velocity in the south china sea is weak at less than 0 5 m s in most sea areas beibu bay is a relatively strong current area however it is less than 1 m s the strongest tidal current in qiongzhou bay can reach 2 5 m s feng et al 2015 as shown in table 2 the current velocity in the south china sea is the smallest and that in the east china sea except for nd is higher than that in the bohai sea therefore we inferred that μ x 1 0 m s is beneficial to the diffusion of thermal plumes 0 5 m s μ x 1 0 m s restricts thermal diffusion and μ x 0 5 m s is not conducive to the diffusion of warm water therefore in general if the study area is located in the bohai sea the current velocity restricts thermal diffusion if it is located in the east china sea the current velocity is conducive to thermal diffusion and if the study area is located in the south china sea the current velocity is not conducive to the diffusion of warm water 3 3 comprehensive suggestions based on influential factors according to the single influencing factor analysis in section 4 4 2 when h 3 0 m st 0 5 and μ x 0 5 m s these conditions are not conducive to the diffusion of the thermal plume when h 5 0 m st 0 8 and μ x 1 0 m s the conditions are conducive to thermal diffusion otherwise the joint effect of these influential factors on the tdc is difficult to judge as shown in section 3 2 1 the sensitivity indices of μ x and st were 1 indicating that they were directly proportional to the tdc while the sensitivity indices of h change with the change in h which is disproportional to the tdc therefore we define a ratio of tdc to classify the combination of influencing factors based on whether it is conducive to thermal diffusion the ratio of tdc is defined as the tdc of each combination of influencing factors divided by the tdc with the minimum requirement for good diffusion that is h 5 0 m st 0 8 and μ x 1 0 m s α 1 represents conditions that are greatly conducive to thermal diffusion when 0 8 α 1 the conditions are conducive to thermal diffusion 0 5 α 0 8 represents conditions that restrict the diffusion of thermal plumes and α 0 5 represents conditions that are not conducive to the diffusion of warm water the formula is as follows α μ x 1 β st 0 8 α is the ratio of tdc and β is the coefficient of h according to the tdc formula the value of β is shown in table 5 within the range of h mentioned in table 3 h and the coefficient of h are approximately linearly distributed based on the formula above the order of α of each outlet in this study is consistent with that in table 3 and the ratio of tdc has a good linear correlation with tdc fig 5 which proves that the formula is reasonable in the south china sea the water depth condition is more conducive to thermal diffusion than those in other three major sea areas of china however the current velocity there is the weakest always less than 0 5 m s feng et al 2015 under this condition the maximum value of α in the south china sea is 0 63 when the emission source is set offshore and with a great water depth the current velocity in the east china sea is the highest with an average of 1 5 m s feng et al 2015 if h 2 m and st 0 94 or h 3 5 m and st 0 6 α 0 8 that is conducive or greatly conducive to thermal diffusion in the bohai sea area μ x is generally 0 5 1 0 m s feng et al 2015 only when μ x 0 8 and offshore deep water discharge occurs are conditions more conducive to the diffusion of thermal plumes the range of current velocity in the yellow sea is very wide according to the three dimensional basic model and the ratio of tdc mentioned above the hydrodynamic condition in the east china sea is more conducive to the diffusion of warm water than that in the south china sea moreover the basic assumption of the model is that the particles of high heat fluid have the same hydrodynamic characteristics as those of a normal fluid in the south china sea a weak stratification phenomenon appears in summer which confines the warm thermal plume within the upper few meters of water the discharge of warm water further increases the surface water temperature which enhances stratification tang et al 2003 therefore the tdc in the south china sea may be lower than the theoretical value of the model especially in summer secondly takesue and tsuruta 1978 found that decreases in chlorophyll a and photosynthetic activity caused by thermal discharge were lower where the natural seawater temperature was lower in addition some researchers found that the impact of marine phytoplankton zeng 2008 briand 1975 copepods and other zooplankton hoffmeyer et al 2005 caused by thermal discharge was lower in winter when the natural seawater temperature was lower than that in summer when the natural seawater temperature was higher in contrast some studies have indicated that if the background water temperature is below 26 c a slight increase in the temperature increases the macrobenthic abundance hu and yang 2001 han 2012 found that elevated temperatures in spring and autumn have positive impacts on the number of taxa and the density of polychaeta and arthropoda furthermore in the north temperate regions of china the seasonal variation of temperature of the receiving water is large marine organisms have acclimate the fluctuation of seawater temperature otherwise in the subtropical and tropical regions of china the seasonal variation in seawater temperature is relatively small marine organisms have acclimate the approximate same seawater temperature a little increment of seawater temperature may have a great impact on marine organisms on the whole a further southward location of a cnatpp corresponds to a greater maximum temperature which increases the possibility of reaching the upper limit of sensitive biological temperature and corresponds to a smaller seasonal gap in temperature resulting in poorer marine organism adaptability to temperature changes therefore the adverse effects of thermal pollution on aquatic organisms are generally more obvious in subtropical and tropical regions smythe and sawyko 2000 wei et al 2018 briand 1975 in summary the results of this study can provide a comprehensive measurement tool for the planning site selection and layout of cnatpps to reduce the impact of its thermal pollution on aquatic organisms in receiving water on the coast of china the east china sea has the largest current velocity which is conducive to the diffusion of warm water especially in hangzhou bay where the current velocity is large and in the northern jiangsu province which has a warm temperate zone monsoon climate the impact of thermal pollution caused by cnatpps on aquatic organisms is relatively small however in the south china sea although the water depth condition is the best the current velocity is the smallest belonging to the tropical area the thermal discharge from cnatpps has a relatively large impact on aquatic organisms 4 conclusions among these five influencing factors the sensitivity indices of current velocity and shoreline topography were the same and the largest which were classed as highly sensitive parameters the sensitivity index of the horizontal diffusion coefficient was classified as a sensitive parameter current velocity the horizontal diffusion coefficient and shoreline topography are linearly correlated with tdc the sensitivity indices of the horizontal diffusion coefficient and water depth are variable and were between the small to negligible parameters and the sensitive parameters the contribution rates of the current velocity and shoreline topography were both 0 32 ranging from 0 287 0 333 while those of the horizontal diffusion coefficient vertical diffusion coefficient and water depth were 0 16 0 144 0 167 0 11 0 004 0 167 and 0 09 0 0 279 respectively in terms of the contribution rate distribution the rates of the horizontal diffusion coefficient and shoreline topography were relatively small while those of the vertical diffusion coefficient and water depth were relatively large the shoreline topography close to the outfall affects the tdc of the emitting source of cnatpps rather than the geographical location of the sea area where the study area is located the results of this study can provide a comprehensive measurement tool for the planning site selection and layout of cnatpps to reduce the impact of its thermal pollution on aquatic organisms in receiving water considering the tdc and thermal sensitivity of marine organisms it might be assumed that the same heat and the same volume of thermal pollution may have smaller impacts on marine organisms in the east china sea than in the south china sea declaration of

sludge source wwtps are the central unit of urban sewage purification systems which are used to purifythe domestic industrial hospital commercial and agricultural wastewater syed hassan et al 2017 sludge is an unavoidable byproduct from the treatment processes including primary treatment physical or chemical secondary treatment biological anaerobic digestion process biological and dewatering process chen et al 2018d zaker et al 2019 the illustration of integrated sludge treatment in wwtps is depicted in fig 1 in the primary treatment the sewage slowly passes through the primary clarifiers due to the gravitational differences grease and foam rise to the surface while the solid matter settles at the bottom of tank which is called primary sludge the secondary treatment stage is primarily a microbial treatment process utilizing microorganisms to immobilize the organic components and to remove non colloidal solids in wastewater secondary sludge is produced from secondary settling tank after the aerobic bioreactors such as conventional activated sludge system membrane biological reactor and anaerobic anoxic oxic process pathak et al 2009 syed hassan et al 2017 anaerobic digestion is

anaerobic digestion sludgeas well wu et al 2018 dewatered sludge refers to the solid residue after wet sludge dewatering by means of physical and chemical methods the compositions and characteristics of sludge are much more variable than those of classical biomass which are significantly affected by sewage properties and loadings entering the unit the treatment system used in wwtps environmental legislation and seasonal variations syed hassan et al 2017 tytła et al 2016 moreover the compositions and characteristics of sludge from the same wwtps may vary from day to day 2 1 2 physicochemical properties of sludge in order to reduce the complexity of sludge used for subsequent thermochemical strategies it is important to clarify its physicochemical properties the components of sewage sludge includenitrogen and phosphorous compounds organic carbon compounds inorganic salts pathogens and water rulkens 2008 the nontoxic organic compounds approximately 60 on a dry basis mainly consist of bacterial constituents including nucleic acids proteins polysaccharides humic substance lipids decay products and undigested organic substances chen et al 2018d nitrogen in sludge mainly originates from protein ranging from 0 1 to 18 in weight sludge also contains high concentrations of inorganic salts including inorganic ions e g co3 2 po4 3 so4 2 and no3 toxic heavy metals e g zn pb ni cd cr cu as and hg and other elements e g si al k na ca and mg tytła et al 2016 these metals are from the municipal agriculture and industrial wastewateras well as the processes of runoff and corrosion of sewerage system about 50 80 of themetal species entering the wwtps will be fixed into sludge through physicochemical and biological processes tytła et al 2016 van de velden et al 2008 previous studies indicated that different organic compounds and inorganic salts would be transformed into biochar with different properties huang et al found that metal ions catalyze the graphitization process and improve the subsequent catalytic performance of biochar during the thermochemical process implying that organic species and metal ions play important roles in improving the physiochemical features of the biochar formed during thermal treatment huang et al 2018 additionally various organic compounds e g persistent organic pollutants pharmaceuticals and personal care products microplastics and pathogenic micro organisms are also found in sludge which may cause significant environmental risks martín pozo et al 2019 recently large amounts of genes resistant to sulfonamides tetracyclines and macrolides have been detected in sludge ezzariai et al 2018 these antibiotic resistant genes can be easily transmitted through bacterial division and horizontal gene transfer between micro organisms in the environment which areemerging micropollutants and may pose a potential threat to regional and global ecological systems pazda et al 2019 2 1 3 moisture content of sludge sludge from wwtps contains over 90 moisture by weight the water in sludge can be categorized as free water interstitial water vicinal water and bound water wei et al 2018 free water is detached from the sludge particles which accounts for about 70 of the sludge moisture and can be easily removed by mechanical dewatering chen et al 2015b vaxelaire and cézac 2004 interstitial water is trapped within the spaces of flocs and micro organisms which can be converted into free water via destroying the flocs and microbial cells removal of free and interstitial water is relatively easy by mechanical dewatering mikkelsen and keiding 2002 wei et al 2018 in contrast vicinal water is tightly attached on the sludge particle surfaces byhydrogen bonding the bound water exists inside the microbial cells accounting for 10 of the sludge moisture which can be removed by thermal treatment freeze thaw and heat treatment and aops chen et al 2018c lee and wang 2000 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 the contentsand categories of water in sludge have significant impacts on the subsequent transportation and treatment moreover the selection of dewatering methods has important impacts on the subsequent heat treatment of sludge and may result in different sludge properties 2 2 sludge dewatering treatment conventional mechanical dewatering processes can eliminate partial free and interstitial water for which it is necessary to destroy the sludge flocs by physical and chemical methods thereby further releasing the existing bound water erdincler and vesilind 2003 sludge flocs contain microbial colonies and outer extracellular polymers eps eps as a highly hydrated biopolymer are mainly classified into soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps which play an important role in the process of bioflocculation and solid water separation li and yang 2007 yu et al 2010 eps mainly consist of lipids 40 carbohydrates 40 95 protein like compounds 60 dna 10 aquatic humic substances and small moleculesthat can affect the physicochemical properties of sludge which is the dominant factor contributing to the difficulty in sludge dewatering sheng et al 2010 diverse pretreatments including both physical and chemical methods have been applied to improve the sludge dewaterability physical treatments include thermal frozen electrical microwave and ultrasonic stimulations feng et al 2009 hu et al 2011 chemical treatments refer to the use of acid alkali surfactants coagulants and oxidants to influencesludge properties for enhancing the dewatering performance table 1 chen et al 2018c wei et al 2018 2 2 1 freeze thaw method freeze thaw method in sludge dewatering relies on the temperature below the freezing point and the method is generally applicable in winter of cold regions the effect of sludge dewatering is related to the freezing rate and temperature kinsley et al 2012 a lower temperature and a thinner sludge layer lead to a faster melting rate of sludge during the melting process the ice is dissolved and removed leaving the sludge solids with a low content of water diak and örmeci 2018 generally the volume of sludge can be reduced by 85 96 under gravity drainage natural freeze thaw method is a handy and low cost technology for sludge treatment without intensive energy consumption or discharging greenhouse gasses but is limited by season and region diak and örmeci 2018 diak et al 2011 kinsley et al 2012 2 2 2 heat treatment heat can improve the sludge dewatering performance by decreasingits viscosity changing its surface structure and releasing eps the temperature for heat treatment usually ranges from 40 c to 210 c wang et al 2019b when the temperature increases to above 120 c the heat treatment is capable of destroying the cell wall and decomposing the heat resistant biological molecules wang and li 2015 after heat treatment the binding energy of water is reduced and most of the input energy is expended to destroy bound water and solid particles typically when the temperature exceeds 180 c the majority of free water molecules exist as moisture in the sludge and the residual solid displays a higher carbonization degree with a large amount of oxygen containing functional groupscompared to raw sludge which is detailed in section 3 1 3 wang et al 2017c however this study also showed that the capillary water suction time cst of sludge improved from 0 44 s to 4 18 s when the temperature increased from 20 c to 135 c indicating that the dewatering performance deteriorated at high temperatures liu et al also proposed that the proteins in s eps had an important effect on the dewatering performance of sludge under heat treatment from 105 c to 170 c liu et al 2019 2 2 3 microwave treatment microwave can damage the cells and eps of sludge to enhance the solubility and release of organic matter the influence of microwave on sludge dewatering performance is related to the intensity and duration of the radiation as well as the type and concentration of sludge liu et al 2016a yu et al found that the dewatering performance was enhanced with increased microwave intensity 500 900 w and proper irradiation duration 0 140 s the best sludge dewatering performance was achieved at the microwave intensity of 900 w for 60 s yu et al 2009 liu et al indicated that high temperature had a positive impact on sludge destruction but the release of organic matter led to greater electronegativity of sludge and affected the dewatering performance liu et al 2016a notably ph has a great influence on sludge dewatering during microwave treatment under acidic condition the electronegativity and size of sludge are reduced and dewatering performance is improved liu et al reported that the best performance of sludge dewatering was achieved when ph was 2 5 and the temperature of microwave treatment was 100 c with the microwave temperature range of 40 100 c liu et al 2016a 2 2 4 acid base treatment adjusting the ph value of sludge not only improves the flocculation of sludge but also breaks cells and releases intracellular substances under extreme ph conditions after the acid base treatment the electrostatic repulsive force of eps increases and the adhesive forces between the sludge cells and eps are destroyed moreover eps is partially dissolved and released into the surroundings mikkelsen and keiding 2002 to explore the mechanisms of sludge acidification and provide a theoretical basis for practical application wei et al reported that the dewatering performance of sludge first improved and then deteriorated as the ph decreased from 7 to 3 indicating that acidcan destroy sludge flocs and induce eps to release bound water wei et al 2019 on the other hand eps can be effectively compressed due to the protonation effect and can adhere tightly to the sludge particles both processes can improve the dewatering performance of sludge but the former destruction of sludge flocs is an irreversible process while the latter protonation effect is a reversible process control of sludge ph is a simple method for sludge treatment and disposal however as the treated sludge with extreme ph would impact the environment further regulation is required 2 2 5 coagulant and flocculant the treatment of sludge using aforementioned methods is typically aimed at improving the dewatering performance by destroying the cells and eps although such treatment will influence the compositions and physicochemical properties of sludge the subsequent impact on the thermochemical process of sdbcs may not be obvious since no additional substances chemicals are added the chemical treatment methods require the addition of surfactant coagulant or oxidant which would affect the compositions of sludge moreover the addition of metals or organic substances will have a great impact on the preparation of biochar yu et al 2019 conventional coagulants such as polyaluminum chloride pac and iron salts fe3 can intensify the flocculation of sludge by electrostatic neutralization and hydroxide formation which are beneficial for the coacervation of small sludge colloid and sludge dewaterability improvement wei et al 2018 yang et al demonstrated that the best efficacy of sludge dewaterability was achieved with 1 54 g l 1 pac yang et al 2019a in addition fe3 coagulant displays the merits of low cost fast sedimentation low toxicity applicability over a wide ph range and a better performance than pac organic polymer flocculants mainly include polyacrylamide pam and its derivatives pam is used to improve the filtering performance in mechanical dewatering luo et al 2011 however this process has limitations because it cannot degrade eps and cells wang et al used a combination of fe3 and pam as well as pac and pam for sludge dewatering and found that the combination of coagulant and flocculant significantly improved the sludge dewatering performance wang et al 2019a the improved sludge dewatering may stem from the synergistic effect of flocculation and coagulation which induces the decomposition of microbial cells and the aggregation of sludge flocculates the addition of inorganic salts will also impact the performance of sludge for example pam and polyferric sulfate pfs can be used as the nitrogen and iron sources to prepare biochar from sludge via thermal treatment and the derived products possess magnetic property and are in situ doped with nitrogen dopants yu et al 2019 2 2 6 treatment by advanced oxidation process advanced oxidation is an emerging technique for sludge treatment in recent years in general reactive radicals with high oxidative potentialsare generated to destroy the sludge cells and release the bound water thereby improving the sludge dewaterability chen et al 2018c the specific filtration resistance of sludge is adjusted in the fenton reaction and the use of lime is effectively reduced by approximately 90 this is because hydroxyl radicals in the fenton reaction are destructive to eps and sludge cells leading to the release of bound water as free water in addition fe3 flocculates the sludge flocs to improve the filtration of sludge liang et al 2015 ding et al used the fenton method to treat sludge and found that the optimal sludge dewatering conditions were ph of 5 5 20 mg g 1 h2o2 and 80 mg g 1 fe2 as a result the moisture of sludge decreased from 85 3 to 73 8 ding et al 2018 sr aops are effective over a wide range of ph liu et al 2018 zhen et al found that the cst of sludge decreased by 88 8 in the first minute when the pds was 1 2 mmol g 1 and the fe2 was 1 5 mmol g 1 with the ph ranging from 3 to 8 5 potassium ferrate also has a strong oxidizing property zhen et al 2012 diak et al found that the use of gravity drainage can reduce the volume of sludge by 79 after treating sludge with potassium ferrate and freezing diak and örmeci 2018 additionally when the sludge was frozen for 3 days with 22 0 g l 1 potassium ferrate the content of melted water and the population of microbial community were lower than the detection limit suggesting that this method can be used for sterilization to reduce the environmental hazards of sludge therefore the treatment of sludge by aops not only improves the sludge dewaterability but also inactivates the pathogens in the sludge furthermore aops can degrade the organic pollutants in sludge and wastewater the addition of iron salt may induce secondary contamination requiring subsequent treatment and disposal of the dewatered sludge chen et al used zero valent iron zvi pds system to degrade the proteins in lb eps and s eps of anaerobic digestion sludge ads to increase the dewatering performance chen et al 2019c in order to avoid secondary pollution caused by the residual iron the iron containing anaerobic digestion sludge was converted into sludge biochar fe adsbc by one pot conventional pyrolysis similarly the sludge dewatered via fecl3 and pam was also annealed into a magnetic biochar catalyst to drive aops to remove organic pollutants wang et al 2017d 3 production and characteristicsof sludge biochar 3 1 sludge biochar production method raw anaerobic and dewatered sludge can be converted into sdbcs via diverse thermochemical strategies which mainly include conventional thermal pyrolysis 300 1000 c and 1 h dry pyrolysis microwave pyrolysis 0 3 300 ghz torrefaction 200 300 c and 10 60 min gasification 700 c and wet pyrolysis htc 180 250 c and 1 4 mpa the pyrolysis methods vary in terms of the duration and temperature during thermal treatment chen et al 2019b manara and zabaniotou 2012 the thermochemical strategies are economically and environmentally feasible for converting sewage sludge into valuable resources such as bio oil biogas and biochar chen et al 2018d the low thermal treatment temperature of torrefaction has no significant effect on the properties of biochar the biochar yield from gasification is typically very low thus the derived products from torrefaction and gasification are not suitable to be used as carbocatalysts as a result this review mainly focuses on thermal pyrolysis mwp and hydrothermal methods 3 1 1 conventional pyrolysis conventional pyrolysis is the most common strategy for biochar production manara and zabaniotou 2012 according to the heating rate the pyrolysis process is categorized into slow pyrolysis and fast pyrolysis slow pyrolysis over the temperature range from 300 to 700 c and low heating rate of 0 1 1 0 cs 1 yields the maximum amount of biochar while fast pyrolysis with a high heating rate of above 100 cs 1usually attains a higher bio oil yield li and hong 2017 the morphological physiochemical and catalytic properties of sdbcs are influenced by pyrolysis temperature ho et al 2017 yin et al 2019b when the pyrolysis temperature is below 300 c the surface chemical composition of sdbcs does not change significantly as a result of incomplete carbonization in contrast higher carbonization and graphitization degree are guaranteed after high temperature thermal treatment accompanied by the formation of cracks and porous structures from the released gas and volatile matter feng et al 2018 yuan et al 2013 more aggressive treatments using high temperatures and reactive atmospheres e g co2 and nh3 are commonly applied to intensify the pyrolysis in order to achieve increased ssa porous structures and diverse functional groups of sdbcs a temperature higher than 700 c can dramatically enhance the graphitic degree electrical conductivity and porosity of biochar which are favorable for pds activation ho et al 2019 in addition the characteristics of biochar can be changed under different atmospheres generally n2 or ar atmosphereis used as a protective gas for biochar production it is reported that co2 atmosphere can lead to higher ssa and more oxygen functional groups in biochar compared with n2 atmosphere at high temperature sun et al 2020 nh3 atmosphere can promote micropores production to prepare hierarchically porous n doped carbons liang et al 2014 the optimal temperature for conventional pyrolysis process is related to the major component and its content in sludge such as protein polysaccharide and lipid among them n content in sludge is mainly related to total protein quantity which can be decomposed into amine compounds during the conventional pyrolysis parnaudeau and dignac 2007 the catalytic activity of sdbcs primarily depends on the surface compositions and chemistry including the carbon content functional groups e g oh co c o ando c o and inorganic components such as sio2 al ox and especially the various iron species fe3o4 fe2o3 fe0 and fe3c 3 1 2 microwave assisted pyrolysis mwp is one of the most efficient thermochemical processes used for converting sludge into syngas bio oil and biochar morgan et al 2017 in conventional pyrolysis water in biomass may lower the heating efficiency because a significant amount of energy will be adsorbed consumed by water in contrast biomass containing water can increase microwave heating efficiency due to the high microwave absorption capacity of water li et al 2016 mwp is another advanced method to degrade sludge particles and release organic matters to improve the properties and dewater ability of sludge as discussed in section 2 2 3 the previous studies indicated that the ph value ssa and heavy metals hms stability of sdbc increased with the increase in mwp temperature whereas the nitrogen content yield and cation exchange capacity of sdbc decreased simultaneously tan et al 2017 zaker et al 2019 particularly sdbc is acidic at low temperature 300 400 c while sdbc prepared at high temperatures 700 c is alkaline hossain et al 2011 wet biomass can be treated using microwave treatment in the absence of microwave absorbers mwas however the addition of mwas and catalysts into sludge can improve the energy efficiency or raise the content of specific components in biogas bio oil and biochar in addition mwas can indirectly heat sludge affecting both the yield and quality of target product du et al 2011 li et al 2016 mushtaq et al 2014 for instance yu et al found that ni2o3 catalyst exhibited high activity in the disintegration of organic substances from sludge and significantly increased the yields of bio oil and pyrolytic gas yu et al 2014 inguanzo et al reported that sdbcs after microwave irradiation are highly microporous and are comparable to the products from conventional pyrolysis the derived bio oil and biogas have high heating values inguanzo et al 2002 another study showed that cao and fe2o3 can serve as catalysts to immobilize the heavy metals in biochar during mwp sun et al 2018 3 1 3 hydrothermal carbonization htc is a thermochemical process which involves treating waste biomass in hot and compressed water htc is also a pretreatment method for sludge patel et al 2015 when this process is adopted to concentrate the carbon content of wet biomass no pre drying is required making it a promising alternative for processing waste streams under certain conditions e g freezing and microwave yu et al 2017 moreover htc is an effective method for the dewatering of wet sludge as discussed in section 2 2 2 the technique causes the dissolution and breakage of flocs in suspended solids thus releasing bound water zhuang et al 2018 generally sludge is pyrolyzed for 1 24 h under 180 250 c in water via htc process resulting in a 36 72 yield of biochar peterson et al 2008 at a relatively low temperature 200 c hydrothermal biochar typically exhibits lower carbon content and higher oxygen content than the parent raw materials alatalo et al 2013 on the surface of hydrothermal biochar oxygen usually exists in the form of oxygen containing functional groups lachos perez et al 2017 zhang et al reported that carbon features were not observed in the x ray diffraction xrd spectra of sdbcs prepared via htc process indicating that htc did not achieve a high degree of carbonization zhang et al 2018 by mixing with ferric sludge and biological sludge the magnetic sdbcs showed larger ssa smaller pore size and higher carbonization degree additionally fe2o3 can be converted into fe3o4 on the surface of sdbcs at 200 240 c htc is a promising technology for sludge utilization and energy recovery due to the high contents of organic species and moisture which significantly reduce the processing costs 3 2 characteristics of sludge biochar 3 2 1 chemical compositions of biochar the content and type of elements contained in sdbcs varywith biomass feedstock and preparation conditions which usually have significant impacts on the subsequent applications of biochar ho et al 2017 huang et al 2018 generally carbon is the most dominant element in biomass the forms of carbon can be divided into organic components e g aromatic hydrocarbon aliphatic hydrocarbon and functional carbons and inorganic compounds e g bicarbonate and carbonate xiao et al 2018b during the thermochemical process the organic components undergo a series of reactions including dehydration devolatilization polymerization and aromatization which convert the organic components into aliphatic carbons 100 300 c and aromatic carbons 400 700 c xu and chen 2013 the graphitic structure was detected in biochar derived at high temperature indicating that alarge portion of carbon containing substances was converted into sp2 hybridized structure with strong π π interactions duan et al 2018c zhu et al 2018 inorganic components are decomposed into co2 or converted into metal oxides at high temperatures xiao et al 2018b hydrogen mainly includes aromatic hydrogen fatty hydrogen and hydrogen in functional groups xiao et al 2016 the forms of oxygen can also be divided into organic components e g hydroxyl carboxyl ester and carbonyl and inorganic components e g bicarbonate carbonate and phosphate these surface functional groups play important roles in determining the properties and applications of biochar during thermochemical processes higher temperature promotes the conversion of partial oxygen containing groups into co2 where the oxygen containing inorganic components contribute to the alkaline property of biochar nguyen and lehmann 2009 zimmerman 2010 in addition o c and h c atomic ratios can be respectively used to characterize the graphitization and aromaticity degree of biochar and the changes of oxygen group can be used to determine the carbon stability of biochar xiao et al 2016 zimmerman 2010 nitrogen mainly exists in the proteins in biomass after thermal treatment the produced nitrogen species are mainly pyridine n pyrrole n graphitized n and oxidized n which affect the adsorption performance and activity of biochar long et al 2019 xiao et al 2018b it was found that graphitized n played a major role in activating persulfate to produce reactive species chen et al 2019a in addition functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and amino groups may also contribute to the removal of pollutants by complexation with the increase in thermal treatment temperature the atomic ratios of o c h c n c and n o c were generally reduced resulting in a decrease in functional groups on the surface of biochar li et al 2017a sdbcs also contain some inorganic elements which are closely related to their pollutant removal ability metal ions can catalyze the graphitization process and improve the subsequent catalytic performance of biochar huang et al 2018 with increase in thermal treatment temperature the organic components in biochar gradually decompose while the inorganic components increase in content additionally phosphorus is a universal element in sludge which can be transformed from organic phosphorus to inorganic phosphorus cantrell et al 2012 fe is also an abundant element in sdbcs generally the compositions of fe containing nanoparticles can be regulated by the temperature and atmosphere during thermal treatment to form fe2o3 fe3o4 fe0 or iron carbides chen et al 2015a 3 2 2 surface physicochemical properties in a previous study the yield of biochar from sludge ranged from around 60 0 to 70 0 over the temperature range from 400 to 800 c ho et al 2017 it is obvious that the yield of sdbcs is generally higher than that of other biochar because sludge contains a large number of inorganic elements jin et al demonstrated that sludge biochar yield gradually reduced from 60 6 to 53 1 at 400 600 c due to the gradual disintegration of organic substances from sludge jin et al 2017 in addition elevated temperature results in larger ssa which is beneficial for adsorption and degradation of organic pollutants chang et al 2015 yuan et al 2015 however under some circumstances biochar generated at high temperature exhibits lower ssa and porosity because the skeleton of biochar is destroyed or blocked by tars yuan et al reported that the ssa of sdbcs was reduced by about 11 99 after fe loading which might be due to the blockage of porous structures by the increased size and number of nanoparticles α fe2o3 yuan and dai 2014 similarly the ph value of biochar varies with the thermal treatment temperature and sludge feedstock yuan et al revealed that the ph value of biochar generated at 300 c was acidic while biochar produced at higher temperature ranging from 400 to 700 c was alkaline possibly due to the disintegration of carbonate and organic acids yuan et al 2015 at a higher temperature the alkalinity of organic anion contained in biochar is also higher in the case of pollutant removal by biochar from water solution ph dramatically influences the surface charge of biochar ho et al 2017 when ph is above the point of zero charge phpzc the biochar with a negative charge prefers to bind with cationic pollutants which significantly influences the following absorption and catalytic processes in aops 3 2 3 persistent free radicals pfrs andpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs of sludge recently some researchers reported that pfrs in a carbonaceous material were relatively stable and capable of mediating reactive oxygen species ros including superoxide ion radical o2 oh and h2o2 pfrs can be categorized into three species of carbon centered pfrs g factors 2 0030 carbon centered pfrs with an adjacent oxygen atom g factors 2 0030 2 0040 and oxygen centered pfrs g factors 2 0040 fang et al 2014 fang et al 2015 oxygen centered pfrs are dominant at low thermal treatment temperature with short annealing duration and can be converted into carbon centered pfrs with the increase in thermal treatment temperature fang et al 2015 oxygen centered pfrs are the main active centers that catalyze persulfate to produce so4 at low thermal treatment temperature fang et al 2015 qin et al 2018 in addition the formation of pfrs and free radicals on biochar includes the chemical bond breaking of macromolecules and the substitution of metal oxide surface functional groups by aromatics dela cruz et al 2011 fang et al 2014 liao et al 2014 transition metals e g fe3 ni2 cu2 or zn2 not only promote the generation of pfrs in biochar but also regulate the reactivity of pfrs phenol or quinone moieties in biomass can transfer electrons to the transition metals in sludge during the thermochemical processes to generate surface bound pfrs the concentration of pfrs in biochar markedly decreases as conventional pyrolysis temperature increases from 400 c to 1000 c due to the reduction removal of oxygen groups and graphitization of carbon structure yang et al 2016 therefore the formation of toxic substances low pyrolyzed aromatic compounds in biochar can be restrained by increasing the temperature to decrease the potential environmental threats biochar is generally categorized into soluble and insoluble fractions yang et al 2018 the dissolved organic matter dom in biochar is mainly composed of aromatic co and carboxyl ester quinone moieties including protein fulvic humic acid like compounds and various pahs pahs are a class of pollutants in sludge that need to be treated due to their mutagenic and cancerogenic characteristics the conversion of sludge into biochar can greatly reduce the content of pahs resulting in a sharp decrease in the toxicity of sludge khan et al 2015 zielińska and oleszczuk 2016 a higher content of dom was extracted from biochar produced at a moderate temperature range from 400 to 550 c keiluweit et al 2012 smith et al 2016 the concentration of extractable dom decreased at a higher temperature 550 c due to the volatilization of the amorphous phase and the strong interaction between large aromatic molecules and biochar wang et al 2017a xiao et al 2018b the density evolution of dom with temperature is similar to that of pfrs in addition dom may play a positive role in the removal of pollutants it has been suggested that dom can produce 1o2and o2 under light irradiation the carbonyl structure is responsible for the production of 1o2 while the production of o2 is related to the electron transfer process of silicate in the dissolved biochar fu et al 2016 therefore thermal treatment of sludgeat a high temperature is a promising strategy to yield stable low toxic and efficient sdbcs in practical applications 4 activation of sludge biochar 4 1 mechanisms of persulfate activation 4 1 1 transition metal based catalyst transition metals oxides are classic catalysts for the activation of persulfates in fenton like aops via homogeneous or heterogeneous processes zhang et al 2019 the metal ions in the homogeneous process cannot be recovered easily causing additional post treatment expense and potential secondary pollution therefore heterogeneous catalysts are more popular in aops with high reactivity and satisfactory stability wang et al found that co3o4 nano rods exhibited great catalytic performance in pms activation to remove phenol with satisfactory stability and reusability wang et al 2015b liu et al investigated the catalytic performance of mno2 with different particle sizes 200 500 nm in pms activation and revealed that mno2 with smaller size showed higher activity for catalytic degradation liu et al 2016b previous studies have shown that mixed metal oxides display improved stability versatility redox potential and catalytic activity due to the enlarged ssa the mixed valence states of transition metals and the synergy among the redox couples of different metals wu et al 2014 xiao et al 2018a γ fe2o3 α mno2 nanocomposites exhibited remarkable performance in the catalytic activation of pds toproduce ros including oh so4 and o2 for rhodamine b rhb decomposition li et al 2019 iron based materials are most extensively studied due to their characteristics of abundance environmental safety low toxicity and prominent activity li et al used fe2 nzvi n for nanosized and nfe3o4 to activate pds achieving 24 4 27 8 and 5 8 removal of 2 4 dichlorophenol respectively zvi transferred electrons directly to pds as an efficient electron donor while surface corroded iron was released into water to react with pds homogeneously li et al 2015 leng et al revealed that fe3o4 activated pds and 50 of rhb removal was attained after 120 min in this system pds directly formed a complex over fe3o4 which further decomposed into so4 leng et al 2014 zheng et al applied magnetic and porous sulfurized fe2o3 composites to activate pms and generate oh and so4 for atrazine atz removal zheng et al 2019 the surface bonded hydroxyl group facilitated the binding with pms molecule which was subsequently activated by the redox metal sites of fe2 fe3 moreover the low valent sulfur species such as sulfite on the surface of the catalyst can accelerate the recovery of fe3 to fe2 to fulfill the redoxcycle in addition carbonaceous materials with large ssa can be used as a support to alleviate the agglomeration of iron based nanoparticles and effectively improve the performance in persulfate activation the oxygen group on the surface of carbon material can reduce fe3 to fe2 rgo fe3o4 effectively activated pds for the degradation of norfloxacin indicating that so4 oh and 1o2 were produced in rgo fe3o4 ps system yin et al 2019a xu et al used magnetic fe3o4 sepiolite composite as a catalyst to activate pds and the system removed 71 6 of atz and 20 9 of total organic carbon toc in 60 min respectively the catalytic activity and structural stability of fe3o4 sepiolite composite were maintained well during recycling xu et al 2019 yang et al manufactured two hybrid nanomaterials by decorating fe2o3 nanoparticles on the outer or inner surface of carbon nanotubes cnts i e fe2o3 fcnt l and fe2o3 fcnt h under different acid washing conditions thermal treatment temperatures and residence times figs 2 a c yang et al 2019b it was found that the former hybrid nanomaterial followed a traditional fenton like reaction pathway producing oh as ros while the latter presented an unprecedented reaction pathway generating 1o2 as ros based on chemical quenching experiment esr spectroscopy fig 2d and classical chemical probe detection with 9 10 diphenylanthracene dpa fig 2e 4 1 2 carbon based catalyst carbon is abundant in natural resources hence most carbon materials are green and sustainable and possess good biocompatibility large ssa high stability in nature and strong resistanceto acid and alkali recent studies have shown that carbon materials includinggraphene oxide go cnts diamond and activated carbon can be used to activate pds or pms to remove organic contaminants duan et al 2018a duan et al 2018c sun et al discovered that reduced graphene oxide rgo was capable of activating pms to produce so4 and the ketonic group c o located on the grain boundaries wasthe primary active site for pms activation sun et al 2012 duan et al used rgos with controlled category and level of oxygen moieties to activate pms and found that rgo with the highest content of c o exhibited the best activity duan et al 2016b additionally it was found that defective graphene id ig 1 70 with rich edge sites activated pms and completely decomposed phenol within 5 min via a nonradical pathway moreover the degradation performance of defective graphene was significantly higher than that of multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts id ig 1 35 and ordered mesoporous carbon cmk 3 id ig 1 17 duan et al 2016a surface confined so4 and 1o2 have been found to be the primary ros in pds cnts systems shao et al manufactured nanodiamonds nds at different thermal treatment temperatures and found that c o in nds activated pms to produce 1o2 shao et al 2018 apart from 1o2 lee et al found that graphitized nds could be used to activate pds to form active surface complex and the adsorbed organic pollutants acted as electron donors to transfer electrons to pds through the conductive nds lee et al 2016 duan et al showed that zero to three dimensional carbon materials go cnts and nds could effectively activate pds to produce different kinds of ros to degrade pollutants duan et al 2018b carbon configuration and dimension were the main factors that affected the adsorption and catalytic activity of carbocatalysts the adsorption of phenol was closely related to the molecular arrangement of nanocarbons in the order of 0d 1d 2d 3d however the catalytic properties of persulfate activation were not necessarily correlated with the dimension duan et al 2015 indrawirawan et al 2015 abundant free flowing π electrons in the sp2 hybridized carbon lattice surface edge defects and c o group were important for the activation and dissociation of peroxide oo bond in pds and pms based reactions for ros generation duan et al 2018b in addition modification of carbon nanomaterials by heteroatom dopants such as n s p and b effectively enhanced the performance for pds activation xiao et al 2018a wang et al found that n doped reduced graphene oxide n rgo was beneficial for the adsorption and degradation of bisphenol a bpa wang et al 2015a urea was found to be the best precursor to synthesize n doped graphene with a high nitrogen loading of 18 7 at contributing to 49 7 and 11 5 fold enhancement of phenol oxidation over go and pristine rgo therefore functionalized carbocatalysts can effectively activate pds and pms to degrade organic pollutants via radical and or nonradical processes fig 3 however some limitations still exist for the nanocarbon materials in practical applications due to the complex preparation process high cost and potential biotoxicity the fabrication methods can be categorized into top down and bottom up synthetic processes li and wong 2017 the classic hummers method for synthesis of go involves many hazardous and highly oxidizing reagents such as kmno4 h2o2 and concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids hummers and offeman 1958 graphene and go display superior bactericidal effect due to their extremely sharp edges nanoscale effect and generation of ros zhang et al 2017 additionally cnts can destroy the biological structure of cells and induce severe dna damage because the contact of cnts with bacteria leads to the destruction of cell membrane the entanglement with cells to precipitate and the production of intracellular ros kang et al 2008 qiao et al 2013 therefore the toxicity and potential biocompatibility of nanocarbons should be carefully evaluated before and after aops reaction prior to the scaled up applications in practical water remediation 4 1 3 biochar based catalyst biochar is a carbon rich solid material produced from the pyrolysis treatment of solid wastes and biomass such as sludge straw and algal residue under oxygen limited atmosphere lately biochar has been developed as a functional material due to its low cost ease of manufacturing and sustainability xiao et al 2018b biochar is applied as the carbocatalyst for activation of persulfates with large ssa graphitic structures and diverse functional groups qin et al 2019 wang and wang 2019a zhu et al found that the biochar with nitrogen doping from high temperature thermal treatment significantly improved the performance of pds activation and pollutant removal zhu et al 2018 n doped graphitized biochar produced at different temperatures exhibit different mechanisms in pds activation when the thermal treatment temperature of biochar was 400 c the dominant ros of the system were oh and so4 catalyzed by pfrs in biochar while the electron transfer mechanism dominated the oxidation catalyzed by the biochar derived at 900 c a positive correlation was observed between the organic degradation rate and adsorption capacity the organic adsorption was a rate limiting step and the pre adsorption of the contaminants promoted the subsequent nonradical oxidation near the surface of biochar therefore the strong affinity between organic matters and catalyst was beneficial to the electron transfer pathway the structures of organic substrates significantly influence the efficiency of biochar for adsorption and nonradical oxidation chen and carroll 2016 duan et al 2018a ho et al used n doped graphitic biochar from spirulina residue with large ssa nitrogen doping and excellent conductivity for catalytic pds activation figs 4 a and b and found that sdbc pds was a nonradical oxidation system figs 4c e ho et al 2019 due to the structural complexity of biochar the mechanism of biochar based catalysis needs to be further clarified the catalysis mechanism might be governed by the types and sources of biomass as well as the inherent compositions and proportions of cellulose lignocellulose protein carbohydrate and inorganic matter in sludge metal modification on biochar can effectively improve pds activation and structural robustness and reduce metal leaching rong et al fabricated magnetic biochar with high ssa using ferrous sulfate and banana peels as the precursors rong et al 2019 the biochar efficiently activated pds to achieve complete bpa removal within 20 min confirming that so4 oh and 1o2 were the dominant ros the catalyst showed high stability excellent reusability and wide adaptability over a broad ph range for decomposition of a wide array of organic microcontaminants moreover biochar supported and sulfided nzvi s nzvi bc displayed excellent performance in the oxidation of ciprofloxacin cip with pds to produce oh and so4 gao et al 2020 4 1 4 mechanism of radical and nonradical oxidation in summary the persulfate based aops involve radical and or nonradical processes the former reaction produces free radicals such as oh so4 and o2 during the persulfate activation via a one electron transfer process and chain reactions duan et al 2018a xiao et al 2018a the nonradical processes depend on1o2 electron transfer and surface confined ros transition metals can stimulate persulfate to generate free radicals while free radicals and nonradical ros may co exist in carbon based processes chen et al 2018a radical and nonradical processes can be determined by electron spin resonance esr technique using spin trapping agents and selective ros screening tests with chemical scavengers in addition electrochemical methods e g chronoamperometry and linear sweep voltammetry organic probes and solvent exchange have recently been applied to distinguish the reaction pathways ho et al 2019 lee et al 2016 compared with the free radical process the nonradical process generally exhibits a lower redox capacity with better selectivity for organics and greater resistance to environmental background matters and complicated water matrix duan et al 2018a duan et al 2018c 4 2 persulfate activation by sludge biochar recently sdbcs are applied as carbocatalysts for pds or pms activation which provides an environment friendly method for sludge treatment moreover it also produces low costand eco friendly carbon materials for wastewater treatment in a facile manner due to the different compositions of sludge sdbcs exhibit diverse characteristics and may involve different mechanisms including radical and nonradical pathways in pds and pms activation table 2 additionally alien atom dopants can further tailor the reactivity of sdbcs in the degradation of organics 4 2 1 sludge biochar catalyst huang et al prepared sludge biochar based catalysts under carbonization temperatures of 400 800 c 5 c min 1 heating rate for 6 h in nh3 ar 10 90 v v atmosphere huang et al 2018 the sdbcs pms system achieved a high mineralization efficiency of bpa 80 nevertheless 1o2 produced at the ketone groups of biochar was the dominant ros for bpa degradation more importantly the metals in sludge had a significant effect on improving the catalytic performance of biochar during the thermochemical process the biochar prepared by pre mixing bovine serum albumin bsa and 5 metal ions including al fe ca mg cu and zn led to remarkable improvement in pms activation compared with the biochar from only bsa however liang et al further investigated the role of endogenous metal ions in sludge biochar during oxidation process and found that the inherent metals in biochar had a negative effect on phenol degradation fig 5 a liang et al 2020 the biochar was prepared from sewage sludge with intrinsic metals and then demineralized by 1 m hcl and 10 hf at 400 c ss400 and dss400 and 700 c ss700 and dss700 subsequently the carbon materials were used to activate pds for phenol degradation the degradation of phenol was poor 12 6 in sludge pds system whereas the removal efficiency reached 36 3 and 57 8 after acid washing for dss400 and dss700 respectively moreover mg and k in biochar had little effect on the reaction while fe was beneficial for the phenol degradation by promoting oh and so4 production in contrast ca species blocked the active sites in biochar and prohibited oh generation resulting in less phenol degradation the relative contents of degradation intermediates in the ss400 pds and ss700 pds systems were obviously different from those of dss400 pds and dss700 pds systems fig 5b in addition yin et al found that 1o2 instead of free radicals was the main ros in the sdbcs pds system for sulfamethoxazole smx degradation 1o2 likely destroyed the aniline ring of smx to accelerate the degradation yin et al 2019b furthermore sludge biochar could be produced via conventional pyrolysis of sludge after anaerobic digestion and the derived carbons possessed large ssa high graphitization and good conductivity fig 6 a chen et al 2020a the carbocatalysts oxidized various pollutants with pds over a wide range of ph and temperature in addition biochar produced by high temperature annealing 1000 c exhibited low biotoxicity and good stability because of fewer pfrs and dom and limited metal leaching solvent exchange h2o to d2o organic probes and electrochemical measurement were applied to confirm the role of 1o2in the reaction pathways and analyze ros for degradation of pollutants d2o replaced h2o as the solvent due to the longer lifetime of 1o2 in d2o 55 µs than that in h2o 4 2 µs as shown in fig 6b the degradation rate of sulfathiazole stz was similar in d2o and h2o suggesting that 1o2 was not the dominant ros the organic probe offurfuryl alcohol ffa is an efficient scavenger of 1o2 with a high degradation rate 1 2 108m 1s 1 however the degradation rate constant of ffa in the sdbc pds system was much lower than that of phenol fig 6c electrochemical analysis techniques such as linear sweep voltammetry and chrono amperometric measurements were further applied to analyze the charge transfer processes fig 6d and e the results showed that sludge biochar pds system was based on an electron transfer regime rather than relying on free radicals or 1o2 fig 6a sludge biochar derived from high annealing temperature is more reactive because the graphitic framework promotes the adsorption of aromatic organics and induces the electron transfer process in pds based nonradical oxidation li et al 2017b the effect of chemical modification i e nh4oh koh or hcl treatment on sludge biochar pms system was also studied and high ssa and maximum c o content were attained using koh pre treated biochar mian and liu 2019 however the maximum reaction rate constant of organic matter degradation was achieved by the biochar post treated with koh sludge biochar based catalyst treated with a combination of nh4oh and koh showed excellent pms activation and degradation performance for organics due to large ssa high c o content and superior n content the nonradical process was recognized as the major mechanism of pms activation via electron transfer regime and some oh and so4 were also generated wang et al reported that sdbcs had a porous structure with high ssa of 157 4 m2 g 1 after naoh treatment and could activate pms to degrade triclosan tcs wang and wang 2019b the optimum conditions of sdbcs pms system for tcs degradation were 1 0 g l of sdbc and 0 8 mm of pms at 25 c which resulted in 32 5 of toc removal within 240 min mineralized by oh and so4 additionally hu et al prepared a carbocatalyst derived from sludge with abundant surface oxygen functional groups via a facile hydrothermal coupled conventional pyrolysis process hu et al 2019 htc was found to be crucial for increasing the oxygen content of sludge biochar most of which existed as ketone groups under the optimal reaction conditions the removal rates of bpa and toc were 100 and 69 53 within 20 min respectively and 1o2 was identified as the primary ros 4 2 2 metal based sludge biochar catalyst the properties of sludge are affected by both the metal impurities in the pristine sludge and the added metals wang et al found that sdbcs manufactured from dried sewage sludge in n2 atmosphere at 400 c achieved92 3 of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp removal via both adsorption and oxidation with pds wang et al 2017b it suggested that sdbcs can activate pds to produce various ros including oh so4 o2 and 1o2 due to the pristine existence of fe2 and fe3 on the surface of sdbcs the best catalytic activity for pms activation was achieved by fe0 fe3c composites derived at 900 c 99 of cip was removed in 20 min which was attributed to the high activity of fe0 and fe3c in another study oh so4 o2 and 1o2 were revealed as the dominant ros which contributed to the decomposition of organic pollutants zhu et al 2019 diao et al reported that fe0 and al0 particles were dispersed on the surface and within the porous structure of sdbcs they found that the ultrasound enhanced sdbc persulfate system exhibited outstanding performance for degradation of bpa in water diao et al 2020 chen et al used a one pot conventional pyrolysis method to convert iron containing dewatering ads into an iron modified biochar and the pds zvi system was applied to effectively reduce heavy metal pollution eliminate the pathogens and promote the ads recycling fig 7 a chen et al 2019c the thermal treatment temperature played an important role in tailoring the iron species in sludge the carbon surface became smooth and the size of the nanoparticles increased as the temperature increased it was found that the iron oxides gradually converted from fe3o4 to feo when the temperature increased from 600 to 1000 c fig 7b fe adsbc 1000 feo adscb with a less ferromagnetic property compared with fe3o4 could prevent the severe aggregation of magnetic materials whereas the carbocatalyst was still magnetic and could be separated from the aqueous solution by an external magnet fig 7c fe adsbc 1000 achieved the complete removal of sulfamethazine smt with pds within 60 min it indicated that the primary ros in fe adsbc pds system underwent a transformation from oh fe3o4 adscb at 600 c to so4 feo adscb at 1000 c figs 7d f moreover wang et al manufactured zero valent iron zvi sdbc using a mixture of fe containing sludge and reducing agent nabh4 via one step conventional pyrolysis without external iron source wang et al 2020 fe0 was successfully loaded on the surface of sdbc as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps it was found that 99 0 of acid orange 7 ao7 was removed by 0 925 mm pds and 0 5 g l 1 zvi sdbc via 71 9 oh and a small amount of so4 and 1o2 while 62 8 toc and 99 8 ammonia in leachate were removed wang et al prepared sdbcs by co pyrolysis of sludge with fecl3 and pam at 300 800 c they found that sdbcs prepared at 600 c achieved 88 7 of 2 naphthol degradation by oh and so4 produced from pds wang et al 2017d yu et al discussed the effect of compositions of magnetic and n doped biochar from sludge ms biochar on catalytic degradation yu et al 2019 the sludge was procured from wwtps which had been flocculated by pfs and pam as the iron and nitrogen sources respectively then the sludge residue was pyrolyzed from 400 to 800 c for 2 h under n2 atmosphere ms biochar was mainly composed of dom acid soluble substance ass carbon matrix cm and basal part bsp figs 8 a and b ass was dominant for ms 400 600 while cm was the most important component of ms 800 both ass and cm contributed to the generation of so4 and oh respectively figs 8c f they also proposed an internal electron transfer mechanism from sp3 to sp2 carbon during the reaction fig 8a composite metals and other transition metals can also be used to modify sdbcs to improve the catalytic performance in aops li et al proposed a novel method to convert sludge into porous activated carbon via washing with 20 hno3 and 3 mol l 1of hcl and then converted mnfe2o4 sludge into porous activated carbon sac nanocomposites via htc of a mixture of sac fecl3 6h2o and mncl2 4h2o li et al 2017b the mnfe2o4 sac composites exhibited a remarkable activity in activating pds for degrading orange g over a wide ph range of 3 9 and the used catalysts could be recovered easily by a magnet and recycled additionally sdbcs were integrated with cuo on macroporous silicon carbide foams to fabricate a distinctive catalyst he et al 2020 the composites displayed strong catalytic activity for the oxidation of methyl mercaptan therefore catalytic performance and reaction mechanisms of the sdbcs ps system are dependent on the structures and compositions of the biochar which can be deliberately tailored by varying the thermal treatment temperature heteroatom doping and composite formation the best sdbcs can be derived from high temperature thermal treatment for both adsorption and catalysis due to the higher graphitization degree better conductivity larger ssa and a higher content of reductive metal sites 4 2 3 factors influencing persulfate activation by sdbc in the sdbc pms or pds systems the removal efficiency and mechanism of organic contaminants are significantly affected by the dewatering treatment methods thermochemical strategies and the characteristics of the sludge conventional dewatering technologies including physical approaches freeze thaw heat and microwave treatment and chemical methods acid base coagulant and flocculant and aops treatment have been used to upgrade the sludge dewaterability these methods also change the properties of sludge to impact the compositions and structures of sdbc chen et al 2018c feng et al 2009 hu et al 2011 wei et al 2018 due to volume expansion by freezing water ice transformation freeze thaw treatment modified the pore structures and creased more micropores in sdbc therefore this approach produced high quality porous biochar which may facilitate organic adsorption and the subsequent aops meng and wang 2020 heat and microwave treatmentcan reduce moisture change the carbon structure and release eps in sludge liu et al 2016a wang et al 2019b these methods are not only used for sludge dewatering in the pretreatment process but are also used as thermochemical strategies to convert sludge into biochar bio oil and biogas hydrothermal and microwave pretreatment have been coupled with pyrolysis to achieve the redistribution and preliminary immobilization of hms aimed at reducing the potential environmental risks chen et al 2020c menéndez et al 2005 furthermore acid base treatment improved the flocculation of sludge via electrostatic interaction while the cellular substances experienced slight destruction under extreme ph conditions mikkelsen and keiding 2002 hence the acid base treatment does not significantly change the sludge structure and physiochemical characteristics by means of coagulant flocculant and aops sludge can be dewatered by the addition of reagents such as iron or aluminum thus sdbc can be in situ modified via one step pyrolysis the iron doped sdbc showed excellent activity in catalyzing pms pds based aops for water purification yu et al 2019 additionally the thermochemical processes including conventional pyrolysis mwp and htc are crucial to determine the sludge properties and indirectly influence aops depending on the temperature conventional pyrolysis is conducive to enlarge ssa enhance graphitization degree and improve conductivity at high annealing temperatures the ph value ssa and hms stability of sdbc are improved by mwp at increased temperature feng et al 2018 yuan et al 2013 high temperature carbonization improves the π π interactions of carbonaceous materials with c c bonds or benzene rings in organic contaminants tian et al 2020 the hierarchical porous structure with large ssa promotes the diffusion and adsorption of organics or pms pds toward the active sites although biochar obtained from mwp has low micro and meso pores the biochar was resistant to hms and organic leaching the mwp procedure has a high comprehensive pyrolysis characteristic index with less energy consumption menéndez et al 2005 besides htc induced the formation of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of sdbc lachos perez et al 2017 pms can be catalyzedby c o to produce 1o2 shao et al 2018 however ren et al reported that the zeta potentials of carbon materials would be reduced by strong brønsted acid sites in the oxygen containing groups ren et al 2020 4 3 effect of background matters on aops in actual water samples various background substances significantly impact the efficiency of aops which may consume ros and impede organic oxidation ghanbari and moradi 2017 hence it is necessary to further investigate the effects of background matters on the oxidation performance of biochar pds systems solution ph and temperature are two key factors determining the oxidation efficiency sdbcs show prominent catalytic efficiency in pds or pms activation processes over a wide ph range huang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b yin et al 2019b wang et al reported that the adsorption capacity of sdbcs toward 4 chlorophenol 4 cp declined at high ph because of the electrostatic repulsion forces nevertheless pds activation on sdbcs favored high ph leading to improved degradation of 4 cp because of boosted generation of oh so4 o2 and 1o2 wang et al 2017b pms was easily decomposed to1o2 underhighly alkaline condition via sdbcs which had a lower oxidizing capacity compared with oh and so4 resulting in decreased tcs removal wang and wang 2019b similar to fenton reaction the optimal ph was 2 4 for the sr aops system based on iron modified sludge biochar li et al 2017b yu et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 the effects of inorganic anions at different concentrations were evaluated in the sdbcs pds system representative inorganic anions e g cl no3 and h2po4 had limited influences on stz degradation by nonradical oxidation chen et al 2020a however yin et al found that cl and no3 had negligible impacts on smx degradation while hco3 and po4 3 dramatically inhibited the oxidationin the sdbc pds system yin et al 2019b this was possibly because hco3 and po4 3 increased the solution ph to affect the surface charge of biochar which prevented the interaction of sdbcs with persulfate ions and inhibited the production of reactive radicals in another study the presence of cl and no3 barely affected the smt removal in the fe adsbc pds system while po4 3 strongly prevented smt oxidation at high dosages because it chelated the active iron species in fe adsbc thereby blocking the catalytic sites and preventing their further interaction with pds chen et al 2019c natural organic matter nom is a heterogeneous mixture of aromatic and aliphatic compounds mainly including humic like substances lipids proteins and polysaccharides with diverse chemical functionalities and a range of molecular sizes which affects the smell taste and color of water tian et al 2018 nom may inhibit the removal of pollutants due to the competing reaction with ros giannakis et al 2016 humic acid ha is extensively used as a model substance to represent nom in water purification sun et al found that the removal efficiency of phenol reduced from 99 to 76 with the increase in concentration of ha from 0 to 30 mg l sun et al 2020 nom ubiquitously exists in surface water and wastewater nom in real water matrixes had a considerable impact on the effectiveness of the adsbc 1000 pds system and stz removal rate decreased from 100 in pure water solution to 84 81 and 74 07 in river water and wastewater respectively chen et al 2020a the inhibitory effect was probably due to competitive adsorption between pollutants pds and nom on the surface of biochar as well as the competitive consumption of ros by nom song et al 2017 5 conclusion and prospects this review presents a systematic overview of sludge derived biochar as a carbocatalyst for persulfate activation for sludge management and environmental application sludge can be efficiently converted into biochar by thermochemical approaches to solve various environment problems caused by sludge residues the constituents of sludge including inorganic organic components and water significantly affect the characteristics of sdbcs via various thermochemical processes and subsequently affect the performances in sr aops significant amounts of transition metals such as al fe ni and si and nonmetals such as c o n p and s yield diverse metal species and surface functional groups in sdbcs which serve as active sites in carbocatalysis and lead to diverse mechanisms inaops as shown in fig 9 the metals in sdbcs served as the active sites for mediating the production of free radicals such as oh and so4 on the other hand sdbcs unmodified by metals can activate pds and pms primarily through nonradical pathways including singlet oxygenation and electron transfer regime over the biochars derived from conventional pyrolysis mwp and htc however most current studies directly converted sludge into sdbcs viaone pot conventional pyrolysis and the resulting products were evaluated for activation of pds and pms to remediate the organic microcontaminants in water a few studies deliberately designed biochar with fine tuned structure and surface chemistry for better catalysis toward persulfate activation the specific designed biochar for aops can be produced by optimizing the thermochemical strategies applying physical chemical activation methods and optimizing the activation parameters in addition most studies on sdbcs were conducted on the laboratory scale and focused on developing highly efficient oxidative systems for rapid elimination of diverse organic contaminants it is important to consider the effect of complex physical environment and the environmental risk assessment including the effects of sdbcs on long term carbon sequestration release of contaminants and diverse microbial communications in water moreover the rational preparation of sludge into sdbcs requires the optimization of the sludge treatment process in wwtps life cycle analysis of this process is essential to confirm its benefits and environmental consequences which includes evaluating the consumptions of energy feedstocks and chemicals associated with the emissions into air soil and water as well as considering the potential trade offs in practical environmental remediation declaration of competing

industrialization massive amounts of municipal sludge waste are produced in recent decades however sludge waste typically contains high levels of nitrogen phosphorus heavy metals organic micro pollutants and pathogens posing great threats to the environment after disposal wu et al 2019 therefore thetreatment and reutilization of sludge waste have become a research hotspot in recent years chen et al 2018b development of a low cost and green process is required for the disposal to meet the policy demands in developing countries some universal sludge treatment approaches such as incineration and landfilling have caused undesirable secondary pollution chen et al 2018d in contrast thermal treatment provides an economical and environment friendly approach for recycling of sludge by means of converting sludge wastes into functional biochar and valuable biofuel chen et al 2020b biochar is a carbon rich porous material with aromatic hydrocarbon surfaces and oxygen containing groups chen et al 2019b the physicochemical properties of sludge biochar are primarily determined by the sludge sources primary secondary anaerobic digestion and dewatering process and thermochemical strategies conventional dry and wet pyrolysis processes chen et al 2019b manara and zabaniotou 2012 these methods can reduce the leaching of heavy metals organic pollutants and pathogens from sludge products into soil and water advanced oxidation processes aops are an important part of wastewater treatment plants wwtps free radicals with strong oxidative capacities such ashydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 or singlet oxygen 1o2 are generated in aops which can directly decompose organic pollutants into mineralized products wang and wang 2019b additionally aops are preliminary treatment techniques to convert toxic organic compounds into less toxic substances to improve their biodegradability for the subsequent biological treatment processes duan et al 2018c oh et al 2016 in recent years sulfate radical based aops sr aops have attracted widespread attention because of their high reactivity with organic pollutants and their high selectivity in complex environmental systems so4 is mainly produced by persulfatesand has many excellent properties duan et al 2018a so4 displays a higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 v than oh 2 7 v for organic mineralization the half life of so4 30 40 μs is much longer than that of oh 1 μs offering so4 more opportunity to react with organic contaminants in water in addition sr aops can be applied overa wider ph range compared with fenton reactions ph 3 which is applicable to more complicated environments xiao et al 2018a persulfates such as peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms are similar in structure to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 with a peroxide bond oo which require external energy or activator to break the oo bond for producing so4 chen et al 2018a more recently innovative environmental remediation techniqueshave been proposed based on carbonaceous materials with good biocompatibility large specific surface area ssa great resistance to acidic basic environment and flexible electronic properties duan et al 2018c mauter and elimelech 2008 in pds activation biochar derived from sludge sdbcs canbe utilizedas carbocatalysts via facile preparation processes chen et al 2020a this review will highlight the

this review provides a comprehensive understanding of the properties and treatment of sludge waste controlled fabrication of biochar from sludges and their application in aops the outcome will benefit the development and optimization of sludge derived biochar for practical waste management and water purification 2 characteristics of sewage sludge 2 1 sludge compositions and characteristics 2 1 1 sludge source wwtps are the central unit of urban sewage purification systems which are used to purifythe domestic industrial hospital commercial and agricultural wastewater syed hassan et al 2017 sludge is an unavoidable byproduct from the treatment processes including primary treatment physical or chemical secondary treatment biological anaerobic digestion process biological and dewatering process chen et al 2018d zaker et al 2019 the illustration of integrated sludge treatment in wwtps is depicted in fig 1 in the primary treatment the sewage slowly passes through the primary clarifiers due to the gravitational differences grease and foam rise to the surface while the solid matter settles at the bottom of tank which is called primary sludge the secondary treatment stage is primarily a microbial treatment process utilizing microorganisms to immobilize the organic components and to remove non colloidal solids in wastewater secondary sludge is produced from secondary settling tank after the aerobic bioreactors such as conventional activated sludge system membrane biological reactor and anaerobic anoxic oxic process pathak et al 2009 syed hassan et al 2017 anaerobic digestion is a biological process capable of converting biodegradable substances into biogas i e ch4 h2 and co2 or soluble metabolic products i e volatile fatty acids vfas and bio alcohol and the solid residue is anaerobic digestion sludgeas well wu et al 2018 dewatered sludge refers to the solid residue after wet sludge dewatering by means of physical and chemical methods the compositions and characteristics of sludge are much more variable than those of classical biomass which are significantly affected by sewage properties and loadings entering the unit the treatment system used in wwtps environmental legislation and seasonal variations syed hassan et al 2017 tytła et al 2016 moreover the compositions and characteristics of sludge from the same wwtps may vary from day to day 2 1 2 physicochemical properties of sludge in order to reduce the complexity of sludge used for subsequent thermochemical strategies it is important to clarify its physicochemical properties the components of sewage sludge includenitrogen and phosphorous compounds organic carbon compounds inorganic salts pathogens and water rulkens 2008 the nontoxic organic compounds approximately 60 on a dry basis mainly consist of bacterial constituents including nucleic acids proteins polysaccharides humic substance lipids decay products and undigested organic substances chen et al 2018d nitrogen in sludge mainly originates from protein ranging from 0 1 to 18 in weight sludge also contains high concentrations of inorganic salts including inorganic ions e g co3 2 po4 3 so4 2 and no3 toxic heavy metals e g zn pb ni cd cr cu as and hg and other elements e g si al k na ca and mg tytła et al 2016 these metals are from the municipal agriculture and industrial wastewateras well as the processes of runoff and corrosion of sewerage system about 50 80 of themetal species entering the wwtps will be fixed into sludge through physicochemical and biological processes tytła et al 2016 van de velden et al 2008 previous studies indicated that different organic compounds and inorganic salts would be transformed into biochar with different properties huang et al found that metal ions catalyze the graphitization process and improve the subsequent catalytic performance of biochar during the thermochemical process implying that organic species and metal ions play important roles in improving the physiochemical features of the biochar formed during thermal treatment huang et al 2018 additionally various organic compounds e g persistent organic pollutants pharmaceuticals and personal care products microplastics and pathogenic micro organisms are also found in sludge which may cause significant environmental risks martín pozo et al 2019 recently large amounts of genes resistant to sulfonamides tetracyclines and macrolides have been detected in sludge ezzariai et al 2018 these antibiotic resistant genes can be easily transmitted through bacterial division and horizontal gene transfer between micro organisms in the environment which areemerging micropollutants and may pose a potential threat to regional and global ecological systems pazda et al 2019 2 1 3 moisture content of sludge sludge from wwtps contains over 90 moisture by weight the water in sludge can be categorized as free water interstitial water vicinal water and bound water wei et al 2018 free water is detached from the sludge particles which accounts for about 70 of the sludge moisture and can be easily removed by mechanical dewatering chen et al 2015b vaxelaire and cézac 2004 interstitial water is trapped within the spaces of flocs and micro organisms which can be converted into free water via destroying the flocs and microbial cells removal of free and interstitial water is relatively easy by mechanical dewatering mikkelsen and keiding 2002 wei et al 2018 in contrast vicinal water is tightly attached on the sludge particle surfaces byhydrogen bonding the bound water exists inside the microbial cells accounting for 10 of the sludge moisture which can be removed by thermal treatment freeze thaw and heat treatment and aops chen et al 2018c lee and wang 2000 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 the contentsand categories of water in sludge have significant impacts on the subsequent transportation and treatment moreover the selection of dewatering methods has important impacts on the subsequent heat treatment of sludge and may result in different sludge properties 2 2 sludge dewatering treatment conventional mechanical dewatering processes can eliminate partial free and interstitial water for which it is necessary to destroy the sludge flocs by physical and chemical methods thereby further releasing the existing bound water erdincler and vesilind 2003 sludge flocs contain microbial colonies and outer extracellular polymers eps eps as a highly hydrated biopolymer are mainly classified into soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps which play an important role in the process of bioflocculation and solid water separation li and yang 2007 yu et al 2010 eps mainly consist of lipids 40 carbohydrates 40 95 protein like compounds 60 dna 10 aquatic humic substances and small moleculesthat can affect the physicochemical properties of sludge which is the dominant factor contributing to the difficulty in sludge dewatering sheng et al 2010 diverse pretreatments including both physical and chemical methods have been applied to improve the sludge dewaterability physical treatments include thermal frozen electrical microwave and ultrasonic stimulations feng et al 2009 hu et al 2011 chemical treatments refer to the use of acid alkali surfactants coagulants and oxidants to influencesludge properties for enhancing the dewatering performance table 1 chen et al 2018c wei et al 2018 2 2 1 freeze thaw method freeze thaw method in sludge dewatering relies on the temperature below the freezing point and the method is generally applicable in winter of cold regions the effect of sludge dewatering is related to the freezing rate and temperature kinsley et al 2012 a lower temperature and a thinner sludge layer lead to a faster melting rate of sludge during the melting process the ice is dissolved and removed leaving the sludge solids with a low content of water diak and örmeci 2018 generally the volume of sludge can be reduced by 85 96 under gravity drainage natural freeze thaw method is a handy and low cost technology for sludge treatment without intensive energy consumption or discharging greenhouse gasses but is limited by season and region diak and örmeci 2018 diak et al 2011 kinsley et al 2012 2 2 2 heat treatment heat can improve the sludge dewatering performance by decreasingits viscosity changing its surface structure and releasing eps the temperature for heat treatment usually ranges from 40 c to 210 c wang et al 2019b when the temperature increases to above 120 c the heat treatment is capable of destroying the cell wall and decomposing the heat resistant biological molecules wang and li 2015 after heat treatment the binding energy of water is reduced and most of the input energy is expended to destroy bound water and solid particles typically when the temperature exceeds 180 c the majority of free water molecules exist as moisture in the sludge and the residual solid displays a higher carbonization degree with a large amount of oxygen containing functional groupscompared to raw sludge which is detailed in section 3 1 3 wang et al 2017c however this study also showed that the capillary water suction time cst of sludge improved from 0 44 s to 4 18 s when the temperature increased from 20 c to 135 c indicating that the dewatering performance deteriorated at high temperatures liu et al also proposed that the proteins in s eps had an important effect on the dewatering performance of sludge under heat treatment from 105 c to 170 c liu et al 2019 2 2 3 microwave treatment microwave can damage the cells and eps of sludge to enhance the solubility and release of organic matter the influence of microwave on sludge dewatering performance is related to the intensity and duration of the radiation as well as the type and concentration of sludge liu et al 2016a yu et al found that the dewatering performance was enhanced with increased microwave intensity 500 900 w and proper irradiation duration 0 140 s the best sludge dewatering performance was achieved at the microwave intensity of 900 w for 60 s yu et al 2009 liu et al indicated that high temperature had a positive impact on sludge destruction but the release of organic matter led to greater electronegativity of sludge and affected the dewatering performance liu et al 2016a notably ph has a great influence on sludge dewatering during microwave treatment under acidic condition the electronegativity and size of sludge are reduced and dewatering performance is improved liu et al reported that the best performance of sludge dewatering was achieved when ph was 2 5 and the temperature of microwave treatment was 100 c with the microwave temperature range of 40 100 c liu et al 2016a 2 2 4 acid base treatment adjusting the ph value of sludge not only improves the flocculation of sludge but also breaks cells and releases intracellular substances under extreme ph conditions after the acid base treatment the electrostatic repulsive force of eps increases and the adhesive forces between the sludge cells and eps are destroyed moreover eps is partially dissolved and released into the surroundings mikkelsen and keiding 2002 to explore the mechanisms of sludge acidification and provide a theoretical basis for practical application wei et al reported that the dewatering performance of sludge first improved and then deteriorated as the ph decreased from 7 to 3 indicating that acidcan destroy sludge flocs and induce eps to release bound water wei et al 2019 on the other hand eps can be effectively compressed due to the protonation effect and can adhere tightly to the sludge particles both processes can improve the dewatering performance of sludge but the former destruction of sludge flocs is an irreversible process while the latter protonation effect is a reversible process control of sludge ph is a simple method for sludge treatment and disposal however as the treated sludge with extreme ph would impact the environment further regulation is required 2 2 5 coagulant and flocculant the treatment of sludge using aforementioned methods is typically aimed at improving the dewatering performance by destroying the cells and eps although such treatment will influence the compositions and physicochemical properties of sludge the subsequent impact on the thermochemical process of sdbcs may not be obvious since no additional substances chemicals are added the chemical treatment methods require the addition of surfactant coagulant or oxidant which would affect the compositions of sludge moreover the addition of metals or organic substances will have a great impact on the preparation of biochar yu et al 2019 conventional coagulants such as polyaluminum chloride pac and iron salts fe3 can intensify the flocculation of sludge by electrostatic neutralization and hydroxide formation which are beneficial for the coacervation of small sludge colloid and sludge dewaterability improvement wei et al 2018 yang et al demonstrated that the best efficacy of sludge dewaterability was achieved with 1 54 g l 1 pac yang et al 2019a in addition fe3 coagulant displays the merits of low cost fast sedimentation low toxicity applicability over a wide ph range and a better performance than pac organic polymer flocculants mainly include polyacrylamide pam and its derivatives pam is used to improve the filtering performance in mechanical dewatering luo et al 2011 however this process has limitations because it cannot degrade eps and cells wang et al used a combination of fe3 and pam as well as pac and pam for sludge dewatering and found that the combination of coagulant and flocculant significantly improved the sludge dewatering performance wang et al 2019a the improved sludge dewatering may stem from the synergistic effect of flocculation and coagulation which induces the decomposition of microbial cells and the aggregation of sludge flocculates the addition of inorganic salts will also impact the performance of sludge for example pam and polyferric sulfate pfs can be used as the nitrogen and iron sources to prepare biochar from sludge via thermal treatment and the derived products possess magnetic property and are in situ doped with nitrogen dopants yu et al 2019 2 2 6 treatment by advanced oxidation process advanced oxidation is an emerging technique for sludge treatment in recent years in general reactive radicals with high oxidative potentialsare generated to destroy the sludge cells and release the bound water thereby improving the sludge dewaterability chen et al 2018c the specific filtration resistance of sludge is adjusted in the fenton reaction and the use of lime is effectively reduced by approximately 90 this is because hydroxyl radicals in the fenton reaction are destructive to eps and sludge cells leading to the release of bound water as free water in addition fe3 flocculates the sludge flocs to improve the filtration of sludge liang et al 2015 ding et al used the fenton method to treat sludge and found that the optimal sludge dewatering conditions were ph of 5 5 20 mg g 1 h2o2 and 80 mg g 1 fe2 as a result the moisture of sludge decreased from 85 3 to 73 8 ding et al 2018 sr aops are effective over a wide range of ph liu et al 2018 zhen et al found that the cst of sludge decreased by 88 8 in the first minute when the pds was 1 2 mmol g 1 and the fe2 was 1 5 mmol g 1 with the ph ranging from 3 to 8 5 potassium ferrate also has a strong oxidizing property zhen et al 2012 diak et al found that the use of gravity drainage can reduce the volume of sludge by 79 after treating sludge with potassium ferrate and freezing diak and örmeci 2018 additionally when the sludge was frozen for 3 days with 22 0 g l 1 potassium ferrate the content of melted water and the population of microbial community were lower than the detection limit suggesting that this method can be used for sterilization to reduce the environmental hazards of sludge therefore the treatment of sludge by aops not only improves the sludge dewaterability but also inactivates the pathogens in the sludge furthermore aops can degrade the organic pollutants in sludge and wastewater the addition of iron salt may induce secondary contamination requiring subsequent treatment and disposal of the dewatered sludge chen et al used zero valent iron zvi pds system to degrade the proteins in lb eps and s eps of anaerobic digestion sludge ads to increase the dewatering performance chen et al 2019c in order to avoid secondary pollution caused by the residual iron the iron containing anaerobic digestion sludge was converted into sludge biochar fe adsbc by one pot conventional pyrolysis similarly the sludge dewatered via fecl3 and pam was also annealed into a magnetic biochar catalyst to drive aops to remove organic pollutants wang et al 2017d 3 production and characteristicsof sludge biochar 3 1 sludge biochar production method raw anaerobic and dewatered sludge can be converted into sdbcs via diverse thermochemical strategies which mainly include conventional thermal pyrolysis 300 1000 c and 1 h dry pyrolysis microwave pyrolysis 0 3 300 ghz torrefaction 200 300 c and 10 60 min gasification 700 c and wet pyrolysis htc 180 250 c and 1 4 mpa the pyrolysis methods vary in terms of the duration and temperature during thermal treatment chen et al 2019b manara and zabaniotou 2012 the thermochemical strategies are economically and environmentally feasible for converting sewage sludge into valuable resources such as bio oil biogas and biochar chen et al 2018d the low thermal treatment temperature of torrefaction has no significant effect on the properties of biochar the biochar yield from gasification is typically very low thus the derived products from torrefaction and gasification are not suitable to be used as carbocatalysts as a result this review mainly focuses on thermal pyrolysis mwp and hydrothermal methods 3 1 1 conventional pyrolysis conventional pyrolysis is the most common strategy for biochar production manara and zabaniotou 2012 according to the heating rate the pyrolysis process is categorized into slow pyrolysis and fast pyrolysis slow pyrolysis over the temperature range from 300 to 700 c and low heating rate of 0 1 1 0 cs 1 yields the maximum amount of biochar while fast pyrolysis with a high heating rate of above 100 cs 1usually attains a higher bio oil yield li and hong 2017 the morphological physiochemical and catalytic properties of sdbcs are influenced by pyrolysis temperature ho et al 2017 yin et al 2019b when the pyrolysis temperature is below 300 c the surface chemical composition of sdbcs does not change significantly as a result of incomplete carbonization in contrast higher carbonization and graphitization degree are guaranteed after high temperature thermal treatment accompanied by the formation of cracks and porous structures from the released gas and volatile matter feng et al 2018 yuan et al 2013 more aggressive treatments using high temperatures and reactive atmospheres e g co2 and nh3 are commonly applied to intensify the pyrolysis in order to achieve increased ssa porous structures and diverse functional groups of sdbcs a temperature higher than 700 c can dramatically enhance the graphitic degree electrical conductivity and porosity of biochar which are favorable for pds activation ho et al 2019 in addition the characteristics of biochar can be changed under different atmospheres generally n2 or ar atmosphereis used as a protective gas for biochar production it is reported that co2 atmosphere can lead to higher ssa and more oxygen functional groups in biochar compared with n2 atmosphere at high temperature sun et al 2020 nh3 atmosphere can promote micropores production to prepare hierarchically porous n doped carbons liang et al 2014 the optimal temperature for conventional pyrolysis process is related to the major component and its content in sludge such as protein polysaccharide and lipid among them n content in sludge is mainly related to total protein quantity which can be decomposed into amine compounds during the conventional pyrolysis parnaudeau and dignac 2007 the catalytic activity of sdbcs primarily depends on the surface compositions and chemistry including the carbon content functional groups e g oh co c o ando c o and inorganic components such as sio2 al ox and especially the various iron species fe3o4 fe2o3 fe0 and fe3c 3 1 2 microwave assisted pyrolysis mwp is one of the most efficient thermochemical processes used for converting sludge into syngas bio oil and biochar morgan et al 2017 in conventional pyrolysis water in biomass may lower the heating efficiency because a significant amount of energy will be adsorbed consumed by water in contrast biomass containing water can increase microwave heating efficiency due to the high microwave absorption capacity of water li et al 2016 mwp is another advanced method to degrade sludge particles and release organic matters to improve the properties and dewater ability of sludge as discussed in section 2 2 3 the previous studies indicated that the ph value ssa and heavy metals hms stability of sdbc increased with the increase in mwp temperature whereas the nitrogen content yield and cation exchange capacity of sdbc decreased simultaneously tan et al 2017 zaker et al 2019 particularly sdbc is acidic at low temperature 300 400 c while sdbc prepared at high temperatures 700 c is alkaline hossain et al 2011 wet biomass can be treated using microwave treatment in the absence of microwave absorbers mwas however the addition of mwas and catalysts into sludge can improve the energy efficiency or raise the content of specific components in biogas bio oil and biochar in addition mwas can indirectly heat sludge affecting both the yield and quality of target product du et al 2011 li et al 2016 mushtaq et al 2014 for instance yu et al found that ni2o3 catalyst exhibited high activity in the disintegration of organic substances from sludge and significantly increased the yields of bio oil and pyrolytic gas yu et al 2014 inguanzo et al reported that sdbcs after microwave irradiation are highly microporous and are comparable to the products from conventional pyrolysis the derived bio oil and biogas have high heating values inguanzo et al 2002 another study showed that cao and fe2o3 can serve as catalysts to immobilize the heavy metals in biochar during mwp sun et al 2018 3 1 3 hydrothermal carbonization htc is a thermochemical process which involves treating waste biomass in hot and compressed water htc is also a pretreatment method for sludge patel et al 2015 when this process is adopted to concentrate the carbon content of wet biomass no pre drying is required making it a promising alternative for processing waste streams under certain conditions e g freezing and microwave yu et al 2017 moreover htc is an effective method for the dewatering of wet sludge as discussed in section 2 2 2 the technique causes the dissolution and breakage of flocs in suspended solids thus releasing bound water zhuang et al 2018 generally sludge is pyrolyzed for 1 24 h under 180 250 c in water via htc process resulting in a 36 72 yield of biochar peterson et al 2008 at a relatively low temperature 200 c hydrothermal biochar typically exhibits lower carbon content and higher oxygen content than the parent raw materials alatalo et al 2013 on the surface of hydrothermal biochar oxygen usually exists in the form of oxygen containing functional groups lachos perez et al 2017 zhang et al reported that carbon features were not observed in the x ray diffraction xrd spectra of sdbcs prepared via htc process indicating that htc did not achieve a high degree of carbonization zhang et al 2018 by mixing with ferric sludge and biological sludge the magnetic sdbcs showed larger ssa smaller pore size and higher carbonization degree additionally fe2o3 can be converted into fe3o4 on the surface of sdbcs at 200 240 c htc is a promising technology for sludge utilization and energy recovery due to the high contents of organic species and moisture which significantly reduce the processing costs 3 2 characteristics of sludge biochar 3 2 1 chemical compositions of biochar the content and type of elements contained in sdbcs varywith biomass feedstock and preparation conditions which usually have significant impacts on the subsequent applications of biochar ho et al 2017 huang et al 2018 generally carbon is the most dominant element in biomass the forms of carbon can be divided into organic components e g aromatic hydrocarbon aliphatic hydrocarbon and functional carbons and inorganic compounds e g bicarbonate and carbonate xiao et al 2018b during the thermochemical process the organic components undergo a series of reactions including dehydration devolatilization polymerization and aromatization which convert the organic components into aliphatic carbons 100 300 c and aromatic carbons 400 700 c xu and chen 2013 the graphitic structure was detected in biochar derived at high temperature indicating that alarge portion of carbon containing substances was converted into sp2 hybridized structure with strong π π interactions duan et al 2018c zhu et al 2018 inorganic components are decomposed into co2 or converted into metal oxides at high temperatures xiao et al 2018b hydrogen mainly includes aromatic hydrogen fatty hydrogen and hydrogen in functional groups xiao et al 2016 the forms of oxygen can also be divided into organic components e g hydroxyl carboxyl ester and carbonyl and inorganic components e g bicarbonate carbonate and phosphate these surface functional groups play important roles in determining the properties and applications of biochar during thermochemical processes higher temperature promotes the conversion of partial oxygen containing groups into co2 where the oxygen containing inorganic components contribute to the alkaline property of biochar nguyen and lehmann 2009 zimmerman 2010 in addition o c and h c atomic ratios can be respectively used to characterize the graphitization and aromaticity degree of biochar and the changes of oxygen group can be used to determine the carbon stability of biochar xiao et al 2016 zimmerman 2010 nitrogen mainly exists in the proteins in biomass after thermal treatment the produced nitrogen species are mainly pyridine n pyrrole n graphitized n and oxidized n which affect the adsorption performance and activity of biochar long et al 2019 xiao et al 2018b it was found that graphitized n played a major role in activating persulfate to produce reactive species chen et al 2019a in addition functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and amino groups may also contribute to the removal of pollutants by complexation with the increase in thermal treatment temperature the atomic ratios of o c h c n c and n o c were generally reduced resulting in a decrease in functional groups on the surface of biochar li et al 2017a sdbcs also contain some inorganic elements which are closely related to their pollutant removal ability metal ions can catalyze the graphitization process and improve the subsequent catalytic performance of biochar huang et al 2018 with increase in thermal treatment temperature the organic components in biochar gradually decompose while the inorganic components increase in content additionally phosphorus is a universal element in sludge which can be transformed from organic phosphorus to inorganic phosphorus cantrell et al 2012 fe is also an abundant element in sdbcs generally the compositions of fe containing nanoparticles can be regulated by the temperature and atmosphere during thermal treatment to form fe2o3 fe3o4 fe0 or iron carbides chen et al 2015a 3 2 2 surface physicochemical properties in a previous study the yield of biochar from sludge ranged from around 60 0 to 70 0 over the temperature range from 400 to 800 c ho et al 2017 it is obvious that the yield of sdbcs is generally higher than that of other biochar because sludge contains a large number of inorganic elements jin et al demonstrated that sludge biochar yield gradually reduced from 60 6 to 53 1 at 400 600 c due to the gradual disintegration of organic substances from sludge jin et al 2017 in addition elevated temperature results in larger ssa which is beneficial for adsorption and degradation of organic pollutants chang et al 2015 yuan et al 2015 however under some circumstances biochar generated at high temperature exhibits lower ssa and porosity because the skeleton of biochar is destroyed or blocked by tars yuan et al reported that the ssa of sdbcs was reduced by about 11 99 after fe loading which might be due to the blockage of porous structures by the increased size and number of nanoparticles α fe2o3 yuan and dai 2014 similarly the ph value of biochar varies with the thermal treatment temperature and sludge feedstock yuan et al revealed that the ph value of biochar generated at 300 c was acidic while biochar produced at higher temperature ranging from 400 to 700 c was alkaline possibly due to the disintegration of carbonate and organic acids yuan et al 2015 at a higher temperature the alkalinity of organic anion contained in biochar is also higher in the case of pollutant removal by biochar from water solution ph dramatically influences the surface charge of biochar ho et al 2017 when ph is above the point of zero charge phpzc the biochar with a negative charge prefers to bind with cationic pollutants which significantly influences the following absorption and catalytic processes in aops 3 2 3 persistent free radicals pfrs andpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs of sludge recently some researchers reported that pfrs in a carbonaceous material were relatively stable and capable of mediating reactive oxygen species ros including superoxide ion radical o2 oh and h2o2 pfrs can be categorized into three species of carbon centered pfrs g factors 2 0030 carbon centered pfrs with an adjacent oxygen atom g factors 2 0030 2 0040 and oxygen centered pfrs g factors 2 0040 fang et al 2014 fang et al 2015 oxygen centered pfrs are dominant at low thermal treatment temperature with short annealing duration and can be converted into carbon centered pfrs with the increase in thermal treatment temperature fang et al 2015 oxygen centered pfrs are the main active centers that catalyze persulfate to produce so4 at low thermal treatment temperature fang et al 2015 qin et al 2018 in addition the formation of pfrs and free radicals on biochar includes the chemical bond breaking of macromolecules and the substitution of metal oxide surface functional groups by aromatics dela cruz et al 2011 fang et al 2014 liao et al 2014 transition metals e g fe3 ni2 cu2 or zn2 not only promote the generation of pfrs in biochar but also regulate the reactivity of pfrs phenol or quinone moieties in biomass can transfer electrons to the transition metals in sludge during the thermochemical processes to generate surface bound pfrs the concentration of pfrs in biochar markedly decreases as conventional pyrolysis temperature increases from 400 c to 1000 c due to the reduction removal of oxygen groups and graphitization of carbon structure yang et al 2016 therefore the formation of toxic substances low pyrolyzed aromatic compounds in biochar can be restrained by increasing the temperature to decrease the potential environmental threats biochar is generally categorized into soluble and insoluble fractions yang et al 2018 the dissolved organic matter dom in biochar is mainly composed of aromatic co and carboxyl ester quinone moieties including protein fulvic humic acid like compounds and various pahs pahs are a class of pollutants in sludge that need to be treated due to their mutagenic and cancerogenic characteristics the conversion of sludge into biochar can greatly reduce the content of pahs resulting in a sharp decrease in the toxicity of sludge khan et al 2015 zielińska and oleszczuk 2016 a higher content of dom was extracted from biochar produced at a moderate temperature range from 400 to 550 c keiluweit et al 2012 smith et al 2016 the concentration of extractable dom decreased at a higher temperature 550 c due to the volatilization of the amorphous phase and the strong interaction between large aromatic molecules and biochar wang et al 2017a xiao et al 2018b the density evolution of dom with temperature is similar to that of pfrs in addition dom may play a positive role in the removal of pollutants it has been suggested that dom can produce 1o2and o2 under light irradiation the carbonyl structure is responsible for the production of 1o2 while the production of o2 is related to the electron transfer process of silicate in the dissolved biochar fu et al 2016 therefore thermal treatment of sludgeat a high temperature is a promising strategy to yield stable low toxic and efficient sdbcs in practical applications 4 activation of sludge biochar 4 1 mechanisms of persulfate activation 4 1 1 transition metal based catalyst transition metals oxides are classic catalysts for the activation of persulfates in fenton like aops via homogeneous or heterogeneous processes zhang et al 2019 the metal ions in the homogeneous process cannot be recovered easily causing additional post treatment expense and potential secondary pollution therefore heterogeneous catalysts are more popular in aops with high reactivity and satisfactory stability wang et al found that co3o4 nano rods exhibited great catalytic performance in pms activation to remove phenol with satisfactory stability and reusability wang et al 2015b liu et al investigated the catalytic performance of mno2 with different particle sizes 200 500 nm in pms activation and revealed that mno2 with smaller size showed higher activity for catalytic degradation liu et al 2016b previous studies have shown that mixed metal oxides display improved stability versatility redox potential and catalytic activity due to the enlarged ssa the mixed valence states of transition metals and the synergy among the redox couples of different metals wu et al 2014 xiao et al 2018a γ fe2o3 α mno2 nanocomposites exhibited remarkable performance in the catalytic activation of pds toproduce ros including oh so4 and o2 for rhodamine b rhb decomposition li et al 2019 iron based materials are most extensively studied due to their characteristics of abundance environmental safety low toxicity and prominent activity li et al used fe2 nzvi n for nanosized and nfe3o4 to activate pds achieving 24 4 27 8 and 5 8 removal of 2 4 dichlorophenol respectively zvi transferred electrons directly to pds as an efficient electron donor while surface corroded iron was released into water to react with pds homogeneously li et al 2015 leng et al revealed that fe3o4 activated pds and 50 of rhb removal was attained after 120 min in this system pds directly formed a complex over fe3o4 which further decomposed into so4 leng et al 2014 zheng et al applied magnetic and porous sulfurized fe2o3 composites to activate pms and generate oh and so4 for atrazine atz removal zheng et al 2019 the surface bonded hydroxyl group facilitated the binding with pms molecule which was subsequently activated by the redox metal sites of fe2 fe3 moreover the low valent sulfur species such as sulfite on the surface of the catalyst can accelerate the recovery of fe3 to fe2 to fulfill the redoxcycle in addition carbonaceous materials with large ssa can be used as a support to alleviate the agglomeration of iron based nanoparticles and effectively improve the performance in persulfate activation the oxygen group on the surface of carbon material can reduce fe3 to fe2 rgo fe3o4 effectively activated pds for the degradation of norfloxacin indicating that so4 oh and 1o2 were produced in rgo fe3o4 ps system yin et al 2019a xu et al used magnetic fe3o4 sepiolite composite as a catalyst to activate pds and the system removed 71 6 of atz and 20 9 of total organic carbon toc in 60 min respectively the catalytic activity and structural stability of fe3o4 sepiolite composite were maintained well during recycling xu et al 2019 yang et al manufactured two hybrid nanomaterials by decorating fe2o3 nanoparticles on the outer or inner surface of carbon nanotubes cnts i e fe2o3 fcnt l and fe2o3 fcnt h under different acid washing conditions thermal treatment temperatures and residence times figs 2 a c yang et al 2019b it was found that the former hybrid nanomaterial followed a traditional fenton like reaction pathway producing oh as ros while the latter presented an unprecedented reaction pathway generating 1o2 as ros based on chemical quenching experiment esr spectroscopy fig 2d and classical chemical probe detection with 9 10 diphenylanthracene dpa fig 2e 4 1 2 carbon based catalyst carbon is abundant in natural resources hence most carbon materials are green and sustainable and possess good biocompatibility large ssa high stability in nature and strong resistanceto acid and alkali recent studies have shown that carbon materials includinggraphene oxide go cnts diamond and activated carbon can be used to activate pds or pms to remove organic contaminants duan et al 2018a duan et al 2018c sun et al discovered that reduced graphene oxide rgo was capable of activating pms to produce so4 and the ketonic group c o located on the grain boundaries wasthe primary active site for pms activation sun et al 2012 duan et al used rgos with controlled category and level of oxygen moieties to activate pms and found that rgo with the highest content of c o exhibited the best activity duan et al 2016b additionally it was found that defective graphene id ig 1 70 with rich edge sites activated pms and completely decomposed phenol within 5 min via a nonradical pathway moreover the degradation performance of defective graphene was significantly higher than that of multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts id ig 1 35 and ordered mesoporous carbon cmk 3 id ig 1 17 duan et al 2016a surface confined so4 and 1o2 have been found to be the primary ros in pds cnts systems shao et al manufactured nanodiamonds nds at different thermal treatment temperatures and found that c o in nds activated pms to produce 1o2 shao et al 2018 apart from 1o2 lee et al found that graphitized nds could be used to activate pds to form active surface complex and the adsorbed organic pollutants acted as electron donors to transfer electrons to pds through the conductive nds lee et al 2016 duan et al showed that zero to three dimensional carbon materials go cnts and nds could effectively activate pds to produce different kinds of ros to degrade pollutants duan et al 2018b carbon configuration and dimension were the main factors that affected the adsorption and catalytic activity of carbocatalysts the adsorption of phenol was closely related to the molecular arrangement of nanocarbons in the order of 0d 1d 2d 3d however the catalytic properties of persulfate activation were not necessarily correlated with the dimension duan et al 2015 indrawirawan et al 2015 abundant free flowing π electrons in the sp2 hybridized carbon lattice surface edge defects and c o group were important for the activation and dissociation of peroxide oo bond in pds and pms based reactions for ros generation duan et al 2018b in addition modification of carbon nanomaterials by heteroatom dopants such as n s p and b effectively enhanced the performance for pds activation xiao et al 2018a wang et al found that n doped reduced graphene oxide n rgo was beneficial for the adsorption and degradation of bisphenol a bpa wang et al 2015a urea was found to be the best precursor to synthesize n doped graphene with a high nitrogen loading of 18 7 at contributing to 49 7 and 11 5 fold enhancement of phenol oxidation over go and pristine rgo therefore functionalized carbocatalysts can effectively activate pds and pms to degrade organic pollutants via radical and or nonradical processes fig 3 however some limitations still exist for the nanocarbon materials in practical applications due to the complex preparation process high cost and potential biotoxicity the fabrication methods can be categorized into top down and bottom up synthetic processes li and wong 2017 the classic hummers method for synthesis of go involves many hazardous and highly oxidizing reagents such as kmno4 h2o2 and concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids hummers and offeman 1958 graphene and go display superior bactericidal effect due to their extremely sharp edges nanoscale effect and generation of ros zhang et al 2017 additionally cnts can destroy the biological structure of cells and induce severe dna damage because the contact of cnts with bacteria leads to the destruction of cell membrane the entanglement with cells to precipitate and the production of intracellular ros kang et al 2008 qiao et al 2013 therefore the toxicity and potential biocompatibility of nanocarbons should be carefully evaluated before and after aops reaction prior to the scaled up applications in practical water remediation 4 1 3 biochar based catalyst biochar is a carbon rich solid material produced from the pyrolysis treatment of solid wastes and biomass such as sludge straw and algal residue under oxygen limited atmosphere lately biochar has been developed as a functional material due to its low cost ease of manufacturing and sustainability xiao et al 2018b biochar is applied as the carbocatalyst for activation of persulfates with large ssa graphitic structures and diverse functional groups qin et al 2019 wang and wang 2019a zhu et al found that the biochar with nitrogen doping from high temperature thermal treatment significantly improved the performance of pds activation and pollutant removal zhu et al 2018 n doped graphitized biochar produced at different temperatures exhibit different mechanisms in pds activation when the thermal treatment temperature of biochar was 400 c the dominant ros of the system were oh and so4 catalyzed by pfrs in biochar while the electron transfer mechanism dominated the oxidation catalyzed by the biochar derived at 900 c a positive correlation was observed between the organic degradation rate and adsorption capacity the organic adsorption was a rate limiting step and the pre adsorption of the contaminants promoted the subsequent nonradical oxidation near the surface of biochar therefore the strong affinity between organic matters and catalyst was beneficial to the electron transfer pathway the structures of organic substrates significantly influence the efficiency of biochar for adsorption and nonradical oxidation chen and carroll 2016 duan et al 2018a ho et al used n doped graphitic biochar from spirulina residue with large ssa nitrogen doping and excellent conductivity for catalytic pds activation figs 4 a and b and found that sdbc pds was a nonradical oxidation system figs 4c e ho et al 2019 due to the structural complexity of biochar the mechanism of biochar based catalysis needs to be further clarified the catalysis mechanism might be governed by the types and sources of biomass as well as the inherent compositions and proportions of cellulose lignocellulose protein carbohydrate and inorganic matter in sludge metal modification on biochar can effectively improve pds activation and structural robustness and reduce metal leaching rong et al fabricated magnetic biochar with high ssa using ferrous sulfate and banana peels as the precursors rong et al 2019 the biochar efficiently activated pds to achieve complete bpa removal within 20 min confirming that so4 oh and 1o2 were the dominant ros the catalyst showed high stability excellent reusability and wide adaptability over a broad ph range for decomposition of a wide array of organic microcontaminants moreover biochar supported and sulfided nzvi s nzvi bc displayed excellent performance in the oxidation of ciprofloxacin cip with pds to produce oh and so4 gao et al 2020 4 1 4 mechanism of radical and nonradical oxidation in summary the persulfate based aops involve radical and or nonradical processes the former reaction produces free radicals such as oh so4 and o2 during the persulfate activation via a one electron transfer process and chain reactions duan et al 2018a xiao et al 2018a the nonradical processes depend on1o2 electron transfer and surface confined ros transition metals can stimulate persulfate to generate free radicals while free radicals and nonradical ros may co exist in carbon based processes chen et al 2018a radical and nonradical processes can be determined by electron spin resonance esr technique using spin trapping agents and selective ros screening tests with chemical scavengers in addition electrochemical methods e g chronoamperometry and linear sweep voltammetry organic probes and solvent exchange have recently been applied to distinguish the reaction pathways ho et al 2019 lee et al 2016 compared with the free radical process the nonradical process generally exhibits a lower redox capacity with better selectivity for organics and greater resistance to environmental background matters and complicated water matrix duan et al 2018a duan et al 2018c 4 2 persulfate activation by sludge biochar recently sdbcs are applied as carbocatalysts for pds or pms activation which provides an environment friendly method for sludge treatment moreover it also produces low costand eco friendly carbon materials for wastewater treatment in a facile manner due to the different compositions of sludge sdbcs exhibit diverse characteristics and may involve different mechanisms including radical and nonradical pathways in pds and pms activation table 2 additionally alien atom dopants can further tailor the reactivity of sdbcs in the degradation of organics 4 2 1 sludge biochar catalyst huang et al prepared sludge biochar based catalysts under carbonization temperatures of 400 800 c 5 c min 1 heating rate for 6 h in nh3 ar 10 90 v v atmosphere huang et al 2018 the sdbcs pms system achieved a high mineralization efficiency of bpa 80 nevertheless 1o2 produced at the ketone groups of biochar was the dominant ros for bpa degradation more importantly the metals in sludge had a significant effect on improving the catalytic performance of biochar during the thermochemical process the biochar prepared by pre mixing bovine serum albumin bsa and 5 metal ions including al fe ca mg cu and zn led to remarkable improvement in pms activation compared with the biochar from only bsa however liang et al further investigated the role of endogenous metal ions in sludge biochar during oxidation process and found that the inherent metals in biochar had a negative effect on phenol degradation fig 5 a liang et al 2020 the biochar was prepared from sewage sludge with intrinsic metals and then demineralized by 1 m hcl and 10 hf at 400 c ss400 and dss400 and 700 c ss700 and dss700 subsequently the carbon materials were used to activate pds for phenol degradation the degradation of phenol was poor 12 6 in sludge pds system whereas the removal efficiency reached 36 3 and 57 8 after acid washing for dss400 and dss700 respectively moreover mg and k in biochar had little effect on the reaction while fe was beneficial for the phenol degradation by promoting oh and so4 production in contrast ca species blocked the active sites in biochar and prohibited oh generation resulting in less phenol degradation the relative contents of degradation intermediates in the ss400 pds and ss700 pds systems were obviously different from those of dss400 pds and dss700 pds systems fig 5b in addition yin et al found that 1o2 instead of free radicals was the main ros in the sdbcs pds system for sulfamethoxazole smx degradation 1o2 likely destroyed the aniline ring of smx to accelerate the degradation yin et al 2019b furthermore sludge biochar could be produced via conventional pyrolysis of sludge after anaerobic digestion and the derived carbons possessed large ssa high graphitization and good conductivity fig 6 a chen et al 2020a the carbocatalysts oxidized various pollutants with pds over a wide range of ph and temperature in addition biochar produced by high temperature annealing 1000 c exhibited low biotoxicity and good stability because of fewer pfrs and dom and limited metal leaching solvent exchange h2o to d2o organic probes and electrochemical measurement were applied to confirm the role of 1o2in the reaction pathways and analyze ros for degradation of pollutants d2o replaced h2o as the solvent due to the longer lifetime of 1o2 in d2o 55 µs than that in h2o 4 2 µs as shown in fig 6b the degradation rate of sulfathiazole stz was similar in d2o and h2o suggesting that 1o2 was not the dominant ros the organic probe offurfuryl alcohol ffa is an efficient scavenger of 1o2 with a high degradation rate 1 2 108m 1s 1 however the degradation rate constant of ffa in the sdbc pds system was much lower than that of phenol fig 6c electrochemical analysis techniques such as linear sweep voltammetry and chrono amperometric measurements were further applied to analyze the charge transfer processes fig 6d and e the results showed that sludge biochar pds system was based on an electron transfer regime rather than relying on free radicals or 1o2 fig 6a sludge biochar derived from high annealing temperature is more reactive because the graphitic framework promotes the adsorption of aromatic organics and induces the electron transfer process in pds based nonradical oxidation li et al 2017b the effect of chemical modification i e nh4oh koh or hcl treatment on sludge biochar pms system was also studied and high ssa and maximum c o content were attained using koh pre treated biochar mian and liu 2019 however the maximum reaction rate constant of organic matter degradation was achieved by the biochar post treated with koh sludge biochar based catalyst treated with a combination of nh4oh and koh showed excellent pms activation and degradation performance for organics due to large ssa high c o content and superior n content the nonradical process was recognized as the major mechanism of pms activation via electron transfer regime and some oh and so4 were also generated wang et al reported that sdbcs had a porous structure with high ssa of 157 4 m2 g 1 after naoh treatment and could activate pms to degrade triclosan tcs wang and wang 2019b the optimum conditions of sdbcs pms system for tcs degradation were 1 0 g l of sdbc and 0 8 mm of pms at 25 c which resulted in 32 5 of toc removal within 240 min mineralized by oh and so4 additionally hu et al prepared a carbocatalyst derived from sludge with abundant surface oxygen functional groups via a facile hydrothermal coupled conventional pyrolysis process hu et al 2019 htc was found to be crucial for increasing the oxygen content of sludge biochar most of which existed as ketone groups under the optimal reaction conditions the removal rates of bpa and toc were 100 and 69 53 within 20 min respectively and 1o2 was identified as the primary ros 4 2 2 metal based sludge biochar catalyst the properties of sludge are affected by both the metal impurities in the pristine sludge and the added metals wang et al found that sdbcs manufactured from dried sewage sludge in n2 atmosphere at 400 c achieved92 3 of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp removal via both adsorption and oxidation with pds wang et al 2017b it suggested that sdbcs can activate pds to produce various ros including oh so4 o2 and 1o2 due to the pristine existence of fe2 and fe3 on the surface of sdbcs the best catalytic activity for pms activation was achieved by fe0 fe3c composites derived at 900 c 99 of cip was removed in 20 min which was attributed to the high activity of fe0 and fe3c in another study oh so4 o2 and 1o2 were revealed as the dominant ros which contributed to the decomposition of organic pollutants zhu et al 2019 diao et al reported that fe0 and al0 particles were dispersed on the surface and within the porous structure of sdbcs they found that the ultrasound enhanced sdbc persulfate system exhibited outstanding performance for degradation of bpa in water diao et al 2020 chen et al used a one pot conventional pyrolysis method to convert iron containing dewatering ads into an iron modified biochar and the pds zvi system was applied to effectively reduce heavy metal pollution eliminate the pathogens and promote the ads recycling fig 7 a chen et al 2019c the thermal treatment temperature played an important role in tailoring the iron species in sludge the carbon surface became smooth and the size of the nanoparticles increased as the temperature increased it was found that the iron oxides gradually converted from fe3o4 to feo when the temperature increased from 600 to 1000 c fig 7b fe adsbc 1000 feo adscb with a less ferromagnetic property compared with fe3o4 could prevent the severe aggregation of magnetic materials whereas the carbocatalyst was still magnetic and could be separated from the aqueous solution by an external magnet fig 7c fe adsbc 1000 achieved the complete removal of sulfamethazine smt with pds within 60 min it indicated that the primary ros in fe adsbc pds system underwent a transformation from oh fe3o4 adscb at 600 c to so4 feo adscb at 1000 c figs 7d f moreover wang et al manufactured zero valent iron zvi sdbc using a mixture of fe containing sludge and reducing agent nabh4 via one step conventional pyrolysis without external iron source wang et al 2020 fe0 was successfully loaded on the surface of sdbc as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps it was found that 99 0 of acid orange 7 ao7 was removed by 0 925 mm pds and 0 5 g l 1 zvi sdbc via 71 9 oh and a small amount of so4 and 1o2 while 62 8 toc and 99 8 ammonia in leachate were removed wang et al prepared sdbcs by co pyrolysis of sludge with fecl3 and pam at 300 800 c they found that sdbcs prepared at 600 c achieved 88 7 of 2 naphthol degradation by oh and so4 produced from pds wang et al 2017d yu et al discussed the effect of compositions of magnetic and n doped biochar from sludge ms biochar on catalytic degradation yu et al 2019 the sludge was procured from wwtps which had been flocculated by pfs and pam as the iron and nitrogen sources respectively then the sludge residue was pyrolyzed from 400 to 800 c for 2 h under n2 atmosphere ms biochar was mainly composed of dom acid soluble substance ass carbon matrix cm and basal part bsp figs 8 a and b ass was dominant for ms 400 600 while cm was the most important component of ms 800 both ass and cm contributed to the generation of so4 and oh respectively figs 8c f they also proposed an internal electron transfer mechanism from sp3 to sp2 carbon during the reaction fig 8a composite metals and other transition metals can also be used to modify sdbcs to improve the catalytic performance in aops li et al proposed a novel method to convert sludge into porous activated carbon via washing with 20 hno3 and 3 mol l 1of hcl and then converted mnfe2o4 sludge into porous activated carbon sac nanocomposites via htc of a mixture of sac fecl3 6h2o and mncl2 4h2o li et al 2017b the mnfe2o4 sac composites exhibited a remarkable activity in activating pds for degrading orange g over a wide ph range of 3 9 and the used catalysts could be recovered easily by a magnet and recycled additionally sdbcs were integrated with cuo on macroporous silicon carbide foams to fabricate a distinctive catalyst he et al 2020 the composites displayed strong catalytic activity for the oxidation of methyl mercaptan therefore catalytic performance and reaction mechanisms of the sdbcs ps system are dependent on the structures and compositions of the biochar which can be deliberately tailored by varying the thermal treatment temperature heteroatom doping and composite formation the best sdbcs can be derived from high temperature thermal treatment for both adsorption and catalysis due to the higher graphitization degree better conductivity larger ssa and a higher content of reductive metal sites 4 2 3 factors influencing persulfate activation by sdbc in the sdbc pms or pds systems the removal efficiency and mechanism of organic contaminants are significantly affected by the dewatering treatment methods thermochemical strategies and the characteristics of the sludge conventional dewatering technologies including physical approaches freeze thaw heat and microwave treatment and chemical methods acid base coagulant and flocculant and aops treatment have been used to upgrade the sludge dewaterability these methods also change the properties of sludge to impact the compositions and structures of sdbc chen et al 2018c feng et al 2009 hu et al 2011 wei et al 2018 due to volume expansion by freezing water ice transformation freeze thaw treatment modified the pore structures and creased more micropores in sdbc therefore this approach produced high quality porous biochar which may facilitate organic adsorption and the subsequent aops meng and wang 2020 heat and microwave treatmentcan reduce moisture change the carbon structure and release eps in sludge liu et al 2016a wang et al 2019b these methods are not only used for sludge dewatering in the pretreatment process but are also used as thermochemical strategies to convert sludge into biochar bio oil and biogas hydrothermal and microwave pretreatment have been coupled with pyrolysis to achieve the redistribution and preliminary immobilization of hms aimed at reducing the potential environmental risks chen et al 2020c menéndez et al 2005 furthermore acid base treatment improved the flocculation of sludge via electrostatic interaction while the cellular substances experienced slight destruction under extreme ph conditions mikkelsen and keiding 2002 hence the acid base treatment does not significantly change the sludge structure and physiochemical characteristics by means of coagulant flocculant and aops sludge can be dewatered by the addition of reagents such as iron or aluminum thus sdbc can be in situ modified via one step pyrolysis the iron doped sdbc showed excellent activity in catalyzing pms pds based aops for water purification yu et al 2019 additionally the thermochemical processes including conventional pyrolysis mwp and htc are crucial to determine the sludge properties and indirectly influence aops depending on the temperature conventional pyrolysis is conducive to enlarge ssa enhance graphitization degree and improve conductivity at high annealing temperatures the ph value ssa and hms stability of sdbc are improved by mwp at increased temperature feng et al 2018 yuan et al 2013 high temperature carbonization improves the π π interactions of carbonaceous materials with c c bonds or benzene rings in organic contaminants tian et al 2020 the hierarchical porous structure with large ssa promotes the diffusion and adsorption of organics or pms pds toward the active sites although biochar obtained from mwp has low micro and meso pores the biochar was resistant to hms and organic leaching the mwp procedure has a high comprehensive pyrolysis characteristic index with less energy consumption menéndez et al 2005 besides htc induced the formation of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of sdbc lachos perez et al 2017 pms can be catalyzedby c o to produce 1o2 shao et al 2018 however ren et al reported that the zeta potentials of carbon materials would be reduced by strong brønsted acid sites in the oxygen containing groups ren et al 2020 4 3 effect of background matters on aops in actual water samples various background substances significantly impact the efficiency of aops which may consume ros and impede organic oxidation ghanbari and moradi 2017 hence it is necessary to further investigate the effects of background matters on the oxidation performance of biochar pds systems solution ph and temperature are two key factors determining the oxidation efficiency sdbcs show prominent catalytic efficiency in pds or pms activation processes over a wide ph range huang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b yin et al 2019b wang et al reported that the adsorption capacity of sdbcs toward 4 chlorophenol 4 cp declined at high ph because of the electrostatic repulsion forces nevertheless pds activation on sdbcs favored high ph leading to improved degradation of 4 cp because of boosted generation of oh so4 o2 and 1o2 wang et al 2017b pms was easily decomposed to1o2 underhighly alkaline condition via sdbcs which had a lower oxidizing capacity compared with oh and so4 resulting in decreased tcs removal wang and wang 2019b similar to fenton reaction the optimal ph was 2 4 for the sr aops system based on iron modified sludge biochar li et al 2017b yu et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 the effects of inorganic anions at different concentrations were evaluated in the sdbcs pds system representative inorganic anions e g cl no3 and h2po4 had limited influences on stz degradation by nonradical oxidation chen et al 2020a however yin et al found that cl and no3 had negligible impacts on smx degradation while hco3 and po4 3 dramatically inhibited the oxidationin the sdbc pds system yin et al 2019b this was possibly because hco3 and po4 3 increased the solution ph to affect the surface charge of biochar which prevented the interaction of sdbcs with persulfate ions and inhibited the production of reactive radicals in another study the presence of cl and no3 barely affected the smt removal in the fe adsbc pds system while po4 3 strongly prevented smt oxidation at high dosages because it chelated the active iron species in fe adsbc thereby blocking the catalytic sites and preventing their further interaction with pds chen et al 2019c natural organic matter nom is a heterogeneous mixture of aromatic and aliphatic compounds mainly including humic like substances lipids proteins and polysaccharides with diverse chemical functionalities and a range of molecular sizes which affects the smell taste and color of water tian et al 2018 nom may inhibit the removal of pollutants due to the competing reaction with ros giannakis et al 2016 humic acid ha is extensively used as a model substance to represent nom in water purification sun et al found that the removal efficiency of phenol reduced from 99 to 76 with the increase in concentration of ha from 0 to 30 mg l sun et al 2020 nom ubiquitously exists in surface water and wastewater nom in real water matrixes had a considerable impact on the effectiveness of the adsbc 1000 pds system and stz removal rate decreased from 100 in pure water solution to 84 81 and 74 07 in river water and wastewater respectively chen et al 2020a the inhibitory effect was probably due to competitive adsorption between pollutants pds and nom on the surface of biochar as well as the competitive consumption of ros by nom song et al 2017 5 conclusion and prospects this review presents a systematic overview of sludge derived biochar as a carbocatalyst for persulfate activation for sludge management and environmental application sludge can be efficiently converted into biochar by thermochemical approaches to solve various environment problems caused by sludge residues the constituents of sludge including inorganic organic components and water significantly affect the characteristics of sdbcs via various thermochemical processes and subsequently affect the performances in sr aops significant amounts of transition metals such as al fe ni and si and nonmetals such as c o n p and s yield diverse metal species and surface functional groups in sdbcs which serve as active sites in carbocatalysis and lead to diverse mechanisms inaops as shown in fig 9 the metals in sdbcs served as the active sites for mediating the production of free radicals such as oh and so4 on the other hand sdbcs unmodified by metals can activate pds and pms primarily through nonradical pathways including singlet oxygenation and electron transfer regime over the biochars derived from conventional pyrolysis mwp and htc however most current studies directly converted sludge into sdbcs viaone pot conventional pyrolysis and the resulting products were evaluated for activation of pds and pms to remediate the organic microcontaminants in water a few studies deliberately designed biochar with fine tuned structure and surface chemistry for better catalysis toward persulfate activation the specific designed biochar for aops can be produced by optimizing the thermochemical strategies applying physical chemical activation methods and optimizing the activation parameters in addition most studies on sdbcs were conducted on the laboratory scale and focused on developing highly efficient oxidative systems for rapid elimination of diverse organic contaminants it is important to consider the effect of complex physical environment and the environmental risk assessment including the effects of sdbcs on long term carbon sequestration release of contaminants and diverse microbial communications in water moreover the rational preparation of sludge into sdbcs requires the optimization of the sludge treatment process in wwtps life cycle analysis of this process is essential to confirm its benefits and environmental consequences which includes evaluating the consumptions of energy feedstocks and chemicals associated with the emissions into air soil and water as well as considering the potential trade offs in practical environmental remediation declaration of competing

17469,treating water and wastewater is energy intensive and traditional methods that require large amounts of chemicals are often still used electrocoagulation ec an electrochemical treatment technology has been proposed as a more economically and environmentally sustainable alternative in ec sacrificial metal electrodes are used to produce coagulant in situ which offers many benefits over conventional chemical coagulation however material precipitation on the electrodes during long term operation induces a passivating effect that decreases treatment performance and increases power requirements overcoming this problem is considered to be the greatest challenge facing the development of ec in this critical review the studies that have examined the nature of electrode passivation and its effect on treatment performance are considered a fundamental approach is used to examine the association between passivation and faradaic efficiency a surrogate for ec performance in addition the strategies that have been proposed to remove or avoid passivation are reviewed including aggressive ion addition ac current operation polarity reversal ultrasonication and mechanical cleaning of the electrodes it is concluded that the success of implementing each method is dependent on critical operating parameters and careful consideration should be taken when designing an ec system based on the phenomena discussed in this article in conclusion this review provides insight into passivation mechanisms delivers guidelines for sustaining high treatment performance and offers an outlook for the future development of ec graphical absract image graphical abstract keywords electrocoagulation water treatment electrochemistry passivation faradaic efficiency polarity reversal nomenclature ec

wastewater treatment technology that produces metal coagulant in situ by electrochemically dissolving sacrificial electrodes that are submerged in contaminated water this is achieved by applying a current to the electrodes from an external power source vik et al 1984 the positively polarized anode commonly made of steel fe ec or aluminum al ec is electrochemically dissolved eq 1 yasri and gunaskearan 2017 at the same time h2o is electrolyzed at the negatively charged cathode to produce oh and h2 g eq 2 mansoorian et al 2014 following anodic dissolution metal cations hydrolyze to form oxy hydr oxides and h3o ions symbolized as h in this article that cause the ph to drop eq 3 lakshmanan et al 2009 the acidic and alkaline environments at the electrodes create distinctive layers that have shown to be up to 0 5 mm thick using confocal imaging fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 subsequently h diffuses to the electrolyte where it is neutralized by oh transported from the cathode yasri et al 2020 the cationic character of the metal oxyhydr oxides neutralizes the negative surface charge of colloidal contaminants which causes them to destabilize and form larger aggregates together with the metal oxy hydroxides that can be separated by filtration flotation or sedimentation garcia segura et al 2017 1 m s m z aq z e 2 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h aq h 2 g 3 m z aq z h 2 o m oh z s z h aq where m represents the metal of which the electrode is made of and z is the charge transfer number an illustration of the ec process is shown in fig 1 the amount of electrochemically produced coagulant in ec can be predicted by faraday s law of electrolysis eq 4 and is proportional to the amount of charge passed through the cell yasri and gunaskearan 2017 the majority of ec experiments reported in the literature are operated galvanostatically i e at constant current to ensure effective addition of the coagulant the faradaic efficiency is often reported when evaluating ec performance which is the ratio of experimentally observed coagulant mass over the theoretical mass predicted by faraday s law eq 5 the faradaic efficiency is determined by measuring the amount of metal released over the duration of the experiment this is generally performed by dissolving all flocs in acid followed by analysis using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes chow and pham 2019 dubrawski et al 2015 a calculated faradaic efficiency of 100 is desirable since it is indicative of effective current utilization 4 theoretical amount of coagulant metal dissolved i t m z f

time s and m is the molar mass of the metal g mol 1 ec is often compared to chemical coagulation cc where metal ions are added to contaminated water as salts such as aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride however it has been shown that ec is more cost effective than cc per unit water treated for many different applications because of some significant advantages that ec exhibits garcia segura et al 2017 price et al 2018 timmes et al 2010 vik et al 1984 for example the cationic coagulant in ec is produced in situ without adding unnecessary counter ions that contribute to sludge production ölmez 2009 meanwhile counter ions in cc remaining in the dissolved phase must be removed in subsequent treatment steps depending on discharge limits mamelkina et al 2017 in addition neutralizing chemicals must be added in cc to mitigate the ph drop caused by the hydrolysis of the metal salts eq 3 this is achieved by using a neutralizing chemical such as lime ca2 oh 2 garcia segura et al 2017 the cathodic reaction in ec produces h2 g and oh providing an in situ ph neutralizing mechanism wang et al 2009 furthermore the uniform metal dissolution of the electrodes as opposed to point addition in cc reduces the need for intense mechanical mixing which lowers energy demands while making the coagulation process more efficient uniform metal ion addition in ec also permits lower coagulant dosing which further curtails sludge production additionally the prospect of harnessing the h2 g produced at the cathode makes ec a viable energy storage technology phalakornkule et al 2010 lastly using commonplace materials such as iron and aluminum for local electrode manufacturing allows remote communities to sustain treatment without relying on resupplying chemicals thus eliminating transportation costs that are burdensome to areas such as northern canada ragush et al 2015 tartakovsky et al 2018 however problems with long term ec operation persist for example the precipitation of solids on the electrodes over time and its ensuing passivating effect increases operating costs and lowers treatment efficiency bandaru et al 2020 garcia segura et al 2017 müller et al 2019 furthermore storing the electrodes between treatment cycles and removing the initial passivating surface layer during reactor startup has shown to be problematic van genuchten et al 2016 additionally non uniform electrode consumption can compromise the structural integrity of the electrodes which requires them to be prematurely exchanged bandaru et al 2020 wellner et al 2018 it is widely recognized that overcoming these challenges is imperative to the development of ec bian et al 2019 kabdaşlı et al 2012 in this article the existing body of scientific literature related to the nature of electrode passivation in ec is reviewed a fundamental approach is used to study the electrochemical and chemical mechanisms governing coagulant production and electrode passivation while also examining different strategies that have been proposed to mitigate the detrimental effects of passivation some of these strategies include increasing the flowrate to enhance hydrodynamic scouring karamati niaragh et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 adding depassivating salts to the water van genuchten et al 2016 mechanically cleaning the electrodes sahu et al 2014 ultra sonication maha lakshmi and sivashanmugam 2013 or changing the current waveform eyvaz et al 2009 karamati niaragh et al 2019 pi et al 2014 sahu et al 2014 timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2017 2016 yet 2011 each method is evaluated and suggestions for future research are provided to date published reviews of ec have focused on general operation or on the abatement of a specific pollutant chen 2004 emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 garcia segura et al 2017 kabdaşlı et al 2012 mollah et al 2001 2004a moussa et al 2017 sahu et al 2014 yasri et al 2020 while these reviews are useful pollutant removal is dependent on both coagulant dosing in the ec reactor and the subsequent separation process overall this involves many controllable variables which makes it difficult to distinguish between the sensitivity of different operating parameters as concluded by timmes et al 2010 ec should be regarded as a two step process i e coagulant dosing followed by flocculation and separation therefore the scope of this article is to focus on the coagulant dosing component while disregarding floc separation 2 electrode surface layers passivation and ec performance 2 1 principles of electrode surface layer formation and passivation passivation is a concept emanating from corrosion science which describes the formation of a protective film on a metal surface usually comprised of metal oxides the passivation layer impedes the kinetics of otherwise thermodynamically favorable metal oxidation which increases the resistance at the electrode electrolyte interface schmuki 2002 in the ec literature this is commonly referred to as a surface layer film müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2016 the terms passive layer and surface layer are often used interchangeably however a surface layer does not have to be passivating i e it could also be conductive bandaru et al 2020 schmuki 2002 furthermore the surface layer formation process has also been referred to as electrode fouling schulz et al 2009 yasri et al 2020 to sustain effective electrochemical dissolution of the anode the applied cell potential u must overcome several resistances within the cell eq 6 these energy barriers are expressed as a series of overpotentials η which are encountered at the electrode electrolyte interfaces namely the activation concentration and passivation overpotentials chen et al 2002 the activation overpotential is associated with the kinetic energy barrier that the electron exchange process exhibits whereas the passivation overpotential pertains to the energy required for dissolved metal to penetrate the passivating surface layer which increases the polarization resistance due to the availability of metal in the anode the concentration overpotential there is negligible 6 u e η a n a η a n c η a n p η c t a η c t c η c t p d k i where e is the thermodynamic equilibrium potential for the electrochemical cell and ηan a ηan c and ηan p are the anodic activation concentration and passivation overpotentials respectively likewise ηct a ηct c and ηct p are the equivalent overpotentials at the cathode furthermore d is the distance between the electrodes k is the electrolyte conductivity and i is the current density fig 2 illustrates the distribution of the cell potential and breaks down the components outlined in eq 6 within the ec reactor the equilibrium potential depicted at the anode is relative to the potential of the cathode as an anodic surface layer is formed metal dissolution is impeded which raises the passivation overpotential and increases the energy consumption in ec holt et al 2005 2002 mechelhoff et al 2013a van genuchten et al 2016 xu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 extreme passivation may lead to electrochemical side reactions that decrease coagulant production during galvanostatic operation or cause a complete termination of the passage of current during potentiostatic constant voltage operation huang et al 2009 for example anodic o2 g or cl2 g evolution eqs 7 8 have been proposed as unwanted side reactions that occur when the total anodic overpotential is sufficiently high during galvanostatic operation dubrawski et al 2015 7 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e e o 1 23 v vs she 8 2 c l c l 2 2 e e o 1 36 v vs she the formation of the electrode surface layer is dependent on specific ec operating conditions such as electrolyte conductivity composition electrode material dissolved oxygen do current density and polarization cycles van genuchten et al 2017 2016 during ec operation it is generally desirable to maintain a high electrolyte conductivity and a low inter electrode distance to reduce ohmic losses potential drop in the solution which reduces the cell potential eq 6 mollah et al 2001 however small inter electrode gaps and high electrolyte conductivities increase the variations in the current density distribution over the electrode geometry which causes uneven wear of the anode and is problematic to long term operation mcbeath et al 2020 the electrode surface layer can be a mono layer of absorbed molecules or consist of multiple layers schmuki 2002 for example a porous surface layer will be less passivating than a non porous layer due to its enhanced charge carrying properties several fouling mechanisms are possible and may include the precipitation of dissolved species adsorption of colloidal suspended particles or solid phase transformations at the anode surface pally et al 2020 the formation of a metal oxide layer through anodization to prevent further corrosion is an established phenomenon for aluminum zinc magnesium and several other metals roberge 2008 for example metal oxide coated anodes are utilized for some electrochemical applications e g anodic electro oxidation for wastewater disinfection wu et al 2014 at the anode interface the low ph environment inhibits the buildup of a surface layer which works as a passivation prevention mechanism however metal oxides can precipitate on the anode over time if their solubility limits are exceeded chen et al 2002 similarly ca2 and mg2 in the electrolyte can precipitate as minerals and form a passivating surface layer in the high ph environment at the cathode doggaz et al 2019 sahu et al 2014 additionally cations could be transported and sorbed to the negatively polarized cathode by electrophoretic migration and electrostatic interactions sahu et al 2014 xu et al 2017 otherwise referred to as electro condensation hu et al 2003 likewise anions could migrate towards and bind to the positively polarized anode this effect could explain why electrode surface layers have been observed to be thicker at higher current densities dubrawski et al 2015 mansouri et al 2011 müller et al 2019 although the effect of electrophoretic migration is diminished at high supporting electrolyte concentrations mechelhoff 2008 alternatively electrochemically produced metal cations could precipitate with oxyanions and adsorb to the electrode surface for example a passivating alpo4 surface layer has been observed on electrodes in phosphate electrolytes in al ec mansouri et al 2011 similarly feso4 can form a passivating surface layer in the presence of so4 2 in fe ec gerónimo lópez et al 2014 the probability of exceeding the solubility limits of metal salts at the anode interface is greater while operating at higher current densities because of the increased concentration of metal ions the exact mechanisms for how co existing ions contribute to passivation in ec is not clear but an illustration of the possible mechanisms is provided in fig 3 in batch experiments it is often seen that the bulk solution ph shifts towards higher values over time especially at higher current densities due to oh production outcompeting metal hydrolysis i e h generation which has more sluggish reaction kinetics garcia segura et al 2017 lakshmanan et al 2009 for example the ph equilibrated around 8 9 in al ec after 60 80 min of galvanostatic operation which was independent of the initial ph mansouri et al 2011 additionally when buffering agents are present i e salts of weak acids such as phosphates pka1 2 1 pka2 7 2 pka1 12 4 and carbonates pka1 3 6 pka2 6 3 pka3 10 3 h protons produced through hydrolysis at the anode are quenched consequently the acidic ph boundary layer is thinner in buffered solutions than in unbuffered systems which increases the likelihood of metal oxyhydr oxides precipitating at the anode lumsden et al 1981 refaey 2005 however it has been shown that adding salts containing nh4 pka 9 3 which is amphoteric enhances ec performance in al ec by avoiding an excessive increase in bulk solution ph izquierdo et al 2010 trompette and vergnes 2009 it has also been shown that the shift towards alkaline ph is less pronounced in al ec than in fe ec due to the buffering effect of aluminum monomeric species that form in the bulk solution al oh 2 al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 al oh 4 and polymeric species such as al6 oh 15 3 al7 oh 17 4 al8 oh 20 4 al13o4 oh 24 7 daneshvar et al 2007 fayad et al 2017 kobya et al 2006 ultimately the presence of buffering agents in the electrolyte can either be beneficial or detrimental to avoiding passivation depending on the solution composition 2 2 potentiodynamic polarization methods to study passivation the nature of electrode passivation can be characterized by polarization studies dura and breslin 2019 schmuki 2002 potentiodynamic polarization methods are often used in corrosion studies lee and pyun 2000 pyun et al 1999 however some studies have adopted this methodology to investigate the characteristics of electrochemical dissolution in ec hu et al 2003 mansouri et al 2011 panikulam et al 2018 data from these experiments are usually presented as tafel plots fig 4 the minimum in current density determines the equilibrium potential e also referred to as the corrosion potential esmailzadeh et al 2018 at this potential the kinetic rates of reduction oxidation are equal and the net current approaches zero the current density plateau in the anodic potential region adjacent to the corrosion potential is the passivation range here the presence of a passivating surface layer impedes the dissolution of the electrode even though electrochemical oxidation becomes more thermodynamically favorable with increasing anodic potentials however the current dramatically increases at a certain potential indicating the start of the active dissolution range also referred to as pitting corrosion zhang and ma 2019 the width of this range corresponds to the passivation overpotential and an increase in the passivation range is indicative of a higher polarization resistance at the electrode electrolyte interface pitting is initiated by ions breaking down the electrode surface layer or by the dissolution of the surface film when the electrode boundary layer becomes sufficiently acidic due to metal hydrolysis lumsden et al 1981 aggressive ions such as cl enhance pitting corrosion due to the ionic mobility that allows them to penetrate the electrode surface oxide film consequently cl reacts with the metal oxides which dissolves the surface layer and exposes the underlying raw metal golder et al 2007 it has also been proposed that clo formed at the anode following cl cl2 oxidation destroys the passivating surface layer zhou et al 2020 in the presence of cl the corrosion and pitting potentials shift towards more negative potentials while decreasing the width of the passivation range mansouri et al 2011 it is well established that the electrode corrosion characteristics are dependent on the nature of the supporting electrolyte hu et al 2003 mansouri et al 2011 by changing operating conditions such as the electrolyte composition ph or electrode material the corrosion and pitting potentials shift higher corrosion pitting potentials are indicative of increased passivation i e a greater voltage must be applied to initiate metal dissolution additionally based on operating conditions the current densities within a potential window vary for example current densities within the scanned potential window were higher in fe ec than in al ec in a synthetic kaolin solution indicating faster corrosion kinetics panikulam et al 2018 comparatively lower current densities in the active dissolution range are also indicative of greater polarization resistance and electrode passivation hu et al 2003 reported greater polarization resistance with aluminum electrodes when scanning from low to high potentials 1 5 v to 3 0 v vs sce in the presence of only f compared to when cl no3 and so4 were present in the electrolyte it was hypothesized that enhanced electrophoretic migration and adsorption of f to the anode caused this effect in contrast no passive region was observed under similar experimental conditions but without f in the electrolyte mansouri et al 2011 corrosion characteristics are also affected by the ph at the electrode electrolyte interface for example by increasing the initial ph from 2 to 11 in a nacl electrolyte 0 1 m it was observed that the corrosion potential shifted towards more negative potentials when scanning from 1 5 v to 3 0 v vs sce in al ec mansouri et al 2011 in the same study mansouri et al observed that the pitting potential was independent of ph which corresponded to the increased width of the passivation range as the ph was increased a similar observation was also made by el ghenymy et al 2020 with titanium electrodes both studies attributed the changes in the corrosion characteristics to a more favorable dissolution of the electrode in alkaline ph however a shift towards more negative corrosion potentials when scanning from cathodic to anodic currents is also caused by the cathodic electrolysis of h2o being more thermodynamically favorable in lower ph roberge 2008 this effect explains why the corrosion potentials were relatively high at ph 2 even though aluminum dissolution was favorable under these conditions see section 2 3 2 the corrosion parameters reported from potentiodynamic polarization studies in ec are presented in table 1 2 3 passivation of different electrode materials the mechanism and rate of electrode passivation and corrosion vary depending on the electrode materials that are used ec is traditionally operated with either steel or aluminum electrodes other metals such as zinc liu et al 2018 vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 magnesium kamaraj et al 2013 and titanium ti el ghenymy et al 2020 have also been shown to abate aqueous contaminants effectively using ec but they are also susceptible to passivation el ghenymy et al 2020 kamaraj et al 2013 vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 most research has focused on studying the electrochemical behavior speciation and coagulation mechanisms for iron usually steel and aluminum electrodes due to their abundant availability and low procurement costs holt et al 2002 the price of steel is more economical than aluminum but better removal performance with aluminum electrodes for certain pollutants has made it an attractive alternative 2 3 1 passivation behavior of iron electrodes in ec observed rates of metal dissolution indicate that fe ii ions are initially dissolved from the fe 0 anode eq 9 which is thermodynamically favorable over fe 0 fe iii oxidation fig 5 fe ii is subsequently oxidized to fe iii ions by dissolved oxygen in the bulk solution eq 10 which is favored at higher ph dubrawski and mohseni 2013 holt et al 2002 lakshmanan et al 2009 sasson et al 2009 van genuchten et al 2017 vepsäläinen 2012 additionally given a sufficiently acidic environment fe 0 can be chemically dissolved from the anode eq 11 golder et al 2011 9 fe s f e 2 aq 2 e e o 0 44 v vs she 10 4 f e 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 f e 3 4 o h 11 f e 0 2 h f e 2 h 2 following the generation of these ions they hydrolyze into a wide variety of oxyhydr oxides which can be comprised of fe ii fe iii or a combination of both dubrawski et al 2015 lakshmanan et al 2009 some oxyhydr oxides such as magnetite fe3o4 and hematite fe2o3 can form by the solid phase oxidation of fe 0 in alkaline ph furthermore fe oxyhydr oxides function as the coagulant in the bulk solution but also contribute to the buildup of the electrode surface layer van genuchten et al 2017 therefore the nature of fe ii iii speciation is vital because different oxyhydr oxides exhibit distinctive passivating characteristics bandaru et al 2020 the formation of different oxides is best represented by pourbaix diagrams fig 5 which show the stability range of metal oxides with respect to electrochemical and ph conditions schmuki 2002 the speciation of fe ii iii oxyhydr oxides depending on do and electrolyte chemistry has been mapped and is shown in fig 6 dubrawski et al 2015 it has been demonstrated that the primary fe oxyhydr oxides that form in ec are green rust fe3o4 and lepidocrocite γ feooh dubrawski et al 2015 dubrawski and mohseni 2013 of these products fe iii species γ feooh exhibit the poorest conductivity and their incorporation in the electrode surface layer is conducive to a higher degree of passivation bandaru et al 2020 gerónimo lópez et al 2014 meanwhile fe ii containing species e g fe3o4 are more conductive and less detrimental to passivation bandaru et al 2020 it has also been reported that the formation of the different precipitates depends on the concentration of do ph electrolyte composition and the fe ii fe iii ratio within the reactor the nature of these parameters varies based on the charge loading rate c l 1 min 1 which is a function of the current density and reactor geometry because green rust and fe3o4 are fe ii iii complexes they form when the fe ii fe iii ratio is low i e in acidic and low do conditions when fe ii fe iii oxidation is retarded dubrawski et al 2015 additionally green rust is an intermediate in fe3o4 and γ feooh formation and can be isolated in the presence of sulfates phosphates and carbonates dubrawski et al 2015 moreno et al 2009 furthermore fe ii iii oxyhydr oxide formation is favored when the rate of fe ii generation is at least three times higher than the rate of do replenishment van genuchten et al 2018 therefore if o2 g is produced in anodic side reactions do levels would increase and prompt fe ii fe iii oxidation hence facilitating the formation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides i e γ feooh fig 6 by analyzing the anode surface layer using x ray powder diffraction xrd it was determined that fe3o4 is its main constituent bandaru et al 2020 van genuchten et al 2016 consequently this makes the composition of the electrode surface layers in ec different than the surface layers on naturally corroded steel which usually contain fe iii species such as γ feooh akaganeit b feooh or hematite a fe2o3 cook 2005 van genuchten et al 2016 furthermore it is well known that little passivation occurs in solutions with high cl concentrations in contrast electrodes are prone to passivate in the presence of dissolved oxyanions such as nitrate sulfate carbonate phosphate silicate formate citrate molybdate and chromate lakshmipathiraj et al 2008 refaey 2005 van genuchten et al 2017 xu et al 2015 as an electrode surface passivates or depassivates the anodic overpotential increases or decreases respectively this response becomes apparent in chronopotentiometric and chronogalvanometric studies fig 7 mechelhoff et al 2013a van genuchten et al 2017 oxyanions exhibit strong affinities to fe 0 and fe oxyhydr oxides whereas cl and br ions replace oxyanions in the inner molecular layer close to the electrode surface effectively weakening the surface layer which ultimately leads to pitting corrosion because cl and br form highly soluble complexes with iron maintaining sufficient availability of aggressive ions can be used to prevent electrode passivation a strategy that is discussed in section 3 1 the effect of passivation in fe ec is particularly evident in no3 solutions fig 7 the passivating behavior of no3 is different than other ions because it does not form a strong interaction with fe ii iii complexes van genuchten et al 2017 however no3 accelerates fe oxyhydr oxide formation which enhances the buildup of the electrode surface layer this effect may be caused by the electrochemical reduction of no3 to no2 nh3 and n2 which liberates hydroxide ions and raises the solution ph additionally in solutions with considerable sulfate concentrations fe ii iii ions have shown to form precipitates with so4 2 for example feso4 and green rust sulfate may form on the electrode surface which contributes to passivation gerónimo lópez et al 2014 the ordering of ionic species from least to most negative impact on fe 0 dissolution and passivation has been determined as chloride bromide sulfate formate carbonate phosphate citrate nitrate van genuchten et al 2017 the effect of increasing current density has also been shown to affect passivation in fe ec for example high current densities increase the total overpotential η at the electrode according to the butler volmer equation eq 12 dubrawski et al 2015 12 i i 0 exp a a z f r t η exp a c z f r t η where i is the current density i0 is the exchange current density aa and ac are electron transfer coefficients r is the universal gas constant t is the temperature and η is the total electrode overpotential activation concentration and passivation overpotentials when the anode overpotential corresponding to the applied current density is sufficiently high o2 g evolution can be triggered this side reaction has been seen when operating at 125 ma cm 2 dubrawski et al 2015 which is exceptionally high compared to the typical current densities reported by other authors see tables 2 4 additionally a higher current density leads to more significant electrophoretic migration of charged suspended particles in the electrolyte which could contribute to fouling and passivation alkhatib et al 2020 sulfide species can exist in certain types of effluents such as produced water from oil production chow and pham 2019 the presence of sulfides in fe ec is critical to acknowledge due to its reactivity within the electrochemical stability range of water and its ability to affect ec performance vepsäläinen 2012 sulfide will be present in different species depending on ph and do concentration h2s is a weak acid pka 7 and exists in acidic environments whereas hs is present in alkaline conditions guan et al 2017 while the impact of sulfides on ec performance has not been extensively studied it has been shown in potentiodynamic polarization studies that their presence effectively mitigates passivation and favors pitting corrosion hernández espejel et al 2011 the same study used thermodynamic modeling to show that fe 0 reacts with sulfide to form mackinawite fes pyrite fes2 and subsequently fe2o3 fe3o4 in later oxidation stages a sequence of chemical and electrochemical reactions was proposed as mechanisms for these transformations initially fe ii is electrochemically produced at the anode which forms fes upon reacting with h2s in the acidic boundary layer eq 13 chemically generated fes either precipitates on the electrode surface or is transported to the bulk solution the formation of fes by this mechanism has been reported elsewhere guan et al 2017 rickard and luther 2007 vepsäläinen 2012 furthermore xrd analysis has shown that a mixture of iron sulfides and fe oxyhydr oxides form on steel electrodes after anodic polarization it was therefore proposed that fes is further oxidized to fe oxyhydr oxides at the anode surface eqs 14 15 hernández espejel et al 2011 it was also hypothesized that sulfur species could oxidize to so4 2 at high overpotentials 13 f e 2 h 2 s fes 2 h 14 2 fes 3 h 2 o f e 2 o 3 2 h 2 s 2 h 2 e 15 3 fes 4 h 2 o f e 3 o 4 3 h 2 s 2 h 2 e post experiment transmission electron microscopy tem images of electrodes have also revealed signs of elemental sulfur formation as a result of h2s oxidation chow and pham 2019 lastly in an attempt to electrodeposit fes2 on steel electrodes researchers found that the surface layer was primarily comprised of crystalline fes whereas no fes2 was observed this was explained by fes2 formation exhibiting sluggish reaction kinetics even though it was thermodynamically favorable under the experimental conditions guan et al 2017 2 3 2 passivation behavior of aluminum electrodes in ec aluminum ions only have one oxidation state z 3 but upon electrochemical dissolution these ions can hydrolyze into many types of polymeric hydroxide species mouedhen et al 2008 following al 0 dissolution al oh 2 and al oh 2 tend to form in acidic conditions whereas al oh 4 forms in alkaline media phalakornkule et al 2010 meanwhile solid al oh 3 al2o3 exist within the range of ph 4 9 5 moussa et al 2017 roberge 2008 interestingly observed concentrations of aluminum in the electrolyte often exceed that of 100 faradaic efficiency cañizares et al 2007 2005 chen et al 2000 izquierdo et al 2010 mouedhen et al 2008 it has been shown that al iii is primarily produced electrochemically at the anode but the super faradaic behavior is a result of chemical corrosion at both the anode and the cathode fig 8 fekete et al 2016 where the cathodic chemical corrosion of al 0 is catalyzed by the alkaline environment mouedhen et al 2008 without applying an electrical current al 0 dissolution increases dramatically above ph 11 compared to iron which corrodes spontaneously below ph 4 cañizares et al 2007 it has also been reported that the chemical corrosion of al 0 at the cathode accelerates with increasing temperature ben grich et al 2019 meanwhile the authors claimed that the electrochemical dissolution of the anode was unaffected by temperature changes furthermore it has also been shown using gas chromatography that al 0 is oxidized by h hence generating h2 g at the anode fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 the electrochemical and the chemical dissolution of al 0 are shown in eqs 16 18 respectively 16 al s a l 3 aq 3 e e o 1 66 v vs she 17 6 h 2 al s 3 h 2 2 a l 3 aq 18 6 h 2 o 2 o h 2 al s 2 al oh 4 3 h 2 when aluminum metal is exposed to air a film of alumina al2o3 forms on the surface which is stable in water at circumneutral ph badawy et al 1999 schmuki 2002 trompette and vergnes 2009 the oxide film thickness has been reported to be between 1 and 5 nm using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analyses martin et al 2005 mechelhoff et al 2013a contrary to the formation of oxyhydr oxides on iron electrodes the al2o3 film is insulating hence functioning as a dielectric schmuki 2002 the insulating al2o3 surface layer must be broken down to facilitate effective ec performance and is replaced by a porous layer of al oh 3 al2o3 during ec operation badawy et al 1999 gao et al 2010 mansouri et al 2011 furthermore on the aluminum pourbaix diagram fig 9 it is seen that al 0 al oh 3 oxidation occurs in circumneutral ph which is another example of a solid phase transformation that contributes to electrode surface layer growth passivation has been studied for aluminum electrodes with different electrolyte compositions solutions containing cl f and no3 have shown to decrease electrochemical overpotentials and produce higher faradaic efficiencies compared to solutions with high concentrations of so4 2 hu et al 2003 mansouri et al 2011 the passivating effect of so4 2 in al ec has also been reported elsewhere huang et al 2009 izquierdo et al 2010 mansouri et al 2011 and it is well established in the corrosion literature lee and pyun 2000 pyun et al 1999 potentiodynamic polarization studies have shown that pitting potentials are increased and current densities are decreased in so4 2 and h2po4 solutions compared to in high concentration nacl electrolytes mansouri et al 2011 in the presence of cl the al oh 3 al2o3 passivation layer breaks down according to eqs 19 23 mansouri et al 2011 which is conducive to pitting corrosion 19 a l 2 o 3 6 c l 6 h 2 alc l 3 3 h 2 o 20 al oh 3 c l al oh 2 cl o h 21 al oh 2 cl c l al oh c l 2 o h 22 al oh c l 2 c l alc l 3 o h 23 alc l 3 c l alcl 4 at sufficiently high so4 2 concentrations it was observed that no al 0 dissolved at all while operating at a constant voltage huang et al 2009 additionally the electrolyte ph remained the same throughout the experiment indicating that little or no current passed through the reactor due to extreme passivation other studies have reported evidence of current termination during potentiostatic operation in so4 2 electrolytes e g an aluminum anode surface showed little sign of corrosion in post experiment scanning electron microscopy sem images hu et al 2003 there was no sign of a thick or porous layer indicating that the surface layer was thin and not visible in sem in contrast other researchers showed that al 0 dissolution was unaffected by changing the supporting electrolyte from nacl to na2so4 cañizares et al 2005 in this case the authors concluded that metal dissolution was more sensitive to ph changes i e higher alkalinity favoring al 0 al iii dissolution however the salt concentrations used in these experiments were 2 45 and 3 0 g l 1 which are high side reactions such as cl2 g evolution triggered by high cl concentrations could explain these trends in contrast some authors have recommended using na2so4 over nacl as a supporting electrolyte in al ec due to the enhanced conductivity of so4 2 yildiz et al 2008 the choice between different supporting electrolytes in ec has been a topic of controversy and ghernaout and ghernaout 2011 published a review paper on the contradicting conclusions that have been reported while no3 is detrimental to fe ec performance it may promote metal dissolution in al ec hu et al 2003 this effect may be caused by no3 reduction to no2 nh3 and n2 at the cathode eqs 24 26 thus oxidizing al 0 al iii and generating oh hu et al 2003 the increased concentration of oh could trigger a feedback loop that further promotes the chemical dissolution of al 0 eq 18 however a thick al oh 3 surface layer was observed on the anode in the presence of no3 compared to no observable oxide film in the cl electrolyte hu et al 2003 furthermore the reduction mechanisms for no3 is corroborated by relatively higher ph values observed in no3 solutions than in cl electrolytes huang et al 2009 the authors hypothesized that the lower ph in the presence of cl was caused by the anodic oxidation of cl cl2 g and further production of hocl that had a buffering effect which enhanced the speciation of al hydroxides consequently higher contaminant removal efficiencies were reported in the cl solutions compared to in the no3 electrolytes even though the faradaic efficiencies were similar in both cases the buffering effect of high cl concentrations has been reported elsewhere ben grich et al 2019 24 6 no 3 18 h 2 o 10 a l 0 10 a l 3 aq 3 n 2 36 o h 25

depassivation is not as likely to occur on smooth electrodes due to enhanced structural integrity of the surface layers mechelhoff et al 2013a however it is not apparent if this phenomenon is unique to the nature of al oh 3 al2o3 surface layers or if it applies to fe ec passivation as well as mentioned in section 2 1 formation of alpo4 on electrode surfaces has been observed in phosphate electrolytes which reinforces the passivating surface layer mansouri et al 2011 also the presence of carbonates phosphates silicates and arsenates has shown to lower f removal in al ec while operating galvanostatically vasudevan et al 2011 however it was unclear if this was a result of electrode passivation instead it was suggested that carbonates passivated the anode surface whereas the other ions decreased f removal by competitive adsorption on the aluminum coagulant however as mentioned in section 2 2 f has been shown to passivate aluminum electrodes in ec hu et al 2003 furthermore the passivating effects of carbonates and phosphates have also been reported elsewhere doggaz et al 2019 dura and breslin 2019 lastly the effect of organics such as humic acids on the anodic dissolution and passivation of al 0 is not apparent mechelhoff et al 2013a 2013b but it has been reported that higher concentrations of humic acids form a gelatinous layer on the anode surface which effectively inhibits metal dissolution yildiz et al 2008 2 3 3 summary of passivation of different electrodes the presence of most oxyanions in the electrolyte is detrimental to both al and fe ec performance the exception is that no3 is passivating in fe ec izquierdo et al 2010 thiam et al 2014 but possibly conducive to chemical corrosion in al ec hu et al 2003 few studies have investigated the effect of cations on ec performance but trompette and vergnes 2009 found that the presence of na had a negligible impact on al ec operation whereas izquierdo et al 2010 observed that k had a detrimental effect on faradaic efficiencies in fe ec furthermore bench scale experiments demonstrated that electrode fouling was not as pronounced in al ec as in fe ec shamaei et al 2018 however severe material precipitation on the electrodes in al ec has been reported on the pilot scale schulz et al 2009 it is also unclear if there are differences in passivation behavior for electrodes made of different grades of steel and aluminum which should be investigated in future studies interestingly müller et al 2019 found that overpotentials were higher when using lower purity steel in fe ec field trials compared to when using high purity steel in laboratory experiments however it is unclear if the electrode purity was the main contributor to this effect lastly while so4 2 ions are passivating for both materials sulfate electrolytes have shown to facilitate anodic dissolution in ti ec el ghenymy et al 2020 this observation highlights the complex nature of electrode passivation dissolution which depends upon both the electrode material and the electrolyte composition which can vary widely 2 4 passivation and faradaic efficiency it is generally presumed that higher faradaic efficiencies are correlated with enhanced contaminant removal and maintaining high efficiency is imperative to sustaining efficient ec performance müller et al 2019 the faradaic efficiency of a given ec process is related to the degree of electrode passivation and as mentioned previously severe surface layer growth can adversely affect faradaic efficiency by triggering side reactions or terminating the current this is particularly evident in experiments with high concentrations of oxyanions in the electrolyte hu et al 2003 huang et al 2009 izquierdo et al 2010 müller et al 2019 therefore the relationship between the faradaic efficiency and passivation is important for understanding the electrochemical efficacy of the ec process generally faradaic efficiencies are around 100 in fe ec independent of current density and the do concentration lakshmanan et al 2009 low faradaic efficiencies have been observed at high current densities which has been attributed to unwanted anodic o2 g evolution that was corroborated by bubbles forming on the anode dubrawski et al 2015 additionally the faradaic efficiency dropped from 116 to around 80 in al ec when increasing the current density from 18 ma cm 2 to 52 ma cm 2 chen et al 2020 low faradaic efficiencies have also been reported for experiments carried out at ph 9 possibly caused by o2 g evolution which is more favorable in alkaline conditions sasson et al 2009 as mentioned in section 2 3 1 an increased current density eq 12 strengthens the anodic polarization which attracts particles that could contribute to electrode passivation additionally once o2 g evolution is initiated γ feooh formation is favored which further promotes passivation the formation of o2 g has either been observed or assumed to be the cause of faradaic efficiencies lower than 100 cañizares et al 2005 gao et al 2010 golder et al 2007 heidmann and calmano 2008 kobya et al 2006 mamelkina et al 2017 mollah et al 2004b müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 vepsäläinen 2012 the most convincing evidence substantiating o2 g generation are do concentration measurements exceeding saturation values in fe ec in a no3 electrolyte operating at 10 ma cm 2 van genuchten et al 2017 as mentioned in section 2 3 2 it was also reported and confirmed using confocal imaging and gas chromatography that h2 g forms on the anode not o2 g in al ec when operating with current densities up to 16 ma cm 2 fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 others have also hypothesized or observed h2 g formation in fe ec due to chemical corrosion eq 11 cañizares et al 2007 golder et al 2011 guan et al 2017 furthermore it has been suggested that o2 g evolution does not take place in al ec due to the thermodynamic favorability of al 0 al iii dissolution mouedhen et al 2008 therefore the extent to which anodic o2 g evolution in ec is responsible for observed faradaic efficiencies below 100 is still uncertain other mechanisms that can affect coagulant production must be explored during ec operation measured metal dissolution quantities could be artificially low due to inhomogeneous concentrations within the reactor bandaru et al 2020 as mentioned in the introduction the faradaic efficiency is commonly determined by sampling the bulk solution followed by acid digestion and icp oes analysis müller et al 2019 the potential issue is that the total electrochemically dissolved iron is distributed between the bulk solution the electrode surface layer and the precipitated sludge ultimately efficient coagulant mixing is essential and high fe oxyhydr oxide concentrations in the electrolyte are imperative to sustaining high treatment performance recent studies have provided more nuanced insights into the cause of low faradaic efficiencies in fe ec bandaru et al 2020 müller et al 2019 for example it has been demonstrated that once a surface layer has formed electrochemically produced fe ii is trapped within the lattice of the surface layer bandaru et al 2020 müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 2016 consequently dissolved metal is hindered from diffusing or migrating to the bulk solution hence accelerating the surface layer buildup fig 10 due to the porous and conductive nature of this type of surface layer it is non passive which has been shown in chronopotentiometric studies müller et al 2019 therefore assuming that this effect is responsible for declines in electrochemically dissolved metal faradaic efficiencies of 100 would be expected if they were determined from lost electrode mass after removing the surface layer post experiment this method has been used by one study cesar lopes geraldino et al 2016 which still observed variations in the faradaic efficiency of electrode consumption under different experimental conditions however the connection between coagulant accumulation in the surface layer faradaic efficiency and operating conditions merits further investigation alternatively a shift from fe 0 fe ii to fe 0 fe iii eq 27 at higher anodic overpotentials is thermodynamically favorable over o2 g evolution and could make it seem like the observed faradaic efficiency is low moreno et al 2009 assuming that this phenomenon takes place there would be a shift in the molar rate of electrochemically dissolved metal because the charge transfer number would increase from 2 to 3 therefore less iron coagulant would be produced per unit charge which would lower the calculated faradaic efficiency assuming a two electron transfer reaction eq 5 however it has been suggested that direct fe 0 fe iii oxidation is negligible sasson et al 2009 and none of the reviewed studies reported evidence of this occurring in addition using electrodes of different steel grades could also affect faradaic efficiency for example impurities ni v cr could be preferentially oxidized over fe 0 few studies have compared using electrodes of different steel aluminum purities but müller et al 2019 found that using a higher purity iron electrode did not enhance the observed faradaic efficiency in fe ec nevertheless using low purity metal may be problematic due to the release of toxic impurities into the water 27 fe s f e 3 aq 3 e e o 0 037 v vs she another suggested hypothesis is that fe ii and fe iii ions are reduced to fe 0 at the cathode which would decrease the measured faradaic efficiency van genuchten et al 2016 yang et al 2015 however this hypothesis has not been thoroughly investigated moreover the evolution of br2 g and cl2 g is thermodynamically possible at sufficiently high electrode potentials and occurs in electro oxidation with boron doped diamond electrodes ferro et al 2000 however it has been suggested that these reactions are unlikely to occur in ec even at overpotentials above their standard reduction potentials van genuchten et al 2017 direct oxidation of organics at the anode surface could also cause a drop in the measured faradaic efficiency while positively affecting treatment performance however direct electrochemical oxidation of organics requires large overpotentials and there is no evidence that these processes occur in ec ghernaout 2013 the causes of low faradaic efficiencies observed in fe ec remain unclear however many of the reviewed papers indicate that ec performance is heavily affected by the buildup of a passivating surface layer on the anode this phenomenon consequently increases the anodic overpotential and may change the nature of the electrochemical activity at the anode by inspecting the faradaic efficiencies reported by studies table 2 it is evident that low efficiencies are more frequently observed in fe ec than in al ec therefore sustaining efficient coagulant dosing is seemingly more attainable in al ec which is likely caused by the thermodynamic favorability of al 0 al iii oxidation eq 16 izquierdo et al 2010 also reached this conclusion i e al ec was more effective than fe ec at avoiding passivation and maintaining effective electrode dissolution under identical operating conditions consequently this indication gives al ec a distinctive advantage over fe ec in long term continuous ec operation however a systematic study of long term al ec similar to those for fe ec amrose et al 2014 bandaru et al 2020 müller et al 2019 has not been reported as mentioned in section 2 3 3 severe material precipitation on aluminum electrodes has been reported to occur during pilot scale ec applications schulz et al 2009 3 passivation mitigation strategies researchers have tested a variety of techniques to remove electrode surface layers or to avoid their formations implementing effective strategies will enable continuous coagulant dosing while keeping the cell potential low during long term ec operation the depassivation and performance enhancement strategies that have been reported are examined in the following sections 3 1 aggressive ion addition one of the most frequently recommended depassivation techniques in ec is to add an aggressive ion to the electrolyte such as cl or br arroyo et al 2009 chellam and sari 2016 dura and breslin 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 xu et al 2014 2015 as described previously the addition of an aggressive ion such as cl triggers pitting corrosion which breaks down the surface oxide layer it has been shown empirically that the pitting potential is proportional to the logarithmic ratio of the concentrations of the aggressive and inhibiting ions in the electrolyte lumsden et al 1981 refaey 2005 the linearized expression for this relationship is shown in eq 28 experiments at different electrolyte concentrations have been fitted to this model dura and breslin 2019 mouedhen et al 2008 28 e p a b log c x i where constants a and b are experimentally determined and cx and i are the concentrations of the aggressive and the inhibitor ions respectively in fe ec operation it has been suggested that 1 mm of nacl should be added for every 20 and 100 mm of no3 and hco3 in the solution respectively to mitigate passivation and ensure high faradaic efficiency fig 11 van genuchten et al 2017 in the presence of so4 2 it has been reported that maintaining a cl so4 2 ratio between 0 1 0 8 is sufficient to avoid passivation and ensure high faradaic efficiency huang et al 2009 mechelhoff et al 2013a mouedhen et al 2008 trompette and vergnes 2009 however there are several drawbacks to adding aggressive ions to the electrolyte firstly the added salts may need to be removed in subsequent treatment steps before the treated water could be re used or discharged into the environment secondly a high cl concentration increases the risk of generating hazardous byproducts especially in the presence of organics which could form organochlorinated compounds donaldson et al 2002 gotsi et al 2005 heidmann and calmano 2008 kabdaşli et al 2009 khandegar and saroha 2013 furthermore it has been shown that adding too much cl can disrupt coagulation e g dissolving al oh 3 s to alcl4 aq wang et al 2009 it was reported that adding 1 g l 1 nacl reduced the contaminant removal rate by preferential sorption of cl on the al coagulant abdel aziz et al 2020 additionally it has been shown that cl increases the aqueous stability of certain dissolved contaminants and metal oxyhydr oxides effectively inhibiting the coagulation process abdel aziz et al 2020 golder et al 2011 2007 another concern is the increased sludge production associated with adding salt to the water maha lakshmi and sivashanmugam 2013 hence aggressive ion addition should be optimized to avoid both electrode passivation and the undesirable side effects associated with excessive ion concentrations maha lakshmi and sivashanmugam 2013 table 3 provides an overview of the studies that have explored using aggressive ion addition as a depassivating strategy and shows the suggested concentrations ionic ratios that authors have recommended 3 2 alternating current using current waveforms other than dc is an easily applicable method that has been proposed to remove or inhibit the growth of electrode surface layers in ec some studies have experimented with using a sinusoidal alternating current ac which causes the electrodes to oscillate between anodic and cathodic polarity cerqueira et al 2014 ghanizadeh et al 2016 kamaraj et al 2013 karamati niaragh et al 2019 mansoorian et al 2014 vasudevan et al 2011 vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 it has been shown that ac ec is more cost effective than dc ec for various applications cerqueira et al 2014 kamaraj et al 2013 karamati niaragh et al 2019 mansoorian et al 2014 vasudevan et al 2011 vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 ac ec has also been tested with iron electrodes mansoorian et al 2014 aluminum cerqueira et al 2014 karamati niaragh et al 2019 vasudevan et al 2011 zinc vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 and magnesium electrodes kamaraj et al 2013 higher contaminant removal per unit mass of metal dissolved has been observed in ac ec possibly due to enhanced coagulant mass transfer caused by the corrosion of both electrodes karamati niaragh et al 2019 ultimately most studies have found that ac ec is comparatively more energy efficient than dc ec which is often hypothesized to be a consequence of diminished electrode passivation alkhatib et al 2020 bian et al 2019 kamaraj et al 2013 vasudevan et al 2011 vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 the mechanisms responsible for avoiding or removing passivation in ac ec have not been discussed in the literature however a proposed explanation for polarity reversal is provided in section 3 3 2 which can also be used to explain the mechanisms for ac ec many authors have provided sem images showing that electrodes post experiment display smoother surface morphologies after ac ec operation compared to after dc ec fig 12 kamaraj et al 2013 mansoorian et al 2014 vasudevan et al 2011 vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 electrodes in dc ec exhibit more crevices localized corrosion and material precipitation on the electrodes therefore pitting corrosion is likely less pronounced in ac ec primarily due to the cyclic interruption and restarting of anodic dissolution which leads to the continuous formation of new points of localized corrosion consequently this leads to more uniform consumption of the anode which could overcome the problem of non uniform electrode dissolution associated with small electrode gaps and high solution conductivities mcbeath et al 2020 it has consistently been reported that faradaic efficiencies are lower in ac ec than in dc ec alkhatib et al 2020 xu et al 2019 however ac ec has shown to offer benefits such as reduced sludge formation lower energy consumption improved mass transfer characteristics and delayed electrode passivation alkhatib et al 2020 cerqueira et al 2014 karamati niaragh et al 2019 mansoorian et al 2014 xu et al 2019 in contrast one study reported that dc ec was better than ac ec for the removal of f with both iron and aluminum electrodes ghanizadeh et al 2016 yet in total there have only been a handful of authors that have examined the effects of ac operation and more research is required to develop a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms benefits and drawbacks of this technique the operating conditions reported by authors of ac ec studies are included in table 4 below 3 3 polarity reversal 3 3 1 principles of polarity reversal electrocoagulation in contrast to using a sinusoidal current to invert electrode polarity operating with polarity reversal entails periodically switching the direction of a direct current thus resulting in a square wave fig 13 a this technique is the most commonly used passivation control strategy in ec and is often referred to as an alternating pulsed current eyvaz et al 2009 keshmirizadeh et al 2011 mao et al 2008 yang et al 2015 or as polarity reversal electrocoagulation pr ec bao et al 2020 liu et al 2018 van genuchten et al 2017 vasudevan et al 2011 some researchers have operated pr ec with intermittently terminating restarting i e pulsing the current in between polarity reversals fig 13b which was proposed to enhance the mass transfer of the coagulant to the bulk solution asaithambi et al 2016 hasani et al 2019 ren et al 2011 xin et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 pr ec is relatively easy to implement and the only additional infrastructure required is a dc time relay or manually switching the positive negative terminals the idea of reversing polarity as a method to consume both electrodes can be found in patents from the 1970s miller 1977 1978 pr ec later received attention in the 1980s scientific literature as an electrode cleaning technique grøterud and smoczynski 1986 jianqian 1988 it has since then been established as a strategy to depassivate sustain high treatment performance and to extend electrode lifetime mollah et al 2001 pr ec has been evaluated for several applications table 4 most studies have operated pr ec with current reversals taking place during operation eyvaz 2016 eyvaz et al 2009 gobbi et al 2018 keshmirizadeh et al 2011 liu et al 2018 mao et al 2008 müller et al 2019 ozyonar and karagozoglu 2015 timmes et al 2010 yang et al 2015 others have switched the electrodes in between operating cycles amrose et al 2014 bandaru et al 2020 cesar lopes geraldino et al 2016 maha lakshmi and sivashanmugam 2013 van genuchten et al 2016 3 3 2 benefits of polarity reversal electrocoagulation some authors have observed increased faradaic efficiencies in pr ec compared to in dc ec for operating with both iron and aluminum electrodes cesar lopes geraldino et al 2016 ozyonar and karagozoglu 2015 wellner et al 2018 yang et al 2015 this effect was explained by the inevitable passivation in dc ec thus triggering side reactions the authors suggested that fouling is avoided in pr ec hence sustaining effective metal dissolution additionally sem imaging and xps analysis have shown that a less pronounced electrode surface layer forms in pr ec with aluminum electrodes hasani et al 2019 mao et al 2008 it was also demonstrated that pr ec and dc ec exhibit similar removal efficiencies for current densities below 12 ma cm 2 for abating cod in brewery wastewater using aluminum electrodes eyvaz 2016 however the electrodes in dc ec started passivating when operating at 12 ma cm 2 whereas passivation was not detected in pr ec until current densities of 18 ma cm 2 it has been reported that pr ec uses 30 60 less energy than dc ec for similar contaminant removal efficiencies with aluminum electrodes hasani et al 2019 mao et al 2008 meanwhile energy consumption data reported for pr ec with iron electrodes tend to be lower than for dc ec but the difference is not as dramatic as for aluminum see table 4 apart from the alleged reduced passivation the cell potential in pr ec is lower than in dc ec because h2 g evolution is thermodynamically favorable in acidic ph therefore cathodic h2 g evolution will proceed at a lower equilibrium potential following polarity reversal due to the acidic environment at the cathode however this effect will diminish once the ph at the cathode interface equilibrates due to the electrochemical dissolution of all electrodes in pr ec metal ions are added more uniformly which increases mixing and induces a higher degree of contaminant coagulant interactions consequently the coagulation process becomes more efficient which permits decreasing the charge loading rate hence reducing sludge production hasani et al 2019 keshmirizadeh et al 2011 it has also been suggested that pr ec mitigates the effect of concentration polarization in al ec i e enhancing the mass transfer of al3 and al oh 4 that otherwise tend to concentrate at the anode and cathode respectively during dc ec operation pi et al 2011 2008 consequently the speciation of al hydroxide polymers was improved in pr ec which is conducive to more efficient contaminant removal per unit coagulant produced it was also observed that the coagulant formed in pr ec had a larger surface area than the coagulant formed in dc ec when operating with iron electrodes zhou et al 2020 similar to ac ec pr ec could mitigate the problem of non uniform anodic dissolution which causes pre mature structural failure of the electrodes mcbeath et al 2020 another benefit of pr ec is that two electrode materials could be used to produce two types of coagulants keshmirizadeh et al 2011 for example this permits using iron and aluminum electrodes together which could be beneficial for the treatment of certain types of wastes for instance it has been shown that fe ec is more effective at removing sulfides while al ec is better at abating silica in produced water from in situ bitumen extraction chow and pham 2019 the mechanism for how passivation is avoided or removed when operating ac ec or pr ec is not clearly understood a possible explanation could be scouring by the formation of h2 g bubbles on the cathode bian et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 which mechanically remove the surface layer from the anode following polarity reversal also calcium and magnesium minerals formed on the cathode can dissolve in the acidic boundary layer after the cathode becomes the anode by changing electrode polarity electrostatically adsorbed particles on the surface are repulsed which also contributes to depassivation the surface layer could also be weakened by the dissolution of the underlying metal causing it to fracture bian et al 2019 understanding these mechanisms requires further investigation 3 3 3 effect of polarity reversal frequency the polarity reversal time prt i e the time in between current reversals has been reported to affect ec performance eyvaz et al 2009 grøterud and smoczynski 1986 timmes et al 2010 yang et al 2015 for example short prts have shown to reduce treatment performance yang et al 2015 meanwhile the nature of passivation becomes analogous to dc ec when operating with longer prts these observations indicate that this variable can be optimized but prts recommended in the literature differ table 4 which suggests that the optimal prt is dependent on operating conditions such as electrolyte composition current density and electrode material for example it was concluded that a 5 min prt was optimal for the treatment of organic dyes disperse yellow 241 and reactive yellow 135 in al ec eyvaz et al 2009 meanwhile a 4 min prt was recommended for removing phosphates al fe ec keshmirizadeh et al 2011 smoczyński et al 2017 a 15 s prt for removing methyl orange dye al ec pi et al 2014 1 min for f al ec betancor abreu et al 2019 15 min for al ec operation chen 2004 and 2 5 min for general ec operation eyvaz 2016 additionally a 10 s prt has been used with aluminum electrodes to remove oil perfluorooctanoic acids pfoas and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas although the results were not compared to dc ec or other reversal frequencies bao et al 2020 gobbi et al 2018 liu et al 2018 it has been observed that faradaic efficiencies vary based on prt duration particularly in fe ec for example it was reported that the faradaic efficiency increased from 45 to 70 when increasing the prt from 10 to 590 s which consequently enhanced cr vi removal in fe ec yang et al 2015 low faradaic efficiencies associated with short prts in fe ec have also been reported by others ashraf et al 2019 fekete et al 2016 grøterud and smoczynski 1986 timmes et al 2010 as mentioned previously the bulk solution ph typically increases gradually during dc ec operation however it was observed that the ph increase is not as pronounced in pr ec with short prts compared to longer prts or dc ec grøterud and smoczynski 1986 this phenomenon has been seen for other systems for example it took considerable time for the ph to regain its equilibrium value after reversing polarity with aluminum electrodes in a continuous flow system wellner et al 2018 low faradaic efficiencies with short prts are consistent with findings from studies of ac ec which are equivalent to pr ec with very short prts i e high frequency reversal cerqueira et al 2014 karamati niaragh et al 2019 in contrast the removal of estrogen was reported to increase with shorter prts when using iron electrodes maher et al 2019 the authors concluded that this was a consequence of avoiding electrode passivation however an alternative explanation is that an elevated rate of direct anodic oxidation caused the improved removal rates rather than enhanced coagulation in the electrolyte by using pr ec direct oxidation takes place at both electrodes and the rate of mass transfer of pollutants could be improved enhanced mass transfer and electrode utilization have been observed when applying polarity reversal in the electro oxidation process thostenson et al 2018 longer prts have also been tested for the treatment of groundwater by fe ec müller et al 2019 in this study the faradaic efficiency was lower for a prt of 21 min than observed for switching polarity between every operating batch 105 min which in turn had a lower faradaic efficiency than dc ec it was also found that the anodic interfacial potential was lower in pr ec than in dc ec experiments indicating that passivation was depressed in contrast cesar lopes geraldino et al 2016 demonstrated that electrode consumption was higher over 24 cycles relative to dc ec when reversing polarity in between batches 60 min in fe ec for treating dairy plant effluent the authors concluded that passivation led to reduced coagulant production in dc ec which is plausible due to the high organic content of the wastewater the differences between the findings of these studies highlight the complex nature of pr ec and the effect of electrolyte composition on faradaic efficiency and treatment performance due to the problem of passivation in ec and the widespread belief that pr ec may address this issue it is essential to consider the connection between performance passivation and prt 3 3 4 mechanisms of passivation mitigation in polarity reversal ec discussion few studies have attempted to provide mechanistic explanations for the association between prt and pr ec performance as discussed in section 2 4 the buildup of the electrode surface layer likely contributes to a decrease in faradaic efficiency by hindering coagulant mass transfer to the bulk solution bandaru et al 2020 müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2016 it has been suggested that this effect is accelerated in pr ec which is supported by thicker electrode surface layers observed on iron electrodes in pr ec relative to dc ec ashraf et al 2019 müller et al 2019 an enhanced trapping capacity of iron species by a caco3 surface layer that forms on the cathode before it becomes the anode was proposed as the causation of this phenomenon müller et al 2019 another possible explanation for the relatively thicker surface layers in pr ec could be the occurrence of changing ph boundary layers at the electrode interfaces for example fe ii iii present in the acidic anodic boundary layer can form fe oxyhydr oxides in the alkaline conditions that develop following polarity reversal fig 5 these species sorb to the electrode surface and contribute to the surface layer buildup which impedes fe ii iii mass transport to the bulk solution furthermore allowing for the ph boundary layers to re establish after polarity reversal requires a particular duration which depends on operating conditions such as current density and electrolyte buffering capacity also the slow dissolution kinetics of calcium and magnesium minerals in the anodic acidic boundary layer adds additional time to achieve effective depassivation consequently applying longer prts favor the completion of these mechanisms it has also been acknowledged that the polarization time i e the time it takes for the electrochemical reactions to restart following polarity reversal is detrimental to ec performance grøterud and smoczynski 1986 non faradaic charging discharging of the capacitive electrochemical double layer hasani et al 2019 and faradaic side reactions could occur during this time therefore the expected anodic and cathodic reactions eqs 1 2 are presumably inactivated during this period bian et al 2019 this proposition is corroborated by relatively lower ph and faradaic efficiencies observed in pr ec compared to in dc ec fekete et al 2016 grøterud and smoczynski 1986 by approximating the duration of charging the capacitive double layer in ec assuming 1 cm electrode separation and c 0 2 f m 2 conway 2018 periods within the range 2 100 ms are obtained based on electrolyte conductivities 1 20 ms cm 2 where higher conductivity corresponds to faster charging most pr ec applications operate within these electrolyte characteristics izquierdo et al 2010 shamaei et al 2018 yildiz et al 2008 and must therefore account for capacitive charging during polarity reversal cycling this effect may explain why no net current was observed when operating pr ec at 60 hz 17 ms prt bian et al 2019 additionally ac ec is often operated at 50 hz 20 ms prt therefore this strategy may become ineffective when treating low conductivity waste this phenomenon may explain why ghanizadeh et al 2016 concluded that ac ec was ineffective at removing f using iron and aluminum electrodes from synthetic solutions with low electrolyte concentrations it is also possible to prompt electrochemical side reactions following polarity reversal especially in fe ec fe oxyhydr oxides are either comprised of fe ii fe iii or a combination of both as described in section 2 3 1 these species can be oxidized or reduced given the right environmental conditions for example it is possible that hfeo2 formed during a cathodic cycle in high ph is oxidized to feo2 during the subsequent anodic period according to eq 29 bard et al 1985 which is thermodynamically favorable over fe 0 fe ii oxidation eq 9 fe oh 2 formed at the cathode can also oxidize to fe3o4 in the alkaline environment immediately following polarity reversal fig 5 additionally fe iii and fe ii iii oxyhydr oxides formed in the anode vicinity can reduce to fe ii and feo in a cathodic environment eqs 30 34 which is thermodynamically favorable over h2 g evolution e 0 v vs she at ph 0 gorski et al 2016 xu et al 2019 29 hfeo 2 o h feo 2 h 2 o e e o 0 685 v vs she 30 f e 3 e f e 2 e o 0 771 v vs she 31 fe oh 3 e f e 2 3 o h 32 f e 3 o 4 2 h 2 e 3 feo h 2 o 33 α feooh e 3 h f e 2 2 h 2 o e o 0 768 v vs she 34 α f e 2 o 3 2 e 6 h 2 f e 2 3 h 2 o e o 0 769 v vs she as discussed in section 2 4 it is also possible to reduce fe ii fe 0 at moderate cathodic overpotentials fig 5 for example this phenomenon has been utilized to make batteries that electroplate fe ii fe 0 during charging at the cathode followed by oxidation back to fe ii during discharge hruska and savinell 1981 this effect could also take place in ec where anodically dissolved fe ii iii species could be reduced back to fe 0 following polarity reversal xu et al 2019 electroplated fe 0 could then be re oxidized during the subsequent reversal cycle therefore over the entirety of the operating period less metal is transferred from the electrode to the bulk solution for example it has been demonstrated using cyclic voltammetry that fe ii iii oxyhydr oxides are reduced oxidized at the iron electrode following anodic or cathodic current shifts yang et al 2015 however the authors did not consider how this would affect faradaic efficiencies in pr ec additionally h2 g bubbles sorbed to the electrode surface could be re oxidized to h2o upon polarity reversal which is also thermodynamically favorable over fe 0 fe ii oxidation however it remains unclear if kinetics allow this reaction to proceed to a significant extent interestingly it has been shown that terminating the current for 6 s in between each reversal with iron electrodes decreases the buildup of the electrode surface layer by allowing anodically dissolved metal to transfer to the bulk solution xin et al 2018 consequently less iron metal is available to precipitate on the anode when it becomes the cathode in al ec the electrochemical properties governing al 0 al iii dissolution are different than those in fe ec in particular al iii cannot be electroplated following polarity reversal due to its very low reduction potential compared to the hydrolysis of water 1 66 v vs 0 83 v vs she at ph 14 the likelihood of side reactions induced by polarity reversal is smaller or nonexistent because aluminum does not exhibit the same reactivity as iron within the electrochemical stability range of water roberge 2008 in contrast due to the anodic activation of both electrodes the protective al2o3 surface layer can be removed and expose more al 0 to chemical corrosion that increases coagulant production for example it has been observed that the consumption of aluminum electrodes in pr ec is greater than in dc ec pi et al 2014 wellner et al 2018 however similar to iron higher al 0 dissolution rates have been observed with longer prts relative to shorter prts fig 14 fekete et al 2016 hasani et al 2019 an explanation for this could be that longer prts allow the ph boundary layers at the electrodes to equilibrate which accelerates chemical corrosion after the electrode surface layers have been removed in contrast there is not sufficient time to reach the required ph to corrode aluminum when operating with shorter prts fig 9 capacitive charging may also affect al ec performance at prts 1 s a group of soviet researchers in the 1980s took an alternative approach i e switching polarity for 5 10 s every 5 6 hrs when operating with an aluminum anode and a titanium cathode nikolaev et al 1982 the purpose of this short period of polarity inversion was to remove the calcium and magnesium precipitates at the cathode whereas it was claimed that polarity reversal was not effective at removing the metal oxide layer at the anode a built in automated scraper was used to remove the anodic surface layer mechanically by applying this technique it was reported that the current density increased by 6 10 times when operating potentiostatically during long term treatment at a municipal water supply plant pr ec is seemingly effective at removing delaying or avoiding the formation of electrode surface layers which in turn enhances treatment performance this outcome has been particularly evident in al ec whereas mixed results have been reported for fe ec therefore it is apparent that prts associated with long term treatment must be optimized to avoid the adverse effects related high frequency polarity reversal which has been acknowledged before van genuchten et al 2016 furthermore when pr ec has been used in field operations polarity is reversed in between each batch amrose et al 2014 however it is possible that this is still too frequent to avoid the detrimental effects of re polarizing the electrodes if pr ec is more effective at mitigating fouling and passivation in al ec than in fe ec it could change the cost benefit analysis of ec treatment for some applications however as mentioned in sections 2 3 3 and 2 4 it has been reported that material precipitation on the electrodes can be more significant and create operational problems for al ec compared to fe ec for operating dc ec on the pilot scale which may have limited the industrial application of al ec schulz et al 2009 of course the electrode selection will also depend on the solution composition for example for removing some contaminants such as cr vi fe ec is more suitable mouedhen et al 2009 3 4 ultrasonication it has been reported that coupling ultrasonication with ec referred to as sono ec can be an effective depassivation strategy he et al 2016 while improving coagulant formation and enhancing ec performance kovatcheva and parlapanski 1999 raschitor et al 2014 sonolysis can also produce radicals eq 35 which mineralize organics while achieving disinfection wang et al 2009 in sonolysis the ultrasound forms microscopic bubbles referred to as cavities that collapse once a critical radius is attained de lima leite et al 2003 this phenomenon generates points of high temperatures and pressures which is conducive to the formation of radicals 35 h 2 o sonolysis h ho ultrasound also dislodges h2 g bubbles sorbed to the electrodes that reduce conductivity and increase the current density kovatcheva and parlapanski 1999 as discussed in section 3 3 4 the presence of hydrogen on the electrodes may also trigger side reactions in pr ec additionally sono ec can enhance the formation of cracks and defects in the electrode kovatcheva and parlapanski 1999 which can accelerate the rate of chemical corrosion by exposing more electrode surface area this effect could be particularly beneficial in al ec continuous and intermittent sonication have both shown to be effective at impeding the onset of electrode passivation which was confirmed using eis he et al 2016 however even though continuous sonication was more effective coagulant formation was inhibited which resulted in decreased contaminant removal efficiencies therefore intermittent sonication proved to be favorable by accomplishing effective depassivation while avoiding the destruction of flocs adverse effects on ec performance associated with excessive sonication have been seen elsewhere he et al 2018 in this study the authors recommended operating at a lower sonication power to mitigate floc destruction another study demonstrated that removing cod from oil tanning waste using continuous sono ec was not economically sustainable reporting a total energy consumption of 435 kwh m 3 maha lakshmi and sivashanmugam 2013 however it was concluded that sono ec was an effective depassivating strategy therefore it was suggested that sonication could be used when re starting a reactor with passivated electrodes an overview of the studies that have investigated sono ec is provided in table 5 even though sono ec has proven to mitigate passivation successfully while enhancing treatment performance installing the required infrastructure and accounting for the ensuing operating costs do not make sono ec an attractive strategy 3 5 other passivation mitigation strategies other strategies that have been proposed for avoiding passivation fouling and enhancing ec performance include mechanically cleaning the electrodes bandaru et al 2020 lakshmanan et al 2009 van genuchten et al 2016 increasing the flow velocity to enhance hydrodynamic scouring chen 2004 ghanizadeh et al 2016 timmes et al 2010 and chemically cleaning the electrodes with organic acids müller et al 2019 additionally temporally varying the magnitude of a static voltage with 30 min intervals has shown to decrease energy consumption by 48 in continuous al ec and fe ec operations genc and bakirci 2015 also pulsing a direct current i e intermittently terminating restarting the current without reversing electrode polarity has been demonstrated to reduce energy consumption and sludge production by 89 and 30 respectively relative to dc ec zhou et al 2020 this effect was attributed to the pulsed current inhibiting the formation a passivating surface layer using a steel brush to mechanically clean iron electrodes once a week during long term operation reduced energy consumption by approximately 33 while enhancing the efficiency of arsenic removal amrose et al 2014 many have suggested that this is the most effective depassivation strategy bandaru et al 2020 lakshmanan et al 2009 müller et al 2019 however this method requires terminating the treatment process and disassembling the ec cell which adds labor costs in situ mechanical cleaning may be a viable solution i e installing scrapers that remove the anodic surface layer which has been shown to work with a radial electrode configuration nikolaev et al 1982 it has also been shown that increasing the charge loading rate i e the current density inhibits the buildup of the electrode surface layer over long term fe ec operation müller et al 2019 it was proposed that this effect was caused by the rapid depletion of dissolved oxygen in the anodic boundary layer by an abundance of electrochemically generated fe ii consequently fe ii fe iii oxidation was depressed which decreased the precipitation of insulating fe iii oxyhydr oxides on the anode surface operating at high current densities also increases the positive charge of the anode eq 12 which intensifies the repulsive effect between the cationic fe ii iii ions and the anode alkhatib et al 2020 however an excessively high supporting electrolyte concentration will diminish the magnitude of coagulant mass transfer by electrophoretic migration care should also be taken when increasing the current density due to the possibility of attracting oxyanions to the anode surface causing passivation and triggering side reactions hu et al 2003 huang et al 2009 izquierdo et al 2010 müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 some researchers have tried operating with a horizontal electrode configuration where the cathode is placed at the bottom which allowed h2 g to percolate through the solution abdel aziz et al 2020 it was claimed that this reactor design enhanced mass transfer and decreased anodic passivation furthermore using an oscillating anode has been shown to reduce the cell voltage in fe ec and al ec panikulam et al 2018 which was attributed to improved mass transport of metal oxyhydr oxides from the anode consequently this technique may inhibit material precipitation on the anode a self assembled electrode consisting of magnetic iron particles on a non magnetic substrate has been described in a patent as an effective de fouling method xia et al 2013 however quantitative evidence for the performance of this method has not been presented in the research literature lastly changing the storage conditions of the electrodes in between operating cycles has been investigated by some authors müller et al 2019 wellner et al 2018 it was found that storing iron electrodes in synthetic groundwater in between cycles had a detrimental effect on faradaic efficiency and ec performance once the reactor was restarted due to the formation of a passivating and coagulant trapping surface layer müller et al 2019 others found that storing aluminum electrodes in a salt solution 1 g l 1 nacl minimized the formation of a passivating surface layer and increased treatment performance upon re starting the reactor wellner et al 2018 4 conclusions the different strategies that have been proposed to decrease avoid passivation and to enhance long term ec performance include aggressive ion addition alternating current operation polarity reversal operation ultrasonication mechanical cleaning of electrodes chemical cleaning of electrodes hydrodynamic scouring all these strategies have been shown to be successful at mitigating passivation under suitable conditions however each method has drawbacks that need to be considered for example excessive aggressive ion concentrations may generate hazardous byproducts and increase sludge production while implementing some form of alternating electrode polarity is the most commonly used passivation control strategy studies have shown that there are also drawbacks to this technique for example ac ec or high frequency pr ec with iron electrodes may accelerate electrode fouling while triggering side reactions that divert the current and depress faradaic efficiency pr ec with aluminum electrodes may mitigate severe passivation that can occur in some systems which could make al ec a more attractive option than fe ec for continuous long term operation depending on operating conditions it is also more suitable to operate pr ec with aluminum electrodes because this system is not prone to reversible electrochemical reactions which likely reduce the faradaic efficiency in fe ec however care should be taken to avoid residual aluminum due to its toxicity singh et al 2017 ultrasonication is effective but likely too costly for the conditions investigated to date however this strategy could potentially be used as an in situ electrode cleaning technique in between treatment cycles mechanical cleaning is seemingly the most effective strategy at decreasing passivation and enhancing ec operation however this strategy increases labor costs and requires shutting down treatment therefore it should be avoided as much as possible in situ cleaning using automated electrode scraping mechanisms merits further investigation a compilation of the advantages and disadvantages of each method is provided in table 6 based on the findings in this study the most promising passivation control strategies are aggressive ion addition pr ec and mechanical cleaning of the electrodes ec developers and operators should incorporate a combination of these strategies in their process designs however parameters such as the concentration of aggressive ions and prt should be optimized based on specific operating conditions failing to optimize a strategy could lead to decreased treatment performance or operational challenges therefore the processes passivation mechanisms and depassivation strategies discussed in this article should be considered when assigning operating parameters in the design of ec systems the selection of electrode material should also be carefully considered because passivation characteristics can vary significantly depending on the application it is also clear that the nature and mechanisms of depassivation by aggressive ion addition and polarity reversal are sensitive to the water composition and are not well understood further studies of the mechanisms of passivation and depassivation as a function of water composition and operating conditions are needed to provide deeper insight into these processes lastly studies investigating the effectiveness of implementing depassivation strategies during long term continuous ec operation are needed more research is also required to further understand the relationship between ec performance solution composition and operating conditions funding this research was funded by the natural science and engineering research council of canada

17469,treating water and wastewater is energy intensive and traditional methods that require large amounts of chemicals are often still used electrocoagulation ec an electrochemical treatment technology has been proposed as a more economically and environmentally sustainable alternative in ec sacrificial metal electrodes are used to produce coagulant in situ which offers many benefits over conventional chemical coagulation however material precipitation on the electrodes during long term operation induces a passivating effect that decreases treatment performance and increases power requirements overcoming this problem is considered to be the greatest challenge facing the development of ec in this critical review the studies that have examined the nature of electrode passivation and its effect on treatment performance are considered a fundamental approach is used to examine the association between passivation and faradaic efficiency a surrogate for ec performance in addition the strategies that have been proposed to remove or avoid passivation are reviewed including aggressive ion addition ac current operation polarity reversal ultrasonication and mechanical cleaning of the electrodes it is concluded that the success of implementing each method is dependent on critical operating parameters and careful consideration should be taken when designing an ec system based on the phenomena discussed in this article in conclusion this review provides insight into passivation mechanisms delivers guidelines for sustaining high treatment performance and offers an outlook for

wastewater treatment technology that produces metal coagulant in situ by electrochemically dissolving sacrificial electrodes that are submerged in contaminated water this is achieved by applying a current to the electrodes from an external power source vik et al 1984 the positively polarized anode commonly made of steel fe ec or aluminum al ec is electrochemically dissolved eq 1 yasri and gunaskearan 2017 at the same time h2o is electrolyzed at the negatively charged cathode to produce oh and h2 g eq 2 mansoorian et al 2014 following anodic dissolution metal cations hydrolyze to form oxy hydr oxides and h3o ions symbolized as h in this article that cause the ph to drop eq 3 lakshmanan et al 2009 the acidic and alkaline environments at the electrodes create distinctive layers that have shown to be up to 0 5 mm thick using confocal imaging fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 subsequently h diffuses to the electrolyte where it is neutralized by oh transported from the cathode yasri et al 2020 the cationic character of the metal oxyhydr oxides neutralizes the negative surface charge of colloidal contaminants which causes them to destabilize and form larger aggregates together with the metal oxy hydroxides that can be separated by filtration flotation or sedimentation garcia segura et al 2017 1 m s m z aq z e 2 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h aq h 2 g 3 m z aq z h 2 o m oh z s z h aq where m represents the metal of which the electrode is made of and z is the charge transfer number an illustration of the ec process is shown in fig 1 the amount of electrochemically produced coagulant in ec can be predicted by faraday s law of electrolysis eq 4 and is proportional to the amount of charge passed through the cell yasri and gunaskearan 2017 the majority of ec experiments reported in the literature are operated galvanostatically i e at constant current to ensure effective addition of the coagulant the faradaic efficiency is often reported when evaluating ec performance which is the ratio of experimentally observed coagulant mass over the theoretical mass predicted by faraday s law eq 5 the faradaic efficiency is determined by measuring the amount of metal released over the duration of the experiment this is generally performed by dissolving all flocs in acid followed by analysis using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes chow and pham 2019 dubrawski et al 2015 a calculated faradaic efficiency of 100 is desirable since it is indicative of effective current utilization 4 theoretical amount of coagulant metal dissolved i t m z f

time s and m is the molar mass of the metal g mol 1 ec is often compared to chemical coagulation cc where metal ions are added to contaminated water as salts such as aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride however it has been shown that ec is more cost effective than cc per unit water treated for many different applications because of some significant advantages that ec exhibits garcia segura et al 2017 price et al 2018 timmes et al 2010 vik et al 1984 for example the cationic coagulant in ec is produced in situ without adding unnecessary counter ions that contribute to sludge production ölmez 2009 meanwhile counter ions in cc remaining in the dissolved phase must be removed in subsequent treatment steps depending on discharge limits mamelkina et al 2017 in addition neutralizing chemicals must be added in cc to mitigate the ph drop caused by the hydrolysis of the metal salts eq 3 this is achieved by using a neutralizing chemical such as lime ca2 oh 2 garcia segura et al 2017 the cathodic reaction in ec produces h2 g and oh providing an in situ ph neutralizing mechanism wang et al 2009 furthermore the uniform metal dissolution of the electrodes as opposed to point addition in cc reduces the need for intense mechanical mixing which lowers energy demands while making the coagulation process more efficient uniform metal ion addition in ec also permits lower coagulant dosing which further curtails sludge production additionally the prospect of harnessing the h2 g produced at the cathode makes ec a viable energy storage technology phalakornkule et al 2010 lastly using commonplace materials such as iron and aluminum for local electrode manufacturing allows remote communities to sustain treatment without relying on resupplying chemicals thus eliminating transportation costs that are burdensome to areas such as northern canada ragush et al 2015 tartakovsky et al 2018 however problems with long term ec operation persist for example the precipitation of solids on the electrodes over time and its ensuing passivating effect increases operating costs and lowers treatment efficiency bandaru et al 2020 garcia segura et al 2017 müller et al 2019 furthermore storing the electrodes between treatment cycles and removing the initial passivating surface layer during reactor startup has shown to be problematic van genuchten et al 2016 additionally non uniform electrode consumption can compromise the structural integrity of the electrodes which requires them to be prematurely exchanged bandaru et al 2020 wellner et al 2018 it is widely recognized that overcoming these challenges is imperative to the development of ec bian et al 2019 kabdaşlı et al 2012 in this article the existing body of scientific literature related to the nature of electrode passivation in ec is reviewed a fundamental approach is used to study the electrochemical and chemical mechanisms governing coagulant production and electrode passivation while also examining different strategies that have been proposed to mitigate the detrimental effects of passivation some of these strategies include increasing the flowrate to enhance hydrodynamic scouring karamati niaragh et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 adding depassivating salts to the water van genuchten et al 2016 mechanically cleaning the electrodes sahu et al 2014 ultra sonication maha lakshmi and sivashanmugam 2013 or changing the current waveform eyvaz et al 2009 karamati niaragh et al 2019 pi et al 2014 sahu et al 2014 timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2017 2016 yet 2011 each method is evaluated and suggestions for future research are provided to date published reviews of ec have focused on general operation or on the abatement of a specific pollutant chen 2004 emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 garcia segura et al 2017 kabdaşlı et al 2012 mollah et al 2001 2004a moussa et al 2017 sahu et al 2014 yasri et al 2020 while these reviews are useful pollutant removal is dependent on both coagulant dosing in the ec reactor and the subsequent separation process overall this involves many controllable variables which makes it difficult to distinguish between the sensitivity of different operating parameters as concluded by timmes et al 2010 ec should be regarded as a two step process i e coagulant dosing followed by flocculation and separation therefore the scope of this article is to focus on the coagulant dosing component while disregarding floc separation 2 electrode surface layers passivation and ec performance 2 1 principles of electrode surface layer formation and passivation passivation is a concept emanating from corrosion science which describes the formation of a protective film on a metal surface usually comprised of metal oxides the passivation layer impedes the kinetics of otherwise thermodynamically favorable metal oxidation which increases the resistance at the electrode electrolyte interface schmuki 2002 in the ec literature this is commonly referred to as a surface layer film müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2016 the terms passive layer and surface layer are often used interchangeably however a surface layer does not have to be passivating i e it could also be conductive bandaru et al 2020 schmuki 2002 furthermore the surface layer formation process has also been referred to as electrode fouling schulz et al 2009 yasri et al 2020 to sustain effective electrochemical dissolution of the anode the applied cell potential u must overcome several resistances within the cell eq 6 these energy barriers are expressed as a series of overpotentials η which are encountered at the electrode electrolyte interfaces namely the activation concentration and passivation overpotentials chen et al 2002 the activation overpotential is associated with the kinetic energy barrier that the electron exchange process exhibits whereas the passivation overpotential pertains to the energy required for dissolved metal to penetrate the passivating surface layer which increases the polarization resistance due to the availability of metal in the anode the concentration overpotential there is negligible 6 u e η a n a η a n c η a n p η c t a η c t c η c t p d k i where e is the thermodynamic equilibrium potential for the electrochemical cell and ηan a ηan c and ηan p are the anodic activation concentration and passivation overpotentials respectively likewise ηct a ηct c and ηct p are the equivalent overpotentials at the cathode furthermore d is the distance between the electrodes k is the electrolyte conductivity and i is the current density fig 2 illustrates the distribution of the cell potential and breaks down the components outlined in eq 6 within the ec reactor the equilibrium potential depicted at the anode is relative to the potential of the cathode as an anodic surface layer is formed metal dissolution is impeded which raises the passivation overpotential and increases the energy consumption in ec holt et al 2005 2002 mechelhoff et al 2013a van genuchten et al 2016 xu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 extreme passivation may lead to electrochemical side reactions that decrease coagulant production during galvanostatic operation or cause a complete termination of the passage of current during potentiostatic constant voltage operation huang et al 2009 for example anodic o2 g or cl2 g evolution eqs 7 8 have been proposed as unwanted side reactions that occur when the total anodic overpotential is sufficiently high during galvanostatic operation dubrawski et al 2015 7 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e e o 1 23 v vs she 8 2 c l c l 2 2 e e o 1 36 v vs she the formation of the electrode surface layer is dependent on specific ec operating conditions such as electrolyte conductivity composition electrode material dissolved oxygen do current density and polarization cycles van genuchten et al 2017 2016 during ec operation it is generally desirable to maintain a high electrolyte conductivity and a low inter electrode distance to reduce ohmic losses potential drop in the solution which reduces the cell potential eq 6 mollah et al 2001 however small inter electrode gaps and high electrolyte conductivities increase the variations in the current density distribution over the electrode geometry which causes uneven wear of the anode and is problematic to long term operation mcbeath et al 2020 the electrode surface layer can be a mono layer of absorbed molecules or consist of multiple layers schmuki 2002 for example a porous surface layer will be less passivating than a non porous layer due to its enhanced charge carrying properties several fouling mechanisms are possible and may include the precipitation of dissolved species adsorption of colloidal suspended particles or solid phase transformations at the anode surface pally et al 2020 the formation of a metal oxide layer through anodization to prevent further corrosion is an established phenomenon for aluminum zinc magnesium and several other metals roberge 2008 for example metal oxide coated anodes are utilized for some electrochemical applications e g anodic electro oxidation for wastewater disinfection wu et al 2014 at the anode interface the low ph environment inhibits the buildup of a surface layer which works as a passivation prevention mechanism however metal oxides can precipitate on the anode over time if their solubility limits are exceeded chen et al 2002 similarly ca2 and mg2 in the electrolyte can precipitate as minerals and form a passivating surface layer in the high ph environment at the cathode doggaz et al 2019 sahu et al 2014 additionally cations could be transported and sorbed to the negatively polarized cathode by electrophoretic migration and electrostatic interactions sahu et al 2014 xu et al 2017 otherwise referred to as electro condensation hu et al 2003 likewise anions could migrate towards and bind to the positively polarized anode this effect could explain why electrode surface layers have been observed to be thicker at higher current densities dubrawski et al 2015 mansouri et al 2011 müller et al 2019 although the effect of electrophoretic migration is diminished at high supporting electrolyte concentrations mechelhoff 2008 alternatively electrochemically produced metal cations could precipitate with oxyanions and adsorb to the electrode surface for example a passivating alpo4 surface layer has been observed on electrodes in phosphate electrolytes in al ec mansouri et al 2011 similarly feso4 can form a passivating surface layer in the presence of so4 2 in fe ec gerónimo lópez et al 2014 the probability of exceeding the solubility limits of metal salts at the anode interface is greater while operating at higher current densities because of the increased concentration of metal ions the exact mechanisms for how co existing ions contribute to passivation in ec is not clear but an illustration of the possible mechanisms is provided in fig 3 in batch experiments it is often seen that the bulk solution ph shifts towards higher values over time especially at higher current densities due to oh production outcompeting metal hydrolysis i e h generation which has more sluggish reaction kinetics garcia segura et al 2017 lakshmanan et al 2009 for example the ph equilibrated around 8 9 in al ec after 60 80 min of galvanostatic operation which was independent of the initial ph mansouri et al 2011 additionally when buffering agents are present i e salts of weak acids such as phosphates pka1 2 1 pka2 7 2 pka1 12 4 and carbonates pka1 3 6 pka2 6 3 pka3 10 3 h protons produced through hydrolysis at the anode are quenched consequently the acidic ph boundary layer is thinner in buffered solutions than in unbuffered systems which increases the likelihood of metal oxyhydr oxides precipitating at the anode lumsden et al 1981 refaey 2005 however it has been shown that adding salts containing nh4 pka 9 3 which is amphoteric enhances ec performance in al ec by avoiding an excessive increase in bulk solution ph izquierdo et al 2010 trompette and vergnes 2009 it has also been shown that the shift towards alkaline ph is less pronounced in al ec than in fe ec due to the buffering effect of aluminum monomeric species that form in the bulk solution al oh 2 al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 al oh 4 and polymeric species such as al6 oh 15 3 al7 oh 17 4 al8 oh 20 4 al13o4 oh 24 7 daneshvar et al 2007 fayad et al 2017 kobya et al 2006 ultimately the presence of buffering agents in the electrolyte can either be beneficial or detrimental to avoiding passivation depending on the solution composition 2 2 potentiodynamic polarization methods to study passivation the nature of electrode passivation can be characterized by polarization studies dura and breslin 2019 schmuki 2002 potentiodynamic polarization methods are often used in corrosion studies lee and pyun 2000 pyun et al 1999 however some studies have adopted this methodology to investigate the characteristics of electrochemical dissolution in ec hu et al 2003 mansouri et al 2011 panikulam et al 2018 data from these experiments are usually presented as tafel plots fig 4 the minimum in current density determines the equilibrium potential e also referred to as the corrosion potential esmailzadeh et al 2018 at this potential the kinetic rates of reduction oxidation are equal and the net current approaches zero the current density plateau in the anodic potential region adjacent to the corrosion potential is the passivation range here the presence of a passivating surface layer impedes the dissolution of the electrode even though electrochemical oxidation becomes more thermodynamically favorable with increasing anodic potentials however the current dramatically increases at a certain potential indicating the start of the active dissolution range also referred to as pitting corrosion zhang and ma 2019 the width of this range corresponds to the passivation overpotential and an increase in the passivation range is indicative of a higher polarization resistance at the electrode electrolyte interface pitting is initiated by ions breaking down the electrode surface layer or by the dissolution of the surface film when the electrode boundary layer becomes sufficiently acidic due to metal hydrolysis lumsden et al 1981 aggressive ions such as cl enhance pitting corrosion due to the ionic mobility that allows them to penetrate the electrode surface oxide film consequently cl reacts with the metal oxides which dissolves the surface layer and exposes the underlying raw metal golder et al 2007 it has also been proposed that clo formed at the anode following cl cl2 oxidation destroys the passivating surface layer zhou et al 2020 in the presence of cl the corrosion and pitting potentials shift towards more negative potentials while decreasing the width of the passivation range mansouri et al 2011 it is well established that the electrode corrosion characteristics are dependent on the nature of the supporting electrolyte hu et al 2003 mansouri et al 2011 by changing operating conditions such as the electrolyte composition ph or electrode material the corrosion and pitting potentials shift higher corrosion pitting potentials are indicative of increased passivation i e a greater voltage must be applied to initiate metal dissolution additionally based on operating conditions the current densities within a potential window vary for example current densities within the scanned potential window were higher in fe ec than in al ec in a synthetic kaolin solution indicating faster corrosion kinetics panikulam et al 2018 comparatively lower current densities in the active dissolution range are also indicative of greater polarization resistance and electrode passivation hu et al 2003 reported greater polarization resistance with aluminum electrodes when scanning from low to high potentials 1 5 v to 3 0 v vs sce in the presence of only f compared to when cl no3 and so4 were present in the electrolyte it was hypothesized that enhanced electrophoretic migration and adsorption of f to the anode caused this effect in contrast no passive region was observed under similar experimental conditions but without f in the electrolyte mansouri et al 2011 corrosion characteristics are also affected by the ph at the electrode electrolyte interface for example by increasing the initial ph from 2 to 11 in a nacl electrolyte 0 1 m it was observed that the corrosion potential shifted towards more negative potentials when scanning from 1 5 v to 3 0 v vs sce in al ec mansouri et al 2011 in the same study mansouri et al observed that the pitting potential was independent of ph which corresponded to the increased width of the passivation range as the ph was increased a similar observation was also made by el ghenymy et al 2020 with titanium electrodes both studies attributed the changes in the corrosion characteristics to a more favorable dissolution of the electrode in alkaline ph however a shift towards more negative corrosion potentials when scanning from cathodic to anodic currents is also caused by the cathodic electrolysis of h2o being more thermodynamically favorable in lower ph roberge 2008 this effect explains why the corrosion potentials were relatively high at ph 2 even though aluminum dissolution was favorable under these conditions see section 2 3 2 the corrosion parameters reported from potentiodynamic polarization studies in ec are presented in table 1 2 3 passivation of different electrode materials the mechanism and rate of electrode passivation and corrosion vary depending on the electrode materials that are used ec is traditionally operated with either steel or aluminum electrodes other metals such as zinc liu et al 2018 vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 magnesium kamaraj et al 2013 and titanium ti el ghenymy et al 2020 have also been shown to abate aqueous contaminants effectively using ec but they are also susceptible to passivation el ghenymy et al 2020 kamaraj et al 2013 vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 most research has focused on studying the electrochemical behavior speciation and coagulation mechanisms for iron usually steel and aluminum electrodes due to their abundant availability and low procurement costs holt et al 2002 the price of steel is more economical than aluminum but better removal performance with aluminum electrodes for certain pollutants has made it an attractive alternative 2 3 1 passivation behavior of iron electrodes in ec observed rates of metal dissolution indicate that fe ii ions are initially dissolved from the fe 0 anode eq 9 which is thermodynamically favorable over fe 0 fe iii oxidation fig 5 fe ii is subsequently oxidized to fe iii ions by dissolved oxygen in the bulk solution eq 10 which is favored at higher ph dubrawski and mohseni 2013 holt et al 2002 lakshmanan et al 2009 sasson et al 2009 van genuchten et al 2017 vepsäläinen 2012 additionally given a sufficiently acidic environment fe 0 can be chemically dissolved from the anode eq 11 golder et al 2011 9 fe s f e 2 aq 2 e e o 0 44 v vs she 10 4 f e 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 f e 3 4 o h 11 f e 0 2 h f e 2 h 2 following the generation of these ions they hydrolyze into a wide variety of oxyhydr oxides which can be comprised of fe ii fe iii or a combination of both dubrawski et al 2015 lakshmanan et al 2009 some oxyhydr oxides such as magnetite fe3o4 and hematite fe2o3 can form by the solid phase oxidation of fe 0 in alkaline ph furthermore fe oxyhydr oxides function as the coagulant in the bulk solution but also contribute to the buildup of the electrode surface layer van genuchten et al 2017 therefore the nature of fe ii iii speciation is vital because different oxyhydr oxides exhibit distinctive passivating characteristics bandaru et al 2020 the formation of different oxides is best represented by pourbaix diagrams fig 5 which show the stability range of metal oxides with respect to electrochemical and ph conditions schmuki 2002 the speciation of fe ii iii oxyhydr oxides depending on do and electrolyte chemistry has been mapped and is shown in fig 6 dubrawski et al 2015 it has been demonstrated that the primary fe oxyhydr oxides that form in ec are green rust fe3o4 and lepidocrocite γ feooh dubrawski et al 2015 dubrawski and mohseni 2013 of these products fe iii species γ feooh exhibit the poorest conductivity and their incorporation in the electrode surface layer is conducive to a higher degree of passivation bandaru et al 2020 gerónimo lópez et al 2014 meanwhile fe ii containing species e g fe3o4 are more conductive and less detrimental to passivation bandaru et al 2020 it has also been reported that the formation of the different precipitates depends on the concentration of do ph electrolyte composition and the fe ii fe iii ratio within the reactor the nature of these parameters varies based on the charge loading rate c l 1 min 1 which is a function of the current density and reactor geometry because green rust and fe3o4 are fe ii iii complexes they form when the fe ii fe iii ratio is low i e in acidic and low do conditions when fe ii fe iii oxidation is retarded dubrawski et al 2015 additionally green rust is an intermediate in fe3o4 and γ feooh formation and can be isolated in the presence of sulfates phosphates and carbonates dubrawski et al 2015 moreno et al 2009 furthermore fe ii iii oxyhydr oxide formation is favored when the rate of fe ii generation is at least three times higher than the rate of do replenishment van genuchten et al 2018 therefore if o2 g is produced in anodic side reactions do levels would increase and prompt fe ii fe iii oxidation hence facilitating the formation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides i e γ feooh fig 6 by analyzing the anode surface layer using x ray powder diffraction xrd it was determined that fe3o4 is its main constituent bandaru et al 2020 van genuchten et al 2016 consequently this makes the composition of the electrode surface layers in ec different than the surface layers on naturally corroded steel which usually contain fe iii species such as γ feooh akaganeit b feooh or hematite a fe2o3 cook 2005 van genuchten et al 2016 furthermore it is well known that little passivation occurs in solutions with high cl concentrations in contrast electrodes are prone to passivate in the presence of dissolved oxyanions such as nitrate sulfate carbonate phosphate silicate formate citrate molybdate and chromate lakshmipathiraj et al 2008 refaey 2005 van genuchten et al 2017 xu et al 2015 as an electrode surface passivates or depassivates the anodic overpotential increases or decreases respectively this response becomes apparent in chronopotentiometric and chronogalvanometric studies fig 7 mechelhoff et al 2013a van genuchten et al 2017 oxyanions exhibit strong affinities to fe 0 and fe oxyhydr oxides whereas cl and br ions replace oxyanions in the inner molecular layer close to the electrode surface effectively weakening the surface layer which ultimately leads to pitting corrosion because cl and br form highly soluble complexes with iron maintaining sufficient availability of aggressive ions can be used to prevent electrode passivation a strategy that is discussed in section 3 1 the effect of passivation in fe ec is particularly evident in no3 solutions fig 7 the passivating behavior of no3 is different than other ions because it does not form a strong interaction with fe ii iii complexes van genuchten et al 2017 however no3 accelerates fe oxyhydr oxide formation which enhances the buildup of the electrode surface layer this effect may be caused by the electrochemical reduction of no3 to no2 nh3 and n2 which liberates hydroxide ions and raises the solution ph additionally in solutions with considerable sulfate concentrations fe ii iii ions have shown to form precipitates with so4 2 for example feso4 and green rust sulfate may form on the electrode surface which contributes to passivation gerónimo lópez et al 2014 the ordering of ionic species from least to most negative impact on fe 0 dissolution and passivation has been determined as chloride bromide sulfate formate carbonate phosphate citrate nitrate van genuchten et al 2017 the effect of increasing current density has also been shown to affect passivation in fe ec for example high current densities increase the total overpotential η at the electrode according to the butler volmer equation eq 12 dubrawski et al 2015 12 i i 0 exp a a z f r t η exp a c z f r t η where i is the current density i0 is the exchange current density aa and ac are electron transfer coefficients r is the universal gas constant t is the temperature and η is the total electrode overpotential activation concentration and passivation overpotentials when the anode overpotential corresponding to the applied current density is sufficiently high o2 g evolution can be triggered this side reaction has been seen when operating at 125 ma cm 2 dubrawski et al 2015 which is exceptionally high compared to the typical current densities reported by other authors see tables 2 4 additionally a higher current density leads to more significant electrophoretic migration of charged suspended particles in the electrolyte which could contribute to fouling and passivation alkhatib et al 2020 sulfide species can exist in certain types of effluents such as produced water from oil production chow and pham 2019 the presence of sulfides in fe ec is critical to acknowledge due to its reactivity within the electrochemical stability range of water and its ability to affect ec performance vepsäläinen 2012 sulfide will be present in different species depending on ph and do concentration h2s is a weak acid pka 7 and exists in acidic environments whereas hs is present in alkaline conditions guan et al 2017 while the impact of sulfides on ec performance has not been extensively studied it has been shown in potentiodynamic polarization studies that their presence effectively mitigates passivation and favors pitting corrosion hernández espejel et al 2011 the same study used thermodynamic modeling to show that fe 0 reacts with sulfide to form mackinawite fes pyrite fes2 and subsequently fe2o3 fe3o4 in later oxidation stages a sequence of chemical and electrochemical reactions was proposed as mechanisms for these transformations initially fe ii is electrochemically produced at the anode which forms fes upon reacting with h2s in the acidic boundary layer eq 13 chemically generated fes either precipitates on the electrode surface or is transported to the bulk solution the formation of fes by this mechanism has been reported elsewhere guan et al 2017 rickard and luther 2007 vepsäläinen 2012 furthermore xrd analysis has shown that a mixture of iron sulfides and fe oxyhydr oxides form on steel electrodes after anodic polarization it was therefore proposed that fes is further oxidized to fe oxyhydr oxides at the anode surface eqs 14 15 hernández espejel et al 2011 it was also hypothesized that sulfur species could oxidize to so4 2 at high overpotentials 13 f e 2 h 2 s fes 2 h 14 2 fes 3 h 2 o f e 2 o 3 2 h 2 s 2 h 2 e 15 3 fes 4 h 2 o f e 3 o 4 3 h 2 s 2 h 2 e post experiment transmission electron microscopy tem images of electrodes have also revealed signs of elemental sulfur formation as a result of h2s oxidation chow and pham 2019 lastly in an attempt to electrodeposit fes2 on steel electrodes researchers found that the surface layer was primarily comprised of crystalline fes whereas no fes2 was observed this was explained by fes2 formation exhibiting sluggish reaction kinetics even though it was thermodynamically favorable under the experimental conditions guan et al 2017 2 3 2 passivation behavior of aluminum electrodes in ec aluminum ions only have one oxidation state z 3 but upon electrochemical dissolution these ions can hydrolyze into many types of polymeric hydroxide species mouedhen et al 2008 following al 0 dissolution al oh 2 and al oh 2 tend to form in acidic conditions whereas al oh 4 forms in alkaline media phalakornkule et al 2010 meanwhile solid al oh 3 al2o3 exist within the range of ph 4 9 5 moussa et al 2017 roberge 2008 interestingly observed concentrations of aluminum in the electrolyte often exceed that of 100 faradaic efficiency cañizares et al 2007 2005 chen et al 2000 izquierdo et al 2010 mouedhen et al 2008 it has been shown that al iii is primarily produced electrochemically at the anode but the super faradaic behavior is a result of chemical corrosion at both the anode and the cathode fig 8 fekete et al 2016 where the cathodic chemical corrosion of al 0 is catalyzed by the alkaline environment mouedhen et al 2008 without applying an electrical current al 0 dissolution increases dramatically above ph 11 compared to iron which corrodes spontaneously below ph 4 cañizares et al 2007 it has also been reported that the chemical corrosion of al 0 at the cathode accelerates with increasing temperature ben grich et al 2019 meanwhile the authors claimed that the electrochemical dissolution of the anode was unaffected by temperature changes furthermore it has also been shown using gas chromatography that al 0 is oxidized by h hence generating h2 g at the anode fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 the electrochemical and the chemical dissolution of al 0 are shown in eqs 16 18 respectively 16 al s a l 3

water at circumneutral ph badawy et al 1999 schmuki 2002 trompette and vergnes 2009 the oxide film thickness has been reported to be between 1 and 5 nm using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analyses martin et al 2005 mechelhoff et al 2013a contrary to the formation of oxyhydr oxides on iron electrodes the al2o3 film is insulating hence functioning as a dielectric schmuki 2002 the insulating al2o3 surface layer must be broken down to facilitate effective ec performance and is replaced by a porous layer of al oh 3 al2o3 during ec operation badawy et al 1999 gao et al 2010 mansouri et al 2011 furthermore on the aluminum pourbaix diagram fig 9 it is seen that al 0 al oh 3 oxidation occurs in circumneutral ph which is another example of a solid phase transformation that contributes to electrode surface layer growth passivation has been studied for aluminum electrodes with different electrolyte compositions solutions containing cl f and no3 have shown to decrease electrochemical overpotentials and produce higher faradaic efficiencies compared to solutions with high concentrations of so4 2 hu et al 2003 mansouri et al 2011 the passivating effect of so4 2 in al ec has also been reported elsewhere huang et al 2009 izquierdo et al 2010 mansouri et al 2011 and it is well established in the corrosion literature lee and pyun 2000 pyun et al 1999 potentiodynamic polarization studies have shown that pitting potentials are increased and current densities are decreased in so4 2 and h2po4 solutions compared to in high concentration nacl electrolytes mansouri et al 2011 in the presence of cl the al oh 3 al2o3 passivation layer breaks down according to eqs 19 23 mansouri et al 2011 which is conducive to pitting

concentrations it was observed that no al 0 dissolved at all while operating at a constant voltage huang et al 2009 additionally the electrolyte ph remained the same throughout the experiment indicating that little or no current passed through the reactor due to extreme passivation other studies have reported evidence of current termination during potentiostatic operation in so4 2 electrolytes e g an aluminum anode surface showed little sign of corrosion in post experiment scanning electron microscopy sem images hu et al 2003 there was no sign of a thick or porous layer indicating that the surface layer was thin and not visible in sem in contrast other researchers showed that al 0 dissolution was unaffected by changing the supporting electrolyte from nacl to na2so4 cañizares et al 2005 in this case the authors concluded that metal dissolution was more sensitive to ph changes i e higher alkalinity favoring al 0 al iii dissolution however the salt concentrations used in these experiments were 2 45 and 3 0 g l 1 which are high side reactions such as cl2 g evolution triggered by high cl concentrations could explain these trends in contrast some authors have recommended using na2so4 over nacl as a supporting electrolyte in al ec due to the enhanced conductivity of so4 2 yildiz et al 2008 the choice between different supporting electrolytes in ec has been a topic of controversy and ghernaout and ghernaout 2011 published a review paper on the contradicting conclusions that have been reported while no3 is detrimental to fe ec performance it may promote metal dissolution in al ec hu et al 2003 this effect may be caused by no3 reduction to no2 nh3 and n2 at the cathode eqs 24 26 thus oxidizing al 0 al iii and generating oh hu et al 2003 the increased concentration of oh could trigger a feedback loop that further promotes the chemical dissolution of al 0 eq 18 however a thick al oh 3 surface layer was observed on the anode in the presence of no3 compared to no observable oxide film in the cl electrolyte hu et al 2003 furthermore the reduction mechanisms for no3 is corroborated by relatively higher ph values observed in no3 solutions than in cl electrolytes huang et al 2009 the authors hypothesized that the lower ph in the presence of cl was caused by the anodic oxidation of cl cl2 g and further production of hocl that had a buffering effect which enhanced the speciation of al hydroxides consequently higher contaminant removal efficiencies were reported in the cl solutions compared to in the no3 electrolytes even though the faradaic efficiencies were similar in both cases the buffering effect of high cl concentrations has been reported elsewhere ben grich et al 2019 24 6 no 3 18 h 2 o 10 a l 0 10 a l 3 aq 3 n 2 36 o h 25

depassivation is not as likely to occur on smooth electrodes due to enhanced structural integrity of the surface layers mechelhoff et al 2013a however it is not apparent if this phenomenon is unique to the nature of al oh 3 al2o3 surface layers or if it applies to fe ec passivation as well as mentioned in section 2 1 formation of alpo4 on electrode surfaces has been observed in phosphate electrolytes which reinforces the passivating surface layer mansouri et al 2011 also the presence of carbonates phosphates silicates and arsenates has shown to lower f removal in al ec while operating galvanostatically vasudevan et al 2011 however it was unclear if this was a result of electrode passivation instead it was suggested that carbonates passivated the anode surface whereas the other ions decreased f removal by competitive adsorption on the aluminum coagulant however as mentioned in section 2 2 f has been shown to passivate aluminum electrodes in ec hu et al 2003 furthermore the passivating effects of carbonates and phosphates have also been reported elsewhere doggaz et al 2019 dura and breslin 2019 lastly the effect of organics such as humic acids on the anodic dissolution and passivation of al 0 is not apparent mechelhoff et al 2013a 2013b but it has been reported that higher concentrations of humic acids form a gelatinous layer on the anode surface which effectively inhibits metal dissolution yildiz et al 2008 2 3 3 summary of passivation of different electrodes the presence of most oxyanions in the electrolyte is detrimental to both al and fe ec performance the exception is that no3 is passivating in fe ec izquierdo et al 2010 thiam et al 2014 but possibly conducive to chemical corrosion in al ec hu et al 2003 few studies have investigated the effect of cations on ec performance but trompette and vergnes 2009 found that the presence of na had a negligible impact on al ec operation whereas izquierdo et al 2010 observed that k had a detrimental effect on faradaic efficiencies in fe ec furthermore bench scale experiments demonstrated that electrode fouling was not as pronounced in al ec as in fe ec shamaei et al 2018 however severe material precipitation on the electrodes in al ec has been reported on the pilot scale schulz et al 2009 it is also unclear if there are differences in passivation behavior for electrodes made of different grades of steel and aluminum which should be investigated in future studies interestingly müller et al 2019 found that overpotentials were higher when using lower purity steel in fe ec field trials compared to when using high purity steel in laboratory experiments however it is unclear if the electrode purity was the main contributor to this effect lastly while so4 2 ions are passivating for both materials sulfate electrolytes have shown to facilitate anodic dissolution in ti ec el ghenymy et al 2020 this observation highlights the complex nature of electrode passivation dissolution which depends upon both the electrode material and the electrolyte composition which can vary widely 2 4 passivation and faradaic efficiency it is generally presumed that higher faradaic efficiencies are correlated with enhanced contaminant removal and maintaining high efficiency is imperative to sustaining efficient ec performance müller et al 2019 the faradaic efficiency of a given ec process is related to the degree of electrode passivation and as mentioned previously severe surface layer growth can adversely affect faradaic efficiency by triggering side reactions or terminating the current this is particularly evident in experiments with high concentrations of oxyanions in the electrolyte hu et al 2003 huang et al 2009 izquierdo et al 2010 müller et al 2019 therefore the relationship between the faradaic efficiency and passivation is important for understanding the electrochemical efficacy of the ec process generally faradaic efficiencies are around 100 in fe ec independent of current density and the do concentration lakshmanan et al 2009 low faradaic efficiencies have been observed at high current densities which has been attributed to unwanted anodic o2 g evolution that was corroborated by bubbles forming on the anode dubrawski et al 2015 additionally the faradaic efficiency dropped from 116 to around 80 in al ec when increasing the current density from 18 ma cm 2 to 52 ma cm 2 chen et al 2020 low faradaic efficiencies have also been reported for experiments carried out at ph 9 possibly caused by o2 g evolution which is more favorable in alkaline conditions sasson et al 2009 as mentioned in section 2 3 1 an increased current density eq 12 strengthens the anodic polarization which attracts particles that could contribute to electrode passivation additionally once o2 g evolution is initiated γ feooh formation is favored which further promotes passivation the formation of o2 g has either been observed or assumed to be the cause of faradaic efficiencies lower than 100 cañizares et al 2005 gao et al 2010 golder et al 2007 heidmann and calmano 2008 kobya et al 2006 mamelkina et al 2017 mollah et al 2004b müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 vepsäläinen 2012 the most convincing evidence substantiating o2 g generation are do concentration measurements exceeding saturation values in fe ec in a no3 electrolyte operating at 10 ma cm 2 van genuchten et al 2017 as mentioned in section 2 3 2 it was also reported and confirmed using confocal imaging and gas chromatography that h2 g forms on the anode not o2 g in al ec when operating with current densities up to 16 ma cm 2 fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 others have also hypothesized or observed h2 g formation in fe ec due to chemical corrosion eq 11 cañizares et al 2007 golder et al 2011 guan et al 2017 furthermore it has been suggested that o2 g evolution does not take place in al ec due to the thermodynamic favorability of al 0 al iii dissolution mouedhen et al 2008 therefore the extent to which anodic o2 g evolution in ec is responsible for observed faradaic efficiencies below 100 is still uncertain other mechanisms that can affect coagulant production must be explored during ec operation measured metal dissolution quantities could be artificially low due to inhomogeneous concentrations within the reactor bandaru et al 2020 as mentioned in the introduction the faradaic efficiency is commonly determined by sampling the bulk solution followed by acid digestion and icp oes analysis müller et al 2019 the potential issue is that the total electrochemically dissolved iron is distributed between the bulk solution the electrode surface layer and the precipitated sludge ultimately efficient coagulant mixing is essential and high fe oxyhydr oxide concentrations in the electrolyte are imperative to sustaining high treatment performance recent studies have provided more nuanced insights into the cause of low faradaic efficiencies in fe ec bandaru et al 2020 müller et al 2019 for example it has been demonstrated that once a surface layer has formed electrochemically produced fe ii is trapped within the lattice of the surface layer bandaru et al 2020 müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 2016 consequently dissolved metal is hindered from diffusing or migrating to the bulk solution hence accelerating the surface layer buildup fig 10 due to the porous and conductive nature of this type of surface layer it is non passive which has been shown in chronopotentiometric studies müller et al 2019 therefore assuming that this effect is responsible for declines in electrochemically dissolved metal faradaic efficiencies of 100 would be expected if they were determined from lost electrode mass after removing the surface layer post experiment this method has been used by one study cesar lopes geraldino et al 2016 which still observed variations in the faradaic efficiency of electrode consumption under different experimental conditions however the connection between coagulant accumulation in the surface layer faradaic efficiency and operating conditions merits further investigation alternatively a shift from fe 0 fe ii to fe 0 fe iii eq 27 at higher anodic overpotentials is thermodynamically favorable over o2 g evolution and could make it seem like the observed faradaic efficiency is low moreno et al 2009 assuming that this phenomenon takes place there would be a shift in the molar rate of electrochemically dissolved metal because the charge transfer number would increase from 2 to 3 therefore less iron coagulant would be produced per unit charge which would lower the calculated faradaic efficiency assuming a two electron transfer reaction eq 5 however it has been suggested that direct fe 0 fe iii oxidation is negligible sasson et al 2009 and none of the reviewed studies reported evidence of this occurring in addition using electrodes of different steel grades could also affect faradaic efficiency for example impurities ni v cr could be preferentially oxidized over fe 0 few studies have compared using electrodes of different steel aluminum purities but müller et al 2019 found that using a higher purity iron electrode did not enhance the observed faradaic efficiency in fe ec nevertheless using low purity metal may be problematic due to the release of toxic impurities into the water 27 fe s f e 3 aq 3 e e o 0 037 v vs she another suggested hypothesis is that fe ii and fe iii ions are reduced to fe 0 at the cathode which would decrease the measured faradaic efficiency van genuchten et al 2016 yang et al 2015 however this hypothesis has not been thoroughly investigated moreover the evolution of br2 g and cl2 g is thermodynamically possible at sufficiently high electrode potentials and occurs in electro oxidation with boron doped diamond electrodes ferro et al 2000 however it has been suggested that these reactions are unlikely to occur in ec even at overpotentials above their standard reduction potentials van genuchten et al 2017 direct oxidation of organics at the anode surface could also cause a drop in the measured faradaic efficiency while positively affecting treatment performance however direct electrochemical oxidation of organics requires large overpotentials and there is no evidence that these processes occur in ec ghernaout 2013 the causes of low faradaic efficiencies observed in fe ec remain unclear however many of the reviewed papers indicate that ec performance is heavily affected by the buildup of a passivating surface layer on the anode this phenomenon consequently increases the anodic overpotential and may change the nature of the electrochemical activity at the anode by inspecting the faradaic efficiencies reported by studies table 2 it is evident that low efficiencies are more frequently observed in fe ec than in al ec therefore sustaining efficient coagulant dosing is seemingly more attainable in al ec which is likely caused by the thermodynamic favorability of al 0 al iii oxidation eq 16 izquierdo et al 2010 also reached this conclusion i e al ec was more effective than fe ec at avoiding passivation and maintaining effective electrode dissolution under identical operating conditions consequently this indication gives al ec a distinctive advantage over fe ec in long term continuous ec operation however a systematic study of long term al ec similar to those for fe ec amrose et al 2014 bandaru et al 2020 müller et al 2019 has not been reported as mentioned in section 2 3 3 severe material precipitation on aluminum electrodes has been reported to occur during pilot scale ec applications schulz et al 2009 3 passivation mitigation strategies researchers have tested a variety of techniques to remove electrode surface layers or to avoid their formations implementing effective strategies will enable continuous coagulant dosing while keeping the cell potential low during long term ec operation the depassivation and performance enhancement strategies that have been reported are examined in the following sections 3 1 aggressive ion addition one of the most frequently recommended depassivation techniques in ec is to add an aggressive ion to the electrolyte such as cl or br arroyo et al 2009 chellam and sari 2016 dura and breslin 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 xu et al 2014 2015 as described previously the addition of an aggressive ion such as cl triggers pitting corrosion which breaks down the surface oxide layer it has been shown empirically that the pitting potential is proportional to the logarithmic ratio of the concentrations of the aggressive and inhibiting ions in the electrolyte lumsden et al 1981 refaey 2005 the linearized expression for this relationship is shown in eq 28 experiments at different electrolyte concentrations have been fitted to this model dura and breslin 2019 mouedhen et al 2008 28 e p a b log c x i where constants a and b are experimentally determined and cx and i are the concentrations of the aggressive and the inhibitor ions respectively in fe ec operation it has been suggested that 1 mm of nacl should be added for every 20 and 100 mm of no3 and hco3 in the solution respectively to mitigate passivation and ensure high faradaic efficiency fig 11 van genuchten et al 2017 in the presence of so4 2 it has been reported that maintaining a cl so4 2 ratio between 0 1 0 8 is sufficient to avoid passivation and ensure high faradaic efficiency huang et al 2009 mechelhoff et al 2013a mouedhen et al 2008 trompette and vergnes 2009 however there are several drawbacks to adding aggressive ions to the electrolyte firstly the added salts may need to be removed in subsequent treatment steps before the treated water could be re used or discharged into the environment secondly a high cl concentration increases the risk of generating hazardous byproducts especially in the presence of organics which could form organochlorinated compounds donaldson et al 2002 gotsi et al 2005 heidmann and calmano 2008 kabdaşli et al 2009 khandegar and saroha 2013 furthermore it has been shown that adding too much cl can disrupt coagulation e g dissolving al oh 3 s to alcl4 aq wang et al 2009 it was reported that adding 1 g l 1 nacl reduced the contaminant removal rate by preferential sorption of cl on the al coagulant abdel aziz et al 2020 additionally it has been shown that cl increases the aqueous stability of certain dissolved contaminants and metal oxyhydr oxides effectively inhibiting the coagulation process abdel aziz et al 2020 golder et al 2011 2007 another concern is the increased sludge production associated with adding salt to the water maha lakshmi and sivashanmugam 2013 hence aggressive ion addition should be optimized to avoid both electrode passivation and the undesirable side effects associated with excessive ion concentrations maha lakshmi and sivashanmugam 2013 table 3 provides an overview of the studies that have explored using aggressive ion addition as a depassivating strategy and shows the suggested concentrations ionic ratios that authors have recommended 3 2 alternating current using current waveforms other than dc is an easily applicable method that has been proposed to remove or inhibit the growth of electrode surface layers in ec some studies have experimented with using a sinusoidal alternating current ac which causes the electrodes to oscillate between anodic and cathodic polarity cerqueira et al 2014 ghanizadeh et al 2016 kamaraj et al 2013 karamati niaragh et al 2019 mansoorian et al 2014 vasudevan et al 2011 vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 it has been shown that ac ec is more cost effective than dc ec for various applications cerqueira et al 2014 kamaraj et al 2013 karamati niaragh et al 2019 mansoorian et al 2014 vasudevan et al 2011 vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 ac ec has also been tested with iron electrodes mansoorian et al 2014 aluminum cerqueira et al 2014 karamati niaragh et al 2019 vasudevan et al 2011 zinc vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 and magnesium electrodes kamaraj et al 2013 higher contaminant removal per unit mass of metal dissolved has been observed in ac ec possibly due to enhanced coagulant mass transfer caused by the corrosion of both electrodes karamati niaragh et al 2019 ultimately most studies have found that ac ec is comparatively more energy efficient than dc ec which is often hypothesized to be a consequence of diminished electrode passivation alkhatib et al 2020 bian et al 2019 kamaraj et al 2013 vasudevan et al 2011 vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 the mechanisms responsible for avoiding or removing passivation in ac ec have not been discussed in the literature however a proposed explanation for polarity reversal is provided in section 3 3 2 which can also be used to explain the mechanisms for ac ec many authors have provided sem images showing that electrodes post experiment display smoother surface morphologies after ac ec operation compared to after dc ec fig 12 kamaraj et al 2013 mansoorian et al 2014 vasudevan et al 2011 vasudevan and lakshmi 2012 electrodes in dc ec exhibit more crevices localized corrosion and material precipitation on the electrodes therefore pitting corrosion is likely less pronounced in ac ec primarily due to the cyclic interruption and restarting of anodic dissolution which leads to the continuous formation of new points of localized corrosion consequently this leads to more uniform consumption of the anode which could overcome the problem of non uniform electrode dissolution associated with small electrode gaps and high solution conductivities mcbeath et al 2020 it has consistently been reported that faradaic efficiencies are lower in ac ec than in dc ec alkhatib et al 2020 xu et al 2019 however ac ec has shown to offer benefits such as reduced sludge formation lower energy consumption improved mass transfer characteristics and delayed electrode passivation alkhatib et al 2020 cerqueira et al 2014 karamati niaragh et al 2019 mansoorian et al 2014 xu et al 2019 in contrast one study reported that dc ec was better than ac ec for the removal of f with both iron and aluminum electrodes ghanizadeh et al 2016 yet in total there have only been a handful of authors that have examined the effects of ac operation and more research is required to develop a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms benefits and drawbacks of this technique the operating conditions reported by authors of ac ec studies are included in table 4 below 3 3 polarity reversal 3 3 1 principles of polarity reversal electrocoagulation in contrast to using a sinusoidal current to invert electrode polarity operating with polarity reversal entails periodically switching the direction of a direct current thus resulting in a square wave fig 13 a this technique is the most commonly used passivation control strategy in ec and is often referred to as an alternating pulsed current eyvaz et al 2009 keshmirizadeh et al 2011 mao et al 2008 yang et al 2015 or as polarity reversal electrocoagulation pr ec bao et al 2020 liu et al 2018 van genuchten et al 2017 vasudevan et al 2011 some researchers have operated pr ec with intermittently terminating restarting i e pulsing the current in between polarity reversals fig 13b which was proposed to enhance the mass transfer of the coagulant to the bulk solution asaithambi et al 2016 hasani et al 2019 ren et al 2011 xin et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 pr ec is relatively easy to implement and the only additional infrastructure required is a dc time relay or manually switching the positive negative terminals the idea of reversing polarity as a method to consume both electrodes can be found in patents from the 1970s miller 1977 1978 pr ec later received attention in the 1980s scientific literature as an electrode cleaning technique grøterud and smoczynski 1986 jianqian 1988 it has since then been established as a strategy to depassivate sustain high treatment performance and to extend electrode lifetime mollah et al 2001 pr ec has been evaluated for several applications table 4 most studies have operated pr ec with current reversals taking place during operation eyvaz 2016 eyvaz et al 2009 gobbi et al 2018 keshmirizadeh et al 2011 liu et al 2018 mao et al 2008 müller et al 2019 ozyonar and karagozoglu 2015 timmes et al 2010 yang et al 2015 others have switched the electrodes in between operating cycles amrose et al 2014 bandaru et al 2020 cesar lopes geraldino et al 2016 maha lakshmi and sivashanmugam 2013 van genuchten et al 2016 3 3 2 benefits of polarity reversal electrocoagulation some authors have observed increased faradaic efficiencies in pr ec compared to in dc ec for operating with both iron and aluminum electrodes cesar lopes geraldino et al 2016 ozyonar and karagozoglu 2015 wellner et al 2018 yang et al 2015 this effect was explained by the inevitable passivation in dc ec thus triggering side reactions the authors suggested that fouling is avoided in pr ec hence sustaining effective metal dissolution additionally sem imaging and xps analysis have shown that a less pronounced electrode surface layer forms in pr ec with aluminum electrodes hasani et al 2019 mao et al 2008 it was also demonstrated that pr ec and dc ec exhibit similar removal efficiencies for current densities below 12 ma cm 2 for abating cod in brewery wastewater using aluminum electrodes eyvaz 2016 however the electrodes in dc ec started passivating when operating at 12 ma cm 2 whereas passivation was not detected in pr ec until current densities of 18 ma cm 2 it has been reported that pr ec uses 30 60 less energy than dc ec for similar contaminant removal efficiencies with aluminum electrodes hasani et al 2019 mao et al 2008 meanwhile energy consumption data reported for pr ec with iron electrodes tend to be lower than for dc ec but the difference is not as dramatic as for aluminum see table 4 apart from the alleged reduced passivation the cell potential in pr ec is lower than in dc ec because h2 g evolution is thermodynamically favorable in acidic ph therefore cathodic h2 g evolution will proceed at a lower equilibrium potential following polarity reversal due to the acidic environment at the cathode however this effect will diminish once the ph at the cathode interface equilibrates due to the electrochemical dissolution of all electrodes in pr ec metal ions are added more uniformly which increases mixing and induces a higher degree of contaminant coagulant interactions consequently the coagulation process becomes more efficient which permits decreasing the charge loading rate hence reducing sludge production hasani et al 2019 keshmirizadeh et al 2011 it has also been suggested that pr ec mitigates the effect of concentration polarization in al ec i e enhancing the mass transfer of al3 and al oh 4 that otherwise tend to concentrate at the anode and cathode respectively during dc ec operation pi et al 2011 2008 consequently the speciation of al hydroxide polymers was improved in pr ec which is conducive to more efficient contaminant removal per unit coagulant produced it was also observed that the coagulant formed in pr ec had a larger surface area than the coagulant formed in dc ec when operating with iron electrodes zhou et al 2020 similar to ac ec pr ec could mitigate the problem of non uniform anodic dissolution which causes pre mature structural failure of the electrodes mcbeath et al 2020 another benefit of pr ec is that two electrode materials could be used to produce two types of coagulants keshmirizadeh et al 2011 for example this permits using iron and aluminum electrodes together which could be beneficial for the treatment of certain types of wastes for instance it has been shown that fe ec is more effective at removing sulfides while al ec is better at abating silica in produced water from in situ bitumen extraction chow and pham 2019 the mechanism for how passivation is avoided or removed when operating ac ec or pr ec is not clearly understood a possible explanation could be scouring by the formation of h2 g bubbles on the cathode bian et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 which mechanically remove the surface layer from the anode following polarity reversal also calcium and magnesium minerals formed on the cathode can dissolve in the acidic boundary layer after the cathode becomes the anode by changing electrode polarity electrostatically adsorbed particles on the surface are repulsed which also contributes to depassivation the surface layer could also be weakened by the dissolution of the underlying metal causing it to fracture bian et al 2019 understanding these mechanisms requires further investigation 3 3 3 effect of polarity reversal frequency the polarity reversal time prt i e the time in between current reversals has been reported to affect ec performance eyvaz et al 2009 grøterud and smoczynski 1986 timmes et al 2010 yang et al 2015 for example short prts have shown to reduce treatment performance yang et al 2015 meanwhile the nature of passivation becomes analogous to dc ec when operating with longer prts these observations indicate that this variable can be optimized but prts recommended in the literature differ table 4 which suggests that the optimal prt is dependent on operating conditions such as electrolyte composition current density and electrode material for example it was concluded that a 5 min prt was optimal for the treatment of organic dyes disperse yellow 241 and reactive yellow 135 in al ec eyvaz et al 2009 meanwhile a 4 min prt was recommended for removing phosphates al fe ec keshmirizadeh et al 2011 smoczyński et al 2017 a 15 s prt for removing methyl orange dye al ec pi et al 2014 1 min for f al ec betancor abreu et al 2019 15 min for al ec operation chen 2004 and 2 5 min for general ec operation eyvaz 2016 additionally a 10 s prt has been used with aluminum electrodes to remove oil perfluorooctanoic acids pfoas and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas although the results were not compared to dc ec or other reversal frequencies bao et al 2020 gobbi et al 2018 liu et al 2018 it has been observed that faradaic efficiencies vary based on prt duration particularly in fe ec for example it was reported that the faradaic efficiency increased from 45 to 70 when increasing the prt from 10 to 590 s which consequently enhanced cr vi removal in fe ec yang et al 2015 low faradaic efficiencies associated with short prts in fe ec have also been reported by others ashraf et al 2019 fekete et al 2016 grøterud and smoczynski 1986 timmes et al 2010 as mentioned previously the bulk solution ph typically increases gradually during dc ec operation however it was observed that the ph increase is not as pronounced in pr ec with short prts compared to longer prts or dc ec grøterud and smoczynski 1986 this phenomenon has been seen for other systems for example it took considerable time for the ph to regain its equilibrium value after reversing polarity with aluminum electrodes in a continuous flow system wellner et al 2018 low faradaic efficiencies with short prts are consistent with findings from studies of ac ec which are equivalent to pr ec with very short prts i e high frequency reversal cerqueira et al 2014 karamati niaragh et al 2019 in contrast the removal of estrogen was reported to increase with shorter prts when using iron electrodes maher et al 2019 the authors concluded that this was a consequence of avoiding electrode passivation however an alternative explanation is that an elevated rate of direct anodic oxidation caused the improved removal rates rather than enhanced coagulation in the electrolyte by using pr ec direct oxidation takes place at both electrodes and the rate of mass transfer of pollutants could be improved enhanced mass transfer and electrode utilization have been observed when applying polarity reversal in the electro oxidation process thostenson et al 2018 longer prts have also been tested for the treatment of groundwater by fe ec müller et al 2019 in this study the faradaic efficiency was lower for a prt of 21 min than observed for switching polarity between every operating batch 105 min which in turn had a lower faradaic efficiency than dc ec it was also found that the anodic interfacial potential was lower in pr ec than in dc ec experiments indicating that passivation was depressed in contrast cesar lopes geraldino et al 2016 demonstrated that electrode consumption was higher over 24 cycles relative to dc ec when reversing polarity in between batches 60 min in fe ec for treating dairy plant effluent the authors concluded that passivation led to reduced coagulant production in dc ec which is plausible due to the high organic content of the wastewater the differences between the findings of these studies highlight the complex nature of pr ec and the effect of electrolyte composition on faradaic efficiency and treatment performance due to the problem of passivation in ec and the widespread belief that pr ec may address this issue it is essential to consider the connection between performance passivation and prt 3 3 4 mechanisms of passivation mitigation in polarity reversal ec discussion few studies have attempted to provide mechanistic explanations for the association between prt and pr ec performance as discussed in section 2 4 the buildup of the electrode surface layer likely contributes to a decrease in faradaic efficiency by hindering coagulant mass transfer to the bulk solution bandaru et al 2020 müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2016 it has been suggested that this effect is accelerated in pr ec which is supported by thicker electrode surface layers observed on iron electrodes in pr ec relative to dc ec ashraf et al 2019 müller et al 2019 an enhanced trapping capacity of iron species by a caco3 surface layer that forms on the cathode before it becomes the anode was proposed as the causation of this phenomenon müller et al 2019 another possible explanation for the relatively thicker surface layers in pr ec could be the occurrence of changing ph boundary layers at the electrode interfaces for example fe ii iii present in the acidic anodic boundary layer can form fe oxyhydr oxides in the alkaline conditions that develop following polarity reversal fig 5 these species sorb to the electrode surface and contribute to the surface layer buildup which impedes fe ii iii mass transport to the bulk solution furthermore allowing for the ph boundary layers to re establish after polarity reversal requires a particular duration which depends on operating conditions such as current density and electrolyte buffering capacity also the slow dissolution kinetics of calcium and magnesium minerals in the anodic acidic boundary layer adds additional time to achieve effective depassivation consequently applying longer prts favor the completion of these mechanisms it has also been acknowledged that the polarization time i e the time it takes for the electrochemical reactions to restart following polarity reversal is detrimental to ec performance grøterud and smoczynski 1986 non faradaic charging discharging of the capacitive electrochemical double layer hasani et al 2019 and faradaic side reactions could occur during this time therefore the expected anodic and cathodic reactions eqs 1 2 are presumably inactivated during this period bian et al 2019 this proposition is corroborated by relatively lower ph and faradaic efficiencies observed in pr ec compared to in dc ec fekete et al 2016 grøterud and smoczynski 1986 by approximating the duration of charging the capacitive double layer in ec assuming 1 cm electrode separation and c 0 2 f m 2 conway 2018 periods within the range 2 100 ms are obtained based on electrolyte conductivities 1 20 ms cm 2 where higher conductivity corresponds to faster charging most pr ec applications operate within these electrolyte characteristics izquierdo et al 2010 shamaei et al 2018 yildiz et al 2008 and must therefore account for capacitive charging during polarity reversal cycling this effect may explain why no net current was observed when operating pr ec at 60 hz 17 ms prt bian et al 2019 additionally ac ec is often operated at 50 hz 20 ms prt therefore this strategy may become ineffective when treating low conductivity waste this phenomenon may explain why ghanizadeh et al 2016 concluded that ac ec was ineffective at removing f using iron and aluminum electrodes from synthetic solutions with low electrolyte concentrations it is also possible to prompt electrochemical side reactions following polarity reversal especially in fe ec fe oxyhydr oxides are either comprised of fe ii fe iii or a combination of both as described in section 2 3 1 these species can be oxidized or reduced given the right environmental conditions for example it is possible that hfeo2 formed during a cathodic cycle in high ph is oxidized to feo2 during the subsequent anodic period according to eq 29 bard et al 1985 which is thermodynamically favorable over fe 0 fe ii oxidation eq 9 fe oh 2 formed at the cathode can also oxidize to fe3o4 in the alkaline environment immediately following polarity reversal fig 5 additionally fe iii and fe ii iii oxyhydr oxides formed in the anode vicinity can reduce to fe ii and feo in a cathodic environment eqs 30 34 which is thermodynamically favorable over h2 g evolution e 0 v vs she at ph 0 gorski et al 2016 xu et al 2019 29 hfeo 2 o h feo 2 h 2 o e e o 0 685 v vs she 30 f e 3 e f e 2 e o 0 771 v vs she 31 fe oh 3 e f e 2 3 o h 32 f e 3 o 4 2 h 2 e 3 feo h 2 o 33 α feooh e 3 h f e 2 2 h 2 o e o 0 768 v vs she 34 α f e 2 o 3 2 e 6 h 2 f e 2 3 h 2 o e o 0 769 v vs she as discussed in section 2 4 it is also possible to reduce fe ii fe 0 at moderate cathodic overpotentials fig 5 for example this phenomenon has been utilized to make batteries that electroplate fe ii fe 0 during charging at the cathode followed by oxidation back to fe ii during discharge hruska and savinell 1981 this effect could also take place in ec where anodically dissolved fe ii iii species could be reduced back to fe 0 following polarity reversal xu et al 2019 electroplated fe 0 could then be re oxidized during the subsequent reversal cycle therefore over the entirety of the operating period less metal is transferred from the electrode to the bulk solution for example it has been demonstrated using cyclic voltammetry that fe ii iii oxyhydr oxides are reduced oxidized at the iron electrode following anodic or cathodic current shifts yang et al 2015 however the authors did not consider how this would affect faradaic efficiencies in pr ec additionally h2 g bubbles sorbed to the electrode surface could be re oxidized to h2o upon polarity reversal which is also thermodynamically favorable over fe 0 fe ii oxidation however it remains unclear if kinetics allow this reaction to proceed to a significant extent interestingly it has been shown that terminating the current for 6 s in between each reversal with iron electrodes decreases the buildup of the electrode surface layer by allowing anodically dissolved metal to transfer to the bulk solution xin et al 2018 consequently less iron metal is available to precipitate on the anode when it becomes the cathode in al ec the electrochemical properties governing al 0 al iii dissolution are different than those in fe ec in particular al iii cannot be electroplated following polarity reversal due to its very low reduction potential compared to the hydrolysis of water 1 66 v vs 0 83 v vs she at ph 14 the likelihood of side reactions induced by polarity reversal is smaller or nonexistent because aluminum does not exhibit the same reactivity as iron within the electrochemical stability range of water roberge 2008 in contrast due to the anodic activation of both electrodes the protective al2o3 surface layer can be removed and expose more al 0 to chemical corrosion that increases coagulant production for example it has been observed that the consumption of aluminum electrodes in pr ec is greater than in dc ec pi et al 2014 wellner et al 2018 however similar to iron higher al 0 dissolution rates have been observed with longer prts relative to shorter prts fig 14 fekete et al 2016 hasani et al 2019 an explanation for this could be that longer prts allow the ph boundary layers at the electrodes to equilibrate which accelerates chemical corrosion after the electrode surface layers have been removed in contrast there is not sufficient time to reach the required ph to corrode aluminum when operating with shorter prts fig 9 capacitive charging may also affect al ec performance at prts 1 s a group of soviet researchers in the 1980s took an alternative approach i e switching polarity for 5 10 s every 5 6 hrs when operating with an aluminum anode and a titanium cathode nikolaev et al 1982 the purpose of this short period of polarity inversion was to remove the calcium and magnesium precipitates at the cathode whereas it was claimed that polarity reversal was not effective at removing the metal oxide layer at the anode a built in automated scraper was used to remove the anodic surface layer mechanically by applying this technique it was reported that the current density increased by 6 10 times when operating potentiostatically during long term treatment at a municipal water supply plant pr ec is seemingly effective at removing delaying or avoiding the formation of electrode surface layers which in turn enhances treatment performance this outcome has been particularly evident in al ec whereas mixed results have been reported for fe ec therefore it is apparent that prts associated with long term treatment must be optimized to avoid the adverse effects related high frequency polarity reversal which has been acknowledged before van genuchten et al 2016 furthermore when pr ec has been used in field operations polarity is reversed in between each batch amrose et al 2014 however it is possible that this is still too frequent to avoid the detrimental effects of re polarizing the electrodes if pr ec is more effective at mitigating fouling and passivation in al ec than in fe ec it could change the cost benefit analysis of ec treatment for some applications however as mentioned in sections 2 3 3 and 2 4 it has been reported that material precipitation on the electrodes can be more significant and create operational problems for al ec compared to fe ec for operating dc ec on the pilot scale which may have limited the industrial application of al ec schulz et al 2009 of course the electrode selection will also depend on the solution composition for example for removing some contaminants such as cr vi fe ec is more suitable mouedhen et al 2009 3 4 ultrasonication it has been reported that coupling ultrasonication with ec referred to as sono ec can be an effective depassivation strategy he et al 2016 while improving coagulant formation and enhancing ec performance kovatcheva and parlapanski 1999 raschitor et al 2014 sonolysis can also produce radicals eq 35 which mineralize organics while achieving disinfection wang et al 2009 in sonolysis the ultrasound forms microscopic bubbles referred to as cavities that collapse once a critical radius is attained de lima leite et al 2003 this phenomenon generates points of high temperatures and pressures which is conducive to the formation of radicals 35 h 2 o sonolysis h ho ultrasound also dislodges h2 g bubbles sorbed to the electrodes that reduce conductivity and increase the current density kovatcheva and parlapanski 1999 as discussed in section 3 3 4 the presence of hydrogen on the electrodes may also trigger side reactions in pr ec additionally sono ec can enhance the formation of cracks and defects in the electrode kovatcheva and parlapanski 1999 which can accelerate the rate of chemical corrosion by exposing more electrode surface area this effect could be particularly beneficial in al ec continuous and intermittent sonication have both shown to be effective at impeding the onset of electrode passivation which was confirmed using eis he et al 2016 however even though continuous sonication was more effective coagulant formation was inhibited which resulted in decreased contaminant removal efficiencies therefore intermittent sonication proved to be favorable by accomplishing effective depassivation while avoiding the destruction of flocs adverse effects on ec performance associated with excessive sonication have been seen elsewhere he et al 2018 in this study the authors recommended operating at a lower sonication power to mitigate floc destruction another study demonstrated that removing cod from oil tanning waste using continuous sono ec was not economically sustainable reporting a total energy consumption of 435 kwh m 3 maha lakshmi and sivashanmugam 2013 however it was concluded that sono ec was an effective depassivating strategy therefore it was suggested that sonication could be used when re starting a reactor with passivated electrodes an overview of the studies that have investigated sono ec is provided in table 5 even though sono ec has proven to mitigate passivation successfully while enhancing treatment performance installing the required infrastructure and accounting for the ensuing operating costs do not make sono ec an attractive strategy 3 5 other passivation mitigation strategies other strategies that have been proposed for avoiding passivation fouling and enhancing ec performance include mechanically cleaning the electrodes bandaru et al 2020 lakshmanan et al 2009 van genuchten et al 2016 increasing the flow velocity to enhance hydrodynamic scouring chen 2004 ghanizadeh et al 2016 timmes et al 2010 and chemically cleaning the electrodes with organic acids müller et al 2019 additionally temporally varying the magnitude of a static voltage with 30 min intervals has shown to decrease energy consumption by 48 in continuous al ec and fe ec operations genc and bakirci 2015 also pulsing a direct current i e intermittently terminating restarting the current without reversing electrode polarity has been demonstrated to reduce energy consumption and sludge production by 89 and 30 respectively relative to dc ec zhou et al 2020 this effect was attributed to the pulsed current inhibiting the formation a passivating surface layer using a steel brush to mechanically clean iron electrodes once a week during long term operation reduced energy consumption by approximately 33 while enhancing the efficiency of arsenic removal amrose et al 2014 many have suggested that this is the most effective depassivation strategy bandaru et al 2020 lakshmanan et al 2009 müller et al 2019 however this method requires terminating the treatment process and disassembling the ec cell which adds labor costs in situ mechanical cleaning may be a viable solution i e installing scrapers that remove the anodic surface layer which has been shown to work with a radial electrode configuration nikolaev et al 1982 it has also been shown that increasing the charge loading rate i e the current density inhibits the buildup of the electrode surface layer over long term fe ec operation müller et al 2019 it was proposed that this effect was caused by the rapid depletion of dissolved oxygen in the anodic boundary layer by an abundance of electrochemically generated fe ii consequently fe ii fe iii oxidation was depressed which decreased the precipitation of insulating fe iii oxyhydr oxides on the anode surface operating at high current densities also increases the positive charge of the anode eq 12 which intensifies the repulsive effect between the cationic fe ii iii ions and the anode alkhatib et al 2020 however an excessively high supporting electrolyte concentration will diminish the magnitude of coagulant mass transfer by electrophoretic migration care should also be taken when increasing the current density due to the possibility of attracting oxyanions to the anode surface causing passivation and triggering side reactions hu et al 2003 huang et al 2009 izquierdo et al 2010 müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 some researchers have tried operating with a horizontal electrode configuration where the cathode is placed at the bottom which allowed h2 g to percolate through the solution abdel aziz et al 2020 it was claimed that this reactor design enhanced mass transfer and decreased anodic passivation furthermore using an oscillating anode has been shown to reduce the cell voltage in fe ec and al ec panikulam et al 2018 which was attributed to improved mass transport of metal oxyhydr oxides from the anode consequently this technique may inhibit material precipitation on the anode a self assembled electrode consisting of magnetic iron particles on a non magnetic substrate has been described in a patent as an effective de fouling method xia et al 2013 however quantitative evidence for the performance of this method has not been presented in the research literature lastly changing the storage conditions of the electrodes in between operating cycles has been investigated by some authors müller et al 2019 wellner et al 2018 it was found that storing iron electrodes in synthetic groundwater in between cycles had a detrimental effect on faradaic efficiency and ec performance once the reactor was restarted due to the formation of a passivating and coagulant trapping surface layer müller et al 2019 others found that storing aluminum electrodes in a salt solution 1 g l 1 nacl minimized the formation of a passivating surface layer and increased treatment performance upon re starting the reactor wellner et al 2018 4 conclusions the different strategies that have been proposed to decrease avoid passivation and to enhance long term ec performance include aggressive ion addition alternating current operation polarity reversal operation ultrasonication mechanical cleaning of electrodes chemical cleaning of electrodes hydrodynamic scouring all these strategies have been shown to be successful at mitigating passivation under suitable conditions however each method has drawbacks that need to be considered for example excessive aggressive ion concentrations may generate hazardous byproducts and increase sludge production while implementing some form of alternating electrode polarity is the most commonly used passivation control strategy studies have shown that there are also drawbacks to this technique for example ac ec or high frequency pr ec with iron electrodes may accelerate electrode fouling while triggering side reactions that divert the current and depress faradaic efficiency pr ec with aluminum electrodes may mitigate severe passivation that can occur in some systems which could make al ec a more attractive option than fe ec for continuous long term operation depending on operating conditions it is also more suitable to operate pr ec with aluminum electrodes because this system is not prone to reversible electrochemical reactions which likely reduce the faradaic efficiency in fe ec however care should be taken to avoid residual aluminum due to its toxicity singh et al 2017 ultrasonication is effective but likely too costly for the conditions investigated to date however this strategy could potentially be used as an in situ electrode cleaning technique in between treatment cycles mechanical cleaning is seemingly the most effective strategy at decreasing passivation and enhancing ec operation however this strategy increases labor costs and requires shutting down treatment therefore it should be avoided as much as possible in situ cleaning using automated electrode scraping mechanisms merits further investigation a compilation of the advantages and disadvantages of each method is provided in table 6 based on the findings in this study the most promising passivation control strategies are aggressive ion addition pr ec and mechanical cleaning of the electrodes ec developers and operators should incorporate a combination of these strategies in their process designs however parameters such as the concentration of aggressive ions and prt should be optimized based on specific operating conditions failing to optimize a strategy could lead to decreased treatment performance or operational challenges therefore the processes passivation mechanisms and depassivation strategies discussed in this article should be considered when assigning operating parameters in the design of ec systems the selection of electrode material should also be carefully considered because passivation characteristics can vary significantly depending on the application it is also clear that the nature and mechanisms of depassivation by aggressive ion addition and polarity reversal are sensitive to the water composition and are not well understood further studies of the mechanisms of passivation and depassivation as a function of water composition and operating conditions are needed to provide deeper insight into these processes lastly studies investigating the effectiveness of implementing depassivation strategies during long term continuous ec operation are needed more research is also required to further understand the relationship between ec performance solution composition and operating conditions funding this research was funded by the natural science and engineering research council of canada
