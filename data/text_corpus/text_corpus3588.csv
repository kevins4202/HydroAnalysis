17940,sand filtration is widely used in drinking water treatment processes yet the hydraulic fundamentals at particle scale are not well defined especially the fluid velocity profile near the sand particles surface in this study a numerical model is developed by combining the lattice boltzmann lbm and the discrete element method dem used to describe the fluid flow over the sand particles surface and the micro structure details of the sand packed bed respectively the model is validated by comparing the simulation results with the experimental measurements using two systems showing that the model can describe the fluid velocity distribution around the particles surface critical flow velocity is introduced as the balance between hydrodynamic and adhesive torques acting on sand particle surface furthermore a new concept effective filter surface efs is defined as the area where the velocity near sand particles surface is less than the critical flow velocity aiming for indirectly evaluating the performance of sand filtration it is quantitatively demonstrated that increasing the sand particle size or feed flow velocity results in the decrease of both critical flow velocity and efs under the given tested conditions the lbm dem model provides a useful tool for understanding the fundamentals of liquid flow distribution and also estimating sand filtration performance under different operation conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords lbm dem sand filtration drinking water treatment particle scale 1 introduction sand filtration is commonly used in drinking water treatment processes to remove suspended solids colloids and some pathogens like microbes and viruses the operation process of sand filtration is shown in fig 1 the raw water in the form of a suspension a two phase system containing fine particles in the fluid is fed from the top of a sand filter and circulates through a porous medium a packed bed of sand particles for water purification ncube et al 2018 in this process the turbidity of suspension is usually about 10 ntu nephelometric turbidity unit i e the colloid phase is very dilute sand particles are usually about 0 4 mm in diameter while colloids are generally less than 50 μm in diameter crittenden et al 2012 moreover the preferential flows and blind regions for filtering are easily formed during the filtration process chuah et al 2004 but the internal flow state is difficult to measure besides the sand filter efficiency can be estimated using semi empirical filtration models e g yao et al 1971 rajagopalan and tien 1976 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 although assisting with conceptual understanding these models are not very effective at quantitatively predicting the effluent turbidity because they are based on several assumptions including constant feed fluid velocity in the bed crittenden et al 2012 in general colloids in raw water can be removed in granular filters by two major mechanisms depending on the colloid size colloids larger than the void size estimated around 80 μm are mainly removed from the feed by straining colloids smaller than the void size are removed by attractive close range molecular forces such as van der waals forces when they contact and adsorb to the grains surface shen et al 2017 in drinking water treatment systems additional sedimentation process is firstly used to remove the colloids in a range of about 20 260 μm generated in coagulation and flocculation processes mueller et al 1967 located at the downstream of the sedimentation process the sand filtration is then used to remove some of the remaining colloids i e smaller than 50 μm crittenden et al 2012 thus adsorption is regarded as the dominant colloid removal mechanism in the sand filtration process although straining might occur at the upper layer of the sand bed the colloids adsorption is determined by the balance between hydrodynamic and adhesive torques acting between the colloids in the fluid and sand particles lee et al 2019b for example once the adhesive torque is larger than hydrodynamic torque the colloids are expected to adsorb on sand particles surface successfully otherwise detachment occurs alimi et al 2018 chemical e g ionic strength and ph and physical e g flow rate and hydraulic retention time properties of the fluid both can affect the balance between hydrodynamic and adhesive torques lee et al 2019a to improve the sand filtration process understanding the impact of hydrodynamic and adhesive torques between the suspension and sand particles is essential fluid flow velocity plays a dominant role in the torques balance bizhani and kuru 2018 proposed that the effective fluid velocity controlling the forces acting between the colloids and sand bed was identified at a distance less than one single sand diameter to estimate the adsorption or detachment of colloids understanding and quantifying the flow velocity heterogeneity typically within one sand diameter near the sand particles surface is important obtaining the flow velocity profile near the particles surface in a packed bed is a challenge even in a simple system many physical experiment techniques have been used to obtain fluid velocity distributions in the porous media e g laser doppler anemometry lda neumann et al 2009 particle image velocimetry piv li et al 2018b magnetic resonance imaging mri skuntz et al 2018 magnetic resonance velocimetry mrv reci et al 2018 and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr o neill et al 2016 furthermore more detailed experimental investigations on liquid flow velocity distributions in water saturated porous media e g bead packs were conducted by kutsovsky et al 1996 and wu et al 2016 however most of the experimental methods are limited to measure the fluid phase and cannot take into account detailed particle scale characterization for the sand filtration system as an alternative computational fluid dynamics cfd is an effective tool for studying fluid flow through porous media some previous modelling efforts have been made using continuum based models lu et al 2019 to describe the fluid phase in this environment gatica et al 2008 developed a well posed conforming mixed finite element method to explore the hydrodynamics for a porous medium entirely enclosed in the fluid phase raeini et al 2012 used a volume of fluid method to model fluid flow in porous media with a complex interface motion and irregular solid boundaries hassan et al 2013 utilised a eulerian method to simulate the transport and retention of nanoparticles in saturated porous media however the continuum based methods can only obtain the averaging variables at a grid scale level without the detailed information at particle scale thus the discrete element method dem a particle scale approach has attracted increasing attention to better characterise porous media dong et al 2006 moreover to resolve the fluid motion near the particle surface the dem is commonly coupled with cfd i e the cfd dem method based on the resolution of the fluid phase the cfd dem method is categorised into unresolved and resolved cfd dem methods using the former method huang et al 2014 investigated the fluid induced particles migration in granular filters the velocity distribution information near the particles surface heavily relies on the detailed description of fluid flow and particles which can form microscale gaps or discontinuities in the packed bed as a result the continuum based methods and unresolved cfd dem method cannot take into account such detailed information effectively for accurate analysis to resolve the fluid flow through porous media at particle scale and obtain an accurate velocity profile near the particles surface the cfd model needs to consider the resolved particle boundaries recently the lattice boltzmann method lbm rong et al 2013 offers a powerful tool to describe fluid transport phenomena as a resolved cfd method the lbm is based on the microscopic fluid fictitious particle models and mesoscopic kinetic equations where fluid fictitious particles representing packets of fluid are tracked through the computational domain thus the fluid particle interactions can be directly implemented by solving the collision of fluid and solid nodes near the particle surface moreover the simple and computationally efficient bounce back approach in the lbm can incorporate no slip walls with irregular geometries which makes the lbm an ideal method for simulating fluid flows in porous media across a wide range of scales peng et al 2016 for example sheikh and qiu 2018 investigated the pore scale velocity field and fluid solid interaction from a single particle to randomly packed mono sized porous media using lbm dem coupled model zhao et al 2018 simulated gas transport in a two dimensional 2d micro porous media reconstructed by a lbm at representative elementary volume rev scale li et al 2018a reported a 2d lbm dem framework to study saturated flow velocity characteristics in column leaching yamamoto and toda 2018 numerically investigated the fluid dynamics in a diesel filter by lbm where the bed structure was obtained by x ray ct overall lbm was found to be a useful tool to study the velocity fields in porous media at particle scale however few studies focussed on the application of lbm in sand filtration with a detailed review of the velocity profile near the sand particles surface moreover the particle scale velocity profile has not been used to make a connection with the colloids adsorption on the sand particles surface the objective of this work is therefore to study the fundamentals related to fluid flow near the particles surface under different conditions aiming to estimate the sand filtration performance the paper is structured as follows the integrated three dimensional 3d lbm dem model is introduced first by combining a single phase lbm model to simulate the flow field and a dem model to generate the packed sand particles the model is then validated by comparing the simulated flow profile and pressure drop with experimental data moreover the additional theoretical framework is developed including i critical flow velocity for evaluating the balance between hydrodynamic and adhesive torques acting on sand particle surface ii an effective filter surface efs concept for estimating the efficiency of sand filtration for the colloids adsorption finally the effects of feed flow velocity and sand particle size on flow velocity distribution near the sand particles surface and also efs are comprehensively studied the proposed approach will provide an effective tool to understand the local flow profile in sand filtration for estimating its performance 2 model details an integrated lbm dem model is developed and used to simulate the fluid flow in porous media for the sand filtration process in this model the lbm is used to describe fluid flow through the sand bed and the fluid velocity profile near the sand particles surface while the dem is used to generate the packed bed representing a scale down sand filter 2 1 lbm model in this study the suspension a mixture of water and the colloids in the sand filtration is considered as a single fluid phase since the velocity of the fluid is very slow i e about 0 3 m h and the size of colloids is small i e nano scale as a result the colloids follow fluid pathway and have a similar pattern to the near sand particles surface flow velocity distributions lukic et al 2005 the general descriptions of the lbm are well documented in the literature chen and doolen 1998 spaid and phelan 1997 in this study the lbm model mainly refers to the numerical treatments by warren 1997 which is briefly described below in the single bhatnagar gross krook bgk scheme the dynamics of a fluid particle distribution function f i at a lattice node r and time t with velocity v i in direction i are given by a collision step as 1 f i r t f i r t f i r t f i e q r t τ where τ is relaxation time and f i e q represents the pseudo equilibrium distribution function followed by a propagation step as 2 f i r c i t 1 f i r t generally τ determines the kinetic viscosity ν in a widely used class of models given by ν τ 0 5 3 0 eqs 1 and 2 can give the navier stokes equations by the correct choice of f i e q in a low mach number limit ladd 1994a once the distribution function is known the hydrodynamic variables such as the fluid density ρ and the momentum ρ u can be obtained 3 ρ i f i ρ u i f i c i a double relaxation time scheme introduced in the d3q15 model behrend et al 1994 is used to solve eqs 1 and 2 as shown in fig 2 this 3d model is based on a cubic lattice it possesses a rest fluid particle state with six links to the nearest and eight links to the next next nearest neighbours a quantity q i α β c i α c i β c s 2 δ α β is introduced in this model where α and β denote spatial indices and c s is the speed of sound in the present model the value c s is set as 1 3 therefore the pseudo equilibrium distribution function f i e q can be constructed as 4 f i e q r t ρ b ρ u α c i α b c s 2 ρ u α u ρ q i α β b c s 2 a double relaxation time scheme is implemented as efficiently as the above single relaxation time scheme the scheme calculates another weighted quantity s α β i ω i f i q i α β which is related to the pressure tensor by α β ρ c s 2 δ α β s α β then this quantity is relaxed towards its equilibrium value by s α β s α β s α β s α β e q τ for the n s equation which means s α β e q ρ u α u β therefore the post collision distribution function in eq 1 can be calculated as 5 f i x t ρ b ρ u α c i α b c s 2 s α β q i α β 2 b c s 4 compared to the single relaxation time scheme the double relaxation time scheme results in improved hydrodynamic behaviour since these two schemes take about the same number of floating point operations li et al 2016 2 2 dem model in the dem model the translational and rotational motions of particles are determined by newton s second law where the gravitational and interparticle forces are given by 6 m i d v i d t j f i j a f i j b f g 7 i i d ω i d t j r i j f i j b μ r r f i j a ω i ˆ where m i and i i denote the mass and moment of inertia of particle i respectively v i and ω i are the translational velocity and angular velocity respectively f g is the gravitational force r i j represents the vector from the centre of the particle i to the contact point with particle j μ r is the rolling friction coefficient and ω i ˆ ω i ω i f i j a and f i j b represent the normal and tangential contact forces as expressed by 8 f i j a n i j ˆ 2 y r ξ n 3 2 3 γ n y r ξ n v i j n i j ˆ 3 1 σ 2 9 f i j b μ r f i j a 1 1 m i n ξ s ξ s m a x ξ s m a x 3 2 ξ s ˆ 10 ξ s m a x μ s 2 σ 2 1 σ ξ n where r i and r j are the radius of particle i and j respectively y σ γ n and μ s are young s modulus poisson s ratio normal damping coefficient and sliding friction coefficient respectively r 2 r i r j r i r j n i j ˆ r i r j r i r j ξ s and ξ s ˆ are the magnitude of total tangential displacement during a contact and its unit vector respectively in this study the sand filter is treated as a pack of uniform spherical particles and simulated using the dem model this is because although the sand particles usually have a range of irregular shapes and generally present a size distribution the typical sphericity of a sand particle is found to be as high as 0 82 rorato et al 2019 which means that the sand shape is close to the sphere moreover the sand bed is usually processed as a media having uniform size as the uniformity allows the sand filter to operate at a higher hydraulic loading rate with lower head loss crittenden et al 2012 as a result uniform spherical particles are used to form the sand bed in this study such treatment of mono sized spherical particles was also used in the previous granular filtration studies hassan et al 2013 shen et al 2017 taghavijeloudar et al 2019 in addition the relatively long range inter particle forces can be neglected which include forces such as the van der waals capillary force and electrostatic forces since the fluid velocity in the sand filter is small the movement or interaction between sand particles can be neglected 2 3 coupling procedure the bounce back method wang et al 2019 is used for the treatment of bed boundaries and the one way coupling of dem and lbm when a dem spherical particle is considered in the lbm the lattice is divided into three categories i solid lattice which is fully contained within the discrete spherical particle ii outside lattice which belongs to the fluid iii interface lattice which intersects the boundary of discrete spherical particle fig 3 shows these three lattices categories in the ladd 1994b method the real surface of a discrete spherical particle is represented by the midpoint between two neighbouring solid and fluid nodes for a stationary boundary on a uniform lattice r f r s and r b are referred to as nodes on the fluid side solid side and boundary respectively the subscript i indicates the opposite direction to i thus the lbm dem method can be used to obtain the microscale velocity profile near the sand particles surfaces as 11 f i r b t 1 2 2 f i r f t f i r s t c i 3 theory development as previously mentioned in the introduction the fluid velocity plays a dominant role in determining the balance between hydrodynamic and adhesive torques the balance of torque is the key to determine the colloids adsorption and detachment behaviours in this section the fluid and particle denote the suspension and sand respectively a critical fluid velocity will be derived first and the resulting effective filter surface efs will be defined as an indicator for the sand filtration efficiency 3 1 critical flow velocity when the colloids in the fluid approaches the sand particles surface the comparison between hydrodynamic and adhesive torques is used to determine whether the colloids absorb to the sand particles surface i e adhesive torque is great than hydrodynamic torque or detach from the sand particles surface due to overwhelming hydrodynamic drag i e adhesive torque is less than hydrodynamic torque lee et al 2019b thus a critical fluid velocity can be expected for a given system with fixed chemical properties e g ionic strength ph and temperature where the hydrodynamic torque begins to surpass adhesive force as the fluid velocity near sand particle surface increases similar critical concepts have also been reported related to the fouling mechanisms in ultrafiltration kirschner et al 2019 and critical suspended particle size in granular filtration process qi 1998 briefly under laminar flow conditions the hydrodynamic torque t d acting on the attached colloid due to hydrodynamic shear is expressed as 12 t d 1 399 a c f d where a c is the adsorbed colloid radius and the constant 1 399 indicates that the drag force acts effectively on the deposited colloid at a distance of 1 399 a c from the particle surface f d is the drag force which is a combination of colloid radius fluid viscosity and fluid velocity at the centre between the adsorbed colloid and particle surface 13 f d 1 7005 6 π μ v c a c where the coefficient 1 7005 accounts for the wall effects near the particle surface the adhesive torque t a for the colloid adsorbed on the particle surface is represented by the net adhesive force f a acting on a lever arm l x as given below 14 t a f a l x the lever arm is provided by the radius of colloid surface contact which results from deformation of the colloid as 15 l x 4 f a a c k 1 3 where k is the composite young s modulus bergendahl and grasso 2003 employed value of k 4 0 109 n m2 for glass bead collectors used in the case of a polystyrene colloid suspension and the same value is used in the calculations herein the detailed procedure for calculating hydrodynamic and adhesive torques can be found in the previous work li et al 2005 gregory 1975 and gregory 1981 further electrostatic and van der waals interaction forces are used to calculate colloid particle interaction forces which become the source of adhesive torque the electrostatic interaction force f e per unit area between two parallel flat surfaces is calculated as follows 16 f e n k t 2 cosh y 1 k 2 d y d x 2 2 where n is the number of cations per unit volume k and t are the boltzmann s constant and fluid temperatures respectively y is the reduced potential at a distance x from the plane of the granular surface y z e ψ k t where e and ψ are the electron charge and potential respectively further k is debye huckel reciprocal length parameter y 2 e 2 n z 2 ε k t and ε is the permittivity of the fluid the van der waals interaction energy v s for an unequal sphere sphere system is expressed as d γ 4 π d a c 17 v s a a c a p 6 a c a p d 2 45 10 π γ d 2 17 60 π 2 γ d 2 0 59 280 π 3 γ d 3 where a p is the particle radius γ 100 nm is the decay length for the van der waals force d is the distance between the colloid and particle and a is hamaker constant for which the values of 3 8 10 21 and 6 8 10 21 j are used in the cases of the microsphere water glass system and the microsphere water quartz system respectively note that the value of the van der walls force is estimated as v s d torkzaban et al 2007 the equations used in this study are not appropriate for particle sizes smaller than about 2 μm and distances between the colloids and particles less than about 8 nm owing to the lack of a single expression for retarded intermolecular attraction 3 2 effective filter surface efs the effective filter surface efs is defined as the sand particle surface area where the fluid velocity is less than the critical flow velocity in this system the critical fluid velocity is expected for a given system with fixed chemical properties when the hydrodynamic torque is larger than the adhesive force as the fluid velocity near sand particle surface increases this efs thus represents an effective sand particle surface for the colloid adsorption and can be used for estimating the sand filtration performance the distance between fluid velocity and sand particle surface is less than one sand particle diameter due to the capability of lbm operating at the microscale the developed lbm dem model can provide a detailed velocity profile in the vicinity to sand particles surface and the percentage of fluid velocity where the value is less than critical flow velocity can be quantified this percentage also indirectly represents the percentage of total sand surfaces that can achieve the colloid adsorption the efs is defined as 18 efs p c t s s a n d v s a n d where pct is the percentage of fluid velocity less than critical flow velocity s s a n d and v s a n d are the surface area and volume of a sand particle respectively 4 simulation conditions in the present study a packed bed of uniform spherical particles is used for representing a sand filter fig 4 shows the schematic diagram of the simulation domain the walls of the computational domain are set as periodic boundary condition which allows those particles that are cut off at lateral walls to be properly reintroduced into the computational domain and guarantee a regular geometry the fluid flow is along the vertical direction geometric parameters and simulation conditions investigated in the base case are listed in table 1 to study the fluid velocity distributions around the particles surface and make the computational cost affordable an elementary volume element with a 3 3 mm cross section and 24 mm in length as scale down sand filter is chosen to simulate the depth filtration system as a demonstration of the efs concept the number of sand particles is 1500 three typical sand particle sizes i e 0 3 mm 0 4 mm and 0 5 mm in diameter are chosen the fluid density ρ and kinematic viscosity ν are 1000 kg m3 and 10 6 m2 s respectively τ as the relaxation time for convergence is given three different values i e τ 0 8 0 53 and 0 503 giving rise to a broad range of feed flow velocities moreover three different feed flow velocities 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m h covering a wide range of operation conditions for the conventional sand filter are used in summary a scale down sand filtration system is simulated to help reveal the fundamental insights about the particle scale velocity profile within the sand filter 5 model validation the model is validated with experimental data in two systems fluid flow over an isolated particle and fluid flow through a packed bed 5 1 flow over one isolated sphere fluid flow passing an isolated sphere is a classical problem with many experimental data and is often used for model validation the present model is first applied to a system of fluid flow over an isolated particle in an experimental study schlichting and gersten 2000 note that such particle scale measurement cannot be obtained in industry scale sand filtration but available in some fundamental physical experiments using one single particle as illustrated in fig 5 the simulated drag coefficients are decreased from about 10 5 to 1 0 when the reynolds number re is increased from 10 3 to 102 in a laminar flow field moreover the simulation results are comparable with the measurement in this case the simulation result of drag coefficient is also found to be comparable to some previous empirical correlations i e stokes 1851 dallavalle 1948 and clift et al 1978 details about this case can be found in supplementary material 5 2 flow through a packed bed the model is then applied to two packed beds for further validation in terms of pressure drop and velocity distribution simulation conditions are listed in supplementary material the pressure drop is an important parameter to assess to appropriately design operate and manage filters in a sustainable and energy efficient way duran ros et al 2009 pressure drop induced by fluid flow through a randomly packed granular filter configured with different sphere shaped granular media can be measured in previous experimental studies by bové et al 2015 the system is simulated using the lbm dem model developed in this study as illustrated in fig 6 the simulated pressure drop through filters is almost linearly increased with the feed flow velocities and is comparable with the experimental measurements indicating the accuracy of the lbm dem model in simulating the fluid flow through sphere filters however the lbm dem model can capture the pressure drop for the packed bed of spherical particles but not non spherical particles this model is more suitable for spherical particles and the shape and surface roughness of granular not considered in the present model have been proposed to have significant impact on pressure drop through the granular filter by bové et al 2015 the model is applied to another packed bed in the experiment conducted by wu et al 2016 as shown in fig 7 the flow velocity distributions in packed bed calculated by the lbm dem model are comparable to the experimental results measured using phase contrast mri under three inlet flow velocities i e 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 l min indicating that the model can accurately predict the flow distributions in packed bed systems under different conditions 6 results and discussion in this section the fluid flow patterns at microscale are explored and discussed based on a typical sand filtration system the effects of feed flow velocity and sand particle size on efs are also studied 6 1 hydraulic performance the sand filtration system with an average sand particle size of 0 4 mm operated at an average feed flow velocity of 0 3 m h is simulated as the baseline scenario fig 8 shows the velocity contour and vector the distributions of bulk velocity and velocity near the sand particles surface respectively as seen in fig 8a the local flow velocity varies across the entire bed the preferential flows red vectors and blind regions dark blue vectors can be observed the underlying pore structure of porous media primarily leads to the unique velocity distributions although fluid flow conditions also play a role de anna et al 2017 to further explore the reasons of the velocity distributions the pore structure of the sand filter is quantified in terms of effective throat diameter which is defined as the diameter of a circle with an equal to that of the void space in a face of the delaunay cell considered yang et al 2006 the non uniform distributed void spaces and the related effective throat diameters in the sand filter are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9a the void spaces of the whole sand filter vary from 0 04 to 1 0 mm3 the component 0 06 0 08 mm3 accounts for nearly 75 of the entire void spaces the void space information is obtained by voronoi tessellation with an open source program developed by rycroft 2009 fig 9b shows the distributions of the effective diameter of a pore throat ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mm the sharp peak of the effective diameter distributions located around 0 13 0 15 mm corresponds to the throats formed by contact or near contact sands the zoomed in image shows that the local maxima of velocity are found in the middle between the pores the average flow velocity in the simulated sand bed is found to be 0 5 m h which 1 7 times the feed flow velocity fig 8b and c show the statistic distributions of bulk flow velocity in pores and the near sand particles surface flow velocity the bulk flow velocity in this baseline scenario is in the range of 0 1 0 m h the percentage of bulk flow velocity decreases with the increase of flow velocity a peak is observed at the flow velocity of 0 3 m h equivalent to the feed flow velocity contrastingly the fluid velocity near the sand particles surface is in a smaller range 0 0 4 m h more than 30 of the flow velocity near the sand particles surface is smaller than 0 02 m h and the percentage is found to decrease rapidly for higher flow velocities the developed lbm dem model statistically describes the velocity map in the sand filtration moreover the model demonstrates the distributions near the sand particles surface velocity accounting about one tenth of the feed flow velocity which can be hardly obtained by conventional experimental tools detailed velocity distributions information can be found in table s4 supplementary material as another important parameter for a sand filtration system the pressure is also studied as shown in fig 10 the pressure is found to unevenly distributed in the whole bed although the pressure at cross section is not uniformly distributed a declining trend along the fluid flow direction through the filter depth is observed fig 10a the average pressure at the cross section decreases at a slope of approximately 0 057 pa mm δp fig 10b at the macroscopic level and the limit of creeping flow regimes the pressure gradient δp and the flow rate have a linear relation known as darcy s law δ p μ k u where μ and u are viscosity and superficial velocity respectively the proportionality constant k is the permeability of the medium calculated to be 2 57 m s the value is involved in the reasonable range of sand filtration and indicates that the scale down sand filter generated by dem is pervious 6 2 effects of operating parameters on efs 6 2 1 feed flow velocity three typical feed flow velocities i e 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m h covering a wide range of conventional sand filtration operation conditions hayward et al 2019 are studied to reveal the effects of feed flow velocities on efs for understanding the association between fluid velocity and sand filtration performance the sand filter is configured with 0 4 mm diameter sand particles schijven et al 2013 fig 11 a shows the bulk flow velocity distributions for the three feed flow velocities the average bulk flow velocity increases from 0 37 to 0 60 m h with the increase of feed flow velocity from 0 2 to 0 4 m h the peak percentage of bulk flow velocity is observed at the value of feed flow velocity for all three cases accounting 7 5 4 6 and 5 1 respectively while the percentage of bulk flow velocity below 0 5 m h is 77 8 for the case of 0 2 m h which 1 2 times of that obtained for 0 3 m h and 1 4 times of that obtained 0 4 m h respectively the results indicate that the main velocity component is 0 0 5 m h regardless of the variation of feed flow velocity but the percentage decreases with the increased feed flow velocity fig 11b shows the distributions of velocity near the sand particles surface the average near the sand particles surface velocity increases from 0 08 to 0 15 m h with the increase of feed flow velocities from 0 2 to 0 4 m h at flow velocity lower than 0 16 m h the percentage of flow velocity near the sand particles surface induced by lower feed flow velocity is higher an opposite trend is obtained at flow velocity higher than 0 16 m h the results indicate that increasing feed flow velocity induces a decrease of the value of velocity component near the sand particles surface detailed velocity distributions information can be found in table s5 and table s6 supplementary material the critical flow velocity for 0 4 mm sand particle to adsorb the bacteriophage ms2 virus 25 nm keller et al 2004 is calculated to be 0 0044 m h using eqs 12 17 fig 11c shows the efs induced by different feed flow velocities the efs of 0 4 mm sand filter induced by 0 2 m h feed flow velocity is 1636 m2 m3 10 9 of the overall sand particles surface based on the eq 18 when the feed flow velocity increases from 0 2 to 0 3 m h the efs obtained is 1264 m2 m3 equivalent to 8 4 of the total sand particles surface a further increase of feed flow velocity to 0 4 m h results in a further decrease in efs to 1023 m2 m3 accounting for 6 8 of the total sand particles surface increased feed flow velocity results in smaller efs owing to the decreased percentage of near sand particle surface velocity where the value is less than the critical flow velocity the result is consistent with many experimental works where the smaller feed flow velocity resulted in a higher colloid removal efficiency in sand filtration gude et al 2018 perez vidal et al 2019 this indicates that the lbm dem model and efs concept can reproduce the key phenomena and tendency observed in practice and explain the underlying mechanism of the effect of feed flow velocity using detailed microscale information for example the velocity distributions near the sand particles surface 6 2 2 sand particle size three sand filtration systems with three sand particle sizes i e 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 mm at a feed flow velocity of 0 3 m h are studied for understanding the impact of sand particle size on filtration performance fig 12 shows fluid velocity distributions of bulk flow velocity and near sand particles surface velocity as seen in fig 12a the percentage of bulk flow velocity for the three filters all peak at the flow velocity of 0 3 m h equivalent to the feed flow velocity however the percentage of the high velocity component increases with the rise of sand particle size due to the larger void spaces for same volume filter filled with bigger sand particles the peak value decreases from 9 85 to 4 47 when the sand particle size increases from 0 3 to 0 5 mm with the increase of sand particle size from 0 3 to 0 4 mm the percentage of bulk flow velocity below 0 3 m h the feed flow velocity decreases from 41 1 to 33 2 however only a 2 0 decrease in bulk flow velocity is obtained when the sand particle size increases from 0 4 to 0 5 mm also a slight change is obtained in the bulk flow distributions above 0 5 m h for the three filters the results indicate that the average bulk flow velocity increases with the decrease of sand particle size fig 12b shows the near sand particles surface velocity distributions the peak of near sand particles surface fluid velocity is observed at 0 011 and 0 014 m h for sand size of 0 3 and 0 4 mm accounting 4 8 and 6 2 respectively in contrast a uniform decease trend can be found for the sand particle size of 0 5 mm at flow velocity lower than about 0 20 m h the percentage of flow velocity near the sand particles surface induced by a smaller size is higher an opposite trend is obtained at flow velocity higher than 0 20 m h the previous results indicate that the sand particle size has an important effect on the velocity distributions which is related to the variation of void spaces in sand filters with different particle sizes detailed velocity distributions information can be seen from table s7 and table s8 supplementary material the critical flow velocity shows a decreasing trend with the increase of sand particle size with 0 0056 0 0044 and 0 0035 m h obtained at sizes of 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 mm respectively the decrease in critical flow velocity owes to the enhanced adhesive torque induced by increased sand particle size lee et al 2019b fig 12c shows the efs induced by different sand particle sizes the efs is approximately 740 m2 m3 3 7 of the total surface of the 0 3 mm sand filter the efs decreases to 487 5 m2 m3 when the size increases to 0 4 mm equivalent to 3 2 of the total sand particles surface a further increase of particle size to 0 5 mm results in a further decrease in efs to 300 m2 m3 2 5 of the total sand particles surface the decreasing trend of efs is caused by the declining percentage of near sand particles surface velocity where the value is less than the critical flow velocity the result is in agreement with the trend predicted by the fundamental filtration model developed by rajagopalan and tien 1976 and other experimental works aronino et al 2009 where the filter efficiency decreases with the increase of granule size it indicates the developed model and efs concept can provide the same tendency observed in the experiments and explain the underlying mechanism of the effects of sand particle size based on the particle scale velocity distributions information 7 discussion in this section the model applicability and efs functionality are summarized the developed lbm dem model can describe the velocity map in sand filtration at particle scale the critical flow velocity and efs are proposed and used to quantitatively estimate the sand filtration performance the fluid velocity plays a key role in determining the colloids adsorption the developed lbm dem model can capture and quantitatively assess the bulk and near sand particles surface velocity profiles under different conditions including two important operational parameters i e feed flow velocity and sand particle size these particle scale velocity profiles are associated with sand filtration performance by the newly proposed parameters critical flow velocity and efs the critical flow velocity is operated near the sand particle surface typically within one sand diameter while the efs is the area where the fluid velocity near sand particle surface is less than the critical flow velocity these values can hardly be obtained by experimental or conventional simulation methods several semi empirical filtration models have been widely used in granular filtration process for estimating the filtration performance however all these models are limited in quantitatively predicting the filtration efficiency due to the assumptions of no change in parameters such as fluid velocity crittenden et al 2012 the fluid velocity is usually heterogeneously distributed in the whole sand filter assuming the fluid velocity as constant for the entire sand filtration process is a simple assumption and may weaken these models accuracy comparing with these models the efs can indeed reproduce the tendencies of key variables feed flow velocity and sand particle size on sand filtration efficiency and the efs can quantitatively estimate the sand filtration performance based on statistical velocity distributions near the sand particles surface without assuming fluid velocity as a constant the 3d lbm dem model provides a cost effective tool for visualising the complex fluid pathway around the sand particles and fundamentally understanding the effect of key variables on the fluid velocity distributions near particle surfaces in the opaque filtration system moreover the proposed particle scale model can help resolve the underlying fundamental mechanism providing the theoretical basis for the mesoscopic or macroscopic model study of the real sand filtration process note that two major assumptions are applied in this study firstly the suspension a mixture of water and colloids in the sand filtration is a single fluid phase the sand filter is considered as packing of smooth uniform spherical particles the velocity of the fluid in sand filtration is slow i e about 0 3 m h and the size of the colloids is small i e nano scale as a result the colloids follow fluid pathway and have a similar pattern to the near sand particles surface flow velocity distributions while the sand bed is usually of high sphericity and sieved for greater uniformity the two major assumptions are also used in previous studies hassan et al 2013 shen et al 2017 taghavijeloudar et al 2019 particle scale modelling of the complexities associated with the real filtration systems e g wide variations in sand particle shape size distribution and surface roughness is very computational demanding under the present hardware and software conditions and will need further efforts which is beyond the scope of this study 8 conclusions in this study an integrated lbm dem model is developed for describing the microscopic flow distributions through the sand filter aiming to understand the hydraulic fundamentals and estimate the sand filtration performance under various conditions the model is validated with experimental data about fluid dynamics in one single particle and two packed bed systems subsequently the model is used to study a scaled down sand filter with an average sand particle size of 0 4 mm operated at feed flow velocity of 0 3 m h as a baseline scenario the effects of different operation conditions i e feed flow velocity and sand particle size on sand filtration performance are thoroughly investigated the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 preferential flows and blind regions exist due to the non uniform distributed void spaces and pore structures in the sand filter the maximum local value of velocity is near the middles of the pores under the given simulation conditions the average flow velocity in the sand bed is found to be nearly two times the feed flow velocity the percentage of bulk flow velocity decreases with the increase of flow velocity but a peak observed at the feed flow velocity meanwhile the flow velocity near the sand particles surface is much smaller than the feed flow velocity and more than 30 of this velocity is smaller than 0 02 m h accounting for one tenth of the feed flow velocity 2 the efs decreases with the increase of feed flow velocity the critical flow velocity for a colloid with a size of 25 nm and the sand particle size of 0 4 mm is 0 0044 m h the efs induced by feed flow velocity at 0 2 m h is 1636 m2 m3 10 9 of the overall sand particles surface when the feed flow velocity is increased from 0 2 to 0 3 m h the efs is obtained to be 1264 m2 m3 equivalent to 8 4 of the total sand particles surface a further increase of feed flow velocity to 0 4 m h results in a further decrease in efs to 1023 m2 m3 accounting for 6 8 of the total sand particles surface 3 the increase in sand particle size results in a decline of efs the critical flow velocity shows a decreasing trend with the increasing of sand particle size 0 0056 0 0044 and 0 0035 m h obtained at particle size of 0 3 mm 0 4 mm and 0 5 mm respectively the decreasing tendency is attributed to the enhanced adhesive torque induced by the increase of sand particle size the efs is approximately 740 m2 m3 3 7 of the total particles surface of the 0 3 mm sand filter while the efs decreases to 487 m2 m3 when the sand particle size increases to 0 4 mm equivalent to 3 2 of the total sand particles surface a further increase of particle size to 0 5 mm resulted in a further decrease in efs to 300 m2 m3 2 5 of the total sand particles surface declaration of competing interest

17940,sand filtration is widely used in drinking water treatment processes yet the hydraulic fundamentals at particle scale are not well defined especially the fluid velocity profile near the sand particles surface in this study a numerical model is developed by combining the lattice boltzmann lbm and the discrete element method dem used to describe the fluid flow over the sand particles surface and the micro structure details of the sand packed bed respectively the model is validated by comparing the simulation results with the experimental measurements using two systems showing that the model can describe the fluid velocity distribution around the particles surface critical flow velocity is introduced as the balance between hydrodynamic and adhesive torques acting on sand particle surface furthermore a new concept effective filter surface efs is defined as the area where the velocity near sand particles surface is less than the critical flow velocity aiming for indirectly evaluating the performance of sand filtration it is quantitatively demonstrated that increasing the sand particle size or feed flow velocity results in the decrease of both critical flow velocity and efs under the given tested conditions the lbm dem model provides a useful tool for understanding the fundamentals of liquid flow distribution and also estimating sand filtration performance under different operation conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords lbm dem sand filtration drinking water treatment particle scale 1 introduction sand filtration is commonly used in drinking water treatment processes to remove suspended solids colloids and some pathogens like microbes and viruses the operation process of sand filtration is shown in fig 1 the raw water in the form of a suspension a two phase system containing fine particles in the fluid is fed from the top of a sand filter and circulates through a porous medium a packed bed of sand particles for water purification ncube et al 2018 in this process the turbidity of suspension is usually about 10 ntu nephelometric turbidity unit i e the colloid phase is very dilute sand particles are usually about 0 4 mm in diameter while colloids are generally less than 50 μm in diameter crittenden et al 2012 moreover the preferential flows and blind regions for filtering are easily formed during the filtration process chuah et al 2004 but the internal flow state is difficult to measure besides the sand filter efficiency can be estimated using semi empirical filtration models e g yao et al 1971 rajagopalan and tien 1976 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 although assisting with conceptual understanding these models are not very effective at quantitatively predicting the effluent turbidity because they are based on several assumptions including constant feed fluid velocity in the bed crittenden et al 2012 in general colloids in raw water can be removed in granular filters by two major mechanisms depending on the colloid size colloids larger than the void size estimated around 80 μm are mainly removed from the feed by straining colloids smaller than the void size are removed by attractive close range molecular forces such as van der waals forces when they contact and adsorb to the grains surface shen et al 2017 in drinking water treatment systems additional sedimentation process is firstly used to remove the colloids in a range of about 20 260 μm generated in coagulation and flocculation processes mueller et al 1967 located at the downstream of the sedimentation process the sand filtration is then used to remove some of the remaining colloids i e smaller than 50 μm crittenden et al 2012 thus adsorption is regarded as the dominant colloid removal mechanism in the sand filtration process although straining might occur at the upper layer of the sand bed the colloids adsorption is determined by the balance between hydrodynamic and adhesive torques acting between the colloids in the fluid and sand particles lee et al 2019b for example once the adhesive torque is larger than hydrodynamic torque the colloids are expected to adsorb on sand particles surface successfully otherwise detachment occurs alimi et al 2018 chemical e g ionic strength and ph and physical e g flow rate and hydraulic retention time properties of the fluid both can affect the balance between hydrodynamic and adhesive torques lee et al 2019a to improve the sand filtration process understanding the impact of hydrodynamic and adhesive torques between the suspension and sand particles is essential fluid flow velocity plays a dominant role in the torques balance bizhani and kuru 2018 proposed that the effective fluid velocity controlling the forces acting between the colloids and sand bed was identified at a distance less than one single sand diameter to estimate the adsorption or detachment of colloids understanding and quantifying the flow velocity heterogeneity typically within one sand diameter near the sand particles surface is important obtaining the flow velocity profile near the particles surface in a packed bed is a challenge even in a simple system many physical experiment techniques have been used to obtain fluid velocity distributions in the porous media e g laser doppler anemometry lda neumann et al 2009 particle image velocimetry piv li et al 2018b magnetic resonance imaging mri skuntz et al 2018 magnetic resonance velocimetry mrv reci et al 2018 and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr o neill et al 2016 furthermore more detailed experimental investigations on liquid flow velocity distributions in water saturated porous media e g bead packs were conducted by kutsovsky et al 1996 and wu et al 2016 however most of the experimental methods are limited to measure the fluid phase and cannot take into account detailed particle scale characterization for the sand filtration system as an alternative computational fluid dynamics cfd is an effective tool for studying fluid flow through porous media some previous modelling efforts have been made using continuum based models lu et al 2019 to describe the fluid phase in this environment gatica et al 2008 developed a well posed conforming mixed finite element method to explore the hydrodynamics for a porous medium entirely enclosed in the fluid phase raeini et al 2012 used a volume of fluid method to model fluid flow in porous media with a complex interface motion and irregular solid boundaries hassan et al 2013 utilised a eulerian method to simulate the transport and retention of nanoparticles in saturated porous media however the continuum based methods can only obtain the averaging variables at a grid scale level without the detailed information at particle scale thus the discrete element method dem a particle scale approach has attracted increasing attention to better characterise porous media dong et al 2006 moreover to resolve the fluid motion near the particle surface the dem is commonly coupled with cfd i e the cfd dem method based on the resolution of the fluid phase the cfd dem method is categorised into unresolved and resolved cfd dem methods using the former method huang et al 2014 investigated the fluid induced particles migration in granular filters the velocity distribution information near the particles surface heavily relies on the detailed description of fluid flow and particles which can form microscale gaps or discontinuities in the packed bed as a result the continuum based methods and unresolved cfd dem method cannot take into account such detailed information effectively for accurate analysis to resolve the fluid flow through porous media at particle scale and obtain an accurate velocity profile near the particles surface the cfd model needs to consider the resolved particle boundaries recently the lattice boltzmann method lbm rong et al 2013 offers a powerful tool to describe fluid transport phenomena as a resolved cfd method the lbm is based on the microscopic fluid fictitious particle models and mesoscopic kinetic equations where fluid fictitious particles representing packets of fluid are tracked through the computational domain thus the fluid particle interactions can be directly implemented by solving the collision of fluid and solid nodes near the particle surface moreover the simple and computationally efficient bounce back approach in the lbm can incorporate no slip walls with irregular geometries which makes the lbm an ideal method for simulating fluid flows in porous media across a wide range of scales peng et al 2016 for example sheikh and qiu 2018 investigated the pore scale velocity field and fluid solid interaction from a single particle to randomly packed mono sized porous media using lbm dem coupled model zhao et al 2018 simulated gas transport in a two dimensional 2d micro porous media reconstructed by a lbm at representative elementary volume rev scale li et al 2018a reported a 2d lbm dem framework to study saturated flow velocity characteristics in column leaching yamamoto and toda 2018 numerically investigated the fluid dynamics in a diesel filter by lbm where the bed structure was obtained by x ray ct overall lbm was found to be a useful tool to study the velocity fields in porous media at particle scale however few studies focussed on the application of lbm in sand filtration with a detailed review of the velocity profile near the sand particles surface moreover the particle scale velocity profile has not been used to make a connection with the colloids adsorption on the sand particles surface the objective of this work is therefore to study the fundamentals related to fluid flow near the particles surface under different conditions aiming to estimate the sand filtration performance the paper is structured as follows the integrated three dimensional 3d lbm dem model is introduced first by combining a single phase lbm model to simulate the flow field and a dem model to generate the packed sand particles the model is then validated by comparing the simulated flow profile and pressure drop with experimental data moreover the additional theoretical framework is developed including i critical flow velocity for evaluating the balance between hydrodynamic and adhesive torques acting on sand particle surface ii an effective filter surface efs concept for estimating the efficiency of sand filtration for the colloids adsorption finally the effects of feed flow velocity and sand particle size on flow velocity distribution near the sand particles surface and also efs are comprehensively studied the proposed approach will provide an effective tool to understand the local flow profile in sand filtration for estimating its performance 2 model details an integrated lbm dem model is developed and used to simulate the fluid flow in porous media for the sand filtration process in this model the lbm is used to describe fluid flow through the sand bed and the fluid velocity profile near the sand particles surface while the dem is used to generate the packed bed representing a scale down sand filter 2 1 lbm model in this study the suspension a mixture of water and the colloids in the sand filtration is considered as a single fluid phase since the velocity of the fluid is very slow i e about 0 3 m h and the size of colloids is small i e nano scale as a result the colloids follow fluid pathway and have a similar pattern to the near sand particles surface flow velocity distributions lukic et al 2005 the general descriptions of the lbm are well documented in the literature chen and doolen 1998 spaid and phelan 1997 in this study the lbm model mainly refers to the numerical treatments by warren 1997 which is briefly described below in the single bhatnagar gross krook bgk scheme the dynamics of a fluid particle distribution function f i at a lattice node r and time t with velocity v i in direction i are given by a collision step as 1 f i r t f i r t f i r t f i e q r t τ where τ is relaxation time and f i e q represents the pseudo equilibrium distribution function followed by a propagation step as 2 f i r c i t 1 f i r t generally τ determines the kinetic viscosity ν in a widely used class of models given by ν τ 0 5 3 0 eqs 1 and 2 can give the navier stokes equations by the correct choice of f i e q in a low mach number limit ladd 1994a once the distribution function is known the hydrodynamic variables such as the fluid density ρ and the momentum ρ u can be obtained 3 ρ i f i ρ u i f i c i a double relaxation time scheme introduced in the d3q15 model behrend et al 1994 is used to solve eqs 1 and 2 as shown in fig 2 this 3d model is based on a cubic lattice it possesses a rest fluid particle state with six links to the nearest and eight links to the next next nearest neighbours a quantity q i α β c i α c i β c s 2 δ α β is introduced in this model where α and β denote spatial indices and c s is the speed of sound in the present model the value c s is set as 1 3 therefore the pseudo equilibrium distribution function f i e q can be constructed as 4 f i e q r t ρ b ρ u α c i α b c s 2 ρ u α u ρ q i α β b c s 2 a double relaxation time scheme is implemented as efficiently as the above single relaxation time scheme the scheme calculates another weighted quantity s α β i ω i f i q i α β which is related to the pressure tensor by α β ρ c s 2 δ α β s α β then this quantity is relaxed towards its equilibrium value by s α β s α β s α β s α β e q τ for the n s equation which means s α β e q ρ u α u β therefore the post collision distribution function in eq 1 can be calculated as 5 f i x t ρ b ρ u α c i α b c s 2 s α β q i α β 2 b c s 4 compared to the single relaxation time scheme the double relaxation time scheme results in improved hydrodynamic behaviour since these two schemes take about the same number of floating point operations li et al 2016 2 2 dem model in the dem model the translational and rotational motions of particles are determined by newton s second law where the gravitational and interparticle forces are given by 6 m i d v i d t j f i j a f i j b f g 7 i i d ω i d t j r i j f i j b μ r r f i j a ω i ˆ where m i and i i denote the mass and moment of inertia of particle i respectively v i and ω i are the translational velocity and angular velocity respectively f g is the gravitational force r i j represents the vector from the centre of the particle i to the contact point with particle j μ r is the rolling friction coefficient and ω i ˆ ω i ω i f i j a and f i j b represent the normal and tangential contact forces as expressed by 8 f i j a n i j ˆ 2 y r ξ n 3 2 3 γ n y r ξ n v i j n i j ˆ 3 1 σ 2 9 f i j b μ r f i j a 1 1 m i n ξ s ξ s m a x ξ s m a x 3 2 ξ s ˆ 10 ξ s m a x μ s 2 σ 2 1 σ ξ n where r i and r j are the radius of particle i and j respectively y σ γ n and μ s are young s modulus poisson s ratio normal damping coefficient and sliding friction coefficient respectively r 2 r i r j r i r j n i j ˆ r i r j r i r j ξ s and ξ s ˆ are the magnitude of total tangential displacement during a contact and its unit vector respectively in this study the sand filter is treated as a pack of uniform spherical particles and simulated using the dem model this is because although the sand particles usually have a range of irregular shapes and generally present a size distribution the typical sphericity of a sand particle is found to be as high as 0 82 rorato et al 2019 which means that the sand shape is close to the sphere moreover the sand bed is usually processed as a media having uniform size as the uniformity allows the sand filter to operate at a higher hydraulic loading rate with lower head loss crittenden et al 2012 as a result uniform spherical particles are used to form the sand bed in this study such treatment of mono sized spherical particles was also used in the previous granular filtration studies hassan et al 2013 shen et al 2017 taghavijeloudar et al 2019 in addition the relatively long range inter particle forces can be neglected which include forces such as the van der waals capillary force and electrostatic forces since the fluid velocity in the sand filter is small the movement or interaction between sand particles can be neglected 2 3 coupling procedure the bounce back method wang et al 2019 is used for the treatment of bed boundaries and the one way coupling of dem and lbm when a dem spherical particle is considered in the lbm the lattice is divided into three categories i solid lattice which is fully contained within the discrete spherical particle ii outside lattice which belongs to the fluid iii interface lattice which intersects the boundary of discrete spherical particle fig 3 shows these three lattices categories in the ladd 1994b method the real surface of a discrete spherical particle is represented by the midpoint between two neighbouring solid and fluid nodes for a stationary boundary on a uniform lattice r f r s and r b are referred to as nodes on the fluid side solid side and boundary respectively the subscript i indicates the opposite direction to i thus the lbm dem method can be used to obtain the microscale velocity profile near the sand particles surfaces as 11 f i r b t 1 2 2 f i r f t f i r s t c i 3 theory development as previously mentioned in the introduction the fluid velocity plays a dominant role in determining the balance between hydrodynamic and adhesive torques the balance of torque is the key to determine the colloids adsorption and detachment behaviours in this section the fluid and particle denote the suspension and sand respectively a critical fluid velocity will be derived first and the resulting effective filter surface efs will be defined as an indicator for the sand filtration efficiency 3 1 critical flow velocity when the colloids in the fluid approaches the sand particles surface the comparison between hydrodynamic and adhesive torques is used to determine whether the colloids absorb to the sand particles surface i e adhesive torque is great than hydrodynamic torque or detach from the sand particles surface due to overwhelming hydrodynamic drag i e adhesive torque is less than hydrodynamic torque lee et al 2019b thus a critical fluid velocity can be expected for a given system with fixed chemical properties e g ionic strength ph and temperature where the hydrodynamic torque begins to surpass adhesive force as the fluid velocity near sand particle surface increases similar critical concepts have also been reported related to the fouling mechanisms in ultrafiltration kirschner et al 2019 and critical suspended particle size in granular filtration process qi 1998 briefly under laminar flow conditions the hydrodynamic torque t d acting on the attached colloid due to hydrodynamic shear is expressed as 12 t d 1 399 a c f d where a c is the adsorbed colloid radius and the constant 1 399 indicates that the drag force acts effectively on the deposited colloid at a distance of 1 399 a c from the particle surface f d is the drag force which is a combination of colloid radius fluid viscosity and fluid velocity at the centre between the adsorbed colloid and particle surface 13 f d 1 7005 6 π μ v c a c where the coefficient 1 7005 accounts for the wall effects near the particle surface the adhesive torque t a for the colloid adsorbed on the particle surface is represented by the net adhesive force f a acting on a lever arm l x as given below 14 t a f a l x the lever arm is provided by the radius of colloid surface contact which results from deformation of the colloid as 15 l x 4 f a a c k 1 3 where k is the composite young s modulus bergendahl and grasso 2003 employed value of k 4 0 109 n m2 for glass bead collectors used in the case of a polystyrene colloid suspension and the same value is used in the calculations herein the detailed procedure for calculating hydrodynamic and adhesive torques can be found in the previous work li et al 2005 gregory 1975 and gregory 1981 further electrostatic and van der waals interaction forces are used to calculate colloid particle interaction forces which become the source of adhesive torque the electrostatic interaction force f e per unit area between two parallel flat surfaces is calculated as follows 16 f e n k t 2 cosh y 1 k 2 d y d x 2 2 where n is the number of cations per unit volume k and t are the boltzmann s constant and fluid temperatures respectively y is the reduced potential at a distance x from the plane of the granular surface y z e ψ k t where e and ψ are the electron charge and potential respectively further k is debye huckel reciprocal length parameter y 2 e 2 n z 2 ε k t and ε is the permittivity of the fluid the van der waals interaction energy v s for an unequal sphere sphere system is expressed as d γ 4 π d a c 17 v s a a c a p 6 a c a p d 2 45 10 π γ d 2 17 60 π 2 γ d 2 0 59 280 π 3 γ d 3 where a p is the particle radius γ 100 nm is the decay length for the van der waals force d is the distance between the colloid and particle and a is hamaker constant for which the values of 3 8 10 21 and 6 8 10 21 j are used in the cases of the microsphere water glass system and the microsphere water quartz system respectively note that the value of the van der walls force is estimated as v s d torkzaban et al 2007 the equations used in this study are not appropriate for particle sizes smaller than about 2 μm and distances between the colloids and particles less than about 8 nm owing to the lack of a single expression for retarded intermolecular attraction 3 2 effective filter surface efs the effective filter surface efs is defined as the sand particle surface area where the fluid velocity is less than the critical flow velocity in this system the critical fluid velocity is expected for a given system with fixed chemical properties when the hydrodynamic torque is larger than the adhesive force as the fluid velocity near sand particle surface increases this efs thus represents an effective sand particle surface for the colloid adsorption and can be used for estimating the sand filtration performance the distance between fluid velocity and sand particle surface is less than one sand particle diameter due to the capability of lbm operating at the microscale the developed lbm dem model can provide a detailed velocity profile in the vicinity to sand particles surface and the percentage of fluid velocity where the value is less than critical flow velocity can be quantified this percentage also indirectly represents the percentage of total sand surfaces that can achieve the colloid adsorption the efs is defined as 18 efs p c t s s a n d v s a n d where pct is the percentage of fluid velocity less than critical flow velocity s s a n d and v s a n d are the surface area and volume of a sand particle respectively 4 simulation conditions in the present study a packed bed of uniform spherical particles is used for representing a sand filter fig 4 shows the schematic diagram of the simulation domain the walls of the computational domain are set as periodic boundary condition which allows those particles that are cut off at lateral walls to be properly reintroduced into the computational domain and guarantee a regular geometry the fluid flow is along the vertical direction geometric parameters and simulation conditions investigated in the base case are listed in table 1 to study the fluid velocity distributions around the particles surface and make the computational cost affordable an elementary volume element with a 3 3 mm cross section and 24 mm in length as scale down sand filter is chosen to simulate the depth filtration system as a demonstration of the efs concept the number of sand particles is 1500 three typical sand particle sizes i e 0 3 mm 0 4 mm and 0 5 mm in diameter are chosen the fluid density ρ and kinematic viscosity ν are 1000 kg m3 and 10 6 m2 s respectively τ as the relaxation time for convergence is given three different values i e τ 0 8 0 53 and 0 503 giving rise to a broad range of feed flow velocities moreover three different feed flow velocities 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m h covering a wide range of operation conditions for the conventional sand filter are used in summary a scale down sand filtration system is simulated to help reveal the fundamental insights about the particle scale velocity profile within the sand filter 5 model validation the model is validated with experimental data in two systems fluid flow over an isolated particle and fluid flow through a packed bed 5 1 flow over one isolated sphere fluid flow passing an isolated sphere is a classical problem with many experimental data and is often used for model validation the present model is first applied to a system of fluid flow over an isolated particle in an experimental study schlichting and gersten 2000 note that such particle scale measurement cannot be obtained in industry scale sand filtration but available in some fundamental physical experiments using one single particle as illustrated in fig 5 the simulated drag coefficients are decreased from about 10 5 to 1 0 when the reynolds number re is increased from 10 3 to 102 in a laminar flow field moreover the simulation results are comparable with the measurement in this case the simulation result of drag coefficient is also found to be comparable to some previous empirical correlations i e stokes 1851 dallavalle 1948 and clift et al 1978 details about this case can be found in supplementary material 5 2 flow through a packed bed the model is then applied to two packed beds for further validation in terms of pressure drop and velocity distribution simulation conditions are listed in supplementary material the pressure drop is an important parameter to assess to appropriately design operate and manage filters in a sustainable and energy efficient way duran ros et al 2009 pressure drop induced by fluid flow through a randomly packed granular filter configured with different sphere shaped granular media can be measured in previous experimental studies by bové et al 2015 the system is simulated using the lbm dem model developed in this study as illustrated in fig 6 the simulated pressure drop through filters is almost linearly increased with the feed flow velocities and is comparable with the experimental measurements indicating the accuracy of the lbm dem model in simulating the fluid flow through sphere filters however the lbm dem model can capture the pressure drop for the packed bed of spherical particles but not non spherical particles this model is more suitable for spherical particles and the shape and surface roughness of granular not considered in the present model have been proposed to have significant impact on pressure drop through the granular filter by bové et al 2015 the model is applied to another packed bed in the experiment conducted by wu et al 2016 as shown in fig 7 the flow velocity distributions in packed bed calculated by the lbm dem model are comparable to the experimental results measured using phase contrast mri under three inlet flow velocities i e 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 l min indicating that the model can accurately predict the flow distributions in packed bed systems under different conditions 6 results and discussion in this section the fluid flow patterns at microscale are explored and discussed based on a typical sand filtration system the effects of feed flow velocity and sand particle size on efs are also studied 6 1 hydraulic performance the sand filtration system with an average sand particle size of 0 4 mm operated at an average feed flow velocity of 0 3 m h is simulated as the baseline scenario fig 8 shows the velocity contour and vector the distributions of bulk velocity and velocity near the sand particles surface respectively as seen in fig 8a the local flow velocity varies across the entire bed the preferential flows red vectors and blind regions dark blue vectors can be observed the underlying pore structure of porous media primarily leads to the unique velocity distributions although fluid flow conditions also play a role de anna et al 2017 to further explore the reasons of the velocity distributions the pore structure of the sand filter is quantified in terms of effective throat diameter which is defined as the diameter of a circle with an equal to that of the void space in a face of the delaunay cell considered yang et al 2006 the non uniform distributed void spaces and the related effective throat diameters in the sand filter are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9a the void spaces of the whole sand filter vary from 0 04 to 1 0 mm3 the component 0 06 0 08 mm3 accounts for nearly 75 of the entire void spaces the void space information is obtained by voronoi tessellation with an open source program developed by rycroft 2009 fig 9b shows the distributions of the effective diameter of a pore throat ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mm the sharp peak of the effective diameter distributions located around 0 13 0 15 mm corresponds to the throats formed by contact or near contact sands the zoomed in image shows that the local maxima of velocity are found in the middle between the pores the average flow velocity in the simulated sand bed is found to be 0 5 m h which 1 7 times the feed flow velocity fig 8b and c show the statistic distributions of bulk flow velocity in pores and the near sand particles surface flow velocity the bulk flow velocity in this baseline scenario is in the range of 0 1 0 m h the percentage of bulk flow velocity decreases with the increase of flow velocity a peak is observed at the flow velocity of 0 3 m h equivalent to the feed flow velocity contrastingly the fluid velocity near the sand particles surface is in a smaller range 0 0 4 m h more than 30 of the flow velocity near the sand particles surface is smaller than 0 02 m h and the percentage is found to decrease rapidly for higher flow velocities the developed lbm dem model statistically describes the velocity map in the sand filtration moreover the model demonstrates the distributions near the sand particles surface velocity accounting about one tenth of the feed flow velocity which can be hardly obtained by conventional experimental tools detailed velocity distributions information can be found in table s4 supplementary material as another important parameter for a sand filtration system the pressure is also studied as shown in fig 10 the pressure is found to unevenly distributed in the whole bed although the pressure at cross section is not uniformly distributed a declining trend along the fluid flow direction through the filter depth is observed fig 10a the average pressure at the cross section decreases at a slope of approximately 0 057 pa mm δp fig 10b at the macroscopic level and the limit of creeping flow regimes the pressure gradient δp and the flow rate have a linear relation known as darcy s law δ p μ k u where μ and u are viscosity and superficial velocity respectively the proportionality constant k is the permeability of the medium calculated to be 2 57 m s the value is involved in the reasonable range of sand filtration and indicates that the scale down sand filter generated by dem is pervious 6 2 effects of operating parameters on efs 6 2 1 feed flow velocity three typical feed flow velocities i e 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m h covering a wide range of conventional sand filtration operation conditions hayward et al 2019 are studied to reveal the effects of feed flow velocities on efs for understanding the association between fluid velocity and sand filtration performance the sand filter is configured with 0 4 mm diameter sand particles schijven et al 2013 fig 11 a shows the bulk flow velocity distributions for the three feed flow velocities the average bulk flow velocity increases from 0 37 to 0 60 m h with the increase of feed flow velocity from 0 2 to 0 4 m h the peak percentage of bulk flow velocity is observed at the value of feed flow velocity for all three cases accounting 7 5 4 6 and 5 1 respectively while the percentage of bulk flow velocity below 0 5 m h is 77 8 for the case of 0 2 m h which 1 2 times of that obtained for 0 3 m h and 1 4 times of that obtained 0 4 m h respectively the results indicate that the main velocity component is 0 0 5 m h regardless of the variation of feed flow velocity but the percentage decreases with the increased feed flow velocity fig 11b shows the distributions of velocity near the sand particles surface the average near the sand particles surface velocity increases from 0 08 to 0 15 m h with the increase of feed flow velocities from 0 2 to 0 4 m h at flow velocity lower than 0 16 m h the percentage of flow velocity near the sand particles surface induced by lower feed flow velocity is higher an opposite trend is obtained at flow velocity higher than 0 16 m h the results indicate that increasing feed flow velocity induces a decrease of the value of velocity component near the sand particles surface detailed velocity distributions information can be found in table s5 and table s6 supplementary material the critical flow velocity for 0 4 mm sand particle to adsorb the bacteriophage ms2 virus 25 nm keller et al 2004 is calculated to be 0 0044 m h using eqs 12 17 fig 11c shows the efs induced by different feed flow velocities the efs of 0 4 mm sand filter induced by 0 2 m h feed flow velocity is 1636 m2 m3 10 9 of the overall sand particles surface based on the eq 18 when the feed flow velocity increases from 0 2 to 0 3 m h the efs obtained is 1264 m2 m3 equivalent to 8 4 of the total sand particles surface a further increase of feed flow velocity to 0 4 m h results in a further decrease in efs to 1023 m2 m3 accounting for 6 8 of the total sand particles surface increased feed flow velocity results in smaller efs owing to the decreased percentage of near sand particle surface velocity where the value is less than the critical flow velocity the result is consistent with many experimental works where the smaller feed flow velocity resulted in a higher colloid removal efficiency in sand filtration gude et al 2018 perez vidal et al 2019 this indicates that the lbm dem model and efs concept can reproduce the key phenomena and tendency observed in practice and explain the underlying mechanism of the effect of feed flow velocity using detailed microscale information for example the velocity distributions near the sand particles surface 6 2 2 sand particle size three sand filtration systems with three sand particle sizes i e 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 mm at a feed flow velocity of 0 3 m h are studied for understanding the impact of sand particle size on filtration performance fig 12 shows fluid velocity distributions of bulk flow velocity and near sand particles surface velocity as seen in fig 12a the percentage of bulk flow velocity for the three filters all peak at the flow velocity of 0 3 m h equivalent to the feed flow velocity however the percentage of the high velocity component increases with the rise of sand particle size due to the larger void spaces for same volume filter filled with bigger sand particles the peak value decreases from 9 85 to 4 47 when the sand particle size increases from 0 3 to 0 5 mm with the increase of sand particle size from 0 3 to 0 4 mm the percentage of bulk flow velocity below 0 3 m h the feed flow velocity decreases from 41 1 to 33 2 however only a 2 0 decrease in bulk flow velocity is obtained when the sand particle size increases from 0 4 to 0 5 mm also a slight change is obtained in the bulk flow distributions above 0 5 m h for the three filters the results indicate that the average bulk flow velocity increases with the decrease of sand particle size fig 12b shows the near sand particles surface velocity distributions the peak of near sand particles surface fluid velocity is observed at 0 011 and 0 014 m h for sand size of 0 3 and 0 4 mm accounting 4 8 and 6 2 respectively in contrast a uniform decease trend can be found for the sand particle size of 0 5 mm at flow velocity lower than about 0 20 m h the percentage of flow velocity near the sand particles surface induced by a smaller size is higher an opposite trend is obtained at flow velocity higher than 0 20 m h the previous results indicate that the sand particle size has an important effect on the velocity distributions which is related to the variation of void spaces in sand filters with different particle sizes detailed velocity distributions information can be seen from table s7 and table s8 supplementary material the critical flow velocity shows a decreasing trend with the increase of sand particle size with 0 0056 0 0044 and 0 0035 m h obtained at sizes of 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 mm respectively the decrease in critical flow velocity owes to the enhanced adhesive torque induced by increased sand particle size lee et al 2019b fig 12c shows the efs induced by different sand particle sizes the efs is approximately 740 m2 m3 3 7 of the total surface of the 0 3 mm sand filter the efs decreases to 487 5 m2 m3 when the size increases to 0 4 mm equivalent to 3 2 of the total sand particles surface a further increase of particle size to 0 5 mm results in a further decrease in efs to 300 m2 m3 2 5 of the total sand particles surface the decreasing trend of efs is caused by the declining percentage of near sand particles surface velocity where the value is less than the critical flow velocity the result is in agreement with the trend predicted by the fundamental filtration model developed by rajagopalan and tien 1976 and other experimental works aronino et al 2009 where the filter efficiency decreases with the increase of granule size it indicates the developed model and efs concept can provide the same tendency observed in the experiments and explain the underlying mechanism of the effects of sand particle size based on the particle scale velocity distributions information 7 discussion in this section the model applicability and efs functionality are summarized the developed lbm dem model can describe the velocity map in sand filtration at particle scale the critical flow velocity and efs are proposed and used to quantitatively estimate the sand filtration performance the fluid velocity plays a key role in determining the colloids adsorption the developed lbm dem model can capture and quantitatively assess the bulk and near sand particles surface velocity profiles under different conditions including two important operational parameters i e feed flow velocity and sand particle size these particle scale velocity profiles are associated with sand filtration performance by the newly proposed parameters critical flow velocity and efs the critical flow velocity is operated near the sand particle surface typically within one sand diameter while the efs is the area where the fluid velocity near sand particle surface is less than the critical flow velocity these values can hardly be obtained by experimental or conventional simulation methods several semi empirical filtration models have been widely used in granular filtration process for estimating the filtration performance however all these models are limited in quantitatively predicting the filtration efficiency due to the assumptions of no change in parameters such as fluid velocity crittenden et al 2012 the fluid velocity is usually heterogeneously distributed in the whole sand filter assuming the fluid velocity as constant for the entire sand filtration process is a simple assumption and may weaken these models accuracy comparing with these models the efs can indeed reproduce the tendencies of key variables feed flow velocity and sand particle size on sand filtration efficiency and the efs can quantitatively estimate the sand filtration performance based on statistical velocity distributions near the sand particles surface without assuming fluid velocity as a constant the 3d lbm dem model provides a cost effective tool for visualising the complex fluid pathway around the sand particles and fundamentally understanding the effect of key variables on the fluid velocity distributions near particle surfaces in the opaque filtration system moreover the proposed particle scale model can help resolve the underlying fundamental mechanism providing the theoretical basis for the mesoscopic or macroscopic model study of the real sand filtration process note that two major assumptions are applied in this study firstly the suspension a mixture of water and colloids in the sand filtration is a single fluid phase the sand filter is considered as packing of smooth uniform spherical particles the velocity of the fluid in sand filtration is slow i e about 0 3 m h and the size of the colloids is small i e nano scale as a result the colloids follow fluid pathway and have a similar pattern to the near sand particles surface flow velocity distributions while the sand bed is usually of high sphericity and sieved for greater uniformity the two major assumptions are also used in previous studies hassan et al 2013 shen et al 2017 taghavijeloudar et al 2019 particle scale modelling of the complexities associated with the real filtration systems e g wide variations in sand particle shape size distribution and surface roughness is very computational demanding under the present hardware and software conditions and will need further efforts which is beyond the scope of this study 8 conclusions in this study an integrated lbm dem model is developed for describing the microscopic flow distributions through the sand filter aiming to understand the hydraulic fundamentals and estimate the sand filtration performance under various conditions the model is validated with experimental data about fluid dynamics in one single particle and two packed bed systems subsequently the model is used to study a scaled down sand filter with an average sand particle size of 0 4 mm operated at feed flow velocity of 0 3 m h as a baseline scenario the effects of different operation conditions i e feed flow velocity and sand particle size on sand filtration performance are thoroughly investigated the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 preferential flows and blind regions exist due to the non uniform distributed void spaces and pore structures in the sand filter the maximum local value of velocity is near the middles of the pores under the given simulation conditions the average flow velocity in the sand bed is found to be nearly two times the feed flow velocity the percentage of bulk flow velocity decreases with the increase of flow velocity but a peak observed at the feed flow velocity meanwhile the flow velocity near the sand particles surface is much smaller than the feed flow velocity and more than 30 of this velocity is smaller than 0 02 m h accounting for one tenth of the feed flow velocity 2 the efs decreases with the increase of feed flow velocity the critical flow velocity for a colloid with a size of 25 nm and the sand particle size of 0 4 mm is 0 0044 m h the efs induced by feed flow velocity at 0 2 m h is 1636 m2 m3 10 9 of the overall sand particles surface when the feed flow velocity is increased from 0 2 to 0 3 m h the efs is obtained to be 1264 m2 m3 equivalent to 8 4 of the total sand particles surface a further increase of feed flow velocity to 0 4 m h results in a further decrease in efs to 1023 m2 m3 accounting for 6 8 of the total sand particles surface 3 the increase in sand particle size results in a decline of efs the critical flow velocity shows a decreasing trend with the increasing of sand particle size 0 0056 0 0044 and 0 0035 m h obtained at particle size of 0 3 mm 0 4 mm and 0 5 mm respectively the decreasing tendency is attributed to the enhanced adhesive torque induced by the increase of sand particle size the efs is approximately 740 m2 m3 3 7 of the total particles surface of the 0 3 mm sand filter while the efs decreases to 487 m2 m3 when the sand particle size increases to 0 4 mm equivalent to 3 2 of the total sand particles surface a further increase of particle size to 0 5 mm resulted in a further decrease in efs to 300 m2 m3 2 5 of the total sand particles surface declaration of competing interest

17941,proper granular activated carbon gac selection could improve the performance of biological activated carbon bac filters through a combination of adsorption and biodegradation while the gacs used in bac filters are now mainly selected according to adsorption function ignoring biodegradation in this study sand filter effluent obtained from a drinking water treatment plant was fed into continuous flow bench scale bac columns operated in parallel over 245 days to examine the effects of gac pore size distribution on bac filter performance in terms of the dissolved organic carbon doc and disinfection byproduct dbp precursors a metagenomic analysis indicated that bacterial community structure played an important role in bac filter performance a significant correlation was found between metabolism related proteins and the volume of micro level macropores based on metaproteomic analysis it is suggested that the adsorption saturation was dynamic and that adsorption played a role in the performance of the bac filters throughout the 245 day operating period renewed adsorption capacity or bioregeneration was driven by bacterial metabolic activity such activity largely depended on the organic matter adsorbed by the gac in which micro level macropores especially those with diameters of 0 2 10 μm played an important but previously unrecognized role the results suggest that more attention should be paid to well developed pores and pore size distribution in the production and selection of gac used for full scale drinking water biofilters graphical abstract image 1 keywords granular activated carbon biological activated carbon filter bacterial community structure micro level macropore pore size 1 introduction activated carbon ac is formed by carbonization and activation under high temperatures it has a massive surface area a well developed pore structure and excellent adsorption ability its adsorption effectiveness is determined by the volume of well developed pores and the pore size distribution relative to the molecular weight mw of organic matter karanfil and kilduff 1999 nowotny et al 2007 natural organic matter nom adsorption primarily occurs in mesopores and large micropores hsieh and teng 2000 lorenc grabowska and gryglewicz 2005 the mw fraction 5 kda of natural organic matter nom is readily adsorbed by gac gibert et al 2013 moore et al 2001 velten et al 2011a a gac filter eventually turns into a biological activated carbon bac filter after several months operation bac filters remove organic pollutants hozalski et al 1999 and inorganic nutrients including ammonia andersson et al 2001 phosphorus altmann et al 2016 and metals cerrato et al 2010 from water not only through adsorption but also through microbial degradation typically the ac used in gac filters are selected according to its adsorption functions as reflected by either its iodine or methylene value bac filters are widely used in drinking water treatment plants dwtps and the required iodine value of gac used in such filters must exceed 950 mg g cj t 345 2010 2011 in chinese dwtps after 3 7 years of operation although the iodine values of gac dwindle to less than 450 mg g the effluent potassium permanganate index codmn of bac filters remains around 1 2 mg l gao 2018 liu et al 2011 xu et al 2017 the iodine value of gac in dwtps decreases significantly to 60 of its initial value in the first two months though this decrease slows between the third and twelfth months due to biofilm growth liu et al 2017a therefore microbial activity in bac filters could extend the service life of gac through in situ biological regeneration of sorption sites dejonge et al 1996 speitel and digiano 1987 although the rate of bioregeneration of sorption sites is slow it occurs within the typical service life of gac in practical applications speitel and digiano 1987 two widely accepted mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the bioregeneration process are the concentration gradient mechanism which effects the biodegradation of organic matter following desorption due to the concentration gradient between the ac surface and bulk liquid dejonge et al 1996 kim et al 1997 and extracellular enzyme reactions which occur inside meso and macropores extracellular enzymes secreted by bacteria or enzymes released through cell disintegration interact with the adsorbed organic matter resulting in its release from the adsorption site and utilization by microbes thus the ac regains some of its adsorption capacity kim et al 1997 sirotkin et al 2001 whatever the mechanism it is clear that microbial activities regenerate the adsorption capacity of gac and drive bac filter performance ac pores are divided into micropores 2 nm in diameter mesopores 2 50 nm and macropores 50 nm according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the smaller pores are too small for bacteria to enter 1 2 μm 0 5 μm walker and weatherley 1998 and the most suitable pore size range for microbial attachment on the surfaces of ac particles is thought to be 2 5 μm wang et al 1995 therefore gac selected for bac filters should not only have both micro and mesopores to guarantee a sufficiently high adsorption capacity but also macropores to allow for bacterial adhesion at present the selection of ac for bac filters is based only on iodine or methylene values that indicate the presence of micropores or some mesopores but these methods do not indicate the presence of macropores the effect of macropores on bac filter performance has generally been neglected therefore it is worth investigating whether ac selection solely based on adsorption is the most suitable approach for bac filters employed in bac or o3 bac treatments in dwtps the biodegradation of organic matter mainly depends on the microbial biomass growth rate and community structure gagnon and huck 2001 oh et al 2018 the availability of nutrients and carbon boon et al 2011 li et al 2010 pang and liu 2006 and the operational conditions e g preozonation temperature backwashing the filter characteristics and the contact time affect the microbial biomass and community structure kasuga et al 2007 moll and summers 1999 moll et al 1998 oh et al 2018 yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2010a among these factors the filter is the primary component of the biofilm treatment and plays an important role in water purification most filters have porous structures that facilitate microbial propagation and growth e g the commercial gac picabiol 2 jacobi carbons sweden was specifically manufactured with a pore size 50 nm to favor bacterial growth mercier et al 2014 as some studies have suggested that bac performance is not necessarily correlated with biomass concentration boon et al 2011 emelko et al 2006 optimizing the microbial community structure in a bac filter and increasing the microbial metabolic ability may be the most effective means of improving the ability of bac or o3 bac treatments to degrade organic matter although gac is an ideal candidate biofilter carrier very few studies have explored the relationship between gac pore size distribution characteristics and the bacterial community composition or metabolism in bac filters zhang et al 2010b understanding this relationship could facilitate the identification of suitable gac for bac or o3 bac treatments and thus improve the performance of bac filters this study investigated four different types of gac to better understand the effect of pore size distribution characteristics on bac filter performance in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc and disinfection byproduct dbp precursors the combined use of metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses could provide a clearer picture of the effect of bacterial activity on bac filter performance in addition the most suitable pore sizes and structures for gac used in bac filters were explored providing theoretical guidelines for the production and selection of gac used in bac or o3 bac treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the chemicals and reagents used in the study are described in the

virgin gacs to reach adsorption saturation quickly the gacs were present in low concentrations of 200 mg l the uv254 and mw distribution patterns were recorded at 1 7 12 24 and 36 h and the gac was considered to be saturated after 24 h under constant uv254 removal next a detached bacterial suspension as in the biodegradation tests was added to each adsorption experiment this allowed the

microplate reader molecular devices sunnyvale ca usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 ac characteristics ac adsorption performance is largely dependent on pore structure and chemical surface characteristics along with characteristics of the adsorbate karanfil et al 1999 moore et al 2001 the performances of four bac columns operated in parallel with different gacs and the same influent were compared to investigate the pore structure and chemical surface characteristics of the gacs the pore volume distribution characteristics of the four gacs used in this experiment are shown in fig s5 the most suitable pore size range for microbial attachment on the surfaces of ac particles is regarded to be 2 5 μm wang et al 1995 as bacteria are too large to enter smaller pores walker and weatherley 1998 the smallest bacterial particles had sizes of 200 nm which falls within the size range corresponding to gac macropores therefore ideal macropores for bacterial activity should be micron sized i e micro level macropores pores with d 200 nm were further divided into those with d of 0 2 10 μm 10 100 μm and 100 μm in the present study of which pores with diameters of 0 2 10 μm and 100 μm were called micro level macropores a and b respectively the pore volumes of the four gacs were mainly concentrated in the micropore and micro level macropore a and b ranges table 1 fig s5 ac11 had the highest volume of micropores 0 45 ml g and micro level macropore bs 0 427 ml g and the lowest volume of micro level macropore as 0 138 ml g on the other hand ac9 had the lowest volume of micropores 0 14 ml g and micro level macropore bs 0 118 ml g and the highest volume of micro level macropore as 0 265 ml g surface functional groups sfg of acs were determined through xps analysis and at least three forms of c can be found fig s6 the characteristic bands occurring in graphite or aromatic compounds sfg1 284 79 ev phenols ethers or hydroxylic groups sfg2 286 ev and carboxylic groups sfg3 288 89 ev can be found in fig s6 the content of the surface functional groups and elemental composition of the acs are listed in table 2 the sp2 hybridized type of c 284 79 ev graphitic aromatic carbon was dominant in the structures of the ac samples the hydroxylic and carboxylic structures of chemically treated wood based ac11 were slightly more numerous than those of other acs and the oxygen content 14 91 and o c value 0 16 of ac11 were also significantly higher than those of other coal based acs with thermal treatments table 2 it was found that the chemical treatment of wood based acs increased the number of acidic surface functional groups which was in agreement with previous studies julien et al 1998 aktas and cecen 2006 some studies suggested that acidic oxygen containing functional groups increased surface polarity and reduced the adsorption of hydrophobic organic contaminants by gac karanfil et al 1999 franz et al 2000 therefore the adsorption capacity of thermally treated coal based acs would be relatively higher than that of chemically treated wood based acs this finding was further supported by the adsorption capacity of gacs determined through freundlich isotherm experiments fig s3 the k f adsorption capacity values of ac11 1 21 and ac9 1 33 were lower than those of ac10 1 96 and ac12 1 77 table s3 indicating that the coal based ac10 and ac12 exhibited higher adsorption capacities despite ac11 s higher micropore volume 0 45 ml g therefore surface chemistry characteristics played a more important role in adsorption than pore distribution characteristics 3 2 bac filter performance in terms of doc and dbp formation potential 3 2 1 doc and mw distribution the parallel bench scale bac columns operated for 245 days and the influent doc concentrations measured in the sand filter effluent ranged from 1 8 to 3 5 mg l fig 2 after continuous operation over 200 days the bac columns reached a steady state based on the doc removal and biomass accumulation results fig 2 the bac columns achieved removed up to 37 87 of doc during the first two weeks after which doc removal performance declined and finally remained stable removing 38 54 of doc after 200 operational days the biomass attached to the gac particles gradually accumulated during the first 135 days then remained mature and stable the initial iodine values of ac9 ac12 was 650 950 1000 and 1050 mg g respectively which correlated with the volume of micropores r2 0 82 table s1 and fig s7 the iodine values gradually decreased with operation time and approximately 28 4 35 8 of the initial iodine values were lost after 220 days of operation however the rate of decrease differed over time fig s7 in the first 145 days the iodine values decreased by approximately 20 29 then the decrease slowed 4 5 i e the decreasing iodine value trend line assumed a more gentle slope finally the iodine values of each respective ac decreased to 450 680 670 and 674 mg g fig s7 the doc removal and biomass results along with the iodine values showed that biological regeneration of adsorption sites occurred due to the mature biofilm on the gac surface after 135 days therefore doc removal using bac filters involves both adsorption and biodegradation and adsorption plays a dynamic role throughout the long term operation of bac columns previous studies found that the iodine blue value was low 118 450 mg g after operation for 3 7 years in some full scale dwtps in china and the effluent codmn of bac filters could be controlled to remain at approximately 1 2 mg l gao 2018 liu et al 2011 xu et al 2017 this is as a result of the biological activity in bac filters which has the potential to extend the service life of these devices through in situ bioregeneration of gac sorption sites speitel and digiano 1987 leong et al 2018 smolin et al 2020 yapsakli and cecen 2010 the average doc concentration of the influent was 2 36 mg l and the average effluent doc concentrations of bac 10 1 07 mg l and bac 12 1 13 mg l were lower than those of bac 9 1 46 mg l and bac 11 1 45 mg l the bacterial concentration hpc in bac 11 was 10 50 times higher than those in the other bac columns at 200 245 days fig 2 this indicates that the proportion of doc removed in bac 11 was not the highest despite this bac s having highest biomass suggesting that the bacterial concentration may not the determining factor of doc removal in bac treatments lautenschlager et al 2014 investigated the microbial community compositions and abundances of three different biofilter types and found that biomass was present in the same concentrations in all of the filters however the microbial taxa and metabolisms differed considerably between the filter types which could have contributed to their differing doc removal performance oh et al 2018 also indicated that bacterial community structure and metabolic capacity contributed to doc removal in the biofiltration treatment of full scale dwtps through metagenomic analysis in this case following metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis was performed to uncover the influence of bacterial activity on doc removal from the perspective of bacterial community structure and metabolism the main dom fractions of the influent ranged from 1 6 to 8 6 kd and 0 4 1 6 kd based on mw distributions fig s8 a comparison of the reduction in total area as a percentage and separated fractions between the influent and effluent are listed in table 3 for doc with a mw of 0 4 1 6 kd the mean removal rate of bac filtration was 11 3 25 0 the mean proportion of total doc with a mw of 1 6 8 6 kd removed ranged from 2 5 to 12 7 the mean proportion of doc with a mw of 0 15 0 4 kd removed ranged from 5 2 to 9 5 while only 3 9 6 1 of doc with a mw 0 15 kd was removed the mean total area reduction of the four bac filter columns was approximately 23 2 53 0 26 5 and 41 9 which was within the 37 2 54 3 doc removal range of the bench scale bac filter columns it was found that after 220 days of operation the doc fraction with a mw 0 4 1 6 kd was removed the highest rate among the fractions 3 2 2 dbp formation potential the concentration of total dbp formation potential dbpfp in influent water samples was 389 44 555 61 and 865 29 μg l on operation days 45 145 and 220 respectively fig 3 the 19 targeted dbpfps were detected in the bac effluent with concentrations ranging from non detectable nd to 217 43 μg l table s4 the formation potentials of regulated haa5 and thms in influent water samples ranged from 123 23 to 145 11 μg l and from 231 57 to 632 38 μg l respectively fig 3 accounting for 24 03 4 82 and 66 72 3 96 of the total dbpfps this indicated that thms were the largest classes of dbpfps in this study previous studies found that thms and haas were the two most prevalent classes of dbps present in treated drinking water fu et al 2017 krasner et al 1989 roberts et al 2002 the average concentrations of n dbps formation potentials in influent samples ranged from 23 87 to 86 89 μg l fig 3 accounting for 8 48 1 20 of the total dbpfps the average removal of haa5fp and thmfp was 47 81 3 83 and 58 17 10 17 62 31 7 93 and 82 79 5 20 48 47 7 78 and 47 32 9 88 and 59 27 6 61 and 76 79 7 45 in bac 9 bac 10 bac 11 and bac 12 respectively these were lower than or close to those of the respective total dbpfp removal the average removal of n dbpfps were 74 69 5 41 83 31 5 26 66 35 11 77 and 82 61 6 16 in bac 9 bac 10 bac 11 and bac 12 respectively these were higher than that of the respective total dbpfp in summary bac 9 and bac 11 reduced the total dbpfps by 57 06 7 56 and 50 42 7 37 while bac 10 and bac 12 had a higher dbpfp removal of 78 01 3 78 and 73 09 5 26 respectively 3 3 metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis knowledge of the microbial communities in bac filters could improve our understanding of the related biological processes oh et al 2018 rittmann 2006 velten et al 2011a several researchers have addressed differences in biofilter microbial communities related to water quality li et al 2010 liao et al 2013 temperature kaarela et al 2015 operational conditions nemani et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and filter medium type lautenschlager et al 2014 vignola et al 2017 for example lautenschlager et al 2014 found that in biofilters with similar bacterial community structures the corresponding abundances of bacterial taxa e g relative abundance of proteobacteria differed by filter medium type e g gac 74 2 rapid sand filter 54 slow sand filter 45 however limited information is available on the impact of gac properties such as porosity chemistry and adsorption capacity on microbial community structures and functions vignola et al 2017 lautenschlager et al 2014 the hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the wood based bac 11 sample was distinct from the other coal based bac samples and among the coal based bac samples two samples taken from bac 10 and bac 12 were closely clustered compared to the sample taken from bac 9 fig 4 which indicated that the bacterial community seemed to cluster according to filter material the wood based bac 11 sample was distinctive compared to other coal based bac samples because the surface polarity of the wood based ac was higher than those of the coal based acs table 2 the chemical properties of coal based acs are similar thus differences in the hierarchical clustering bacterial communities in coal based bac samples could be attributed to differences in pore size structure for example ac 10 and ac 12 had similar micropore volumes while ac 9 had the lowest micropore volume table 1 and gac adsorption is affected most strongly by micropore volume hsieh and teng 2000 lorenc grabowska and gryglewicz 2005 further given the relationship between organic matter concentrations and micropore volume thus organic matter concentrations played an essential role in determining differences in the bacterial communities of coal based bac samples alpha proteobacteria were the most abundant class 65 5 relative abundance identified in bac filters that have been reported to be competitive under low nutrient concentrations and to be capable of degrading complex organic compounds newton et al 2011 liao et al 2013 lautenschlager et al 2014 at the genus level the differences between the bac samples were more evident the bac 11 filter contained mostly gemmata 19 while the other biofilters were dominated by sphingomonas 17 24 belnapia 18 22 and unclassified c alphaproteobacteria 10 14 fig 4 the genus belnapia dominated in bac 10 18 and bac 12 22 but was less abundant in bac 9 5 the genus gemmata is capable of utilizing organic matter and nitrogen in lake and wastewater treatment plants wwtps bae et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 the genus sphingomonas is common in bac filters in dwtps it is able to degrade different kinds of organic matter and is a common kind of heterotrophic bacteria jeong et al 2017 liu et al 2017b a functional annotation of all metagenomic reads revealed that metabolic pathways were abundant but differed according to the bacterial communities of the bac filters fig 5 first hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that coal based bac 10 and bac 12 were closely related to coal based bac 9 in contrast to the relatively distant relationship between the coal based bacs and wood based bac 11 which further supported the classification based on hierarchical clustering of bacterial communities at the genus level this analysis also indicated that the ac properties played an important role in shaping the bacterial community composition and function notably the metabolism function pathways level 1 in kegg were the most abundant 41 4 carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism global and overview maps and energy metabolism the subfunctional categories of metabolism were particularly enriched in the bac filters fig 5 for example the relative reads of carbohydrate metabolism pathways in the bac 9 bac 12 columns represented 9 1 7 9 7 2 and 8 4 of the total the number of relative reads regarding amino acid metabolism were 9 0 7 7 6 2 and 8 5 respectively however the functional annotation of metabolic pathways does not reveal which micro organisms are potentially responsible for major functions such as carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism because different microorganisms have diverse catabolic abilities and pathways for substrates newton et al 2011 to address this the bacteria s encoded relative contribution to metabolic functions were examined fig 6 as expected this analysis suggested that the functional capabilities of different bacteria are distinct for example the analysis identified the major genera carrying amino acid degradation genes such as sphingomonas 15 34 belnapia 19 03 sphingobium 2 45 unclassified c alphaproteobacteria 8 41 and gemmata 1 84 in the bac 12 sample in particular members of alpha proteobacteria sphingomonas belnapia sphingobium and unclassified c alphaproteobacteria were the major group encoding the metabolism pathway the carbohydrate metabolism 44 57 and amino acid metabolism 45 23 pathways within the bac 12 sample a previous study reported that major chemical groups in nom include humic species amino acids carbohydrates carboxylic acids and proteins croué et al 2000 among which carbohydrates and amino acids comprise the hydrophilic fraction of nom bond et al 2012 therefore the biodegradation of amino acid bound and carbohydrate bound noms in bac filters can most likely be attributed to these core genera members of alpha proteobacteria constituted the majority of bacteria that harbored genes to encode enzymes for carbohydrate and energy metabolism in a river and sediment reddy et al 2019 and many species were found to be highly abundant in biofilters due to their ability to degrade recalcitrant organic compounds peng et al 2018 emtiazi et al 2004 zhu et al 2014 moreover it was also found that the relative contribution the aforementioned major genera to the metabolic functions of wood based bac 11 was far lower than that of their contribution in coal based bac columns regarding carbohydrate metabolism the relative contribution of major genera was 61 53 54 42 35 2 and 58 39 in the bac 9 bac 12 samples fig 6 this indicates that ac properties not only impacted the microbial community composition but also their potential functions metagenomic analysis can provide information about microbial community compositions and the functional potential of a community albertsen et al 2012 however the functional protein expressions leading to distinct metabolic activities cannot be assessed via metagenome analyses vanwonterghem et al 2014 heyer et al 2013 therefore metaproteome analysis was considered a preferable approach for evaluating functional protein expression in this study fig 7 shows the number of proteins top 20 involved in the kegg pathways which include metabolism cellular processes human diseases and environmental information processing the total number of identified proteins in columns bac 9 bac 12 was 1255 1215 1160 and 1217 proteins most of the identified proteins were associated with the functions identified through the metagenomic analysis fig 7 the most abundant proteins were related to metabolism including amino acid carbohydrate and energy metabolism and global and overview maps the number of proteins related to amino acid metabolism was 97 92 87 and 92 and the number of proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism was 279 267 246 and 266 in filters bac 9 bac 10 bac 11 and bac 12 respectively fig 7 the differences in quantity of the proteins in the four bac filters are mainly due to differences in the respective bacterial communities for example the relative abundances of major genera including sphingomonas belnapia unclassified c alphaproteobacteria sphingobium and gemmata which encoded amino acid metabolism in the bac 10 column were 15 06 15 43 7 51 3 52 and 2 62 and those of genera encoding carbohydrate metabolism in the bac 10 column were 15 65 13 72 5 99 4 71 and 3 56 respectively fig 6 certain gac properties pore size distribution and polarity were found to result in different bacterial community compositions leading to differences in organic metabolism and potentially resulting in different doc removal performance based on the metagenomic and metagenomic analysis the average proportion of total doc removed was 38 1 54 7 38 6 and 52 1 in bac 9 bac 12 respectively when the number of proteins related to metabolism were totaled the quantity of proteins in the bac filters was 974 936 887 and 933 in the bac 9 bac 10 bac 11 and bac 12 filters respectively and their respective relative abundances were 77 61 77 04 76 47 and 76 66 fig 7 the results concerning protein quantities however were not consistent with the bac filter performance results in terms of doc and dbp formation potential this may be because bac filter performance depends on a combination of adsorption and biodegradation therefore the effect of gac pore size distribution on bac filter performance is discussed in detail below with consideration of both adsorption and biodegradation 3 4 potential effects of gac pore size distribution many previous studies focused on the effect of gac micropores and mesopores on adsorption performance gac for nom removal through adsorption is largely selected according to pore size distribution or pore volume in a size range that matches that of the nom gibert et al 2013 moore et al 2001 velten et al 2011a mw fractions 5 kda and of 5 10 kda respectively would fit into the micropores and mesopores based on the empirical relationship between mw and the respective diameters of organic molecules moore et al 2001 however gac filters eventually became bac filters and the performance of bac filters is affected by both adsorption and biological activity in jar tests gac preferentially removed 150 8600 da mw fractions via adsorption while the fractions most removed by biodegradation were mw 150 da and 1600 8600 da fig s9 the organic matter removal in the biodegradation test alone was proportional to atp concentration and atp is considered to be an important indicator of biofilm activity and biomass in bac filter lohwacharin et al 2015 magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 velten et al 2007 velten et al 2011b the adsorption capacity of gac quickly reached saturation due to low gac concentrations 200 mg l and 70 90 of doc remained in the aqueous solution sufficient for bacteria to utilize however the mw 150 da fraction increased in tests involving both adsorption and biodegradation and organic matter removal was not related to atp concentrations both of which are inconsistent with the results found due to biodegradation alone the mw 150 8600 da fraction was the predominant fraction removed through the combination of adsorption and biodegradation which was consistent with the trend observed in the test of gac adsorption alone this may be because bacteria prefer to utilize organic matter adsorbed by gac rather than organic matter directly present in aqueous solutions resulting in the renewal of adsorptive capacity this is consistent with the bioregeneration mechanism in which exoenzymes secreted by microbes diffuse into the pores and react with the organic matter adsorbed on the gac kim et al 1997 sirotkin et al 2001 in this study however apart from that mechanism it was suggested that the main site of the reaction between enzymes and organic matter was the mesopores more than 64 of the proteins were related to metabolism fig s10 the molecular weights of more than 96 of which were less than 100 kda based on metaproteomic analysis fig s11 the proteins with molecular weights of 100 kda and 4 5 kda were approximately 6 nm and 2 nm in diameter respectively fig s11 moore et al 2001 gibert et al 2013 therefore the vast majority of metabolic enzymes could enter into the mesopores but not into the micropores a finding consistent with previous studies klimenko et al 2002 in bench scale experiments the dom mw fractions predominantly removed by bac columns were 0 4 1 6 kd at day 145 and 220 rather than the mw 150 da and 1600 8600 da fractions removed by biodegradation table 3 thus this suggests that gac adsorption in bac columns operated over 245 days could continue to play a role in bac performance nom is the main source of dbp precursors and gac adsorption is an effective technology for the control of dbp precursors kim and kang 2008 results indicated that reduced haa5 formation potential strongly correlated with the removal of mw fraction 1600 8600 da r2 0 90 while the reduction in thm and n dbp formation potential correlated with the removal of mw fraction 400 1600 da with r2 0 77 and r2 0 53 respectively fig s12 results further indicated that adsorption continues to play a vital role in the doc and dbp precursor removal by bac filters operated over 245 days this could be attributed to the in situ bioregeneration of sorption sites the major limitation of gac is its decrease in adsorption capacity over time simpson 2008 the adsorption capacity or iodine value of gac significantly declines with increased adsorbed contaminants without microbial activity microbial activity is influenced by biomass and community composition with the impact of the latter outweighing that of the former gagnon and huck 2001 lautenschlager et al 2014 oh et al 2018 the enzyme activities in different bac columns could be explained by differences in bacterial community composition due to the pore size structure and surface polarity of the gac in this study the metabolism related proteins were correlated with the volume of micro level macropore as with d 0 2 10 μm r2 0 7 table 4 additionally bacterial concentrations were correlated with the volume of micro level macropore bs with d 100 μm r2 0 98 table 4 it indicated that gac micro level macropores had a notable effect on bacterial activity in terms of biomass and bacterial community structure table 4 most previous studies reported that macropores are not responsible for nom adsorption due to size exclusion effects el gamal et al 2018 karanfil and kilduff 1999 however micro level macropores can promote and drive the renewal of adsorption sites when a gac filter is converted to a bac filter although the iodine value of ac11 670 mg g at the stable stage was close to those of ac10 680 mg g and ac12 674 mg g the doc removal of bac 11 38 6 was less than that of bac 10 54 7 and bac 12 52 1 this could be attributed to two main factors one is that the pore distribution and surface chemical characteristics determine gac adsorption and the latter even overwhelm the effects of the former the coal based ac10 and ac12 exhibited higher adsorption capacities than did the wood based ac11 based on freundlich isotherm experiments fig s3 and table s3 the other factor is that after gac adsorption was saturated the regaining of adsorption capacity mainly depended on bioregeneration the number of proteins related to metabolism in bac 11 443 5 proteins g ac was lower than that in bac 10 468 proteins g ac and bac 12 466 5 proteins g ac thus the bioregeneration ability of bac 11 was less than that of bac 10 and bac 12 even if the number of proteins related to metabolism in bac 9 487 proteins g ac was larger than that in bac 10 468 proteins g ac bac 11 443 5 proteins g ac and bac 12 466 5 proteins g ac bac 9 did not have the highest doc removal 38 1 this could be attributed to ac9 having the highest number of proteins while the bacterial activity was dependent on the organic matter adsorbed by the gac and ac9 had the lowest iodine value 450 mg g in addition s was defined as a synergistic effect value of the iodine value xi mg g and the number of proteins xp proteins g i e s xi xp 0 012 xi 0 059 xp it was found that s values and doc removal had a linear correlation r2 0 998 fig s13 the iodine value xi was affected by the volume of micropores with d 2 nm r2 0 82 fig s7 and the number of proteins x p was affected by the volume of micro level macropores a with d 0 2 10 μm r2 0 70 table 4 therefore when ac is selected for a bac filter its pore size structure should be well distributed it should not only have smaller pores micropores and mesopores to guarantee a sufficiently high adsorption capacity but it should also have macropores i e micro level macropores to promote bacterial activity to bioregenerate ac adsorption sites 4 conclusions in this study bac filters loaded with different gacs were operated in parallel for 245 days and the impact of pore size distribution on bac filter performance in terms of doc and disinfection byproduct precursors was investigated based on metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses the results found that the effect of the bacterial community composition on the bac filter performance was greater than that of the bacterial biomass it is suggested that gac adsorption saturation in bac filters is dynamic and the bioregeneration process is based on adsorption capacity and driven by bacterial degradation the adsorption performance is largely determined by the physical and chemical characteristics of ac the micro level macropores affected the number of enzymes in bacteria that metabolized organic matter and the biomass content however the role of micro level macropores is typically neglected when ac is selected or produced for gac filter treatments therefore when ac is selected for a bac filter more attention should be paid to the physical and chemical characteristics of the ac for instance pore size structure should be well distributed i e it should not only have smaller pores micropores and mesopores to guarantee a higher number of adsorption sites but also have micro level macropores to boost the bioregeneration ability of some ac adsorption sites

17941,proper granular activated carbon gac selection could improve the performance of biological activated carbon bac filters through a combination of adsorption and biodegradation while the gacs used in bac filters are now mainly selected according to adsorption function ignoring biodegradation in this study sand filter effluent obtained from a drinking water treatment plant was fed into continuous flow bench scale bac columns operated in parallel over 245 days to examine the effects of gac pore size distribution on bac filter performance in terms of the dissolved organic carbon doc and disinfection byproduct dbp precursors a metagenomic analysis indicated that bacterial community structure played an important role in bac filter performance a significant correlation was found between metabolism related proteins and the volume of micro level macropores based on metaproteomic analysis it is suggested that the adsorption saturation was dynamic and that adsorption played a role in the performance of the bac filters throughout the 245 day operating period renewed adsorption capacity or bioregeneration was driven by bacterial metabolic activity such activity largely depended on the organic matter adsorbed by the gac in which micro level macropores especially those with diameters of 0 2 10 μm played an important but previously unrecognized role the results suggest that more attention should be paid to well developed pores and pore size distribution in the production and selection of gac used for full scale drinking water biofilters graphical abstract image 1 keywords granular activated carbon biological activated carbon filter bacterial community structure micro level macropore pore size 1 introduction activated carbon ac is formed by carbonization and activation under high temperatures it has a massive surface area a well developed pore structure and excellent adsorption ability its adsorption effectiveness is determined by the volume of well developed pores and the pore size distribution relative to the molecular weight mw of organic matter karanfil and kilduff 1999 nowotny et al 2007 natural organic matter nom adsorption primarily occurs in mesopores and large micropores hsieh and teng 2000 lorenc grabowska and gryglewicz 2005 the mw fraction 5 kda of natural organic matter nom is readily adsorbed by gac gibert et al 2013 moore et al 2001 velten et al 2011a a gac filter eventually turns into a biological activated carbon bac filter after several months operation bac filters remove organic pollutants hozalski et al 1999 and inorganic nutrients including ammonia andersson et al 2001 phosphorus altmann et al 2016 and metals cerrato et al 2010 from water not only through adsorption but also through microbial degradation typically the ac used in gac filters are selected according to its adsorption functions as reflected by either its iodine or methylene value bac filters are widely used in drinking water treatment plants dwtps and the required iodine value of gac used in such filters must exceed 950 mg g cj t 345 2010 2011 in chinese dwtps after 3 7 years of operation although the iodine values of gac dwindle to less than 450 mg g the effluent potassium permanganate index codmn of bac filters remains around 1 2 mg l gao 2018 liu et al 2011 xu et al 2017 the iodine value of gac in dwtps decreases significantly to 60 of its initial value in the first two months though this decrease slows between the third and twelfth months due to biofilm growth liu et al 2017a therefore microbial activity in bac filters could extend the service life of gac through in situ biological regeneration of sorption sites dejonge et al 1996 speitel and digiano 1987 although the rate of bioregeneration of sorption sites is slow it occurs within the typical service life of gac in practical applications speitel and digiano 1987 two widely accepted mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the bioregeneration process are the concentration gradient mechanism which effects the biodegradation of organic matter following desorption due to the concentration gradient between the ac surface and bulk liquid dejonge et al 1996 kim et al 1997 and extracellular enzyme reactions which occur inside meso and macropores extracellular enzymes secreted by bacteria or enzymes released through cell disintegration interact with the adsorbed organic matter resulting in its release from the adsorption site and utilization by microbes thus the ac regains some of its adsorption capacity kim et al 1997 sirotkin et al 2001 whatever the mechanism it is clear that microbial activities regenerate the adsorption capacity of gac and drive bac filter performance ac pores are divided into micropores 2 nm in diameter mesopores 2 50 nm and macropores 50 nm according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the smaller pores are too small for bacteria to enter 1 2 μm 0 5 μm walker and weatherley 1998 and the most suitable pore size range for microbial attachment on the surfaces of ac particles is thought to be 2 5 μm wang et al 1995 therefore gac selected for bac filters should not only have both micro and mesopores to guarantee a sufficiently high adsorption capacity but also macropores to allow for bacterial adhesion at present the selection of ac for bac filters is based only on iodine or methylene values that indicate the presence of micropores or some mesopores but these methods do not indicate the presence of macropores the effect of macropores on bac filter performance has generally been neglected therefore it is worth investigating whether ac selection solely based on adsorption is the most suitable approach for bac filters employed in bac or o3 bac treatments in dwtps the biodegradation of organic matter mainly depends on the microbial biomass growth rate and community structure gagnon and huck 2001 oh et al 2018 the availability of nutrients and carbon boon et al 2011 li et al 2010 pang and liu 2006 and the operational conditions e g preozonation temperature backwashing the filter characteristics and the contact time affect the microbial biomass and community structure kasuga et al 2007 moll and summers 1999 moll et al 1998 oh et al 2018 yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2010a among these factors the filter is the primary component of the biofilm treatment and plays an important role in water purification most filters have porous structures that facilitate microbial propagation and growth e g the commercial gac picabiol 2 jacobi carbons sweden was specifically manufactured with a pore size 50 nm to favor bacterial growth mercier et al 2014 as some studies have suggested that bac performance is not necessarily correlated with biomass concentration boon et al 2011 emelko et al 2006 optimizing the microbial community structure in a bac filter and increasing the microbial metabolic ability may be the most effective means of improving the ability of bac or o3 bac treatments to degrade organic matter although gac is an ideal candidate biofilter carrier very few studies have explored the relationship between gac pore size distribution characteristics and the bacterial community composition or metabolism in bac filters zhang et al 2010b understanding this relationship could facilitate the identification of suitable gac for bac or o3 bac treatments and thus improve the performance of bac filters this study investigated four different types of gac to better understand the effect of pore size distribution characteristics on bac filter performance in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc and disinfection byproduct dbp precursors the combined use of metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses could provide a clearer picture of the effect of bacterial activity on bac filter performance in addition the most suitable pore sizes and structures for gac used in bac filters were explored providing theoretical guidelines for the production and selection of gac used in bac or o3 bac treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the chemicals and reagents used in the study are described in the text s1 each week 500 l of sand filter effluent samples were taken from a dwtp located in beijing china and immediately transported back to cold storage 4 c the water treatment process is as follows

influent and effluent samples were taken at regular intervals and their doc concentrations were determined the samples 300 ml for dbp precursor tests collected from each bac column were filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filters to remove suspended solids then stored in 500 ml brown glass bottles the gac samples about 0 5 g were collected from the top surface upper 10 cm at regular intervals and subjected to biomass heterotrophic plate count hpc analysis subsequently 0 5 g of virgin gac was added to compensate for gac loss due to sampling 2 3 jar tests for the biodegradation tests bacterial suspensions detached from each bac column on day 210 were placed into 50 ml of sterilized bac column influent the bacterial suspensions were obtained from the bac columns as described in lu et al 2019 the uv254 and mw distribution patterns were recorded at 24 36 48 and 72 h adsorption experiments were conducted in a 150 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of sterilized influent and four virgin gacs to reach adsorption saturation quickly the gacs were present in low concentrations of 200 mg l the uv254 and mw distribution patterns were recorded at 1 7 12 24 and 36 h and the gac was considered to be saturated after 24 h under constant uv254 removal next a detached bacterial suspension as in the biodegradation tests was added to each adsorption experiment this allowed the simulation of the bac process with synergistic adsorption and biodegradation the uv254 and mw distribution patterns were recorded continuously for 48 60 72 84 and 96 h one flask containing only sterilized water served as a control in all experiments agitation was performed at 250 rpm and the temperature was maintained at 25 c uv254 removal was stable at 48 h in the biodegradation experiments and when the gac no longer removed organic matter after 24 h saturation was considered to have been reached the uv254 removal subsequently increased after adding the bacteria taken from the bac columns until reaching a constant value at 84 h fig s1 analysis of mw distribution patterns of dom was conducted via high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec for the biodegradation experiment samples at 48 h the gac adsorption samples at 24 h and both sets of samples at 84 h fig s2 the isotherm experiments were carried out in batches with different virgin gac dosages ranging

potential tests were immediately conducted in the laboratory before chlorination the water samples were buffered to ph 7 0 with 0 2 m phosphate buffer a sodium hypochlorite naocl solution was dosed into the bottles to a predetermined concentration according to doc demand i e cl2 3 doc weight basis krasner et al 2009 after several inversions the bottles were incubated in the dark for 7 days residual chlorine in the solutions was measured using a hach pocket colorimeter after 7 days of contact time residual chlorine was quenched with sodium sulfite 98 sigma aldrich usa and the samples were analyzed for dbps including the haloacetic acids haas trihalomethanes thms and n dbps 2 5 sampling metagenome sequencing and analysis two biomass samples 0 5 1 g each were collected from the upper surface of each bac filter column on days 210 and 230 and were then added to a sterile erlenmeyer flask with several glass beads and 15 ml of desorption solution the carbon sample was sonicated for 10 min in the desorption solution so liquid supernatant was obtained this was followed by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 8 min to obtain a bacterial precipitate the precipitate was stored at 20 c

silica capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm id with 0 25 μm film thickness agilent usa the details of the instrument analysis are described in text s7 2 7 4 pore structure characterization and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis of ac micropore and mesopore distributions were measured using the n2 adsorption method after the acs were fully dried at 120 c the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were measured at 77 k using an autosorb i q2 mp quantachrome usa and the pore volume distribution was calculated according to alternate models for mesopore and micropore volume distributions these were the bjh and h k s f models respectively the typical pore diameter d of the macropores was greater than 50 nm the distribution characteristics of the macropores were determined using the hg intrusion method with an autopore iv9500 micromeritics usa morlay and joly 2010 the hg column pressure range of the autopore iv9500 is 0 5 6000 psia and the corresponding pore diameter range is around 3 370 000 nm the analysis of the surface functional group content and elemental composition of the ac samples was completed using an escalab 250xi spectrometer thermo fisher usa identification of the surface functional groups was performed via the deconvolution of the c1s xps spectra using peakfit software 2 7 5 quantification of active bacterial biomass bacterial concentrations were determined using the hpc method and adenosine triphosphate atp analysis as in our previous study lu et al 2019 in short a gac sample with a wet weight of about 0 5 g was added to 15 ml of the desorption solution and then sonicated for 10 min the bacterial suspension was diluted to the appropriate concentration and the hpc was calculated based on the number of colonies on the r2a plates after 7 days of incubation at 22 c in the jar tests 100 μl samples were transferred to a 96 well 100 μl of bac titer glo reagent promega madison wi usa was added and the atp was measured using a spectramax m5 microplate reader molecular devices sunnyvale ca usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 ac characteristics ac adsorption performance is largely dependent on pore structure and chemical surface characteristics along with characteristics of the adsorbate karanfil et al 1999 moore et al 2001 the performances of four bac columns operated in parallel with different gacs and the same influent were compared to investigate the pore structure and chemical surface characteristics of the gacs the pore volume distribution characteristics of the four gacs used in this experiment are shown in fig s5 the most suitable pore size range for microbial attachment on the surfaces of ac particles is regarded to be 2 5 μm wang et al 1995 as bacteria are too large to enter smaller pores walker and weatherley 1998 the smallest bacterial particles had sizes of 200 nm which falls within the size range corresponding to gac macropores therefore ideal macropores for bacterial activity should be micron sized i e micro level macropores pores with d 200 nm were further divided into those with d of 0 2 10 μm 10 100 μm and 100 μm in the present study of which pores with diameters of 0 2 10 μm and 100 μm were called micro level macropores a and b respectively the pore volumes of the four gacs were mainly concentrated in the micropore and micro level macropore a and b ranges table 1 fig s5 ac11 had the highest volume of micropores 0 45 ml g and micro level macropore bs 0 427 ml g and the lowest volume of micro level macropore as 0 138 ml g on the other hand ac9 had the lowest volume of micropores 0 14 ml g and micro level macropore bs 0 118 ml g and the highest volume of micro level macropore as 0 265 ml g surface functional groups sfg of acs were determined through xps analysis and at least three forms of c can be found fig s6 the characteristic bands occurring in graphite or aromatic compounds sfg1 284 79 ev phenols ethers or hydroxylic groups sfg2 286 ev and carboxylic groups sfg3 288 89 ev can be found in fig s6 the content of the surface functional groups and elemental composition of the acs are listed in table 2 the sp2 hybridized type of c 284 79 ev graphitic aromatic carbon was dominant in the structures of the ac samples the hydroxylic and carboxylic structures of chemically treated wood based ac11 were slightly more numerous than those of other acs and the oxygen content 14 91 and o c value 0 16 of ac11 were also significantly higher than those of other coal based acs with thermal treatments table 2 it was found that the chemical treatment of wood based acs increased the number of acidic surface functional groups which was in agreement with previous studies julien et al 1998 aktas and cecen 2006 some studies suggested that acidic oxygen containing functional groups increased surface polarity and reduced the adsorption of hydrophobic organic contaminants by gac karanfil et al 1999 franz et al 2000 therefore the adsorption capacity of thermally treated coal based acs would be relatively higher than that of chemically treated wood based acs this finding was further supported by the adsorption capacity of gacs determined through freundlich isotherm experiments fig s3 the k f adsorption capacity values of ac11 1 21 and ac9 1 33 were lower than those of ac10 1 96 and ac12 1 77 table s3 indicating that the coal based ac10 and ac12 exhibited higher adsorption capacities despite ac11 s higher micropore volume 0 45 ml g therefore surface chemistry characteristics played a more important role in adsorption than pore distribution characteristics 3 2 bac filter performance in terms of doc and dbp formation potential 3 2 1 doc and mw distribution the parallel bench scale bac columns operated for 245 days and the influent doc concentrations measured in the sand filter effluent ranged from 1 8 to 3 5 mg l fig 2 after continuous operation over 200 days the bac columns reached a steady state based on the doc removal and biomass accumulation results fig 2 the bac columns achieved removed up to 37 87 of doc during the first two weeks after which doc removal performance declined and finally remained stable removing 38 54 of doc after 200 operational days the biomass attached to the gac particles gradually accumulated during the first 135 days then remained mature and stable the initial iodine values of ac9 ac12 was 650 950 1000 and 1050 mg g respectively which correlated with the volume of micropores r2 0 82 table s1 and fig s7 the iodine values gradually decreased with operation time and approximately 28 4 35 8 of the initial iodine values were lost after 220 days of operation however the rate of decrease differed over time fig s7 in the first 145 days the iodine values decreased by approximately 20 29 then the decrease slowed 4 5 i e the decreasing iodine value trend line assumed a more gentle slope finally the iodine values of each respective ac decreased to 450 680 670 and 674 mg g fig s7 the doc removal and biomass results along with the iodine values showed that biological regeneration of adsorption sites occurred due to the mature biofilm on the gac surface after 135 days therefore doc removal using bac filters involves both adsorption and biodegradation and adsorption plays a dynamic role throughout the long term operation of bac columns previous studies found that the iodine blue value was low 118 450 mg g after operation for 3 7 years in some full scale dwtps in china and the effluent codmn of bac filters could be controlled to remain at approximately 1 2 mg l gao 2018 liu et al 2011 xu et al 2017 this is as a result of the biological activity in bac filters which has the potential to extend the service life of these devices through in situ bioregeneration of gac sorption sites speitel and digiano 1987 leong et al 2018 smolin et al 2020 yapsakli and cecen 2010 the average doc concentration of the influent was 2 36 mg l and the average effluent doc concentrations of bac 10 1 07 mg l and bac 12 1 13 mg l were lower than those of bac 9 1 46 mg l and bac 11 1 45 mg l the bacterial concentration hpc in bac 11 was 10 50 times higher than those in the other bac columns at 200 245 days fig 2 this indicates that the proportion of doc removed in bac 11 was not the highest despite this bac s having highest biomass suggesting that the bacterial concentration may not the determining factor of doc removal in bac treatments lautenschlager et al 2014 investigated the microbial community compositions and abundances of three different biofilter types and found that biomass was present in the same concentrations in all of the filters however the microbial taxa and metabolisms differed considerably between the filter types which could have contributed to their differing doc removal performance oh et al 2018 also indicated that bacterial community structure and metabolic capacity contributed to doc removal in the biofiltration treatment of full scale dwtps through metagenomic analysis in this case following metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis was performed to uncover the influence of bacterial activity on doc removal from the perspective of bacterial community structure and metabolism the main dom fractions of the influent ranged from 1 6 to 8 6 kd and 0 4 1 6 kd based on mw distributions fig s8 a comparison of the reduction in total area as a percentage and separated fractions between the influent and effluent are listed in table 3 for doc with a mw of 0 4 1 6 kd the mean removal rate of bac filtration was 11 3 25 0 the mean proportion of total doc with a mw of 1 6 8 6 kd removed ranged from 2 5 to 12 7 the mean proportion of doc with a mw of 0 15 0 4 kd removed ranged from 5 2 to 9 5 while only 3 9 6 1 of doc with a mw 0 15 kd was removed the mean total area reduction of the four bac filter columns was approximately 23 2 53 0 26 5 and 41 9 which was within the 37 2 54 3 doc removal range of the bench scale bac filter columns it was found that after 220 days of operation the doc fraction with a mw 0 4 1 6 kd was removed the highest rate among the fractions 3 2 2 dbp formation potential the concentration of total dbp formation potential dbpfp in influent water samples was 389 44 555 61 and 865 29 μg l on operation days 45 145 and 220 respectively fig 3 the 19 targeted dbpfps were detected in the bac effluent with concentrations ranging from non detectable nd to 217 43 μg l table s4 the formation potentials of regulated haa5 and thms in influent water samples ranged from 123 23 to 145 11 μg l and from 231 57 to 632 38 μg l respectively fig 3 accounting for 24 03 4 82 and 66 72 3 96 of the total dbpfps this indicated that thms were the largest classes of dbpfps in this study previous studies found that thms and haas were the two most prevalent classes of dbps present in treated drinking water fu et al 2017 krasner et al 1989 roberts et al 2002 the average concentrations of n dbps formation potentials in influent samples ranged from 23 87 to 86 89 μg l fig 3 accounting for 8 48 1 20 of the total dbpfps the average removal of haa5fp and thmfp was 47 81 3 83 and 58 17 10 17 62 31 7 93 and 82 79 5 20 48 47 7 78 and 47 32 9 88 and 59 27 6 61 and 76 79 7 45 in bac 9 bac 10 bac 11 and bac 12 respectively these were lower than or close to those of the respective total dbpfp removal the average removal of n dbpfps were 74 69 5 41 83 31 5 26 66 35 11 77 and 82 61 6 16 in bac 9 bac 10 bac 11 and bac 12 respectively these were higher than that of the respective total dbpfp in summary bac 9 and bac 11 reduced the total dbpfps by 57 06 7 56 and 50 42 7 37 while bac 10 and bac 12 had a higher dbpfp removal of 78 01 3 78 and 73 09 5 26 respectively 3 3 metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis knowledge of the microbial communities in bac filters could improve our understanding of the related biological processes oh et al 2018 rittmann 2006 velten et al 2011a several researchers have addressed differences in biofilter microbial communities related to water quality li et al 2010 liao et al 2013 temperature kaarela et al 2015 operational conditions nemani et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and filter medium type lautenschlager et al 2014 vignola et al 2017 for example lautenschlager et al 2014 found that in biofilters with similar bacterial community structures the corresponding abundances of bacterial taxa e g relative abundance of proteobacteria differed by filter medium type e g gac 74 2 rapid sand filter 54 slow sand filter 45 however limited information is available on the impact of gac properties such as porosity chemistry and adsorption capacity on microbial community structures and functions vignola et al 2017 lautenschlager et al 2014 the hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the wood based bac 11 sample was distinct from the other coal based bac samples and among the coal based bac samples two samples taken from bac 10 and bac 12 were closely clustered compared to the sample taken from bac 9 fig 4 which indicated that the bacterial community seemed to cluster according to filter material the wood based bac 11 sample was distinctive compared to other coal based bac samples because the surface polarity of the wood based ac was higher than those of the coal based acs table 2 the chemical properties of coal based acs are similar thus differences in the hierarchical clustering bacterial communities in coal based bac samples could be attributed to differences in pore size structure for example ac 10 and ac 12 had similar micropore volumes while ac 9 had the lowest micropore volume table 1 and gac adsorption is affected most strongly by micropore volume hsieh and teng 2000 lorenc grabowska and gryglewicz 2005 further given the relationship between organic matter concentrations and micropore volume thus organic matter concentrations played an essential role in determining differences in the bacterial communities of coal based bac samples alpha proteobacteria were the most abundant class 65 5 relative abundance identified in bac filters that have been reported to be competitive under low nutrient concentrations and to be capable of degrading complex organic compounds newton et al 2011 liao et al 2013 lautenschlager et al 2014 at the genus level the differences between the bac samples were more evident the bac 11 filter contained mostly gemmata 19 while the other biofilters were dominated by sphingomonas 17 24 belnapia 18 22 and unclassified c alphaproteobacteria 10 14 fig 4 the genus belnapia dominated in bac 10 18 and bac 12 22 but was less abundant in bac 9 5 the genus gemmata is capable of utilizing organic matter and nitrogen in lake and wastewater treatment plants wwtps bae et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 the genus sphingomonas is common in bac filters in dwtps it is able to degrade different kinds of organic matter and is a common kind of heterotrophic bacteria jeong et al 2017 liu et al 2017b a functional annotation of all metagenomic reads revealed that metabolic pathways were abundant but differed according to the bacterial communities of the bac filters fig 5 first hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that coal based bac 10 and bac 12 were closely related to coal based bac 9 in contrast to the relatively distant relationship between the coal based bacs and wood based bac 11 which further supported the classification based on hierarchical clustering of bacterial communities at the genus level this analysis also indicated that the ac properties played an important role in shaping the bacterial community composition and function notably the metabolism function pathways level 1 in kegg were the most abundant 41 4 carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism global and overview maps and energy metabolism the subfunctional categories of metabolism were particularly enriched in the bac filters fig 5 for example the relative reads of carbohydrate metabolism pathways in the bac 9 bac 12 columns represented 9 1 7 9 7 2 and 8 4 of the total the number of relative reads regarding amino acid metabolism were 9 0 7 7 6 2 and 8 5 respectively however the functional annotation of metabolic pathways does not reveal which micro organisms are potentially responsible for major functions such as carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism because different microorganisms have diverse catabolic abilities and pathways for substrates newton et al 2011 to address this the bacteria s encoded relative contribution to metabolic functions were examined fig 6 as expected this analysis suggested that the functional capabilities of different bacteria are distinct for example the analysis identified the major genera carrying amino acid degradation genes such as sphingomonas 15 34 belnapia 19 03 sphingobium 2 45 unclassified c alphaproteobacteria 8 41 and gemmata 1 84 in the bac 12 sample in particular members of alpha proteobacteria sphingomonas belnapia sphingobium and unclassified c alphaproteobacteria were the major group encoding the metabolism pathway the carbohydrate metabolism 44 57 and amino acid metabolism 45 23 pathways within the bac 12 sample a previous study reported that major chemical groups in nom include humic species amino acids carbohydrates carboxylic acids and proteins croué et al 2000 among which carbohydrates and amino acids comprise the hydrophilic fraction of nom bond et al 2012 therefore the biodegradation of amino acid bound and carbohydrate bound noms in bac filters can most likely be attributed to these core genera members of alpha proteobacteria constituted the majority of bacteria that harbored genes to encode enzymes for carbohydrate and energy metabolism in a river and sediment reddy et al 2019 and many species were found to be highly abundant in biofilters due to their ability to degrade recalcitrant organic compounds peng et al 2018 emtiazi et al 2004 zhu et al 2014 moreover it was also found that the relative contribution the aforementioned major genera to the metabolic functions of wood based bac 11 was far lower than that of their contribution in coal based bac columns regarding carbohydrate metabolism the relative contribution of major genera was 61 53 54 42 35 2 and 58 39 in the bac 9 bac 12 samples fig 6 this indicates that ac properties not only impacted the microbial community composition but also their potential functions metagenomic analysis can provide information about microbial community compositions and the functional potential of a community albertsen et al 2012 however the functional protein expressions leading to distinct metabolic activities cannot be assessed via metagenome analyses vanwonterghem et al 2014 heyer et al 2013 therefore metaproteome analysis was considered a preferable approach for evaluating functional protein expression in this study fig 7 shows the number of proteins top 20 involved in the kegg pathways which include metabolism cellular processes human diseases and environmental information processing the total number of identified proteins in columns bac 9 bac 12 was 1255 1215 1160 and 1217 proteins most of the identified proteins were associated with the functions identified through the metagenomic analysis fig 7 the most abundant proteins were related to metabolism including amino acid carbohydrate and energy metabolism and global and overview maps the number of proteins related to amino acid metabolism was 97 92 87 and 92 and the number of proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism was 279 267 246 and 266 in filters bac 9 bac 10 bac 11 and bac 12 respectively fig 7 the differences in quantity of the proteins in the four bac filters are mainly due to differences in the respective bacterial communities for example the relative abundances of major genera including sphingomonas belnapia unclassified c alphaproteobacteria sphingobium and gemmata which encoded amino acid metabolism in the bac 10 column were 15 06 15 43 7 51 3 52 and 2 62 and those of genera encoding carbohydrate metabolism in the bac 10 column were 15 65 13 72 5 99 4 71 and 3 56 respectively fig 6 certain gac properties pore size distribution and polarity were found to result in different bacterial community compositions leading to differences in organic metabolism and potentially resulting in different doc removal performance based on the metagenomic and metagenomic analysis the average proportion of total doc removed was 38 1 54 7 38 6 and 52 1 in bac 9 bac 12 respectively when the number of proteins related to metabolism were totaled the quantity of proteins in the bac filters was 974 936 887 and 933 in the bac 9 bac 10 bac 11 and bac 12 filters respectively and their respective relative abundances were 77 61 77 04 76 47 and 76 66 fig 7 the results concerning protein quantities however were not consistent with the bac filter performance results in terms of doc and dbp formation potential this may be because bac filter performance depends on a combination of adsorption and biodegradation therefore the effect of gac pore size distribution on bac filter performance is discussed in detail below with consideration of both adsorption and biodegradation 3 4 potential effects of gac pore size distribution many previous studies focused on the effect of gac micropores and mesopores on adsorption performance gac for nom removal through adsorption is largely selected according to pore size distribution or pore volume in a size range that matches that of the nom gibert et al 2013 moore et al 2001 velten et al 2011a mw fractions 5 kda and of 5 10 kda respectively would fit into the micropores and mesopores based on the empirical relationship between mw and the respective diameters of organic molecules moore et al 2001 however gac filters eventually became bac filters and the performance of bac filters is affected by both adsorption and biological activity in jar tests gac preferentially removed 150 8600 da mw fractions via adsorption while the fractions most removed by biodegradation were mw 150 da and 1600 8600 da fig s9 the organic matter removal in the biodegradation test alone was proportional to atp concentration and atp is considered to be an important indicator of biofilm activity and biomass in bac filter lohwacharin et al 2015 magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 velten et al 2007 velten et al 2011b the adsorption capacity of gac quickly reached saturation due to low gac concentrations 200 mg l and 70 90 of doc remained in the aqueous solution sufficient for bacteria to utilize however the mw 150 da fraction increased in tests involving both adsorption and biodegradation and organic matter removal was not related to atp concentrations both of which are inconsistent with the results found due to biodegradation alone the mw 150 8600 da fraction was the predominant fraction removed through the combination of adsorption and biodegradation which was consistent with the trend observed in the test of gac adsorption alone this may be because bacteria prefer to utilize organic matter adsorbed by gac rather than organic matter directly present in aqueous solutions resulting in the renewal of adsorptive capacity this is consistent with the bioregeneration mechanism in which exoenzymes secreted by microbes diffuse into the pores and react with the organic matter adsorbed on the gac kim et al 1997 sirotkin et al 2001 in this study however apart from that mechanism it was suggested that the main site of the reaction between enzymes and organic matter was the mesopores more than 64 of the proteins were related to metabolism fig s10 the molecular weights of more than 96 of which were less than 100 kda based on metaproteomic analysis fig s11 the proteins with molecular weights of 100 kda and 4 5 kda were approximately 6 nm and 2 nm in diameter respectively fig s11 moore et al 2001 gibert et al 2013 therefore the vast majority of metabolic enzymes could enter into the mesopores but not into the micropores a finding consistent with previous studies klimenko et al 2002 in bench scale experiments the dom mw fractions predominantly removed by bac columns were 0 4 1 6 kd at day 145 and 220 rather than the mw 150 da and 1600 8600 da fractions removed by biodegradation table 3 thus this suggests that gac adsorption in bac columns operated over 245 days could continue to play a role in bac performance nom is the main source of dbp precursors and gac adsorption is an effective technology for the control of dbp precursors kim and kang 2008 results indicated that reduced haa5 formation potential strongly correlated with the removal of mw fraction 1600 8600 da r2 0 90 while the reduction in thm and n dbp formation potential correlated with the removal of mw fraction 400 1600 da with r2 0 77 and r2 0 53 respectively fig s12 results further indicated that adsorption continues to play a vital role in the doc and dbp precursor removal by bac filters operated over 245 days this could be attributed to the in situ bioregeneration of sorption sites the major limitation of gac is its decrease in adsorption capacity over time simpson 2008 the adsorption capacity or iodine value of gac significantly declines with increased adsorbed contaminants without microbial activity microbial activity is influenced by biomass and community composition with the impact of the latter outweighing that of the former gagnon and huck 2001 lautenschlager et al 2014 oh et al 2018 the enzyme activities in different bac columns could be explained by differences in bacterial community composition due to the pore size structure and surface polarity of the gac in this study the metabolism related proteins were correlated with the volume of micro level macropore as with d 0 2 10 μm r2 0 7 table 4 additionally bacterial concentrations were correlated with the volume of micro level macropore bs with d 100 μm r2 0 98 table 4 it indicated that gac micro level macropores had a notable effect on bacterial activity in terms of biomass and bacterial community structure table 4 most previous studies reported that macropores are not responsible for nom adsorption due to size exclusion effects el gamal et al 2018 karanfil and kilduff 1999 however micro level macropores can promote and drive the renewal of adsorption sites when a gac filter is converted to a bac filter although the iodine value of ac11 670 mg g at the stable stage was close to those of ac10 680 mg g and ac12 674 mg g the doc removal of bac 11 38 6 was less than that of bac 10 54 7 and bac 12 52 1 this could be attributed to two main factors one is that the pore distribution and surface chemical characteristics determine gac adsorption and the latter even overwhelm the effects of the former the coal based ac10 and ac12 exhibited higher adsorption capacities than did the wood based ac11 based on freundlich isotherm experiments fig s3 and table s3 the other factor is that after gac adsorption was saturated the regaining of adsorption capacity mainly depended on bioregeneration the number of proteins related to metabolism in bac 11 443 5 proteins g ac was lower than that in bac 10 468 proteins g ac and bac 12 466 5 proteins g ac thus the bioregeneration ability of bac 11 was less than that of bac 10 and bac 12 even if the number of proteins related to metabolism in bac 9 487 proteins g ac was larger than that in bac 10 468 proteins g ac bac 11 443 5 proteins g ac and bac 12 466 5 proteins g ac bac 9 did not have the highest doc removal 38 1 this could be attributed to ac9 having the highest number of proteins while the bacterial activity was dependent on the organic matter adsorbed by the gac and ac9 had the lowest iodine value 450 mg g in addition s was defined as a synergistic effect value of the iodine value xi mg g and the number of proteins xp proteins g i e s xi xp 0 012 xi 0 059 xp it was found that s values and doc removal had a linear correlation r2 0 998 fig s13 the iodine value xi was affected by the volume of micropores with d 2 nm r2 0 82 fig s7 and the number of proteins x p was affected by the volume of micro level macropores a with d 0 2 10 μm r2 0 70 table 4 therefore when ac is selected for a bac filter its pore size structure should be well distributed it should not only have smaller pores micropores and mesopores to guarantee a sufficiently high adsorption capacity but it should also have macropores i e micro level macropores to promote bacterial activity to bioregenerate ac adsorption sites 4 conclusions in this study bac filters loaded with different gacs were operated in parallel for 245 days and the impact of pore size distribution on bac filter performance in terms of doc and disinfection byproduct precursors was investigated based on metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses the results found that the effect of the bacterial community composition on the bac filter performance was greater than that of the bacterial biomass it is suggested that gac adsorption saturation in bac filters is dynamic and the bioregeneration process is based on adsorption capacity and driven by bacterial degradation the adsorption performance is largely determined by the physical and chemical characteristics of ac the micro level macropores affected the number of enzymes in bacteria that metabolized organic matter and the biomass content however the role of micro level macropores is typically neglected when ac is selected or produced for gac filter treatments therefore when ac is selected for a bac filter more attention should be paid to the physical and chemical characteristics of the ac for instance pore size structure should be well distributed i e it should not only have smaller pores micropores and mesopores to guarantee a higher number of adsorption sites but also have micro level macropores to boost the bioregeneration ability of some ac adsorption sites

17942,as a common animal feed additive p arsanilic acid p asa is thought to be excreted with little uptake and unchanged chemical structure threatening the environment by potentially releasing more toxic inorganic arsenic we herein investigated the removal of arsenic by in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides with the promotion of p asa degradation in fe ii peroxydisulfate pds system results showed that under acid conditions p asa degraded very quickly and over 99 of p asa 5 μm was degraded within 10 min at the optimal dosage of fe ii 100 μm and pds 150 μm at ph 3 while less than 66 4 of arsenic was removed at ph 3 5 higher ph 3 7 would inhibit the degradation of p asa but promote the arsenic removal at ph 6 7 over 98 5 of total arsenic was removed while the degradation efficiency of p asa was lower than 52 4 hplc icp ms results indicated that the arsenic group was cleaved from p asa in the form of as iii and then rapidly oxidized to as v ftir and xps analysis indicated that both as v products and residual p asa were bonded to ferric oxyhydr oxides via hydroxyl groups common cations e g na ca2 mg2 and anions such as cl so4 2 co3 2 had no significant influence on arsenic removal while sio3 2 po4 3 and ha inhibited the removal of total arsenic mainly by affecting the zeta potential of iron particles in summary the fe ii pds process as an efficient method for partial oxidation and simultaneous adsorption of p asa under near neutral conditions is expected to control the potential environmental risks of p asa graphical abstract image 1 keywords p arsanilic acid p asa fe ii peroxydisulfate arsenate in situ adsorption oxidation ferric oxyhydr oxides 1 introduction as a kind of phenylarsonic acid compounds p arsanilic acid 4 aminophenylarsonic p asa has been widely used as animal feed additives to promote growth control coccidial intestinal parasites and improve meat pigmentation for several decades fan et al 2018 it is barely metabolized in the animal bodies and is almost completely excreted via manure and urine aschbacher and feil 1991 studies estimated that over thousands of tons of phenylarsonic acid compounds were released into the environment through litter storage in weather exposed windrows manure application on agriculture land and animal wastes disposal from swine and poultry farming han et al 2004 2017 makris et al 2008 although p asa has low toxicity it can be bio and non biodegraded into more toxic inorganic arsenic species as iii and as v to cause arsenic contamination in aquatic systems and pose human health risk sapkota et al 2007 in the pearl river delta of southern china arsenic content was found to be elevated compared to the local background and p asa was detected at concentrations up to 771 μg kg 1 in the surface soils surrounding swine farms liu et al 2013 therefore it is desirable to develop an efficient method to achieve effective p asa removal and avoid secondary pollution caused by inorganic arsenic release simultaneously since adsorption is regarded as the best available technology for inorganic arsenic removal in community scale water supply systems joshi et al 2017a sarker et al 2017 several adsorbents have been exploited for the p asa removal including metal oxides feooh al2o3 and fe mn oxides chen and huang 2012 joshi et al 2017a metal organic framework ml 101 sarker et al 2017 and zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 jung et al 2015 all of them demonstrated high adsorption performances towards p asa but it usually takes several hours to reach the adsorption equilibrium and the removal efficiency by metal based adsorbents for p asa is generally lower than for inorganic as v table s1 other studies have also reported that organic arsenic is much more difficult to remove by the common adsorption precipitation or coagulation than inorganic arsenic depalma et al 2008 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the complexity of molecular stereostructure and the increase in molecular weight caused by organic groups in organic arsenic may be the main reasons zhang et al 2018 adsorption studies of monomethylarsonic acid mma and dimethylarsinic acid dma on fe oxyhydr oxides lafferty and loeppert 2005 and titanium dioxide jing et al 2005 revealed that the degree of methylation and oxidation state of arsenic in these compounds affected their binding affinities and geometry of surface complexes depalma et al 2008 therefore liberating the arsenic groups from organoarsenic framework by an oxidation strategy and then adsorbing the released arsenic seems to be a promising method for p asa removal up to now such a two step synergistic combination of oxidation adsorption has been widely investigated under optimized conditions p asa 10 mg as l 1 could be completely oxidized to as v within 30 min by fenton process and the newly released as v can be subsequently removed by ferric hydroxide xie et al 2016 a permanganate oxidation and ferric ion precipitation process reported that 99 of p asa could be degraded within 35 min and the residual arsenic could be adsorbed by fe oh 3 precipitate formed from fecl3 xie et al 2019 cuo fe3o4 nanocomposites were applied as visible light catalysts for p asa degradation the p asa could be oxidized completely and about 95 of released arsenic ions could be anchored on the solid surface sun et al 2018 recently a study found that over 90 of p asa could be oxidized into as v within 1 min in ph 7 0 and 7 5 by ferrate and the released as v could be eliminated by in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides through surface adsorption yang et al 2018 owing to the prominent role that fe played for p asa removal in the mentioned methods they can be summarized as fe based oxidation adsorption peroxydisulfate pds based chemical oxidation processes are gaining more interest in recent years as one of the most commonly used sulfate radical s o 4 source pds can be activated by uv luo et al 2019 heat liang and su 2009 carbon based materials yao et al 2016 nano zero valent iron wacławek et al 2018 metal oxide wang and wang 2018a and transition metals matzek and carter 2016 miralles cuevas et al 2017 among them fe ii has been widely studied due to its high efficiency relative nontoxicity low cost and environmentally friendly nature han et al 2015 wang et al 2018b the fe ii pds system has shown excellent performance in remediating polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated soils tang et al 2015 and eliminating bisphenol a yang 2015 indomethacin li et al 2017a and antibiotic levofloxacin epold et al 2015 in water compared with the strong oxidative ability of fe ii pds the fate of fe ii during the reaction process is rarely noticed some researchers reported the formation of ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 at neutral ph in fe ii pds system and treated it as a limiting factor for the fe ii catalysis ignoring its good adsorption and precipitation properties amina et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 considering the strong oxidizing properties of active component o i e s o 4 yang et al 2019 and or fe iv wang et al 2018b in fe ii pds system and the strong adsorption properties of ferric oxy hydroxide especially for inorganic arsenic fe ii pds process might be a simple and efficient strategy to exhaustively eliminate p asa contamination from water therefore in this study we are focused on the arsenic removal performance and removal form in fe ii pds system and the oxidation performance and the degradation pathway of p asa given the high toxicity of arsenic we mainly studied the arsenic transformation pathway and valence change of arsenic the precipitate containing arsenic was also carefully analyzed in addition we further investigated the effects of some common anions cations and humic acids on the removal of p asa using fe ii pds process as well as the removal of p asa in natural water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents p arsanilic acid p asa c6h8asno3 98 and p

water 2 2 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted in 50 ml glass flasks under constant magnetic stirring at 800 r min and the temperature was controlled at 25 c with a water bath the initial concentration of p asa was 5 μm unless otherwise stated reaction were initiated by simultaneously adding solutions of pds and feso4 at the pre determined dosages samples were periodically collected and immediately quenched with methanol for subsequent kinetics and products analysis to track the arsenic removal the sample collected at fixed time intervals was filtered through a nylon

investigated by experiments carried out in the presence of these background constituents at preset concentrations the removal of p asa in natural water samples was carried out in songhua river

retention times for standard solution of as iii as v and p asa were 2 5 4 6 and 12 2 min fig s2 the concentrations of arsenic species were calculated based on the corresponding chromatogram peak areas and standard curves established with the respective standards two ion chromatographs ic were used for the determination of nh4 dionex ics 2100 thermo usa formic acid and acetic acid dionex integrion

su8000 japan xrd x pert pro panalytical holland and xps axis ultra dld kratos england 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of p asa in fe ii pds system the degradation efficiency of p asa by fe ii pds system under different dosages of pds and fe ii were investigated to find the optimum molar ratio fig 1 a and b the corresponding kinetic data was shown in fig s3 fig 1a showed that the degradation efficiency within 10 min increased from 0 7 to 100 with the increasing dosage of pds from 0 μm to 150 μm at a fixed fe ii dosage of 100 μm while little enhancement occurred with the continual increment of pds thus pds at 150 μm appeared to be sufficient for the degradation of p asa at the tested concentration which was almost completely degraded within 10 min with a fixed pds dosage of 100 μm the degradation efficiency of p asa at 10 min first increased from 8 8 to 98 2 as the fe ii concentration increased from 0 μm to 75 μm and then gradually decreased with further increase of fe ii dosage fig 1b previous studies have revealed that the catalytic generation of more active oxidative species o by the larger amounts of fe ii 0 75 μm contributed to the enhanced degradation of p asa while the competitive scavenging of o by the excess fe ii at a concentration above 100 μm led to the reduced degradation of p asa epold et al 2015 li et al 2017b wang et al 2018 therefore 75 μm fe ii was most effective to catalyze 100 μm pds for p asa degradation close to the ratio of 150 μm pds to 100 μm fe ii in fig 1a in summary the above results indicated that an efficient rapid and almost complete degradation of 5 μm p asa could be achieved by fe ii pds process with 100 μm fe ii and 150 μm pds fe ii pds molar ratio of 1 1 5 at ph 3 within 10 min the optimum dosage of fe ii and pds obtained from the above conclusion was used for all subsequent experiments in this study the ph value of the solution is known to be an important parameter affecting degradation of organic pollutants by fe ii pds process matzek and carter 2016 therefore the effect of solution ph on the degradation efficiency and kinetics of p asa in fe ii pds system was also evaluated obviously the degradation rate and efficiency of p asa decreased with increasing ph fig 1c and the normalized remaining concentration c c0 vs reaction time t in the first 18 s exhibited a good fit to a pseudo first order model by logarithmic regression analysis fig 1d data presented in table s3 there was almost no p asa residue 0 within 30 min at ph 3 whereas the residual percentage increased to 20 2 43 8 38 0 and 61 7 at the ph of 4 5 6 and 7 fig 1c respectively along with the decrease of k obs 10ˆ 2 s 1 from 8 19 at ph 3 to 1 09 at ph 7 fig 1d the decrease of p asa degradation with the increasing ph increasing from 3 to 7 might be attributed to the intense iron precipitation under higher ph conditions and self dissociation of pds through non radical pathways han et al 2015 li et al 2017b when ph was over 7 fe iv one of the possible active oxidative species in fe ii pds system would self decompose wang et al 2018 or hydrolyze rapidly jacobsen 1998 making it unable to oxidize p asa the generated s o 4 might undergo reactions with h2o and oh in accordance with eqs 1 and 2 respectively to generate oh the small amount of oh which would be scavenged by various ions in solution e g so4 2 liang et al 2007 might lead to the slight degradation of p asa 20 5 and 6 2 under alkaline conditions ph 8 and 9 at the end of 30 min reaction 1 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h 2 so 4 ho so 4 2 oh 3 2 degradation pathway of p asa and arsenic species transformation the concentration of p asa nh4 organic degradation products and arsenic species p asa as iii and as v were monitored during the fe ii pds process at ph 3 in order to detect the intermediate products the concentration of p asa was increased to 20 μm 4 times while the concentrations of fe ii pds were halved to 50 μm 75 μm fig 2 a σ 3 0 showed that along with the degradation of p asa the concentration of p aminophenol p ap and as iii increased firstly and then decreased followed by the increase of nh4 p benzoquinone p bq and as v indicating that p asa was first degraded into p ap and as iii which were further oxidized to p bq and as v considering the low concentration of p hydroquinone p hq detected in the experiment fig 2a and its instability to convert to p bq li et al 2017c a general pathway about the transformation of p asa and the aromatic products at ph 3 during fe ii pds process is proposed in fig 2c this proposal was consistent with previous reports that the much higher electron density in the para position of the aniline aromatic ring made it more susceptible to the attack by free radicals and 1o2 to form a para hydroxylation product p ap xie et al 2016 p ap could be further oxidized to p bq via the formation of p hq by sonolysis o3 he et al 2007 photo fenton fukushima et al 2000 persulfate catalytic oxidation li et al 2017c processes moreover benzene ring structure of p bq would be opened by an oxidation process to form small molecular organics e g acetic acid and formic acid these small molecules would be further degraded into co2 and h2o fukushima et al 2000 li et al 2017c or volatilized into air leading to the decrease of toc by 19 4 at the end of 60 min fig 2a nh4 was relatively stable in the solution he et al 2007 and the total nitrogen content of p ap p asa and nh4 was basically conserved fig 2a indicating that nh4 was the final species of nitrogen previous studies showed that the aso oh 2 group would be cleaved from the aromatic ring of p asa in the form of arsenite h3aso3 czaplicka et al 2014 wang and cheng 2015 and as iii could be easily oxidized to as v to achieve higher removal guan et al 2009 zhang et al 2007 in this study as iii was detected at the beginning and then disappeared as v was existed throughout the experimental process and gradually increased accompanied by the degradation of p asa and the decrease of as iii fig 2a and b the basic conservation of total arsenic in fig 2a indicated that no other forms of arsenic existed during the degradation of p asa these results suggested that the aso oh 2 group was oxidized and cleaved from the aromatic ring of p asa in the form of as iii then as iii was rapidly oxidized to as v thus a general pathway involving mineralization of p asa to co2 as v and nh4 at ph 3 by fe ii pds process was also included in fig 2c 3 3 removal of arsenic from solution 3 3 1 the removal efficiency of total arsenic the total arsenic remaining in the filtrate after 60 min of reaction at different ph was tested fe iii i e fecl3 coagulant system with a same amount of fe 100 μm were used as a comparison fig 3 a showed that the total arsenic removal efficiency in fe ii pds system increased with increasing ph until a broad sorption maximum was observed between ph 6 and 7 with more than 98 5 of total arsenic being removed then the removal efficiency decreased with further increasing ph the effect of ph on the removal of total arsenic in fe iii system was similar to that of fe ii pds system while the maximum removal efficiency of total arsenic 64 1 in fe iii system was appeared at ph 8 and the removal ability was relatively weak at each ph compared to fe ii pds system since the fe iii coagulant remained in the trivalent form fe3 in the studied ph range the equilibria between ferric species was a function of solution ph and total fe concentration rather than oxidation reduction potential the main species of ferric hydroxide with a total iron concentration of 100 μm changed sharply from fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 in the ph range of 3 3 5 to fe oh 3 s at higher ph johnson and amirtharajah 1983 with a point of zero charge around 8 0 wang et al 2013 fe oh 3 was positively charged below ph 8 meanwhile the dominant species for p asa pka1 1 9 pka2 4 1 pka3 9 2 joshi et al 2017b in the solution shifts from h2a to ha2 h3a stands for tribasic acid p asa with the ph increased from 3 to 8 therefore the increase in total arsenic removal by fe iii as the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 resulted primarily from the stronger electrostatic interaction between positively charged ferric hydroxide surface and the deprotonated p asa as well as the relatively strong flocculation ability of ferric hydroxide at high ph jiang and graham 1998 on the other hand the decrease in total arsenic removal at solution ph over 8 could be attributed to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged ferric hydroxide and deprotonated p asa similarly the arsenic removal in fe ii pds system could also be attributed to the following three reasons 1 the electrostatic attraction between the in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides and p asa 2 the electrostatic attraction between the in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides and the negatively charged inorganic arsenic products as iii and as v 3 the flocculation ability of the ferric oxyhydr oxides as shown in fig 3a the total arsenic could not be effectively removed in fe ii pds system under the conditions deemed sufficient for p asa oxidation ph 3 and 4 mainly because the poor precipitation of ferric oxyhydr oxides under acidic conditions raven et al 1998 while at ph 6 7 the total arsenic was almost completely removed in the case of incomplete oxidation of p asa it was unexpected because the previous methods of oxidation adsorption for organic arsenic removal typically pursued complete oxidation to release more as iii and as v which are relatively easy to remove the potentially strong adsorption of p asa by in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides might help to reduce the dependence on oxidation process to examine the adsorption ability of ferric oxyhydr oxides in the absence of system oxidation ability experiment was conducted by starting the fe ii pds process firstly then adding p asa into the system the influence of pre reaction time of fe ii and pds on total arsenic removal efficiency at ph 6 was investigated fig 3b results showed that the removal efficiency of total arsenic greatly decreased without the degradation of p asa indicating the importance of inorganic conversion of p asa in the removal of total arsenic in addition the total arsenic removal efficiency decreased further from 66 2 to 53 2 with the pre reaction time increased from 10 to 60 min but it was still higher than that 29 2 in fe iii coagulation system fig 3b indicating that the in situ generated ferric oxyhydr oxides were more effective in adsorbing p asa than aged iron particles and particles formed directly from fe iii since the xrd fig s4 and sem fig s5 results showed that these iron particles are all amorphous and nano scale some unique characteristics of the in situ generated ferric oxyhydr oxides might lead to its excellent adsorption capacity which would be discussed further in section 3 3 3 in summary a certain degree of p asa degradation and the combined adsorption of as v and p asa by in situ generated ferric oxyhydr oxides might be the reasons for the excellent removal of total arsenic under near neutral conditions 3 3 2 the arsenic species when removing p asa the different arsenic species before and after filtration during the degradation of p asa at ph 5 7 were studied fig 4 showed that the main species of arsenic from 10 to 60 min in fe ii pds system were as v and residual p asa after filtration both the as v and p asa remaining in the filtrate were decreased at ph 5 and almost completely removed at ph 6 and ph 7 fig s6 compared with as v p asa is less toxic but more difficult to remove the excellent total arsenic removal efficiency under incomplete oxidation conditions and the strong adsorption capacity of in situ generated ferric oxyhydr oxides to p asa at near neutral ph seems to be more instructive for practical applications the characteristics of in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides and its combination with as v and p asa were further investigated below 3 3 3 characteristics of the iron particles ftir analysis was used to study the chemical properties of iron particles formed in fe ii pds system at ph 6 with and without p asa fig 5 a fe iii coagulation system and as v in fe ii pds system were also analyzed for comparison compared to the control groups without p asa after adsorption of p asa three new peaks appeared at 830 cm 1 1094 cm 1 and 1594 cm 1 in fe ii pds system and fe iii coagulation system which could be attributed to the vibration of as ofe bond chabot et al 2009 pena et al 2006 c as bond yu et al 2019 and c nh2 bond in p asa respectively the ftir spectra of mno2 in a previous study disclosed that a new peak at 1590 cm 1 appeared after the adsorption of aniline and p asa but not in the case of phenylarsonic acid joshi et al 2017c therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the band shifted from 1586 cm 1 in pure p asa fig s7 to 1594 cm 1 was caused by the c nh2 bond in the adsorbed p asa the appearance of the three characteristic peaks on the ferric oxyhydr oxides indicated that the adsorption of p asa occurred in both the fe ii pds system and the fe iii coagulation system compared with fe iii coagulation system ferric particles in fe ii pds system had three unique peaks at 1125 1050 and 976 cm 1 corresponding to the bending vibration of fe oh after reaction with p asa and as v fig 5a these peaks was weakened while the as o stretching vibration appeared at 830 cm 1 this indicated that p asa and as v were bound as surface complexes probably monodentate complexes for p asa and bidentate complexes for as v depalma et al 2008 rather than a precipitated solid phase during fe ii pds process and the hydroxyl group greatly promoted the removal of arsenic the edge of iron particles in the sem image became clearer after the adsorption of p asa fig s8 which might also indicate the replacement of hydroxyl group by arsenic additionally xps spectra provided further information on the identification of p asa and as v combined with ferric oxyhydr oxides fig 5b as 3d core level photoelectron spectra showed the binding energies of ferric particles generated in fe ii pds system with the presence of as v was 45 4 ev which was in good accordance with the common range of 45 2 45 6 ev as v for the as 3d core level of arsenic oxides sun et al 2018 zhao et al 2012 the binding energies of ferric particles with the presence of p asa in fe iii coagulation system was 44 6 ev as reported the values of the binding energy of the as 3d core level for as iii in arsenic oxides could be shifted up to 44 6 0 13 ev when the arsenic anions or molecules are adsorbed onto solids such as ferric oxyhydroxide or iron oxide ding et al 2000 fan et al 2014 therefore it could be concluded that the valence state of arsenic in p asa after being adsorbed onto the surface of ferric particles was 3 as for the ferric particles generated during the removal of p asa by fe ii pds system the as 3d spectrum could be fitted with two peaks of 45 4 ev as v and 44 6 ev as in p asa respectively indicating that the oxidation product of p asa as v and the residual p asa were both adsorbed on the surface of ferric particles generated in fe ii pds system thereby promoting the removal of total arsenic the xps scan spectra of ferric oxyhydr oxides in situ formed in fe ii pds system was also analyzed fig s9a presented the fe 2p spectrum of ferric oxyhydr oxides and the major peaks at 711 3 ev fe 2p3 2 and 724 7 ev fe 2p1 2 can be attributed to the 3 states of iron martinez et al 2007 in addition the satellite peak of fe 2p3 2 at 719 6 ev was similar to other iron oxide samples of only fe3 states martinez et al 2007 wu et al 2016 the o 1s peaks fig s9b in the spectra of ferric oxyhydr oxides at 530 2 ev and 531 7 ev could be assigned to fe o and fe oh bonds respectively cui et al 2016 wu et al 2016 3 4 effect of background constituents on total arsenic removal background constituents such as dissolved organic matter dom and inorganic ions ubiquitously existing in natural waters would influence the oxidation and adsorption of pollutants brame et al 2015 the effects of na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 co3 2 sio3 2 po4 3 and ha on the removal of total arsenic were investigated at fixed ph of 6 0 0 1 samples were collected at 60 min after the reaction followed by the subsequent processing obviously the coexisting electrolytes of cl so4 2 co3 2 fig 6 a and na ca2 mg2 fig s10 had no significant influence on arsenic removal even at a concentration of 10 mm this is consistent with previous researches on arsenic removal yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 and further confirmed the formation of surface complexes between in situ formed ferric oxy hydroxide and arsenic species depalma et al 2008 however the coexisting of sio3 2 po4 3 and ha negatively influenced the removal of total arsenic fig 6a among all these background constituents po4 3 caused the greatest percentage decrease in arsenic removal even at a very low concentration when the content of sio3 2 po4 3 and ha increased from 0 to 5 mm 0 1 mm and 10 mg c l respectively the removal efficiency of arsenic decreased from 99 1 to 27 6 11 7 and 28 4 respectively fig 6a the zeta potential of ferric oxyhydr oxides was reduced from positive 4 38 mv at control group to negative with the presence of sio3 2 po4 3 and ha fig 6b the electrostatic repulsion among negatively charged ferric oxyhydr oxides and negatively charged arsenic species ha2 and haso4 2 at ph 6 would decrease the removal efficiency of total arsenic and inhibit the aggregation of ferric nanoparticles into floc fig s11 yang et al 2018 moreover in the case of sio3 2 and po4 3 some insoluble fe2 species would be formed resulting in a decrease in the utilization rate of fe ii for activating pds thereby reducing the removal efficiency of p asa besides the similar structure and chemical reactivity of po4 3 and sio3 2 with aso4 3 might also contributed to the decrease of arsenic removal through competitive adsorption chen and huang 2012 sun et al 2018 as the scavenger of oh and s o 4 ha could compete with p asa for o and thus decrease the oxidation efficiency of p asa fig s12 and subsequent adsorption efficiency conclusively these background components resulted in a reduction of the removal efficiency of p asa to 64 3 in natural water fig 6a 4 conclusions fe ii pds process with excellent oxidizing ability and simultaneous adsorption capacity by in situ formation of ferric oxyhydr oxides was developed for the removal of p arsanilic acid p asa for the first time the following conclusions were drawn the ph value of the solution and the dosages of fe ii and pds significantly influenced the performance of p asa oxidation the optimum conditions for the oxidation of 5 μm p asa were found to be 100 μm fe ii and 150 μm pds with a decreasing k obs from 8 19 10ˆ 2 s 1 at ph 3 to 0 3 10ˆ 2 s 1 at ph 9 a conversion mechanism of p asa involving as iii as v p ap p hq p bq nh4 small molecular acids and co2 was proposed based on the results of oxidation experiments solution ph sio3 2 po4 3 and ha affected the removal of total arsenic mainly by affecting the zeta potential and flocculation characteristics of ferric oxyhydr oxides while the fe ii pds system showed strong resistance to the interference from common cations e g na ca2 mg2 and anions e g cl so4 2 co3 2 the inorganic transformation of p asa during fe ii pds process contributed to the removal of total arsenic but the optimum conditions for p asa degradation was not the best conditions for total arsenic removal the combined adsorption of as v products and residual p asa by in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides under near neutral conditions without complete degradation of p asa might make the fe ii pds process more instructive for practical applications

17942,as a common animal feed additive p arsanilic acid p asa is thought to be excreted with little uptake and unchanged chemical structure threatening the environment by potentially releasing more toxic inorganic arsenic we herein investigated the removal of arsenic by in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides with the promotion of p asa degradation in fe ii peroxydisulfate pds system results showed that under acid conditions p asa degraded very quickly and over 99 of p asa 5 μm was degraded within 10 min at the optimal dosage of fe ii 100 μm and pds 150 μm at ph 3 while less than 66 4 of arsenic was removed at ph 3 5 higher ph 3 7 would inhibit the degradation of p asa but promote the arsenic removal at ph 6 7 over 98 5 of total arsenic was removed while the degradation efficiency of p asa was lower than 52 4 hplc icp ms results indicated that the arsenic group was cleaved from p asa in the form of as iii and then rapidly oxidized to as v ftir and xps analysis indicated that both as v products and residual p asa were bonded to ferric oxyhydr oxides via hydroxyl groups common cations e g na ca2 mg2 and anions such as cl so4 2 co3 2 had no significant influence on arsenic removal while sio3 2 po4 3 and ha inhibited the removal of total arsenic mainly by affecting the zeta potential of iron particles in summary the fe ii pds process as an efficient method for partial oxidation and simultaneous adsorption of p asa under near neutral conditions is expected to control the potential environmental risks of p asa graphical abstract image 1 keywords p arsanilic acid p asa fe ii peroxydisulfate arsenate in situ adsorption oxidation ferric oxyhydr oxides 1 introduction as a kind of phenylarsonic acid compounds p arsanilic acid 4 aminophenylarsonic p asa has been widely used as animal feed additives to promote growth control coccidial intestinal parasites and improve meat pigmentation for several decades fan et al 2018 it is barely metabolized in the animal bodies and is almost completely excreted via manure and urine aschbacher and feil 1991 studies estimated that over thousands of tons of phenylarsonic acid compounds were released into the environment through litter storage in weather exposed windrows manure application on agriculture land and animal wastes disposal from swine and poultry farming han et al 2004 2017 makris et al 2008 although p asa has low toxicity it can be bio and non biodegraded into more toxic inorganic arsenic species as iii and as v to cause arsenic contamination in aquatic systems and pose human health risk sapkota et al 2007 in the pearl river delta of southern china arsenic content was found to be elevated compared to the local background and p asa was detected at concentrations up to 771 μg kg 1 in the surface soils surrounding swine farms liu et al 2013 therefore it is desirable to develop an efficient method to achieve effective p asa removal and avoid secondary pollution caused by inorganic arsenic release simultaneously since adsorption is regarded as the best available technology for inorganic arsenic removal in community scale water supply systems joshi et al 2017a sarker et al 2017 several adsorbents have been exploited for the p asa removal including metal oxides feooh al2o3 and fe mn oxides chen and huang 2012 joshi et al 2017a metal organic framework ml 101 sarker et al 2017 and zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 jung et al 2015 all of them demonstrated high adsorption performances towards p asa but it usually takes several hours to reach the adsorption equilibrium and the removal efficiency by metal based adsorbents for p asa is generally lower than for inorganic as v table s1 other studies have also reported that organic arsenic is much more difficult to remove by the common adsorption precipitation or coagulation than inorganic arsenic depalma et al 2008 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the complexity of molecular stereostructure and the increase in molecular weight caused by organic groups in organic arsenic may be the main reasons zhang et al 2018 adsorption studies of monomethylarsonic acid mma and dimethylarsinic acid dma on fe oxyhydr oxides lafferty and loeppert 2005 and titanium dioxide jing et al 2005 revealed that the degree of methylation and oxidation state of arsenic in these compounds affected their binding affinities and geometry of surface complexes depalma et al 2008 therefore liberating the arsenic groups from organoarsenic framework by an oxidation strategy and then adsorbing the released arsenic seems to be a promising method for p asa removal up to now such a two step synergistic combination of oxidation adsorption has been widely investigated under optimized conditions p asa 10 mg as l 1 could be completely oxidized to as v within 30 min by fenton process and the newly released as v can be subsequently removed by ferric hydroxide xie et al 2016 a permanganate oxidation and ferric ion precipitation process reported that 99 of p asa could be degraded within 35 min and the residual arsenic could be adsorbed by fe oh 3 precipitate formed from fecl3 xie et al 2019 cuo fe3o4 nanocomposites were applied as visible light catalysts for p asa degradation the p asa could be oxidized completely and about 95 of released arsenic ions could be anchored on the solid surface sun et al 2018 recently a study found that over 90 of p asa could be oxidized into as v within 1 min in ph 7 0 and 7 5 by ferrate and the released as v could be eliminated by in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides through surface adsorption yang et al 2018 owing to the prominent role that fe played for p asa removal in the mentioned methods they can be summarized as fe based oxidation adsorption peroxydisulfate pds based chemical oxidation processes are gaining more interest in recent years as one of the most commonly used sulfate radical s o 4 source pds can be activated by uv luo et al 2019 heat liang and su 2009 carbon based materials yao et al 2016 nano zero valent iron wacławek et al 2018 metal oxide wang and wang 2018a and transition metals matzek and carter 2016 miralles cuevas et al 2017 among them fe ii has been widely studied due to its high efficiency relative nontoxicity low cost and environmentally friendly nature han et al 2015 wang et al 2018b the fe ii pds system has shown excellent performance in remediating polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated soils tang et al 2015 and eliminating bisphenol a yang 2015 indomethacin li et al 2017a and antibiotic levofloxacin epold et al 2015 in water compared with the strong oxidative ability of fe ii pds the fate of fe ii during the reaction process is rarely noticed some researchers reported the formation of ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 at neutral ph in fe ii pds system and treated it as a limiting factor for the fe ii catalysis ignoring its good adsorption and precipitation properties amina et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 considering the strong oxidizing properties of active component o i e s o 4 yang et al 2019 and or fe iv wang et al 2018b in fe ii pds system and the strong adsorption properties of ferric oxy hydroxide especially for inorganic arsenic fe ii pds process might be a simple and efficient strategy to exhaustively eliminate p asa contamination from water therefore in this study we are focused on the arsenic removal performance and removal form in fe ii pds system and the oxidation performance and the degradation pathway of p asa given the high toxicity of arsenic we mainly studied the arsenic transformation pathway and valence change of arsenic the precipitate containing arsenic was also carefully analyzed in addition we further investigated the effects of some common anions cations and humic acids on the removal of p asa using fe ii pds process as well as the removal of p asa in natural water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents p arsanilic acid p asa c6h8asno3 98 and p

water 2 2 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted in 50 ml glass flasks under constant magnetic stirring at 800 r min and the temperature was controlled at 25 c with a water bath the initial concentration of p asa was 5 μm unless otherwise stated reaction were initiated by simultaneously adding solutions of pds and feso4 at the pre determined dosages samples were periodically collected and immediately quenched with methanol for subsequent kinetics and products analysis to track the arsenic removal the sample collected at fixed time intervals was filtered through a nylon

investigated by experiments carried out in the presence of these background constituents at preset concentrations the removal of p asa in natural water samples was carried out in songhua river heilongjiang china water with an additional design amount of p asa detailed natural water quality information can be found in table s2 all experiments were performed at 25 1 c in triplicates n 3 and the mean values with standard deviations σ or one example of the three repeated experiment results were presented 2 3 analytical methods p asa and its organic degradation products were identified and

retention times for standard solution of as iii as v and p asa were 2 5 4 6 and 12 2 min fig s2 the concentrations of arsenic species were calculated based on the corresponding chromatogram peak areas and standard curves established with the respective standards two ion chromatographs ic were used for the determination of nh4 dionex ics 2100 thermo usa formic acid and acetic acid dionex integrion hpic thermo usa released during fe ii pds oxidation of p asa respectively nh4 in the solution was eluted on an ionpac cs12a cation exchange column 4 250 mm with 20 0 mm ch3so3h at 1 0 ml min 1 while formic acid and acetic acid were eluted on an ionpac as11 anion exchange column 4 250 mm with 10 0 mm koh at 0 6 ml min 1 the total organic carbon toc of the treated solution was measured on a toc

su8000 japan xrd x pert pro panalytical holland and xps axis ultra dld kratos england 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of p asa in fe ii pds system the degradation efficiency of p asa by fe ii pds system under different dosages of pds and fe ii were investigated to find the optimum molar ratio fig 1 a and b the corresponding kinetic data was shown in fig s3 fig 1a showed that the degradation efficiency within 10 min increased from 0 7 to 100 with the increasing dosage of pds from 0 μm to 150 μm at a fixed fe ii dosage of 100 μm while little enhancement occurred with the continual increment of pds thus pds at 150 μm appeared to be sufficient for the degradation of p asa at the tested concentration which was almost completely degraded within 10 min with a fixed pds dosage of 100 μm the degradation efficiency of p asa at 10 min first increased from 8 8 to 98 2 as the fe ii concentration increased from 0 μm to 75 μm and then gradually decreased with further increase of fe ii dosage fig 1b previous studies have revealed that the catalytic generation of more active oxidative species o by the larger amounts of fe ii 0 75 μm contributed to the enhanced degradation of p asa while the competitive scavenging of o by the excess fe ii at a concentration above 100 μm led to the reduced degradation of p asa epold et al 2015 li et al 2017b wang et al 2018 therefore 75 μm fe ii was most effective to catalyze 100 μm pds for p asa degradation close to the ratio of 150 μm pds to 100 μm fe ii in fig 1a in summary the above results indicated that an efficient rapid and almost complete degradation of 5 μm p asa could be achieved by fe ii pds process with 100 μm fe ii and 150 μm pds fe ii pds molar ratio of 1 1 5 at ph 3 within 10 min the optimum dosage of fe ii and pds obtained from the above conclusion was used for all subsequent experiments in this study the ph value of the solution is known to be an important parameter affecting degradation of organic pollutants by fe ii pds process matzek and carter 2016 therefore the effect of solution ph on the degradation efficiency and kinetics of p asa in fe ii pds system was also evaluated obviously the degradation rate and efficiency of p asa decreased with increasing ph fig 1c and the normalized remaining concentration c c0 vs reaction time t in the first 18 s exhibited a good fit to a pseudo first order model by logarithmic regression analysis fig 1d data presented in table s3 there was almost no p asa residue 0 within 30 min at ph 3 whereas the residual percentage increased to 20 2 43 8 38 0 and 61 7 at the ph of 4 5 6 and 7 fig 1c respectively along with the decrease of k obs 10ˆ 2 s 1 from 8 19 at ph 3 to 1 09 at ph 7 fig 1d the decrease of p asa degradation with the increasing ph increasing from 3 to 7 might be attributed to the intense iron precipitation under higher ph conditions and self dissociation of pds through non radical pathways han et al 2015 li et al 2017b when ph was over 7 fe iv one of the possible active oxidative species in fe ii pds system would self decompose wang et al 2018 or hydrolyze rapidly jacobsen 1998 making it unable to oxidize p asa the generated s o 4 might undergo reactions with h2o and oh in accordance with eqs 1 and 2 respectively to generate oh the small amount of oh which would be scavenged by various ions in solution e g so4 2 liang et al 2007 might lead to the slight degradation of p asa 20 5 and 6 2 under alkaline conditions ph 8 and 9 at the end of 30 min reaction 1 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h 2 so 4 ho so 4 2 oh 3 2 degradation pathway of p asa and arsenic species transformation the concentration of p asa nh4 organic degradation products and arsenic species p asa as iii and as v were monitored during the fe ii pds process at ph 3 in order to detect the intermediate products the concentration of p asa was increased to 20 μm 4 times while the concentrations of fe ii pds were halved to 50 μm 75 μm fig 2 a σ 3 0 showed that along with the degradation of p asa the concentration of p aminophenol p ap and as iii increased firstly and then decreased followed by the increase of nh4 p benzoquinone p bq and as v indicating that p asa was first degraded into p ap and as iii which were further oxidized to p bq and as v considering the low concentration of p hydroquinone p hq detected in the experiment fig 2a and its instability to convert to p bq li et al 2017c a general pathway about the transformation of p asa and the aromatic products at ph 3 during fe ii pds process is proposed in fig 2c this proposal was consistent with previous reports that the much higher electron density in the para position of the aniline aromatic ring made it more susceptible to the attack by free radicals and 1o2 to form a para hydroxylation product p ap xie et al 2016 p ap could be further oxidized to p bq via the formation of p hq by sonolysis o3 he et al 2007 photo fenton fukushima et al 2000 persulfate catalytic oxidation li et al 2017c processes moreover benzene ring structure of p bq would be opened by an oxidation process to form small molecular organics e g acetic acid and formic acid these small molecules would be further degraded into co2 and h2o fukushima et al 2000 li et al 2017c or volatilized into air leading to the decrease of toc by 19 4 at the end of 60 min fig 2a nh4 was relatively stable in the solution he et al 2007 and the total nitrogen content of p ap p asa and nh4 was basically conserved fig 2a indicating that nh4 was the final species of nitrogen previous studies showed that the aso oh 2 group would be cleaved from the aromatic ring of p asa in the form of arsenite h3aso3 czaplicka et al 2014 wang and cheng 2015 and as iii could be easily oxidized to as v to achieve higher removal guan et al 2009 zhang et al 2007 in this study as iii was detected at the beginning and then disappeared as v was existed throughout the experimental process and gradually increased accompanied by the degradation of p asa and the decrease of as iii fig 2a and b the basic conservation of total arsenic in fig 2a indicated that no other forms of arsenic existed during the degradation of p asa these results suggested that the aso oh 2 group was oxidized and cleaved from the aromatic ring of p asa in the form of as iii then as iii was rapidly oxidized to as v thus a general pathway involving mineralization of p asa to co2 as v and nh4 at ph 3 by fe ii pds process was also included in fig 2c 3 3 removal of arsenic from solution 3 3 1 the removal efficiency of total arsenic the total arsenic remaining in the filtrate after 60 min of reaction at different ph was tested fe iii i e fecl3 coagulant system with a same amount of fe 100 μm were used as a comparison fig 3 a showed that the total arsenic removal efficiency in fe ii pds system increased with increasing ph until a broad sorption maximum was observed between ph 6 and 7 with more than 98 5 of total arsenic being removed then the removal efficiency decreased with further increasing ph the effect of ph on the removal of total arsenic in fe iii system was similar to that of fe ii pds system while the maximum removal efficiency of total arsenic 64 1 in fe iii system was appeared at ph 8 and the removal ability was relatively weak at each ph compared to fe ii pds system since the fe iii coagulant remained in the trivalent form fe3 in the studied ph range the equilibria between ferric species was a function of solution ph and total fe concentration rather than oxidation reduction potential the main species of ferric hydroxide with a total iron concentration of 100 μm changed sharply from fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 in the ph range of 3 3 5 to fe oh 3 s at higher ph johnson and amirtharajah 1983 with a point of zero charge around 8 0 wang et al 2013 fe oh 3 was positively charged below ph 8 meanwhile the dominant species for p asa pka1 1 9 pka2 4 1 pka3 9 2 joshi et al 2017b in the solution shifts from h2a to ha2 h3a stands for tribasic acid p asa with the ph increased from 3 to 8 therefore the increase in total arsenic removal by fe iii as the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 resulted primarily from the stronger electrostatic interaction between positively charged ferric hydroxide surface and the deprotonated p asa as well as the relatively strong flocculation ability of ferric hydroxide at high ph jiang and graham 1998 on the other hand the decrease in total arsenic removal at solution ph over 8 could be attributed to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged ferric hydroxide and deprotonated p asa similarly the arsenic removal in fe ii pds system could also be attributed to the following three reasons 1 the electrostatic attraction between the in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides and p asa 2 the electrostatic attraction between the in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides and the negatively charged inorganic arsenic products as iii and as v 3 the flocculation ability of the ferric oxyhydr oxides as shown in fig 3a the total arsenic could not be effectively removed in fe ii pds system under the conditions deemed sufficient for p asa oxidation ph 3 and 4 mainly because the poor precipitation of ferric oxyhydr oxides under acidic conditions raven et al 1998 while at ph 6 7 the total arsenic was almost completely removed in the case of incomplete oxidation of p asa it was unexpected because the previous methods of oxidation adsorption for organic arsenic removal typically pursued complete oxidation to release more as iii and as v which are relatively easy to remove the potentially strong adsorption of p asa by in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides might help to reduce the dependence on oxidation process to examine the adsorption ability of ferric oxyhydr oxides in the absence of system oxidation ability experiment was conducted by starting the fe ii pds process firstly then adding p asa into the system the influence of pre reaction time of fe ii and pds on total arsenic removal efficiency at ph 6 was investigated fig 3b results showed that the removal efficiency of total arsenic greatly decreased without the degradation of p asa indicating the importance of inorganic conversion of p asa in the removal of total arsenic in addition the total arsenic removal efficiency decreased further from 66 2 to 53 2 with the pre reaction time increased from 10 to 60 min but it was still higher than that 29 2 in fe iii coagulation system fig 3b indicating that the in situ generated ferric oxyhydr oxides were more effective in adsorbing p asa than aged iron particles and particles formed directly from fe iii since the xrd fig s4 and sem fig s5 results showed that these iron particles are all amorphous and nano scale some unique characteristics of the in situ generated ferric oxyhydr oxides might lead to its excellent adsorption capacity which would be discussed further in section 3 3 3 in summary a certain degree of p asa degradation and the combined adsorption of as v and p asa by in situ generated ferric oxyhydr oxides might be the reasons for the excellent removal of total arsenic under near neutral conditions 3 3 2 the arsenic species when removing p asa the different arsenic species before and after filtration during the degradation of p asa at ph 5 7 were studied fig 4 showed that the main species of arsenic from 10 to 60 min in fe ii pds system were as v and residual p asa after filtration both the as v and p asa remaining in the filtrate were decreased at ph 5 and almost completely removed at ph 6 and ph 7 fig s6 compared with as v p asa is less toxic but more difficult to remove the excellent total arsenic removal efficiency under incomplete oxidation conditions and the strong adsorption capacity of in situ generated ferric oxyhydr oxides to p asa at near neutral ph seems to be more instructive for practical applications the characteristics of in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides and its combination with as v and p asa were further investigated below 3 3 3 characteristics of the iron particles ftir analysis was used to study the chemical properties of iron particles formed in fe ii pds system at ph 6 with and without p asa fig 5 a fe iii coagulation system and as v in fe ii pds system were also analyzed for comparison compared to the control groups without p asa after adsorption of p asa three new peaks appeared at 830 cm 1 1094 cm 1 and 1594 cm 1 in fe ii pds system and fe iii coagulation system which could be attributed to the vibration of as ofe bond chabot et al 2009 pena et al 2006 c as bond yu et al 2019 and c nh2 bond in p asa respectively the ftir spectra of mno2 in a previous study disclosed that a new peak at 1590 cm 1 appeared after the adsorption of aniline and p asa but not in the case of phenylarsonic acid joshi et al 2017c therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the band shifted from 1586 cm 1 in pure p asa fig s7 to 1594 cm 1 was caused by the c nh2 bond in the adsorbed p asa the appearance of the three characteristic peaks on the ferric oxyhydr oxides indicated that the adsorption of p asa occurred in both the fe ii pds system and the fe iii coagulation system compared with fe iii coagulation system ferric particles in fe ii pds system had three unique peaks at 1125 1050 and 976 cm 1 corresponding to the bending vibration of fe oh after reaction with p asa and as v fig 5a these peaks was weakened while the as o stretching vibration appeared at 830 cm 1 this indicated that p asa and as v were bound as surface complexes probably monodentate complexes for p asa and bidentate complexes for as v depalma et al 2008 rather than a precipitated solid phase during fe ii pds process and the hydroxyl group greatly promoted the removal of arsenic the edge of iron particles in the sem image became clearer after the adsorption of p asa fig s8 which might also indicate the replacement of hydroxyl group by arsenic additionally xps spectra provided further information on the identification of p asa and as v combined with ferric oxyhydr oxides fig 5b as 3d core level photoelectron spectra showed the binding energies of ferric particles generated in fe ii pds system with the presence of as v was 45 4 ev which was in good accordance with the common range of 45 2 45 6 ev as v for the as 3d core level of arsenic oxides sun et al 2018 zhao et al 2012 the binding energies of ferric particles with the presence of p asa in fe iii coagulation system was 44 6 ev as reported the values of the binding energy of the as 3d core level for as iii in arsenic oxides could be shifted up to 44 6 0 13 ev when the arsenic anions or molecules are adsorbed onto solids such as ferric oxyhydroxide or iron oxide ding et al 2000 fan et al 2014 therefore it could be concluded that the valence state of arsenic in p asa after being adsorbed onto the surface of ferric particles was 3 as for the ferric particles generated during the removal of p asa by fe ii pds system the as 3d spectrum could be fitted with two peaks of 45 4 ev as v and 44 6 ev as in p asa respectively indicating that the oxidation product of p asa as v and the residual p asa were both adsorbed on the surface of ferric particles generated in fe ii pds system thereby promoting the removal of total arsenic the xps scan spectra of ferric oxyhydr oxides in situ formed in fe ii pds system was also analyzed fig s9a presented the fe 2p spectrum of ferric oxyhydr oxides and the major peaks at 711 3 ev fe 2p3 2 and 724 7 ev fe 2p1 2 can be attributed to the 3 states of iron martinez et al 2007 in addition the satellite peak of fe 2p3 2 at 719 6 ev was similar to other iron oxide samples of only fe3 states martinez et al 2007 wu et al 2016 the o 1s peaks fig s9b in the spectra of ferric oxyhydr oxides at 530 2 ev and 531 7 ev could be assigned to fe o and fe oh bonds respectively cui et al 2016 wu et al 2016 3 4 effect of background constituents on total arsenic removal background constituents such as dissolved organic matter dom and inorganic ions ubiquitously existing in natural waters would influence the oxidation and adsorption of pollutants brame et al 2015 the effects of na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 co3 2 sio3 2 po4 3 and ha on the removal of total arsenic were investigated at fixed ph of 6 0 0 1 samples were collected at 60 min after the reaction followed by the subsequent processing obviously the coexisting electrolytes of cl so4 2 co3 2 fig 6 a and na ca2 mg2 fig s10 had no significant influence on arsenic removal even at a concentration of 10 mm this is consistent with previous researches on arsenic removal yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 and further confirmed the formation of surface complexes between in situ formed ferric oxy hydroxide and arsenic species depalma et al 2008 however the coexisting of sio3 2 po4 3 and ha negatively influenced the removal of total arsenic fig 6a among all these background constituents po4 3 caused the greatest percentage decrease in arsenic removal even at a very low concentration when the content of sio3 2 po4 3 and ha increased from 0 to 5 mm 0 1 mm and 10 mg c l respectively the removal efficiency of arsenic decreased from 99 1 to 27 6 11 7 and 28 4 respectively fig 6a the zeta potential of ferric oxyhydr oxides was reduced from positive 4 38 mv at control group to negative with the presence of sio3 2 po4 3 and ha fig 6b the electrostatic repulsion among negatively charged ferric oxyhydr oxides and negatively charged arsenic species ha2 and haso4 2 at ph 6 would decrease the removal efficiency of total arsenic and inhibit the aggregation of ferric nanoparticles into floc fig s11 yang et al 2018 moreover in the case of sio3 2 and po4 3 some insoluble fe2 species would be formed resulting in a decrease in the utilization rate of fe ii for activating pds thereby reducing the removal efficiency of p asa besides the similar structure and chemical reactivity of po4 3 and sio3 2 with aso4 3 might also contributed to the decrease of arsenic removal through competitive adsorption chen and huang 2012 sun et al 2018 as the scavenger of oh and s o 4 ha could compete with p asa for o and thus decrease the oxidation efficiency of p asa fig s12 and subsequent adsorption efficiency conclusively these background components resulted in a reduction of the removal efficiency of p asa to 64 3 in natural water fig 6a 4 conclusions fe ii pds process with excellent oxidizing ability and simultaneous adsorption capacity by in situ formation of ferric oxyhydr oxides was developed for the removal of p arsanilic acid p asa for the first time the following conclusions were drawn the ph value of the solution and the dosages of fe ii and pds significantly influenced the performance of p asa oxidation the optimum conditions for the oxidation of 5 μm p asa were found to be 100 μm fe ii and 150 μm pds with a decreasing k obs from 8 19 10ˆ 2 s 1 at ph 3 to 0 3 10ˆ 2 s 1 at ph 9 a conversion mechanism of p asa involving as iii as v p ap p hq p bq nh4 small molecular acids and co2 was proposed based on the results of oxidation experiments solution ph sio3 2 po4 3 and ha affected the removal of total arsenic mainly by affecting the zeta potential and flocculation characteristics of ferric oxyhydr oxides while the fe ii pds system showed strong resistance to the interference from common cations e g na ca2 mg2 and anions e g cl so4 2 co3 2 the inorganic transformation of p asa during fe ii pds process contributed to the removal of total arsenic but the optimum conditions for p asa degradation was not the best conditions for total arsenic removal the combined adsorption of as v products and residual p asa by in situ formed ferric oxyhydr oxides under near neutral conditions without complete degradation of p asa might make the fe ii pds process more instructive for practical applications

17943,the effects of micro aeration on the performance of anaerobic sequencing batch reactors asbr for blackwater treatment were investigated in this study different micro aeration rates 0 5 10 50 and 150 mg o2 l reactor cycle and their effect on the hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis of blackwater were evaluated and compared at ambient temperature source diverted blackwater toilet water contains high organic contents which can be recovered as biogas previous studies have found that anaerobic digestion of blackwater without micro aeration can only recover upwards of less than 40 of chemical oxygen demand cod to methane at room temperature due to the low hydrolysis rate of biomass content in blackwater this study achieved increases in blackwater hydrolysis from 34 7 to 48 7 and methane production from 39 6 to 50 7 with controlled micro aeration 5 mg o2 l reactor cycle the microbial analysis results showed that hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens e g methanosaeta were in higher abundances in low dose micro aeration reactors 5 and 10 mg o2 l reactor cycle which facilitated syntrophic interactions between microorganisms the relative abundance of oxygen tolerant methanogen such as methanosarcina greatly increased from 1 5 to 11 4 after oxygen injection high oxygen dosages 50 and 150 mg o2 l reactor cycle led to reduced methane production and higher accumulation of volatile fatty acids largely due to the oxygen inhibition on methanogens and degradation of organic matters by aerobic growth and respiration as indicated by the predicted metagenome functions by combining reactor performance results and microbial community analyses this study demonstrated that low dose micro aeration improves blackwater biomethane recovery by enhancing hydrolysis efficiency and promoting the development of a functional microbial population while medium to high dose micro aeration reduced the activities of certain anaerobes it was also observed that medium dose micro aeration maximizes vfa accumulation which may be used in two stage anaerobic digesters graphical abstract image 1 keywords micro aeration methanogenesis blackwater anaerobic digestion microbial community 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad allows for the recovery of valuable compounds such as biogas and volatile fatty acids from organic wastes ad has been widely employed for the treatment of various wastes such as agriculture wastes food wastes and high strength wastewater nag et al 2019 panigrahi et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 however the application of ad for municipal wastewater streams is limited by the low methanogenesis rates due to low organic concentrations and low temperatures huang et al 2019 recent studies applied ad for source diverted blackwater

regards to the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency and methane production oarga mulec et al 2016 pedrouso et al 2020 hydrolysis is considered as the rate limiting step in the blackwater treatment process since the blackwater biomass content is high 25 54 wt of total solids gao et al 2019b rose et al 2015 decomposing of biomass from wastewater can be challenging especially when

zheng et al 2013 thermal pretreatment has also been shown to be effective in improving substrate hydrolysis and the heating energy can be compensated with the combustion of produced methane toutian et al 2020 it can be noted that pretreatments often require high operational costs and intensive energy input energy and cost efficient technologies are still in demand to facilitate ad performance when treating blackwater introducing a small amount of oxygen e g micro aeration was recently proven to be beneficial to the ad treatment by promoting hydrolysis rates duarte et al 2018 fu et al 2016 and was considered as a promising environment friendly pretreatment strategy to enhance methane recovery from recalcitrant wastes nguyen and khanal 2018 oxygen injection can also help to reduce the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfa especially when the loading rate is high nguyen et al 2019 further micro aeration treatment can reduce levels of toxic h2s from the biogas which is a more cost effective 62 cost reduction approach as compared to chemical absorption ramos et al 2014 micro aeration has been applied to different kinds of feedstocks including highly recalcitrant feedstock such as corn straw fu et al 2015 primary sludge diak et al 2013 and co digestion of brown water and food waste lim and wang 2013 where hydrolysis is critical to solubilize complex organics for downstream conversion to our best knowledge no studies to date have investigated the application of micro aeration for low temperature anaerobic treatment of blackwater previously oxygen based applications were often avoided during ad operation because of their potential inhibitory effects on obligate anaerobes however recent studies suggested that some strict anaerobes can also adapt to microaerophilic conditions by producing anti oxidative enzymes or co existing with facultative microorganisms quickly scavenging oxygen angle et al 2017 botheju and bakke 2011 the balance between these syntrophic microorganisms needs to be maintained by precise oxygen dosage control to prevent over aeration that exceeds the anti oxidation capacities in a defined system the effects of micro aeration vary with regards to enhancing hydrolysis controlling vfa accumulation removing hydrogen sulfide and maintaining suitable conditions for methanogenesis depending on the amount of oxygen input deng et al 2009 duarte et al 2018 lim et al 2014 previous studies have primarily focused on the comparison between anaerobic and microaerobic conditions ruan et al 2019 yin et al 2016 many of these studies were conducted in batch reactor mode less than 60 days unable to evaluate the impact of micro aeration on the ad process in long term operation especially with respect to the microbial community structures after long term acclimation nguyen and khanal 2018 this study aims to illustrate the role of micro aeration pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of blackwater the effect of different microaerophilic conditions on the hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis steps were studied microbial networks were also investigated to reveal the fundamental impacts of long term continuously oxygen input on ad performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 blackwater collection and characterization blackwater toilet wastewater was collected from conventional toilets 9 l of water per flush from the university of alberta campus influent and effluent samples were filtered through 0 45 μm nylon membrane filters fisher scientific ca for soluble component analyses total cod and soluble cod after filtration concentrations total solids ts and volatile solids vs were measured according to the standard methods of the american public health association rand et al 1976 acetate propionate and butyrate being the primary vfas were analyzed on a dionex ics 2100 ionic chromatography ic system thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa equipped with a conductivity detector and ionpac as18 analytical column 2 250 mm samples were diluted and filtered through 0 2 μm nylon membrane filters before vfa analysis 2 2 experimental setup and inoculum five semi continuous anaerobic sequencing batch reactors asbr were made using glass with a diameter of 101 mm and a height of 225 mm and a polypropylene cap inner neck diameter 30 mm the cap had three ports that were fixed with two longer silicone rubber tubing in the liquid phase and one short silicone rubber tubing in the gas phase one of the tubes was connected to a gas diffuser submerged in the liquid phase for aeration the second was used to take liquid samples and the third for pressure detection and gas sampling all ports were fixed with plastic valves at the upper end the semi continuous asbrs were inoculated with 0 5 g vs reactor 100 ml reactor of digested sludge and 0 5 g vs reactor 130 ml reactor of waste activated sludge to ensure both anaerobes and aerobes were present in the system reactors were operated at room temperature 22 c all reactors were placed in a shaker at 120 rpm there were five parallel reactors including anr 5 mar 10 mar 50 mar and 150 mar representing the anaerobic reactor anr with no o2 treatment and micro aerobic reactors with gradient aeration levels mar with 5 10 50 and 150 mg o2 l reactor cycle respectively the reactors were operated for 100 days during which time the performance was evaluated at four different hrts 5 4 3 and 2 days corresponding to stages i iv respectively each cycle consisted of the following steps filling 5 min including feeding and air injection reaction from 2 to 5 days settling 30 min and discharging 5 min the gas composition analysis was conducted at the end of settling the exchange ratio was 70 of the working volume 2 3 analysis methods the oxidation reduction potential orp level was measured in the reactors right after air injection to determine the tendency of the aqueous solution in the reactors to accept or donate electrons orp can reflect small changes in oxygen concentration which are below the detection limit of dissolved oxygen do probes 0 1 mg l which corresponds to 50 mv and was therefore used in place of do orp was measured by a portable orp meter milwaukee mw500 the ph was measured with a ph meter b40pcid vwr symphony methane production was assessed by measuring the headspace pressure using a pressure meter ghm 3151 germany and the composition of biogas using gas chromatography gc 7890b agilent technologies usa for each gas detection biogas in reactor headspace was mixed and then withdrawn with a gas tight syringe t test was applied to determine the significance level using microsoft excel software a p value smaller than 0 05 is considered as statistically significant difference 2 4 microbial analysis dna extraction was performed for the inoculum sludge and sludge in all asbrs at the end of the experiment using the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen hilden germany according to the manufacturer s protocol sludge was sampled three times in one cycle well mixed and then centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min to obtain representative sludge samples rosenkranz et al 2013 the pellet was used for dna extraction the extracted dna concentration and quality were examined by nanodrop one thermofisher waltham ma usa and gel electrophoresis pcr was performed followed by sequencing on the illumina miseq platform the 16s rrna genes were amplified using the universal primer pair 515f gtgccagcmgccgcgg and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat sequence analysis was performed using the qiime2 dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 caporaso et al 2010 with 99 similarity with reference to the greengenes database version 13 8 mcdonald et al 2012 werner et al 2012 alpha and beta diversities and principal coordinates analysis pcoa using bray curtis distance were performed using the vegan package jari oksanen et al 2017 in rstudio version 3 4 1 the predicted metagenome and functional genes were determined using the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust langille et al 2013 correlation was computed using the r corrplot package using pearson s product moment correlation test wei and simko 2017 3 results 3 1 blackwater characterization and reactor performances the characteristics of blackwater from toilets on campus varied slightly in every collection the total chemical oxygen demand tcod of the blackwater was 1000 70 mg l and the corresponding soluble chemical oxygen demand scod of the fresh blackwater was 296 74 mg l accounting for 20 30 of tcod the blackwater ph varied from 7 2 to 8 0 depending on the storage time and the solubilization of the feedstock the total ammonia nitrogen tan total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations are shown in table s1 the five asbrs operated with different levels of air injection were operated for 100 days under four different hrt conditions initially set as 5 days then gradually shortened 1 day at a time to 2 days the impact of micro aeration treatment on hydrolysis is shown in fig 1 a despite the relatively large standard deviation observed due to the fluctuate blackwater quality statistical analysis results demonstrated the impacts of micro aeration on blackwater digestibility p 0 05 for all hrt conditions the low dose micro aeration in 5 mar 5 mg o2 l reactor cycle resulted in the highest hydrolysis rates when compared to the no micro aeration condition anr and micro aeration at higher dosages 10 mar 50 mar and 150 mar this indicates that low dose micro aeration can enhance hydrolysis efficiency as the micro aeration dose increased there was a decreasing trend in the hydrolysis rate in particular under stage iv hrt of 2 days the 5 mar and 10 mar reactors had significantly higher p 0 01 hydrolysis efficiencies 48 7 3 3 for 5 mar and 39 9 5 8 for 10 mar as compared to the anr 34 7 3 7 under this condition the 50 mar exhibited a comparable hydrolysis efficiency 37 7 5 6 as compared to anr p 0 01 while higher micro aeration doses i e 150 mar with 25 1 6 5 led to a significant reduction in hydrolysis efficiency p 0 01 the stabilized methanogenesis efficiency in each stage of the operation is shown in fig 1b reactor orp values are provided in fig s1b for all five reactors the methanogenesis rate increased with a reduction in hrt this observation may be attributed to the establishment of more efficient methanogen communities at higher organic loading rates similar to results reported previously lim and wang 2013 ramos and fdz polanco 2013 at the end of stage iv the methanogenesis efficiency reached 50 5 and 46 1 in 5 mar and 10 mar respectively higher than that in anr 39 9 however significantly lower methanogenesis efficiencies were observed in the 50 mar 19 3 and 150 mar 24 6 reactors likely due to the inhibitory effect of increased oxygen dosage to methanogens although the effluent orp of all five reactors was maintained below 300 mv under all conditions the reduced methanogenesis rates at higher micro aeration dosages indicate relatively higher orp as shown in fig s1b had a considerable impact on methanogen activities the effects of micro aeration intensity on effluent vfa concentrations are shown in fig 1c detailed information on vfa compositions and reactor ph changes are provided in figs s2 and s1a as shown in fig 1c effluent vfa concentrations exhibited decreasing trends as the hrt was reduced from stage i to iv correlating with the increasing methanogenesis efficiencies discussed above the 50 mar condition showed the highest vfa accumulatio in all stages also correlating to the lowest methanogenesis activities in 50 mar fig 1b possibly due to the vfa inhibition of methanogens in stage iv 50 mar had the highest vfa concentration 324 5 4 5 mg l which was more than three times higher than that observed in anr 5 mar and 10 mar and was slightly higher than the vfas produced from 150 mar 199 1 mg l as compared to the 150 mar 50 mar had higher hydrolysis efficiency but lower methanogenesis efficiency both contributing to the higher vfa accumulation the acidogenesis efficiency accounting for the proportion transformed to methane is shown in fig 1d the acidogenesis efficiency was significantly higher p 0 01 in 5 mar 10 mar and 50 mar 54 1 2 3 45 4 4 7 and 55 0 0 9 in last stage respectively as compared to anr 38 0 2 2 this indicates that micro aeration at relatively lower dosages improved acidogenesis further since the different component is mainly acetate supplementary fig s2 it reveals that the acetogenesis step of anaerobic digestion can also be enhanced 3 2 microbial community analysis the microbial community alpha diversity and number of different genera which indicates community richness is shown in fig 2 a for bacteria and archaea both bacterial and archaeal communities exhibited a decreasing trend with the increasing oxygen dosage which may be explained by the inhibitory effects of oxygen on some of the obligate anaerobic microorganisms the pcoa of bray curtis distance fig 2b shows that bacterial and archaeal communities were clustered into an anr 5 mar and 10 mar group and 50 mar and 150 mar group and shifted away from the inoculum community the clustering pattern is in close relation to the methanogenesis efficiency pattern fig 1b where anr 5 mar and 10 mar showed similar values while 50 mar and 150 mar showed impaired levels of methanogenesis the total abundance ratios of archaea and bacteria showed a decreasing trend with increasing oxygen dosage fig 2b which further confirmed that oxygen has an inhibitory effect on methanogens the comparison of archaeal genera composition is shown in fig 3 the anr 5 mar and 10 mar were dominated by methanosaeta which is an acetoclastic methanogen the abundance of methanosaeta was remarkably lower at higher micro aeration dosage conditions 50 mar and 150 mar in comparison methanosarcina which can utilize both acetate and h2 co2 to produce methane was less affected by the oxygen dosage the decreasing order of the sum of methanosaeta and methanosarcina abundances in 5 mar 10 mar anr 150 mar and 50 mar is well correlated with methanogenesis efficiencies at the final steady state on the other hand methanospirillum a hydrogenotrophic strain had a higher abundance in the higher oxygen dosage reactors 50 mar and 150 mar indicating that hydrogenotrophic methanogens may have a higher tolerance to oxygen and thus become the dominant methane production pathway under higher oxygen levels further f methanomassiliicoccaceae was present in all reactors but also higher in these two reactors 41 in 50 mar and 35 in 150 mar indicating that obligately methylotrophic may proliferate under higher oxygen conditions the bacterial composition at the family level of the most abundant 10 families in each reactor is shown in fig 3b 5 mar and 10 mar shared similar abundances of bacterial families while the 50 mar and 150 mar shared similar abundances one unidentified family in the order bacteroidales o bacteroidales 2 and desulfomicrobiaceae were highly enriched in 5 mar 26 and 17 respectively and 10 mar 18 and 16 respectively bacteroidales makes up a significant portion of fecal bacterial population ridley et al 2014 and have been reported to function as hydrolytic fermentative bacteria of large macromolecules such as cellulose and protein azman et al 2017 yi et al 2014 the enrichment of these fermenters and sulfate reducing bacteria in low micro aeration intensity reactors may be attributed to enhanced substrate provided by hydrolysis at higher oxygen dosages certain families showed increased abundance including sb 1 from the phylum bacteroidetes one unidentified family in the order sha 98 from the phylum firmicutes rhodocyclaceae one unidentified family in the order thiobacterales geobacteraceae from the phylum proteobacteria and cloacamonaceae from the phylum wwe1 bacteroidetes is a broad group of microorganisms that mainly ferment polysaccharides or carbohydrates braz et al 2019 5 mar 10 mar and 50 mar all showed higher bacteroidetes levels 45 44 and 43 respectively compared to anr 37 which correlates well with the hydrolysis activities observed the increase of cloacamonaceae may be related to the vfa accumulation in 50 mar and 150 mar since these microorganisms may ferment amino acids and syntrophically oxidize propionate braz et al 2019 goux et al 2015 decreasing trends in abundance with increasing oxygen dosage were observed in the families sediment 4 and spirochaetaceae phylum spirochaetes ellin515 and rfp12 phylum verrucomicrobia and one unidentified family in the phylum zb3 indicating their inhibited activity under high oxygen dosage the metagenome and functional genes were predicted from the 16s rrna gene amplicon data using a reference database langille et al 2013 different oxygen dosages promoted different functional groups as shown in fig 4 in the metabolism function group 50 mar showed the highest prevalence of the biosynthesis and metabolism of glycan and the metabolism of carbohydrates nucleotides terpenoids polyketides cofactors vitamins and lipids which can be associated with the high vfa production and accumulation in 50 mar the 50 mar reactor also exhibited the highest prevalence of genetic information processing functions of replication and repair translation folding sorting and degradation which could be triggered by the acidic environment resulting from vfa accumulation the highest oxygen dosage 150 mar improved functions of xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism as well as signal transduction and membrane transport which require sufficient energy and maybe promoted at higher orp fig s1b moreover cell mobility growth and death functional genes were the highest in 150 mar indicating active growth of cells which may have resulted from the promoted activity of aerobic microorganisms 3 3 correlation between parameters fig 5 depicts the pearson s product moment correlation matrix between oxygen dosage and reactor performance effluent vfas effluent scod methanogenesis hydrolysis and acidogenesis ph and archaea bacteria ratio and the significance level p 0 05 of the correlation oxygen dosage had a significant negative correlation with the hydrolysis and acidogenesis efficiencies further higher oxygen dosages were significantly negatively correlated with methanogenesis ph and archaea ratio resulting in higher effluent vfas and scod since the methanogenesis was inhibited and organic substrates were accumulated fig 5 shows a significant positive correlation between effluent vfas and scod since the scod was primarily composed of fermented substrates methanogenesis was significantly negatively correlated with effluent vfas and scod because the vfas and scod were either transformed to methane or accumulated in the reactor a positive correlation cluster between methanogenesis hydrolysis acidogenesis ph and archaea ratio is shown in the lower part of fig 5 indicating that the biochemical reactions in anaerobic digestion process are interrelated this emphasizes the importance of maintaining an appropriate ph and archaea ratio 4 discussion 4 1 balance between anaerobic and aerobic activities low oxygen dosages could promote hydrolysis and acidogenesis bacterial activity the growth of bacteroidetes was enhanced at lower oxygen dosages compared to anaerobic conditions fig 3b large molecules were broken down into smaller molecules such as tyrosine fig s3 by manipulating the oxygen level in the extracellular environment intracellular metabolic pathways and oxidation related gene expressions of microbes can also be changed liu et al 2013 the predicted

17943,the effects of micro aeration on the performance of anaerobic sequencing batch reactors asbr for blackwater treatment were investigated in this study different micro aeration rates 0 5 10 50 and 150 mg o2 l reactor cycle and their effect on the hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis of blackwater were evaluated and compared at ambient temperature source diverted blackwater toilet water contains high organic contents which can be recovered as biogas previous studies have found that anaerobic digestion of blackwater without micro aeration can only recover upwards of less than 40 of chemical oxygen demand cod to methane at room temperature due to the low hydrolysis rate of biomass content in blackwater this study achieved increases in blackwater hydrolysis from 34 7 to 48 7 and methane production from 39 6 to 50 7 with controlled micro aeration 5 mg o2 l reactor cycle the microbial analysis results showed that hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens e g methanosaeta were in higher abundances in low dose micro aeration reactors 5 and 10 mg o2 l reactor cycle which facilitated syntrophic interactions between microorganisms the relative abundance of oxygen tolerant methanogen such as methanosarcina greatly increased from 1 5 to 11 4 after oxygen injection high oxygen dosages 50 and 150 mg o2 l reactor cycle led to reduced methane production and higher accumulation of volatile fatty acids largely due to the oxygen inhibition on methanogens and degradation of organic matters by aerobic growth and respiration as indicated by the predicted metagenome functions by combining reactor performance results and microbial community analyses this study demonstrated that low dose micro aeration improves blackwater biomethane recovery by enhancing hydrolysis efficiency and promoting the development of a functional microbial population while medium to high dose micro aeration reduced the activities of certain anaerobes it was also observed that medium dose micro aeration maximizes vfa accumulation which may be used in two stage anaerobic digesters graphical abstract image 1 keywords micro aeration methanogenesis blackwater anaerobic

employed for the treatment of various wastes such as agriculture wastes food wastes and high strength wastewater nag et al 2019 panigrahi et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 however the application of ad for municipal wastewater streams is limited by the low methanogenesis rates due to low organic concentrations and low temperatures huang et al 2019 recent studies applied ad for source diverted blackwater

regards to the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency and methane production oarga mulec et al 2016 pedrouso et al 2020 hydrolysis is considered as the rate limiting step in the blackwater

zheng et al 2013 thermal pretreatment has also been shown to be effective in improving substrate hydrolysis and the heating energy can be compensated with the combustion of produced methane toutian et al 2020 it can be noted that pretreatments often require high operational costs and intensive energy input energy and cost efficient technologies are still in demand to facilitate ad performance when treating blackwater introducing a small amount of oxygen e g micro aeration was recently proven to be beneficial to the ad treatment by promoting hydrolysis rates duarte et al 2018 fu et al 2016 and

accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfa especially when the loading rate is high nguyen et al 2019 further micro aeration treatment can reduce levels of toxic h2s from the biogas which is a more cost effective 62 cost reduction approach as compared to chemical absorption ramos et al 2014 micro aeration has been applied to different kinds of feedstocks including highly recalcitrant feedstock such as corn straw fu et al 2015 primary sludge diak et al 2013 and co digestion of brown water and food waste lim and wang 2013 where hydrolysis is critical to solubilize complex organics for downstream conversion to our best knowledge no studies to date have investigated the application of micro aeration for low temperature anaerobic treatment of blackwater previously oxygen based applications were often avoided during ad operation because of their potential inhibitory effects on obligate anaerobes however recent studies suggested that some strict anaerobes can also adapt to microaerophilic conditions by producing anti oxidative enzymes or co existing with facultative microorganisms quickly scavenging oxygen angle et al 2017 botheju and bakke 2011 the balance between these syntrophic microorganisms needs to be maintained by precise oxygen dosage control to prevent over aeration that exceeds the anti oxidation capacities in a defined system the effects of micro aeration vary with regards to enhancing hydrolysis controlling vfa accumulation removing hydrogen sulfide and maintaining suitable conditions for methanogenesis depending on the amount of oxygen input deng et al 2009 duarte et al 2018 lim et al 2014 previous studies have primarily focused on the comparison between anaerobic and microaerobic conditions ruan et al 2019 yin et al 2016 many of these studies were conducted in batch reactor mode less than 60 days unable to evaluate the impact of micro aeration on the ad process in long term operation especially with respect to the microbial community structures after long term acclimation nguyen and khanal 2018 this study aims to illustrate the role of micro aeration pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of blackwater the effect of different microaerophilic conditions on the hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis steps were studied microbial networks were also investigated to reveal the fundamental impacts of long term continuously

analytical column 2 250 mm samples were diluted and filtered through 0 2 μm nylon membrane filters before vfa analysis 2 2 experimental setup and inoculum five semi continuous anaerobic sequencing batch reactors asbr were made using glass with a diameter of 101 mm and a height of 225 mm and a polypropylene cap inner neck diameter 30 mm the cap had three ports that were fixed with two longer silicone rubber tubing in the liquid phase and one short silicone rubber tubing in the gas phase one of the tubes was connected to a gas diffuser submerged in the liquid phase for aeration the second

reactor 100 ml reactor of digested sludge and 0 5 g vs reactor 130 ml reactor of waste activated sludge to ensure both anaerobes and aerobes were present in the system reactors were operated at room temperature 22 c all reactors were placed in a shaker at 120 rpm there were five parallel reactors including anr 5 mar 10 mar 50 mar and 150 mar representing the anaerobic reactor anr with no o2 treatment and micro aerobic reactors with gradient aeration levels mar with 5 10 50 and 150 mg o2 l reactor cycle respectively the reactors were operated for 100 days during which time the performance was evaluated at four different hrts 5 4 3 and 2 days corresponding to stages i iv respectively each cycle consisted of the following steps filling 5 min including feeding and air injection reaction from 2 to 5 days settling 30 min and discharging 5 min the gas composition analysis was conducted at the end of settling the exchange ratio was 70 of the working volume 2 3 analysis methods the oxidation reduction potential orp level was measured in the reactors right after air injection to determine the tendency of the aqueous solution in the reactors to accept or donate electrons orp can reflect small changes in oxygen concentration which are below the detection limit of dissolved oxygen do probes 0 1 mg l which corresponds to 50 mv and was therefore used in place of do orp was measured by a portable orp meter milwaukee mw500 the ph was measured with a ph meter b40pcid vwr symphony methane production was assessed by measuring the headspace pressure using a pressure meter ghm 3151 germany and the composition of biogas using gas chromatography gc 7890b agilent technologies usa for each gas detection biogas in reactor headspace was mixed and then withdrawn with a gas tight syringe t test was applied to determine the significance level using microsoft excel software a p value smaller than 0 05 is considered as statistically significant difference 2 4 microbial analysis dna extraction was performed for the inoculum sludge and sludge in all asbrs at the end of the experiment using the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen hilden germany according to the manufacturer s protocol sludge was sampled three times in one cycle well mixed and then centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min to obtain representative sludge samples rosenkranz et al 2013 the pellet was used for dna extraction the extracted dna concentration and quality were examined by nanodrop one thermofisher waltham ma usa and gel electrophoresis pcr was performed followed by sequencing on the illumina miseq platform the 16s rrna genes were amplified using the universal primer pair 515f gtgccagcmgccgcgg and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat sequence analysis was performed using the qiime2 dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 caporaso et al 2010 with 99 similarity with reference to the greengenes database version 13 8 mcdonald et al 2012 werner et al 2012 alpha and beta diversities and principal coordinates analysis pcoa using bray curtis distance were performed using the vegan package jari oksanen et al 2017 in rstudio version 3 4 1 the predicted metagenome and functional genes were determined using the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust langille et al 2013 correlation was computed using the r corrplot package using pearson s product moment correlation test wei and simko 2017 3 results 3 1 blackwater characterization and reactor performances the characteristics of blackwater from toilets on campus varied slightly in every collection the total chemical oxygen demand tcod of the blackwater was 1000 70 mg l and the corresponding soluble chemical oxygen demand scod of the fresh blackwater was 296 74 mg l accounting for 20 30 of tcod the blackwater ph varied from 7 2 to 8 0 depending on the storage time and the solubilization of the feedstock the total ammonia nitrogen tan total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations are shown in table s1 the five asbrs operated with different levels of air injection were operated for 100 days under four different hrt conditions initially set as 5 days then gradually shortened 1 day at a time to 2 days the impact of micro aeration treatment on hydrolysis is shown in fig 1 a despite the relatively large standard deviation observed due to the fluctuate blackwater quality statistical analysis results demonstrated the impacts of micro aeration on blackwater digestibility p 0 05 for all hrt conditions the low dose micro aeration in 5 mar 5 mg o2 l reactor cycle resulted in the highest hydrolysis rates when compared to the no micro aeration condition anr and micro aeration at higher dosages 10 mar 50 mar and 150 mar this indicates that low dose micro aeration can enhance hydrolysis efficiency as the micro aeration dose increased there was a decreasing trend in the hydrolysis rate in particular under stage iv hrt of 2 days the 5 mar and 10 mar reactors had significantly higher p 0 01 hydrolysis efficiencies 48 7 3 3 for 5 mar and 39 9 5 8 for 10 mar as compared to the anr 34 7 3 7 under this condition the 50 mar exhibited a comparable hydrolysis efficiency 37 7 5 6 as compared to anr p 0 01 while higher micro aeration doses i e 150 mar with 25 1 6 5 led to a significant reduction in hydrolysis efficiency p 0 01 the stabilized methanogenesis efficiency in each stage of the operation is shown in fig 1b reactor orp values are provided in fig s1b for all five reactors the methanogenesis rate increased with a reduction in hrt this observation may be attributed to the establishment of more efficient methanogen communities at higher organic loading rates similar to results reported previously lim and wang 2013 ramos and fdz polanco 2013 at the end of stage iv the methanogenesis efficiency reached 50 5 and 46 1 in 5 mar and 10 mar respectively higher than that in anr 39 9 however significantly lower methanogenesis efficiencies were observed in the 50 mar 19 3 and 150 mar 24 6 reactors likely due to the inhibitory effect of increased oxygen dosage to methanogens although the effluent orp of all five reactors was maintained below 300 mv under all conditions the reduced methanogenesis rates at higher micro aeration dosages indicate relatively higher orp as shown in fig s1b had a considerable impact on methanogen activities the effects of micro aeration intensity on effluent vfa concentrations are shown in fig 1c detailed information on vfa compositions and reactor ph changes are provided in figs s2 and s1a as shown in fig 1c effluent vfa concentrations exhibited decreasing trends as the hrt was reduced from stage i to iv correlating with the increasing methanogenesis efficiencies discussed above the 50 mar condition showed the highest vfa accumulatio in all stages also correlating to the lowest methanogenesis activities in 50 mar fig 1b possibly due to the vfa inhibition of methanogens in stage iv 50 mar had the highest vfa concentration 324 5 4 5 mg l which was more than three times higher than that observed in anr 5 mar and 10 mar and was slightly higher than the vfas produced from 150 mar 199 1 mg l as compared to the 150 mar 50 mar had higher hydrolysis efficiency but lower methanogenesis efficiency both contributing to the higher vfa accumulation the acidogenesis efficiency accounting for the proportion transformed to methane is shown in fig 1d the acidogenesis efficiency was significantly higher p 0 01 in 5 mar 10 mar and 50 mar 54 1 2 3 45 4 4 7 and 55 0 0 9 in last stage respectively as compared to anr 38 0 2 2 this indicates that micro aeration at relatively lower dosages improved acidogenesis further since the different component is mainly acetate supplementary fig s2 it reveals that the acetogenesis step of anaerobic digestion can also be enhanced 3 2 microbial community analysis the microbial community alpha diversity and number of different genera which indicates community richness is shown in fig 2 a for bacteria and archaea both bacterial and archaeal communities exhibited a decreasing trend with the increasing oxygen dosage which may be explained by the inhibitory effects of oxygen on some of the obligate anaerobic microorganisms the pcoa of bray curtis distance fig 2b shows that bacterial and archaeal communities were clustered into an anr 5 mar and 10 mar group and 50 mar and 150 mar group and shifted away from the inoculum community the clustering pattern is in close relation to the methanogenesis efficiency pattern fig 1b where anr 5 mar and 10 mar showed similar values while 50 mar and 150 mar showed impaired levels of methanogenesis the total abundance ratios of archaea and bacteria showed a decreasing trend with increasing oxygen dosage fig 2b which further confirmed that oxygen has an inhibitory effect on methanogens the comparison of archaeal genera composition is shown in fig 3 the anr 5 mar and 10 mar were dominated by methanosaeta which is an acetoclastic methanogen the abundance of methanosaeta was remarkably lower at higher micro aeration dosage conditions 50 mar and 150 mar in comparison methanosarcina which can utilize both acetate and h2 co2 to produce methane was less affected by the oxygen dosage the decreasing order of the sum of methanosaeta and methanosarcina abundances in 5 mar 10 mar anr 150 mar and 50 mar is well correlated with methanogenesis efficiencies at the final steady state on the other hand methanospirillum a hydrogenotrophic strain had a higher abundance in the higher oxygen dosage reactors 50 mar and 150 mar indicating that hydrogenotrophic methanogens may have a higher tolerance to oxygen and thus become the dominant methane production pathway under higher oxygen levels further f methanomassiliicoccaceae was present in all reactors but also higher in these two reactors 41 in 50 mar and 35 in 150 mar indicating that obligately methylotrophic may proliferate under higher oxygen conditions the bacterial composition at the family level of the most abundant 10 families in each reactor is shown in fig 3b 5 mar and 10 mar shared similar abundances of bacterial families while the 50 mar and 150 mar shared similar abundances one unidentified family in the order bacteroidales o bacteroidales 2 and desulfomicrobiaceae were highly enriched in 5 mar 26 and 17 respectively and 10 mar 18 and 16 respectively bacteroidales makes up a significant portion of fecal bacterial population ridley et al 2014 and have been reported to function as hydrolytic fermentative bacteria of large macromolecules such as cellulose and protein azman et al 2017 yi et al 2014 the enrichment of these fermenters and sulfate reducing bacteria in low micro aeration intensity reactors may be attributed to enhanced substrate provided by hydrolysis at higher oxygen dosages certain families showed increased abundance including sb 1 from the phylum bacteroidetes one unidentified family in the order sha 98 from the phylum firmicutes rhodocyclaceae one unidentified family in the order thiobacterales geobacteraceae from the phylum proteobacteria and cloacamonaceae from the phylum wwe1 bacteroidetes is a broad group of microorganisms that mainly ferment polysaccharides or carbohydrates braz et al 2019 5 mar 10 mar and 50 mar all showed higher bacteroidetes levels 45 44 and 43 respectively compared to anr 37 which correlates well with the hydrolysis activities observed the increase of cloacamonaceae may be related to the vfa accumulation in 50 mar and 150 mar since these microorganisms may ferment amino acids and syntrophically oxidize propionate braz et al 2019 goux et al 2015 decreasing trends in abundance with increasing oxygen dosage were observed in the families sediment 4 and spirochaetaceae phylum spirochaetes ellin515 and rfp12 phylum verrucomicrobia and one unidentified family in the phylum zb3 indicating their inhibited activity under high oxygen dosage the metagenome and functional genes were predicted from the 16s rrna gene amplicon data using a reference database langille et al 2013 different oxygen dosages promoted different functional groups as shown in fig 4 in the metabolism function group 50 mar showed the highest prevalence of the biosynthesis and metabolism of glycan and the metabolism of carbohydrates nucleotides terpenoids polyketides cofactors vitamins and lipids which can be associated with the high vfa production and accumulation in 50 mar the 50 mar reactor also exhibited the highest prevalence of genetic information processing functions of replication and repair translation folding sorting and degradation which could be triggered by the acidic environment resulting from vfa accumulation the highest oxygen dosage 150 mar improved functions of xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism as well as signal transduction and membrane transport which require sufficient energy and maybe promoted at higher orp fig s1b moreover cell mobility growth and death functional genes were the highest in 150 mar indicating active growth of cells which may have resulted from the promoted activity of aerobic microorganisms 3 3 correlation between parameters fig 5 depicts the pearson s product moment correlation matrix between oxygen dosage and reactor performance effluent vfas effluent scod methanogenesis hydrolysis and acidogenesis ph and archaea bacteria ratio and the significance level p 0 05 of the correlation oxygen dosage had a significant negative correlation with the hydrolysis and acidogenesis efficiencies further higher oxygen dosages were significantly negatively correlated with methanogenesis ph and archaea ratio resulting in higher effluent vfas and scod since the methanogenesis was inhibited and organic substrates were accumulated fig 5 shows a significant positive correlation between effluent vfas and scod since the scod was primarily composed of fermented substrates methanogenesis was significantly negatively correlated with effluent vfas and scod because the vfas and scod were either transformed to methane or accumulated in the reactor a positive correlation cluster between methanogenesis hydrolysis acidogenesis ph and archaea ratio is shown in the lower part of fig 5 indicating that the biochemical reactions in anaerobic digestion process are interrelated this emphasizes the importance of maintaining an appropriate ph and archaea ratio 4 discussion 4 1 balance between anaerobic and aerobic activities low oxygen dosages could promote hydrolysis and acidogenesis bacterial activity the growth of bacteroidetes was enhanced at lower oxygen dosages compared to anaerobic conditions fig 3b large molecules were broken down into smaller molecules such as tyrosine fig s3 by manipulating the oxygen level in the extracellular environment intracellular metabolic pathways and oxidation related gene expressions of microbes can also be changed liu et al 2013 the predicted

pennsylvania barbot et al 2013 and can vary from 0 7 to 12 in southwest pennsylvania he et al 2014 lokare et al 2017 black shale the most dominant component of marcellus shale formation is rich with uranium and thorium which makes it a significant source of naturally occurring radioactive material norm that is usually found in produced water rowan et al 2011 the major components of norm in produced water are ra 226 half life of 1600 years and ra 228 half life of 5 75 years which are daughter isotopes of u 238 and th 232 respectively akovali 1996 artna cohen 1997 multiple gas well analyses showed that the total radium concentration i e ra 226 and ra 228 in marcellus shale produced water in pennsylvania can range from 33 to 18 045 pci l while it can be as high as 16 942 pci l in marcellus shale produced water in new york rowan et al 2011 such high norm concentration makes produced water treatment for the recovery of valuable resources i e clean water and salts very challenging produced water management strategy depends largely on the availability of class ii underground injection control wells uic approximately 95 of onshore produced water is disposed i e disposal and enhanced oil recovery in these wells clark and veil 2009 the only exception is marcellus shale play where close to 90 of the flowback and produced water is reused in hydraulic fracturing jiang et al 2014 rassenfoss 2011 however disposal of produced water in class ii wells has been linked with induced seismicity ellsworth 2013 mcgarr et al 2015 thus thermal processes such as evaporation and crystallization may be necessary to recover clean salts and pure water that can be reused in industrial operations these processes however are energy intensive and costly fakhru l razi et al 2009 any solids or sludge generated during produced water treatment would contain norm and would have to be disposed in approved landfills zhang et al 2014 2015 regulations for the disposal of radioactive sludge vary by state but generally limit radioactivity in the range of 5 30 pci g smith 1992 veil et al 1998 recent studies demonstrated the possibility of using a functionalized proppant as an underground filter for norm control goyal et al 2017 gusa 2020 gusa and vidic 2018 mcdaniel and mccrary 2014 to reduce the radioactivity of produced water and reduce its health and environmental risks salts i e chlorides that can be recovered from the produced water using evaporation crystallization can be used for de icing or other industrial application only if they meet standards for purity especially concerning the norm level dong et al 2017 the most common approach to remove norm from produced water is through co precipitation with barium sulfate barite where radium proportionally precipitates with barium i e equal fractions of radium and barium are removed in the form of a ba ra so4 solid doerner and hoskins 1925 rosenberg et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 important modeling parameters and the influence of solution composition on radium removal by barite precipitation e g pitzer activity coefficients were first characterized by rosenberg et al 2011a 2011b an alternative source of sulfate was analyzed by mixing acid mine drainage and produced water he et al 2016 kondash et al 2014 ouyang et al 2019 these studies showed that the amount of sulfate directly impacts barium and radium removal i e more sulfate in the mixture resulted in higher barium and radium removal another important factor in produced water treatment is the sr ba ratio because it has been shown that increasing sr ba can either increase grandia et al 2008 ouyang et al 2019 or decrease ceccarello et al 2004 radium removal results found in the literature are contradictory and it remains unclear how the ratio of these ions controls barium and radium removal treating produced water often requires adding high concentrations of sulfate i e 4 5 times the molar ratio of barium to achieve more than 99 barium and radium removal due to high concentration of other divalent cations in pw e g sr2 ca2 this strategy leads to precipitation of other insoluble sulfates e g celestite gypsum that dramatically increases the volume of radioactive sludge and cost associate with its disposal heterogeneous nucleation i e nucleation of species in the presence of pre existing seed solids has been widely used to control precipitation of calcium sulfate fröhner and panahandeh 1975 calcium carbonate mercer et al 2005 barium sulfate kügler et al 2016 and struvite wang et al 2006 increasing the seed concentration and decreasing the size of seed particles typically enhances the removal of target species fröhner and panahandeh 1975 mercer et al 2005 he et al showed that barium sulfate precipitation can be inhibited in the presence of a high concentration of sodium and other alkaline earth metals if the saturation index si of barium sulfate is below 2 5 he et al 2014 the rate of barium sulfate precipitation is also affected by high concentrations of calcium and strontium due to incorporation of these ions into barium sulfate boon and jones 2016 jones et al 2004 kelland 2011 these side reactions reduce the removal of barium and radium by sulfate precipitation when the concentration of barium is lower than that of other divalent cations in the solution in that case excess sulfate needs to be added to accomplish the effluent quality that is needed to achieve requisite salt purity in the crystallization process this study is designed to provide fundamental insight into barium and radium removal from unconventional pw when sodium calcium magnesium and strontium are present at concentrations that are several orders of magnitude higher than those of barium and radium understanding the impacts of different ionic ratios e g so4 ba sr ba saturation indices of major sulfate salts and the effect of heterogeneous precipitations is essential to achieve efficient produced water treatment the main goal of the study was to optimize the treatment approach to achieve high barium and radium removal and enable further treatment of this water by evaporation

purchased from fischer scientific pittsburgh pa and strontium chloride purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo organic components were not within the scope of this study due to their lack of impact

produced water after the addition of sulfate was performed using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 2013 this software contains a database with pitzer activity coefficients and thermodynamic parameters that are necessary to accurately determine distribution of dissolved species at very high ionic strength of the solution that is characteristic for the unconventional onshore pw he et al 2014 2016 3 results and discussion the overall objective of this study was to establish an optimal treatment process that would achieve final ba2 and ra2 concentrations in the effluent below 10 mg l and 50 pci l respectively i e more than 99 removal to enable further treatment of pw in an evaporation crystallization system and recover high purity salable salts i e without norm in addition the proposed treatment process should minimize the amount of radioactive sludge produced to enable cost effective disposal as can be seen in table 1 concentrations of sr2 and ca2 in this pw are much higher than that of ba2 which creates extremely challenging conditions for reducing ba2 concentration by sulfate precipitation due to competition for the common ligand i e sulfate furthermore any celestite and gypsum precipitation during treatment would increases the total volume of radioactive sludge for disposal and dramatically escalate the overall cost of pw treatment 3 1 impact of ph and barite saturation index si on barium and radium removal radium removal is closely related to barium removal during barite precipitation doerner and hoskins 1925 zhang et al 2014 and it is important to understand the process parameters that affect the removal efficiency of both ions table 1 shows that the initial barium concentration in pw is 488 mg l and 98 barium removal is necessary to achieve the required water quality i e ba2 10 mg l the ability of sulfate precipitation to achieve this treatment objective was first evaluated by adding sulfate at 120 of the stoichiometric amount of barium at different ph levels and the effluent quality was evaluated after 30 min of reaction time this sulfate dose was selected to achieve sibaso4 3 1 based on the findings that complete barium removal in dilute solutions can be accomplished using the stoichiometric sulfate addition doerner and hoskins 1925 zhang et al 2014 while the reaction time of 30 min was selected based on a reasonable contact time that can be achieved in a full scale pw treatment plant tests at ph of 2 and 10 were included in this study to target barium removal i e barite is the only sulfate salt that is virtually insoluble at ph 2 and evaluate the potential contribution of hydroxide precipitation to ra2 removal in addition dosing sulfate up to 500 of the stoichiometric amount of barium was evaluated for its ability to meet treatment objectives table 2 lists all experimental conditions that were evaluated in this part of the study and fig 1 shows the results of these experiments the results shown in fig 1a clearly indicate that the addition of sulfate at 120 of barium concentration was not able to achieve the required effluent barium concentration i e ba2 10 mg l or 98 removal at any of the conditions tested sulfate removal was higher than barium removal at ph 5 4 and ph 10 suggesting that baso4 was not the only sulfate solid that formed but that srso4 and or caso4 precipitation influenced sulfate removal mgso4 could not precipitate due to the high solubility with kspmgso4 4 67 ropp 2012 although a reduction in caso4 and srso4 precipitation under acidic conditions was expected due to increased solubility of these sulfate minerals lopez valdivieso et al 2000 shukla et al 2008 decreasing the solution ph to 2 did not sufficiently improve ba2 removal to meet the treatment standards fig 1a table s1a in supplementary material in fact a slight increase in mg2 ca2 sr2 and ra2 removal was observed under acidic conditions which is most likely due to the adsorption or co precipitation of these ions with barite averyt and paytan 2003 ouyang et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 lower sulfate removal under acidic conditions i e 79 at ph 2 compared to 86 2 at ph 5 4 and a smaller mass of formed solids table 2 also suggest that barium sulfate was the only precipitate formed under these conditions notably higher removal of mg2 at ph 10 compared to ph 5 4 was due to formation of mg oh 2 phreeqc analysis indicated that solution was supersaturated with respect to mg oh 2 i e si of mg oh 2 of 1 38 was achieved at ph 10 0 with kspmg oh 2 7 1 10 12 harvey 2000 higher i e 9 ra2 removal at ph 10 compared to ph 5 4 was due to co precipitation with formed magnesium hydroxide clifford cothern and rebers 1990 however precipitation of mg oh 2 s at ph 10 lead to about 25 increase in solids formation i e from 19 0 tons 106 gallons at ph 5 4 to 23 8 tons 106 gallons at ph 10 table 2 which would have an adverse impact on the overall cost of sludge disposal it is important to note that ra2 removal in real produced water was always higher than ba2 removal regardless of the solution ph which suggests different removal mechanism i e co precipitation and adsorption compared to the case of dilute solutions where the removal of these ions was always proportional zhang et al 2014 equilibrium calculations using phreeqc revealed that barium and sulfate removal observed experimentally was always lower than theoretical predictions which is likely due to the kinetic limitations i e 30 min was not sufficient to achieve equilibrium fig 1b shows that ba2 removal above 98 can be achieved when the sulfate barium molar ratio is greater than 3 increasing the excess sulfate in solution increases si of all potential sulfate precipitates i e baso4 caso4 and srso4 table s1b which results in lower induction times and faster kinetics during homogeneous precipitation fan et al 2011 he et al 1995 the si of barite 3 12 3 75 was 2 6 112 times higher than the si of gypsum 0 19 to 0 42 and celestite 0 8 1 41 which leads to preferential precipitation of barite over other sulfate species consequently ra2 removal by co precipitation with barite increases to more than 98 fig 1b however a higher initial sulfate concentration leads to higher residual sulfate i e 416 743 mg l when sulfate addition was 300 500 of barium concentration table s1b such an outcome is highly undesirable because high residual sulfate would most likely exceed npdes discharge limits furthermore if the facility is designed to recover saleable salts from the produced water in a crystallization step a high concentration of sulfate in the effluent from the pretreatment step would lead to precipitation of caso4 and srso4 that would cause excessive scaling and or reduce the purity of the salts recovered from the crystallizer furthermore increasing the sulfate dose could almost double the amount of precipitated radioactive solids table 2 and dramatically increase the disposal costs hence the treatment approach that relies on excess sulfate to control ba2 in the effluent is not practical to evaluate the impact of barite si and the sr ba molar ratio on barium and radium removal a set of experiments was designed where the initial ba2 concentration was first increased by adding bacl2 to raw produced water followed by sulfate addition to achieve the initial sulfate barium molar ratio of 1 2 i e 20 excess sulfate addition excess na2so4 was added in each experiment of this study to ensure that there is sufficient so4 2 to precipitate all ba2 experimental conditions for these tests are shown in table 3 together with the concentration of formed solids in each test radioactivity of these solids was calculated using equation 3 all experiments were conducted for 30 min to represent a reasonable detention time in a full scale treatment plant and the results are shown in fig 2 increasing the initial barium concentration in produced water had a positive impact on the removal of all ions of interest fig 2 increasing the initial ba2 concentration from 488 to 1325 mg l in pw with subsequent addition of sulfate resulted in an increase in sr2 ba2 ra2 and so4 2 removal from 18 3 83 8 85 8 and 86 2 to 21 6 95 6 88 3 and 93 9 respectively the removal of mg2 and ca2 was reduced from 12 4 and 21 7 to 11 8 and 21 1 respectively although the solubility product of raso4 ksp 10 10 38 langmuir and riese 1985 is lower than the solubility product of baso4 ksp 10 9 97 none of the experimental conditions evaluated in this study resulted in direct precipitation of raso4 this is due to the si being well below 1 since the ra2 concentration was 8 orders of magnitude lower than the ba2 concentration addition of bacl2 and na2so4 to pw increased barite si from 3 12 to 4 table 3 further addition of ba2 to achieve an initial concentration of 5425 mg l increased barite si to 5 27 table 3 which resulted in higher ba2 and ra2 removal fig 2 and was able to achieve a residual ba2 concentration below 10 m l table s2 in supplementary material despite reducing the ba2 and ra2 concentration to 8 9 mg l and 80 pci l respectively this approach is not suitable for full scale application because it generates enormous quantities of radioactive solids i e 52 6 ton 106 gallons with norm concentration of 352 pci g generally the induction time i e time after the supersaturation is achieved and when the solids start to precipitate is a function of the saturation index söhnel and mullin 1988 previous studies have investigated the kinetics of barite and gypsum precipitation as a function of solution composition and showed that the shorter induction periods were observed at higher saturation indices fan et al 2011 he et al 2014 lancia et al 1999 co precipitation is a multiphase process that includes the following main mechanisms inclusion i e lattice replacement occlusion i e ions physically captured between the layers of precipitating crystal and adsorption harvey 2000 zhang et al 2014 due to the high salinity of the produced water and high concentration of competing divalent cations it is reasonable to assume that the adsorption is unlikely to contribute significantly to ion removal during the co precipitation process precipitation of barite is most likely accompanied by the replacement of ba2 with morphologically similar ra2 and sr2 ions ionic radii of sr2 ba2 and ra2 are similar in size i e ionic radii of sr2 ba2 and ra2 are 1 32 1 49 and 1 62 å respectively shannon 1976 thus allowing them to co precipitate together in the form of solid solutions i e ba sr so4 ba ra so4 and sr ra so4 prieto 2009 mg2 and ca2 ions are smaller ions i e 0 86 and 1 14 å respectively shannon 1976 and unlikely to replace ba2 in solid barite therefore the concentration of mg2 and ca2 is controlled by the occlusion and the extent of the removal of these ions is inversely proportional to the saturation index of barite fig 2 i e removal of these ions at higher sibaso4 is lower due to the shorter induction time of baso4 formation i e insufficient time for these ions to be captured between barite layers another important factor that influences ba2 and ra2 removal during sulfate precipitation in produced water is the sr ba ratio although the solubility product of strontium sulfate i e celestite of 10 6 63 is much higher than that of barite ksp 10 9 97 precipitation of celestite will occur if its saturation index is positive and it will affect the precipitation of barite adding bacl2 to the solution will decrease the sr ba ratio and enhance ba2 and ra2 removal table 3 fig 2 a set of experiments was conducted in synthetic produced water table s3 in supplementary material together with phreeqc simulations to investigate the combined impact of the barite saturation index and the sr ba molar ratio in solution on ba2 and ra2 removal results of these experiments are shown together with equilibrium predictions in fig 3 the results in fig 3 show that equilibrium calculations phreeqc always suggest very high barium removal i e the lowest predicted barium removal was 98 8 for sibaso4 3 1 and sr ba 20 7 however barium precipitation in highly concentrated solutions is a slow process and observed barium removal is greatly affected by both the barite si and sr ba molar ratio at low sr ba molar ratios i e sr ba 3 barium removal approaches predicted thermodynamic equilibrium after just 30 min of reaction time for sibaso4 ranging between 3 9 and 4 5 even when sibaso4 3 1 observed barium removal after 30 min was greater than 95 at sr ba 3 such behavior can be attributed to 100 times lower sisrso4 compared to sibaso4 table s4 in supplementary material which results in minimal interference of sr with barite precipitation increasing the sr ba molar ratio leads to a greater discrepancy between equilibrium predictions and observed experimental results the results in fig 3 clearly indicate a significant increase in equilibration time when sr ba 3 so that even 45 days was not sufficient to achieve chemical equilibrium at lower sr ba molar ratios barite supersaturation is the dominant driving force for barite precipitation while the interference of sr2 becomes significant at elevated sr ba ratios due to possible formation of non miscible pure celestite solids ouyang et al 2019 when sr2 is present at a much higher concentration than ba2 i e sr ba 8 concurrent celestite precipitation decreases the amount of sulfate available for barite precipitation the results depicted in fig 3 suggest that ba2 removal is the highest at the lowest sibaso4 i e 3 1 when sr ba 8 while this outcome may not be intuitively clear it is important to note that lower sibaso4 means lower initial sulfate concentration in the solution which then results in lower sisrso4 for example the range of sisrso4 varies from 0 62 to 1 02 when sibaso4 3 1 compared to sisrso4 in the range of 2 02 2 39 when sibaso4 4 5 the results presented above can be explained by the competition between sr2 and ba2 for sulfate as the common ligand when the reaction time is limited fig 4 shows the rate of ba2 and sr2 removal from the synthetic produced water at different sr ba molar ratios and an identical sibaso4 of 3 9 i e ba2 and sr2 were dosed in different amounts to achieve predetermined sibaso4 and sr ba ratios the kinetics of ba2 and sr2 precipitation is fast when sr ba 3 and pseudo equilibrium i e initial equilibrium of homogeneous precipitation that is followed by very slow displacement of sr2 with ba2 in already formed celestite is reached within 30 60 min at a higher sr ba molar ratio i e 10 and 20 initial sr2 removal is significantly faster than ba2 removal and it took only 15 min to achieve pseudo equilibrium for celestite precipitation compared to more than 2 h that were necessary for barite precipitation none of these experiments reached equilibrium within 7 days i e even 45 days was not sufficient to achieve equilibrium when sr ba molar ratios are very high fig 3 the impact of the sr ba molar ratio fig 2 and sulfate addition on the removal of ba2 and ra2 in real produced water is summarized in fig 5 based on the results discussed above it can be concluded that sulfate precipitation can be used for produced water treatment to achieve required ba2 and ra2 concentrations and enable effective crystallization for salt recovery if appropriate sibaso4 and sr ba molar ratios are achieved in the process the results in fig 5a suggest that there are only two ways to achieve the required ba2 effluent concentration 1 decrease the sr ba molar ratio below 1 2 or 2 add sulfate that is at least 3 3 times the initial ba2 molar concentration the major disadvantage of this approach is the production of 30 50 tons of solids per 106 gallons of treated produced water reducing the ra2 concentration below 50 pci l would require adding sulfate that is at least 4 6 times the initial ba2 molar concentration fig 5b although the epa exempts technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material tenorm generated in the oil and gas industry from hazardous materials disposal regulations it recommends that tenorm solids containing between 50 2000 pci g should be disposed in resource conservation and recovery act rcra hazardous waste landfills smith et al 1999 disposal fees at these landfills and transportation distance would make this treatment approach cost prohibitive therefore it is necessary to develop a different approach to achieve the required effluent concentrations for ba2 and ra2 without generating such large quantities of solids 3 2 impact of the baso4 seed on barium and radium removal it is well documented that seed addition can enhance precipitation of the solids with a structure that is similar to that of the seed material fröhner and panahandeh 1975 kügler et al 2016 mercer et al 2005 wang et al 2006 therefore a set of experiments where barite seed particles were added to the solution was conducted in an effort to enhance ba2 and ra2 removal from the produced water even when sr ba molar ratios were unfavorable for barite precipitation these experiments were conducted using four different doses of barite particles solids formed during the experiment were recycled twice to compare the efficiency of fresh barite seed with the barite seed formed in the presence of impurities i e mg2 ca2 sr2 ra2 experimental conditions are listed in table 4 and the removal of selected ions after 30 min of reaction are shown in fig 6 barite seed had a positive impact on ba2 removal from the produced water fig 6a the addition of 120 sulfate barium molar ratio to pw resulted in 83 8 removal of ba2 however simultaneous addition of 120 sulfate barium molar ratio and fresh barite seed increased ba2 removal to 85 2 at 5 g l of seed and to 90 3 at 50 g l of seed a similar enhancement was previously observed in the removal of gypsum fröhner and panahandeh 1975 and calcite mercer et al 2005 similarly ra2 removal of 96 7 was observed in the presence of 50 g l of barite seed compared to 85 8 removal without any seed based on the results of previous studies in dilute solutions brandt et al 2015 curti et al 2010 klinkenberg et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 it can be concluded that ra2 adsorption on fresh barite is contributing to the enhanced ra2 removal in the pw interestingly the removal of ca2 decreased from 21 7 without seed to 18 9 with 50 g l of fresh barite seed while the removal of sr2 decreased from 18 3 without seed to 13 6 with seed these ions are removed by the occlusion mechanism during the co precipitation process the presence of barite seed lowers the activation energy for heterogeneous barite precipitation kügler et al 2016 thus causing shorter induction times and reducing the extent of ion occlusion the total number of moles of ba2 sr2 and ca2 that were removed from the produced water was greater than the number of so4 2 moles removed table s5a in supplementary material which supports the hypothesis that a portion of these ions is not directly precipitated with sulfate ligand but is removed by adsorption and or occlusion hence the total amount of solids removed from the pw tends to increase only slightly with an increase in the amount of barite seed table 4 the results in fig 6b suggest that recycling solids was as effective in promoting ion removal as was the introduction of fresh seed into the system a slight decrease in ra2 removal from 93 1 when fresh barite seed was added to the system to 89 5 when solids were recycled once suggests a slight decrease in the adsorption capacity of barite for ra2 due to exposure to a high concentration of other ions in the pw however ra2 removal in the third cycle of barite use indicated no further decline in the adsorption capacity solids generated in each recycling stage were very close to the amount generated in the initial stage table s5b in supplementary material 3 3 optimization of the overall treatment process although treatment strategies evaluated above improved barium and radium removal most of the conditions evaluated in this study did not result in a final barium concentration below 10 mg l one exception was the treatment approach shown in fig 2 where the initial ba2 concentration was increased more than 11 times this increase required a very high sulfate dose in order to achieve a high barite saturation index si 5 27 and resulted in a large volume of radioactive sludge the addition of 500 sulfate barium to pw resulted in barium and radium concentrations below the required levels but also led to high residual sulfate in the effluent therefore a treatment approach with simultaneous adjustment of the sr ba molar ratio and addition of baso4 seed was evaluated using the experimental conditions summarized in table 5 the results are shown in fig 7 based on the results shown in fig 7 it can be concluded that simultaneous addition of ba2 and baso4 seed would result in more efficient ba2 and ra2 removal barium concentration in the effluent varied from 45 mg l in sample o1 to 8 mg l in sample o4 which can be correlated to an increase in the saturation index of barite from 4 00 to 4 98 table 5 a ba2 concentration below the required 10 mg l was achieved in samples o3 and o4 i e 9 and 8 mg l addition of chemicals to achieve high sibaso4 and low sr ba molar ratio provided barium free effluent i e lower than 10 mg l in the time frame that is typical for a full scale produced water treatment plant i e detention time of 30 min as expected ra2 removal was also enhanced due to simultaneous removal by co precipitation and adsorption on barium sulfate ra2 concentration in effluents o2 o3 and o4 was 14 20 and 5 pci l respectively i e removal above 99 similar to data shown in fig 6a ra2 removal is higher than ba2 removal due to the multiple mechanisms involved in ra2 removal most of the ra2 is co precipitated with barite forming a ba ra so4 solid solution while the rest is most likely removed through adsorption onto introduced and or formed barite solids while mg2 and ca2 removal remained constant at different experimental conditions shown in table 5 sr2 removal increased slightly when the initial ba2 concentration increased a higher ba2 concentration in the pw required a higher so4 2 concentration to maintain a sulfate barium ratio of 1 2 assuming that all barium was removed through precipitation as barite excess sulfate in experiments o1 o4 was in the range of 218 562 mg l this excess sulfate was sufficient to exceed the solubility product of celestite i e ksp 10 6 63 and achieve a sisrso4 concentration in the range of 1 23 1 72 excess sulfate also contributed to a slight increase in the formation of solids table 5 the combined effect of reducing the sr ba molar ratio and adding barite seed successfully reduced the concentration of barium and radium to the required values this combination also resulted in less sludge formation compared to previously evaluated treatment approaches tables 2 and 3 furthermore experimental results in fig 6b show that recycling barite solids in the treatment process and the addition of fresh barite seed can control the concentration of ra2 in a similar fashion 4 conclusions sulfate precipitation for treatment of produced water from marcellus shale play was investigated with the focus on modifying the initial sr ba molar ratio and adding baso4 seed to achieve requisite ba2 and ra2 removal while minimizing sludge production under realistic conditions that may be feasible in a full scale pw treatment process it was found that a fairly high barite saturation index i e above 5 2 is necessary to achieve the required ba2 and ra2 removal and that a large mass of radioactive sludge would be generated under these conditions i e more than 50 tons 106 gallons of produced water comparison between experimental and modeling results showed that both the kinetics and equilibrium of ba2 removal are highly dependent on the sr ba molar ratio at sr ba 3 and sibaso4 4 5 ba2 removal was fast and pseudo equilibrium was reached within 30 min while it took approximately 3 days to reach pseudo equilibrium for sibaso4 4 5 ba2 barite precipitation was much slower for sr ba 3 equilibrium was not achieved after 45 days and was not dependent on sibaso4 addition of fresh barite seed improved ba2 removal and significantly enhanced ra2 uptake from the solution such behavior can be explained by ra2 adsorption onto barite solids optimization efforts showed that adjusting the sr ba ratio to 2 and sibaso4 to 4 7 while adding 25 g l of barite seed resulted in required effluent standards and minimal sludge production i e 31 8 ton 106 gallons this study suggests that proper optimization of chemical addition and sludge recycling can achieve low ba2 and ra2 in the effluent

17944,produced water pw generated during unconventional oil and gas extraction is characterized by very high total dissolved solids tds that mainly consist of alkali and alkaline earth metals dominant pw management strategy i e injection in class ii disposal wells is scrutinized by regulatory agencies and the public and pw treatment that enables high water and salt recovery i e evaporation crystallization is being considered as an alternative produced water generated in the marcellus shale play also contains very high levels of naturally occurring radioactive material norm in the form of ra 226 and ra 228 which is one of the key impediments for the recovery of high quality salts this study was designed to evaluate the efficiency of ra 226 removal using co and post precipitation with barium sulfate to enable advanced pw treatment processes high sr ba molar ratios in pw lead to relatively low ba2 and ra2 removal and ba2 concentration adjustment is necessary to achieve required treatment standards i e ba2 10 mg l and ra2 50 pci l seeding the reactor with barium sulfate enhanced ba2 and ra2 removal through induced heterogeneous precipitation of barite however it was necessary to simultaneously adjust the sr ba ratio and barite level to achieve treatment requirements while maintaining reasonable detention time in the reactor i e 30 min and minimizing sludge production experimental and modeling results revealed that low ba2 and ra2 effluent concentrations with minimized sludge production can be achieved only when the barium sulfate saturation index was above 4 7 sr ba molar ratio was below 2 and there was at least 25 g l of barite seed in the system this study provides useful guidelines for centralized wastewater treatment facilities in shale plays and serves to

saturation index sr ba molar ratio seeding optimization 1 introduction a constant increase in oil and gas demand is a major factor driving technological advancement towards extraction of these resources from unconventional reservoirs a combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is responsible for the projected increase in total natural gas production in the united states from 27 9 tcf in 2016 to 44 5 tcf in 2050 i e 59 5 increase with natural gas production from unconventional reservoirs contributing more than 80 of the total production in the us in 2050 u s e i a 2018 it is estimated that unconventional natural gas basins around the world contain 7570 tcf of shale gas u s e i a 2015 which makes it a widely available fossil fuel that can be extracted economically sovacool 2014 unconventional natural gas is believed to be a good replacement for coal for power generation due to its lower environmental footprint burnham et al 2011 sovacool 2014 extraction of unconventional shale gas is not without its own threats to human health and the environment hydraulic fracturing of a single well requires 2 3 5 7 million gallons of water with an average consumption of 3 8 million gallons jackson et al 2014 nicot and scanlon 2012 a portion of this water returns to the surface as flowback i e during the first couple of weeks while produced water pw is brought to the surface during the productive life of the well one of the major environmental concerns related to unconventional gas extraction is high salinity of produced water with total dissolved solids tds that range from 1 to 345 g l with an average of 106 4 g l in marcellus shale barbot et al 2013 the concentration of major ions i e na mg2 ca2 sr2 and ba2 in produced water normally increases with time but also depends on the geochemical characteristic of the shale formation barbot et al 2013 for example the molar ratio of sr ba has an average of 1 2 in northeast pennsylvania barbot et al 2013 and can vary from 0 7 to 12 in southwest pennsylvania he et al 2014 lokare et al 2017 black shale the most dominant component of marcellus shale formation is rich with uranium and thorium which makes it a significant source of naturally occurring radioactive material norm that is usually found in produced water rowan et al 2011 the major components of norm in produced water are ra 226 half life of 1600 years and ra 228 half life of 5 75 years which are daughter isotopes of u 238 and th 232 respectively akovali 1996 artna cohen 1997 multiple gas well analyses showed that the total radium concentration i e ra 226 and ra 228 in marcellus shale produced water in pennsylvania can range from 33 to 18 045 pci l while it can be as high as 16 942 pci l in marcellus shale produced water in new york rowan et al 2011 such high norm concentration makes produced water treatment for the recovery of valuable resources i e clean water and salts very challenging produced water management strategy depends largely on the availability of class ii underground injection control wells uic approximately 95 of onshore produced water is disposed i e disposal and enhanced oil recovery in these wells clark and veil 2009 the only exception is marcellus shale play where close to 90 of the flowback and produced water is reused in hydraulic fracturing jiang et al 2014 rassenfoss 2011 however disposal of produced water in class ii wells has been linked with induced seismicity ellsworth 2013 mcgarr et al 2015 thus thermal processes such as evaporation and crystallization may be necessary to recover clean salts and pure water that can be reused in industrial operations these processes however are energy intensive and costly fakhru l razi et al 2009 any solids or sludge generated during produced water treatment would contain norm and would have to be disposed in approved landfills zhang et al 2014 2015 regulations for the disposal of radioactive sludge vary by state but generally limit radioactivity in the range of 5 30 pci g smith 1992 veil et al 1998 recent studies demonstrated the possibility of using a functionalized proppant as an underground filter for norm control goyal et al 2017 gusa 2020 gusa and vidic 2018 mcdaniel and mccrary 2014 to reduce the radioactivity of produced water and reduce its health and environmental risks salts i e chlorides that can be recovered from the produced water using evaporation crystallization can be used for de icing or other industrial application only if they meet standards for purity especially concerning the norm level dong et al 2017 the most common approach to remove norm from produced water is through co precipitation with barium sulfate barite where radium proportionally precipitates with barium i e equal fractions of radium and barium are removed in the form of a ba ra so4 solid doerner and hoskins 1925 rosenberg et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 important modeling parameters and the influence of solution composition on radium removal by barite precipitation e g pitzer activity coefficients were first characterized by rosenberg et al 2011a 2011b an alternative source of sulfate was analyzed by mixing acid mine drainage and produced water he et al 2016 kondash et al 2014 ouyang et al 2019 these studies showed that the amount of sulfate directly impacts barium and radium removal i e more sulfate in the mixture resulted in higher barium and radium removal another important factor in produced water treatment is the sr ba ratio because it has been shown that increasing sr ba can either increase grandia et al 2008 ouyang et al 2019 or decrease ceccarello et al 2004 radium removal results found in the literature are contradictory and it remains unclear how the ratio of these ions controls barium and radium removal treating produced water often requires adding high concentrations of sulfate i e 4 5 times the molar ratio of barium to achieve more than 99 barium and radium removal due to high concentration of other divalent cations in pw e g sr2 ca2 this strategy leads to precipitation of other insoluble sulfates e g celestite gypsum that dramatically increases the volume of radioactive sludge and cost associate with its disposal heterogeneous nucleation i e nucleation of species in the presence of pre existing seed solids has been widely used to control precipitation of calcium sulfate fröhner and panahandeh 1975 calcium carbonate mercer et al 2005 barium sulfate kügler et al 2016 and struvite wang et al 2006 increasing the seed concentration and decreasing the size of seed particles typically enhances the removal of target species fröhner and panahandeh 1975 mercer et al 2005 he et al showed that barium sulfate precipitation can be inhibited in the presence of a high concentration of sodium and other alkaline earth metals if the saturation index si of barium sulfate is below 2 5 he et al 2014 the rate of barium sulfate precipitation is also affected by high concentrations of calcium and strontium due to incorporation of these ions into barium sulfate boon and jones 2016 jones et al 2004 kelland 2011 these side reactions reduce the removal of barium and radium by sulfate precipitation when the concentration of barium is lower than that of other divalent cations in the solution in that case excess sulfate needs to be added to accomplish the effluent quality that is needed to achieve requisite salt purity in the crystallization process this study is designed to provide fundamental insight into barium and radium removal from unconventional pw when sodium calcium magnesium and strontium are present at concentrations that are several orders of magnitude higher than those of barium and radium understanding the impacts of different ionic ratios e g so4 ba sr ba saturation indices of major sulfate salts and the effect of heterogeneous precipitations is essential to achieve efficient produced water treatment the main goal of the study was to optimize the treatment approach to achieve high barium and radium removal and enable further treatment of this water by evaporation

purchased from fischer scientific pittsburgh pa and strontium chloride purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo organic components were not within the scope of this study due to their lack of impact

produced water after the addition of sulfate was performed using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 2013 this software contains a database with pitzer activity coefficients and thermodynamic parameters that are necessary to accurately determine distribution of dissolved species at very high ionic strength of the solution that is characteristic for the unconventional onshore pw he et al 2014 2016 3 results and discussion the overall objective of this study was to establish an optimal treatment process that would achieve final ba2 and ra2 concentrations in the effluent below 10 mg l and 50 pci l respectively i e more than 99 removal to enable further treatment of pw in an evaporation crystallization system and recover high purity salable salts i e without norm in addition the proposed treatment process should minimize the amount of radioactive sludge produced to enable cost effective disposal as can be seen in table 1 concentrations of sr2 and ca2 in this pw are much higher than that of ba2 which creates extremely challenging conditions for reducing ba2 concentration by sulfate precipitation due to competition for the common ligand i e sulfate furthermore any celestite and gypsum precipitation during treatment would increases the total volume of radioactive sludge for disposal and dramatically escalate the overall cost of pw treatment 3 1 impact of ph and barite saturation index si on barium and radium removal radium removal is closely related to barium removal during barite precipitation doerner and hoskins 1925 zhang et al 2014 and it is important to understand the process parameters that affect the removal efficiency of both ions table 1 shows that the initial barium concentration in pw is 488 mg l and 98 barium removal is necessary to achieve the required water quality i e ba2 10 mg l the ability of sulfate precipitation to achieve this treatment objective was first evaluated by adding sulfate at 120 of the stoichiometric amount of barium at different ph levels and the effluent quality was evaluated after 30 min of reaction time this sulfate dose was selected to achieve sibaso4 3 1 based on the findings that complete barium removal in dilute solutions can be accomplished using the stoichiometric sulfate addition doerner and hoskins 1925 zhang et al 2014 while the reaction time of 30 min was selected based on a reasonable contact time that can be achieved in a full scale pw treatment plant tests at ph of 2 and 10 were included in this study to target barium removal i e barite is the only sulfate salt that is virtually insoluble at ph 2 and evaluate the potential contribution of hydroxide precipitation to ra2 removal in addition dosing sulfate up to 500 of the stoichiometric amount of barium was evaluated for its ability to meet treatment objectives table 2 lists all experimental conditions that were evaluated in this part of the study and fig 1 shows the results of these experiments the results shown in fig 1a clearly indicate that the addition of sulfate at 120 of barium concentration was not able to achieve the required effluent barium concentration i e ba2 10 mg l or 98 removal at any of the conditions tested sulfate removal was higher than barium removal at ph 5 4 and ph 10 suggesting that baso4 was not the only sulfate solid that formed but that srso4 and or caso4 precipitation influenced sulfate removal mgso4 could not precipitate due to the high solubility with kspmgso4 4 67 ropp 2012 although a reduction in caso4 and srso4 precipitation under acidic conditions was expected due to increased solubility of these sulfate minerals lopez valdivieso et al 2000 shukla et al 2008 decreasing the solution ph to 2 did not sufficiently improve ba2 removal to meet the treatment standards fig 1a table s1a in supplementary material in fact a slight increase in mg2 ca2 sr2 and ra2 removal was observed under acidic conditions which is most likely due to the adsorption or co precipitation of these ions with barite averyt and paytan 2003 ouyang et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 lower sulfate removal under acidic conditions i e 79 at ph 2 compared to 86 2 at ph 5 4 and a smaller mass of formed solids table 2 also suggest that barium sulfate was the only precipitate formed under these conditions notably higher removal of mg2 at ph 10 compared to ph 5 4 was due to formation of mg oh 2 phreeqc analysis indicated that solution was supersaturated with respect to mg oh 2 i e si of mg oh 2 of 1 38 was achieved at ph 10 0 with kspmg oh 2 7 1 10 12 harvey 2000 higher i e 9 ra2 removal at ph 10 compared to ph 5 4 was due to co precipitation with formed magnesium hydroxide clifford cothern and rebers 1990 however precipitation of mg oh 2 s at ph 10 lead to about 25 increase in solids formation i e from 19 0 tons 106 gallons at ph 5 4 to 23 8 tons 106 gallons at ph 10 table 2 which would have an adverse impact on the overall cost of sludge disposal it is important to note that ra2 removal in real produced water was always higher than ba2 removal regardless of the solution ph which suggests different removal mechanism i e co precipitation and adsorption compared to the case of dilute solutions where the removal of these ions was always proportional zhang et al 2014 equilibrium calculations using phreeqc revealed that barium and sulfate removal observed experimentally was always lower than theoretical predictions which is likely due to the kinetic limitations i e 30 min was not sufficient to achieve equilibrium fig 1b shows that ba2 removal above 98 can be achieved when the sulfate barium molar ratio is greater than 3 increasing the excess sulfate in solution increases si of all potential sulfate precipitates i e baso4 caso4 and srso4 table s1b which results in lower induction times and faster kinetics during homogeneous precipitation fan et al 2011 he et al 1995 the si of barite 3 12 3 75 was 2 6 112 times higher than the si of gypsum 0 19 to 0 42 and celestite 0 8 1 41 which leads to preferential precipitation of barite over other sulfate species consequently ra2 removal by co precipitation with barite increases to more than 98 fig 1b however a higher initial sulfate concentration leads to higher residual sulfate i e 416 743 mg l when sulfate addition was 300 500 of barium concentration table s1b such an outcome is highly undesirable because high residual sulfate would most likely exceed npdes discharge limits furthermore if the facility is designed to recover saleable salts from the produced water in a crystallization step a high concentration of sulfate in the effluent from the pretreatment step would lead to precipitation of caso4 and srso4 that would cause excessive scaling and or reduce the purity of the salts recovered from the crystallizer furthermore increasing the sulfate dose could almost double the amount of precipitated radioactive solids table 2 and dramatically increase the disposal costs hence the treatment approach that relies on excess sulfate to control ba2 in the effluent is not practical to evaluate the impact of barite si and the sr ba molar ratio on barium and radium removal a set of experiments was designed where the initial ba2 concentration was first increased by adding bacl2 to raw produced water followed by sulfate addition to achieve the initial sulfate barium molar ratio of 1 2 i e 20 excess sulfate addition excess na2so4 was added in each experiment of this study to ensure that there is sufficient so4 2 to precipitate all ba2 experimental conditions for these tests are shown in table 3 together with the concentration of formed solids in each test radioactivity of these solids was calculated using equation 3 all experiments were conducted for 30 min to represent a reasonable detention time in a full scale treatment plant and the results are shown in fig 2 increasing the initial barium concentration in produced water had a positive impact on the removal of all ions of interest fig 2 increasing the initial ba2 concentration from 488 to 1325 mg l in pw with subsequent addition of sulfate resulted in an increase in sr2 ba2 ra2 and so4 2 removal from 18 3 83 8 85 8 and 86 2 to 21 6 95 6 88 3 and 93 9 respectively the removal of mg2 and ca2 was reduced from 12 4 and 21 7 to 11 8 and 21 1 respectively although the solubility product of raso4 ksp 10 10 38 langmuir and riese 1985 is lower than the solubility product of baso4 ksp 10 9 97 none of the experimental conditions evaluated in this study resulted in direct precipitation of raso4 this is due to the si being well below 1 since the ra2 concentration was 8 orders of magnitude lower than the ba2 concentration addition of bacl2 and na2so4 to pw increased barite si from 3 12 to 4 table 3 further addition of ba2 to achieve an initial concentration of 5425 mg l increased barite si to 5 27 table 3 which resulted in higher ba2 and ra2 removal fig 2 and was able to achieve a residual ba2 concentration below 10 m l table s2 in supplementary material despite reducing the ba2 and ra2 concentration to 8 9 mg l and 80 pci l respectively this approach is not suitable for full scale application because it generates enormous quantities of radioactive solids i e 52 6 ton 106 gallons with norm concentration of 352 pci g generally the induction time i e time after the supersaturation is achieved and when the solids start to precipitate is a function of the saturation index söhnel and mullin 1988 previous studies have investigated the kinetics of barite and gypsum precipitation as a function of solution composition and showed that the shorter induction periods were observed at higher saturation indices fan et al 2011 he et al 2014 lancia et al 1999 co precipitation is a multiphase process that includes the following main mechanisms inclusion i e lattice replacement occlusion i e ions physically captured between the layers of precipitating crystal and adsorption harvey 2000 zhang et al 2014 due to the high salinity of the produced water and high concentration of competing divalent cations it is reasonable to assume that the adsorption is unlikely to contribute significantly to ion removal during the co precipitation process precipitation of barite is most likely accompanied by the replacement of ba2 with morphologically similar ra2 and sr2 ions ionic radii of sr2 ba2 and ra2 are similar in size i e ionic radii of sr2 ba2 and ra2 are 1 32 1 49 and 1 62 å respectively shannon 1976 thus allowing them to co precipitate together in the form of solid solutions i e ba sr so4 ba ra so4 and sr ra so4 prieto 2009 mg2 and ca2 ions are smaller ions i e 0 86 and 1 14 å respectively shannon 1976 and unlikely to replace ba2 in solid barite therefore the concentration of mg2 and ca2 is controlled by the occlusion and the extent of the removal of these ions is inversely proportional to the saturation index of barite fig 2 i e removal of these ions at higher sibaso4 is lower due to the shorter induction time of baso4 formation i e insufficient time for these ions to be captured between barite layers another important factor that influences ba2 and ra2 removal during sulfate precipitation in produced water is the sr ba ratio although the solubility product of strontium sulfate i e celestite of 10 6 63 is much higher than that of barite ksp 10 9 97 precipitation of celestite will occur if its saturation index is positive and it will affect the precipitation of barite adding bacl2 to the solution will decrease the sr ba ratio and enhance ba2 and ra2 removal table 3 fig 2 a set of experiments was conducted in synthetic produced water table s3 in supplementary material together with phreeqc simulations to investigate the combined impact of the barite saturation index and the sr ba molar ratio in solution on ba2 and ra2 removal results of these experiments are shown together with equilibrium predictions in fig 3 the results in fig 3 show that equilibrium calculations phreeqc always suggest very high barium removal i e the lowest predicted barium removal was 98 8 for sibaso4 3 1 and sr ba 20 7 however barium precipitation in highly concentrated solutions is a slow process and observed barium removal is greatly affected by both the barite si and sr ba molar ratio at low sr ba molar ratios i e sr ba 3 barium removal approaches predicted thermodynamic equilibrium after just 30 min of reaction time for sibaso4 ranging between 3 9 and 4 5 even when sibaso4 3 1 observed barium removal after 30 min was greater than 95 at sr ba 3 such behavior can be attributed to 100 times lower sisrso4 compared to sibaso4 table s4 in supplementary material which results in minimal interference of sr with barite precipitation increasing the sr ba molar ratio leads to a greater discrepancy between equilibrium predictions and observed experimental results the results in fig 3 clearly indicate a significant increase in equilibration time when sr ba 3 so that even 45 days was not sufficient to achieve chemical equilibrium at lower sr ba molar ratios barite supersaturation is the dominant driving force for barite precipitation while the interference of sr2 becomes significant at elevated sr ba ratios due to possible formation of non miscible pure celestite solids ouyang et al 2019 when sr2 is present at a much higher concentration than ba2 i e sr ba 8 concurrent celestite precipitation decreases the amount of sulfate available for barite precipitation the results depicted in fig 3 suggest that ba2 removal is the highest at the lowest sibaso4 i e 3 1 when sr ba 8 while this outcome may not be intuitively clear it is important to note that lower sibaso4 means lower initial sulfate concentration in the solution which then results in lower sisrso4 for example the range of sisrso4 varies from 0 62 to 1 02 when sibaso4 3 1 compared to sisrso4 in the range of 2 02 2 39 when sibaso4 4 5 the results presented above can be explained by the competition between sr2 and ba2 for sulfate as the common ligand when the reaction time is limited fig 4 shows the rate of ba2 and sr2 removal from the synthetic produced water at different sr ba molar ratios and an identical sibaso4 of 3 9 i e ba2 and sr2 were dosed in different amounts to achieve predetermined sibaso4 and sr ba ratios the kinetics of ba2 and sr2 precipitation is fast when sr ba 3 and pseudo equilibrium i e initial equilibrium of homogeneous precipitation that is followed by very slow displacement of sr2 with ba2 in already formed celestite is reached within 30 60 min at a higher sr ba molar ratio i e 10 and 20 initial sr2 removal is significantly faster than ba2 removal and it took only 15 min to achieve pseudo equilibrium for celestite precipitation compared to more than 2 h that were necessary for barite precipitation none of these experiments reached equilibrium within 7 days i e even 45 days was not sufficient to achieve equilibrium when sr ba molar ratios are very high fig 3 the impact of the sr ba molar ratio fig 2 and sulfate addition on the removal of ba2 and ra2 in real produced water is summarized in fig 5 based on the results discussed above it can be concluded that sulfate precipitation can be used for produced water treatment to achieve required ba2 and ra2 concentrations and enable effective crystallization for salt recovery if appropriate sibaso4 and sr ba molar ratios are achieved in the process the results in fig 5a suggest that there are only two ways to achieve the required ba2 effluent concentration 1 decrease the sr ba molar ratio below 1 2 or 2 add sulfate that is at least 3 3 times the initial ba2 molar concentration the major disadvantage of this approach is the production of 30 50 tons of solids per 106 gallons of treated produced water reducing the ra2 concentration below 50 pci l would require adding sulfate that is at least 4 6 times the initial ba2 molar concentration fig 5b although the epa exempts technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material tenorm generated in the oil and gas industry from hazardous materials disposal regulations it recommends that tenorm solids containing between 50 2000 pci g should be disposed in resource conservation and recovery act rcra hazardous waste landfills smith et al 1999 disposal fees at these landfills and transportation distance would make this treatment approach cost prohibitive therefore it is necessary to develop a different approach to achieve the required effluent concentrations for ba2 and ra2 without generating such large quantities of solids 3 2 impact of the baso4 seed on barium and radium removal it is well documented that seed addition can enhance precipitation of the solids with a structure that is similar to that of the seed material fröhner and panahandeh 1975 kügler et al 2016 mercer et al 2005 wang et al 2006 therefore a set of experiments where barite seed particles were added to the solution was conducted in an effort to enhance ba2 and ra2 removal from the produced water even when sr ba molar ratios were unfavorable for barite precipitation these experiments were conducted using four different doses of barite particles solids formed during the experiment were recycled twice to compare the efficiency of fresh barite seed with the barite seed formed in the presence of impurities i e mg2 ca2 sr2 ra2 experimental conditions are listed in table 4 and the removal of selected ions after 30 min of reaction are shown in fig 6 barite seed had a positive impact on ba2 removal from the produced water fig 6a the addition of 120 sulfate barium molar ratio to pw resulted in 83 8 removal of ba2 however simultaneous addition of 120 sulfate barium molar ratio and fresh barite seed increased ba2 removal to 85 2 at 5 g l of seed and to 90 3 at 50 g l of seed a similar enhancement was previously observed in the removal of gypsum fröhner and panahandeh 1975 and calcite mercer et al 2005 similarly ra2 removal of 96 7 was observed in the presence of 50 g l of barite seed compared to 85 8 removal without any seed based on the results of previous studies in dilute solutions brandt et al 2015 curti et al 2010 klinkenberg et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 it can be concluded that ra2 adsorption on fresh barite is contributing to the enhanced ra2 removal in the pw interestingly the removal of ca2 decreased from 21 7 without seed to 18 9 with 50 g l of fresh barite seed while the removal of sr2 decreased from 18 3 without seed to 13 6 with seed these ions are removed by the occlusion mechanism during the co precipitation process the presence of barite seed lowers the activation energy for heterogeneous barite precipitation kügler et al 2016 thus causing shorter induction times and reducing the extent of ion occlusion the total number of moles of ba2 sr2 and ca2 that were removed from the produced water was greater than the number of so4 2 moles removed table s5a in supplementary material which supports the hypothesis that a portion of these ions is not directly precipitated with sulfate ligand but is removed by adsorption and or occlusion hence the total amount of solids removed from the pw tends to increase only slightly with an increase in the amount of barite seed table 4 the results in fig 6b suggest that recycling solids was as effective in promoting ion removal as was the introduction of fresh seed into the system a slight decrease in ra2 removal from 93 1 when fresh barite seed was added to the system to 89 5 when solids were recycled once suggests a slight decrease in the adsorption capacity of barite for ra2 due to exposure to a high concentration of other ions in the pw however ra2 removal in the third cycle of barite use indicated no further decline in the adsorption capacity solids generated in each recycling stage were very close to the amount generated in the initial stage table s5b in supplementary material 3 3 optimization of the overall treatment process although treatment strategies evaluated above improved barium and radium removal most of the conditions evaluated in this study did not result in a final barium concentration below 10 mg l one exception was the treatment approach shown in fig 2 where the initial ba2 concentration was increased more than 11 times this increase required a very high sulfate dose in order to achieve a high barite saturation index si 5 27 and resulted in a large volume of radioactive sludge the addition of 500 sulfate barium to pw resulted in barium and radium concentrations below the required levels but also led to high residual sulfate in the effluent therefore a treatment approach with simultaneous adjustment of the sr ba molar ratio and addition of baso4 seed was evaluated using the experimental conditions summarized in table 5 the results are shown in fig 7 based on the results shown in fig 7 it can be concluded that simultaneous addition of ba2 and baso4 seed would result in more efficient ba2 and ra2 removal barium concentration in the effluent varied from 45 mg l in sample o1 to 8 mg l in sample o4 which can be correlated to an increase in the saturation index of barite from 4 00 to 4 98 table 5 a ba2 concentration below the required 10 mg l was achieved in samples o3 and o4 i e 9 and 8 mg l addition of chemicals to achieve high sibaso4 and low sr ba molar ratio provided barium free effluent i e lower than 10 mg l in the time frame that is typical for a full scale produced water treatment plant i e detention time of 30 min as expected ra2 removal was also enhanced due to simultaneous removal by co precipitation and adsorption on barium sulfate ra2 concentration in effluents o2 o3 and o4 was 14 20 and 5 pci l respectively i e removal above 99 similar to data shown in fig 6a ra2 removal is higher than ba2 removal due to the multiple mechanisms involved in ra2 removal most of the ra2 is co precipitated with barite forming a ba ra so4 solid solution while the rest is most likely removed through adsorption onto introduced and or formed barite solids while mg2 and ca2 removal remained constant at different experimental conditions shown in table 5 sr2 removal increased slightly when the initial ba2 concentration increased a higher ba2 concentration in the pw required a higher so4 2 concentration to maintain a sulfate barium ratio of 1 2 assuming that all barium was removed through precipitation as barite excess sulfate in experiments o1 o4 was in the range of 218 562 mg l this excess sulfate was sufficient to exceed the solubility product of celestite i e ksp 10 6 63 and achieve a sisrso4 concentration in the range of 1 23 1 72 excess sulfate also contributed to a slight increase in the formation of solids table 5 the combined effect of reducing the sr ba molar ratio and adding barite seed successfully reduced the concentration of barium and radium to the required values this combination also resulted in less sludge formation compared to previously evaluated treatment approaches tables 2 and 3 furthermore experimental results in fig 6b show that recycling barite solids in the treatment process and the addition of fresh barite seed can control the concentration of ra2 in a similar fashion 4 conclusions sulfate precipitation for treatment of produced water from marcellus shale play was investigated with the focus on modifying the initial sr ba molar ratio and adding baso4 seed to achieve requisite ba2 and ra2 removal while minimizing sludge production under realistic conditions that may be feasible in a full scale pw treatment process it was found that a fairly high barite saturation index i e above 5 2 is necessary to achieve the required ba2 and ra2 removal and that a large mass of radioactive sludge would be generated under these conditions i e more than 50 tons 106 gallons of produced water comparison between experimental and modeling results showed that both the kinetics and equilibrium of ba2 removal are highly dependent on the sr ba molar ratio at sr ba 3 and sibaso4 4 5 ba2 removal was fast and pseudo equilibrium was reached within 30 min while it took approximately 3 days to reach pseudo equilibrium for sibaso4 4 5 ba2 barite precipitation was much slower for sr ba 3 equilibrium was not achieved after 45 days and was not dependent on sibaso4 addition of fresh barite seed improved ba2 removal and significantly enhanced ra2 uptake from the solution such behavior can be explained by ra2 adsorption onto barite solids optimization efforts showed that adjusting the sr ba ratio to 2 and sibaso4 to 4 7 while adding 25 g l of barite seed resulted in required effluent standards and minimal sludge production i e 31 8 ton 106 gallons this study suggests that proper optimization of chemical addition and sludge recycling can achieve low ba2 and ra2 in the effluent after a reasonable reaction time i e 30 min while minimizing the production of radioactive sludge in the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
