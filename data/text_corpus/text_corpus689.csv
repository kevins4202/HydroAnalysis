3445,the northeastern tibetan plateau netp bordering the endorheic lake basins and the upper yellow river region has been disturbed by increasing human activities in recent years the netp water storage changes could be a combined effect of climate variability change and human activities e g reservoir operation however whether the human activities have evidently altered hydrological processes and become key drivers of total terrestrial water storage tws changes in the netp remains unclear to explore the roles of human interventions in changing surface water storage sws and thus influencing regional tws changes in the netp in comparison with natural drivers this study quantitatively disaggregated and compared the contributions of tws changes from climate dominated natural lakes and man regulated reservoirs at different timescales time series of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tws anomalies twsa exhibited an overall upward trend 0 78 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 with evident periodic fluctuations from april 2002 to august 2020 although the grace twsa was more substantially influenced by changes in natural lake water storage 0 96 0 02 gt yr rather than reservoirs 0 54 0 04 gt yr in the long term trend the man regulated reservoir water storage changes can significantly dominate the grace twsa on interannual and intra annual timescales especially in the second sub period 2013 01 2017 06 grace twsa change rate 1 82 0 29 gt yr p 0 01 in comparison with the change rate of reservoir water storage of 1 28 0 17 gt yr and the natural lakes of 0 72 0 07 gt yr in some abnormal years the reservoir storage changes were even close to the overall signal of region wide grace twsa in addition the increase in soil moisture storage long term linear trend 0 65 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 was also a key factor that cannot be neglected our results suggest that human activities are becoming one of the key factors influencing tws changes in the netp keywords tibetan plateau water storage lake reservoir global change grace fo 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp together with surrounding high mountains well known as asian water tower is the source of many large rivers of asia such as the yangtze brahmaputra indus and yellow immerzeel et al 2020 kääb et al 2012 lu et al 2005 yang et al 2014 yao et al 2012b it is extensively covered by glaciers and lakes which are important components of the terrestrial water budget and regional hydrological cycle bolch et al 2012 qiu 2008 yao et al 2012b the tp is one of the most sensitive areas in response to global climate change and has been becoming warmer and wetter during the past several decades kuang and jiao 2016 sorg et al 2012 sun et al 2020a yang et al 2011 such a phenomenon correlates well with the lake expansion and glacier melting observed in recent years however the lack of in situ observations in high mountain regions limits our understanding of these hydrological changes fortunately this obstacle has been reduced by rapidly emerging satellite observations with various sensors han et al 2019 long et al 2017 xu et al 2020 many prior studies have used optical satellite imagery laser altimetry observations and microwave detection to examine glacier lake and permafrost changes across space and time in the tp these prior study results have indicated significant changes occurred in the tp such as the glacier retreat bolch et al 2012 kääb et al 2012 yao et al 2007 yao et al 2012a permafrost degradation cheng and wu 2007 guo et al 2012 wu and zhang 2008 yang et al 2010 and lake expansion hwang et al 2019 lei and yang 2017 lei et al 2013 li et al 2019b qiao and zhu 2019 song et al 2013 song et al 2014 yang et al 2018 yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 which were considerably affecting the regional terrestrial water storage tws and hydrological cycle in addition a more comprehensive understanding of water storage change in the tp was facilitated with the launch of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellites in general most studies have reported the strong spatial heterogeneity of tws changes across the tp with a decreasing trend in the plateau periphery and an increasing trend in the inner and northern parts guo et al 2016 jiao et al 2015 meng et al 2019 song et al 2015 xiang et al 2016 yin et al 2021 these studies further disassembled different hydrological components such as glaciers lakes and groundwater to understand the possible causes of spatial heterogeneity on the basis of multi source remote sensing data the results have indicated that the overall glacier retreating is considered to be the primary cause of tws depletion in the peripheral plateau particularly along the himalayas bolch et al 2012 jacob et al 2012 kääb et al 2012 matsuo and heki 2010 yao et al 2012a while for the inner and northern tp the rapid lake mass accumulations that were mainly driven by wetting climate and water vapor transport from the outside the inner tp is consistently deemed as the dominant factor of the tws increase song et al 2013 wang et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 undoubtedly the significant hydrological changes in the inner tp including the qiangtang and hoh xil that are minimally intervened by human activities were dominated by climate change and variability by contrast the northeastern tp netp which borders the endorheic lake basins and the upper yellow river basin and has relatively lower elevations is being disturbed by increasing human activities such as the construction of hydropower stations and mining especially in recent years human interventions have become more frequent with the development of western china for example the water regulation and expansion operations of the longyang reservoir one of the largest dams in the yellow river undoubtedly affect the regional water balance however whether the human activities have evidently altered the hydrological processes and become the critical factors of influencing the tws changes in the netp remain unclear with the successful launch of grace follow on grace fo in may 2018 the scientific gravity observations combined with grace satellites will extend the investigation of tws changes in the netp to nearly two decades to conduct a quantitative comparison of the influences of climate forcing and human activities on tws changes the mass variations of natural lakes affected by climate variability and reservoirs regulated by human activities are quantified separately in the study region the two primary objectives of this study were designed to 1 examine the variations of multiple timescales in the tws anomaly twsa time series in the netp and 2 quantify the contributions of glacier mass natural lakes reservoirs and soil moisture storage changes to tws changes in order to identify the effects of human activities and climate forcing the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area datasets and methodology section 3 presents the analyses on change characteristics of grace tws sws and soil moisture storage at different time scales then the discrepancy among the different grace and grace fo products and groundwater storage changes are discussed in section 4 eventually the major findings of this study are summarized in section 5 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the study area in this work includes the geographic domain between 97 and 101 e and 34 39 n fig 1 the study area mainly includes the eastern qaidam basin the southeastern hexi basin and the upper yellow river basin the geographical environment of this area is diverse and different land cover types are distributed in different basins and elevations the glaciers are mostly located in the northwest the hexi basin of the study area the southern part of the study area is the upper yellow river region in addition many lakes are distributed in the study area and these lakes are currently undergoing significant changes due to the impact of climate changes compared with four large lakes qinghai lake harla lake gyaring lake and donggeicuona lake the water storage changes of other small lakes have few contributions to the tws changes therefore these four large lakes were investigated for quantifying the contribution of lake water storage to the tws changes by contrast the water mass changes of longyang reservoir and ngoring lake its water levels were greatly influenced by the operation of the adjacent reservoir i e huangheyuan reservoir were quantified to indicate the tws influences from human activities 2 2 tws changes from different grace grace fo products the nasa dlr grace twin satellite mission was launched in 2002 and terminated in june 2017 tapley et al 2004 its successor grace fo launched in may 2018 continues the scientific gravimetry observation mission kornfeld et al 2019 sun et al 2020b the official grace science data system continuously released monthly grace solutions derived from three different processing institutions with different parameters and strategies geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz center for space research csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl the current solutions for data processing are the release 06 rl06 gravity field solutions the latest released versions of grace twsa products include the spherical harmonic data and mass concentration mascon data versions more detailed information about the six latest grace products three mascons solutions and three spherical harmonics solutions is provided in table 1 in this study the three spherical harmonic solutions were averaged to minimize the uncertainties associated with data processing we estimated the uncertainty among different grace solutions by calculating the standard deviation of the three solutions moreover a few occurrences of monthly data that are missing in the dataset were interpolated linearly by weighted averaging of the observations before and after the missing month grace tws data from jpl mascon rl06 csr mascon rl06 and goddard space flight center gsfc mascon were also used for the inter comparison 2 3 surface water storage changes from global surface water gsw dataset and multi source altimetry data 2 3 1 water area from joint research center jrc gsw the monthly mapping results of the lake and reservoir inundation areas were generated on the google earth engine platform by using the jrc gsw dataset pekel et al 2016 we employed the monthly water history layer which provides the monthly water detention data to estimate the time series of lake and reservoir water areas then the derived monthly water extents were manually inspected and edited for quality control and converted into the equal area projection before calculating the monthly areas 2 3 2 water level from legos hydroweb and space borne laser altimetry at present many institutions have integrated multi source satellite altimetry measurements to construct the water level datasets for lakes reservoirs and rivers crétaux et al 2009 crétaux et al 2011 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 schwatke et al 2015 the laboratoire d etudes en géophysique et océanographie spatiales legos hydroweb altimetry data archive crétaux et al 2009 crétaux et al 2011 was used in this study for analyzing lake water level changes however the number of lakes or reservoirs included in this data archive is rather limited therefore ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat abshire et al 2005 and icesat 2 abdalati et al 2010 altimetry data were used to supplement the lakes missing in the legos hydroweb dataset icesat was launched in 2003 and terminated in 2010 icesat 2 carrying the enhanced advanced topographic laser altimeter system launched in september 2018 exhibits multi beam and high resolution photon counting characteristics compared with icesat the icesat 2 has a finer laser footprint diameter from 70 m to 17 m and improved data accuracy from 10 cm to 3 cm abdalati et al 2010 icesat 2 atl13 a specifically designed dataset for inland water surface height was applied in the current study https nsidc org data the water mask for extracting the icesat 2 footprints is consistent with that of icesat the outliers of lake measurements were eliminated by the normalized median absolute deviation method höhle and höhle 2009 moreover icesat data was converted to the same reference system wgs 84 and egm 2008 geoid as icesat 2 atlas data bhang et al 2007 in addition donggeicuona lake and longyang reservoir were not covered by these satellite altimetry tracks their water levels were derived from the previously published literature li et al 2019b and in situ data yi et al 2017 respectively in summary the different water level data sources of these studied lakes reservoirs are described in table 2 2 3 3 estimation of the water volume variation of lakes and reservoirs the lake shoreline shifts can remarkably reflect the water level rises with area expansions in the relationship of linear or quasilinear parabolic responses hypsometric curve thus water volume variation of lake generally satisfies the calculation method of cone volume the statistical models of the water level area relationship could be constructed based on the corresponding time pairs of water level and area series table 2 we can reconstruct long term water level and area with available data finally water volume variation can be estimated using the following equation 1 taube 2000 1 δ v 1 3 h 2 h 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 where δ v is the volume variation from elevation h 1 and area a 1 to elevation h 2 and area a 2 for the water volume variation calculation in the method the error source only considers level uncertainties provided in the altimetry data thus the uncertainty of water volume variation was estimated based on the error propagation law by equation 2 chen et al 2021 2 δ v s t d 1 3 h 1 s t d 2 h 2 s t d 2 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 where δ v s t d is the uncertainty of volume variation h 1 s t d and h 2 s t d are the uncertainties of elevation h 1 and elevation h 2 2 4 glacier mass changes from tandem x and srtm dem the shuttle radar topography mission srtm mission was accomplished in february 2000 the data acquired from this mission were considered as the previous glacier surface elevations the terrasar x add on for digital elevation measurement tandem x dem was used as the glacier surface elevations around the period between january 2010 and december 2015 therefore the two dem datasets can be used for calculating glacier elevation changes of different epochs under the constraints of the randolph glacier inventory rgi 6 0 consortium 2017 all glacier related statistics were restricted to glaciers whose centroids fall within the study area similar to many previous studies gardelle et al 2013 lin et al 2008 neckel et al 2017 we first eliminated all on glacier elevation differences dh values that exceeded 150 m by using the modified srtm3 version 4 and then reserved dh values within the threshold of three standard deviations of the mean the mean glacier elevation changes were calculated using the area weighted dh of all bins the glacier volume change was calculated by multiplying the mean dh with the total glacier area it was further converted to the mass change assuming an average glacier density of 850 kg m3 huss 2013 the uncertainty was estimated by referring to ke et al 2020 the error of averaged over glacier elevation difference was the quadratic sum of three independent parts including the mean off glacier dh which refers to the glacier hypsometry weighted average of dh over the off glacier areas the random error of off glacier dh which refers to the standard error of dh over the stable ground and the error of penetration depth estimation finally the error propagation formula was applied for the mass changes brun et al 2017 more details of the methods used to quantify the glacier mass change and uncertainty can be found in ke et al 2020 2 5 soil moisture snow water equivalent swe and canopy water from gldas the goal of the global land data assimilation system gldas is to ingest satellite and ground based observational data products using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques in order to generate optimal fields of land surface states e g soil moisture and fluxes rodell et al 2004 gldas drives four land surface models mosaic koster and suarez 1996 noah chen et al 1996 koren et al 1999 the catchment land surface model clsm dai et al 2003 and the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 unfortunately the mosaic product is no longer included in the latest version of the gldas therefore only the three other products noah clsm and vic with a spatial resolution of 1 1 the same as that of grace data were downloaded from https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets the change characteristics of soil moisture simulated by noah and clsm model were similar to those of natural lakes while the vic model behaved quite differently in addition we can find that the change amplitude of soil moisture time series derived from vic was substantially different from the other two model outputs in the study area fig 6 the different soil depths simulated by different models could be the main factor that induced the discrepancy among the three models to avoid possible biases in trend calculation vic was excluded from the ensemble estimation of soil moisture swe and canopy water anomalies similar to previous studies feng et al 2013 xiang et al 2016 time series of the soil moisture swe and canopy water components from the two models were respectively averaged to reduce the model bias 2 6 linear trends fitting of grace twsa and other component changes the monthly mean anomalies of grace tws and other components in the study area were calculated using the area weighted method moreover the units of change rate for all the variables were converted into mass change rate gt yr for consistency comparison the time series of variables were used to calculate the linear trend by the robust fit linear regression dumouchel and o brien 1989 the significance of the linear trends was tested at the 95 or 99 confidence interval of the grace tws and other components trends by using a monte carlo method wang et al 2018 3 results and analysis 3 1 the time series of grace twsa derived from the multi data average as shown in fig 2 the long time series of grace twsa from the three spherical harmonic products exhibited a generally high consistency however different products presented a sharp difference at the end of the grace mission 2017 01 2017 06 probably due to the loss of the accelerometer on the grace b satellite in october 2016 wouters et al 2019 therefore the averaged result of three spherical harmonic solutions was used to reduce the uncertainties moreover the averaged result demonstrated a robust linear correlation with the three spherical harmonic products with r2 values larger than 0 90 this condition indicates that the averaged result achieves high reliability and can be accepted in this study the result showed that grace twsa exhibited an overall upward trend with evident periodic fluctuations the average water equivalent thickness in the study area increased by 12 78 cm equivalent to 25 41 gt in mass from april 2002 to august 2020 although the grace twsa has experienced a significant increase over the past two decades the ascending tendency was not monotonic in general the time series changes of grace twsa can be decomposed into three sub periods fluctuated increase in 2002 04 2012 12 gradual decline in 2013 01 2017 06 and recently sharp increase in 2018 06 2020 08 in addition the annual amplitudes of water equivalent thickness behaved very anomalously in certain years therefore to better understand the characteristics of tws changes and estimate the contributions from different components time series of grace twsa sws and soil moisture storage were compared at different time scales 3 2 the comparison of the change characteristics between the grace twsa and sws on different timescales the water volume changes of lakes and reservoirs were calculated by constructing hypsometry curves table 2 provides the curve equations for all lakes and reservoirs to compare the long term series of grace twsa with the sws changes the equivalent water thickness averaged sh cm was converted into mass change grace shc gt using the same equal area projection 3 2 1 long term change characteristics of grace twsa and sws fig 3 illustrates the linear trends and their variations of both twsa and sws changes during the study period the grace twsa increased significantly with a change rate of 0 78 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 the water storages for longyang reservoir and ngoring lake regulated by human activities exhibited a fluctuating increase meanwhile the water storages of the lakes affected by climate change and variability decreased in the early 2000 s and then presented a continuously increasing trend in particular it can be clearly found that the change rates of harla lake 0 13 0 01 gt yr p 0 01 ngoring lake 0 03 0 01 gt yr p 0 01 gyaring lake 0 06 0 01 gt yr p 0 01 and donggeicuona lake 0 03 0 00 gt yr p 0 01 were considerably smaller than those of qinghai lake 0 74 0 02 gt yr p 0 01 and longyang reservoir 0 51 0 04 gt yr p 0 01 in addition the change direction and amplitude of grace twsa was highly consistent with the water storage change of longyang reservoir however the influence of the lake water storage change on grace twsa started to strengthen with the accelerated growth rate of qinghai lake water storage for example affected by the significant increase in the water storage of qinghai lake and harla lake the magnitude of the changes in grace twsa after 2018 was significantly higher than that in other sub periods although the long term trend of grace twsa was dominated by lake water storage changes with a rapid increase in the water storage of natural lakes the cumulative change rate was 0 96 0 02 gt yr longyang reservoir and ngoring lake also made a significant contribution the cumulative change rate was 0 54 0 04 gt yr to the twsa driven by a warming climate the melting of glaciers will also lead to a decline in tws as described in section 2 4 glacier melting was estimated quantitatively to decompose the contributions of surface water changes to grace twsa accurately the result was also compared with shean et al 2020 as shown in table 3 the long term glacier mass changes in the study area exhibited a significant decreasing trend 0 31 0 06 gt yr 3 2 2 the change characteristics of grace twsa and sws in different sub periods as shown in fig 4 the time series of grace twsa can be divided into three sub periods 2002 4 2012 12 2013 1 2017 6 and 2018 6 2020 8 in accordance with the change direction and amplitude to explore the dominant factors of the temporal heterogeneity of water storage changes we further analyzed the comparative characteristics of grace twsa with different sws in different sub periods see fig 4 the result showed that grace twsa presented evident periodic fluctuations in the first period with an overall upward trend the total water storage increased by 11 68 gt 1 10 0 09 gt yr p 0 01 from april 2002 to december 2012 in the second stage the total water storage decreased by 5 95 gt with a change rate of 1 82 0 29 gt yr p 0 01 however the tendency was reversed in recent years i e the third stage with a sharply increasing rate at 2 76 0 69 gt yr p 0 01 which is nearly triple that of the first stage to examine the changes in sws all lakes and reservoirs exhibited an upward trend in the first sub period among them the water storage of longyang reservoir increased fastest i e 1 03 0 10 gt yr p 0 01 which was greater than the sum 0 75 0 03 gt yr of the change rates of four other natural lakes nearly accounting for 93 6 of the change rate of grace twsa during the second sub period the sws presented a decline except for qinghai lake and harla lake the water storage of longyang reservoir decreased fastest with a rate of 1 03 0 17 gt yr p 0 01 by contrast the water storage of qinghai lake 0 65 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 and harla lake 0 17 0 03 gt yr p 0 01 increased faster than that of the first sub period the results suggested that man regulated longyang reservoir and ngoring lake jointly contributed 70 3 to the twsa in mass during this sub period during the third sub period the climate dominated natural lakes qinghai lake 1 54 0 20 gt yr p 0 01 harla lake 1 00 0 16 gt yr p 0 01 donggeicuona lake 0 15 0 03 gt yr p 0 01 showed significantly accelerated growths by contrast gyaring lake showed an opposite change trend to the other three natural lakes as it is located in exorheic drainage areas ngoring lake and longyang reservoir presented a decrease in water storage the cumulative change rate of lake water storage changes affected by climate forcing during this period was 2 59 0 28 gt yr which accounted for approximately 87 9 of the change rate of grace twsa a conclusion can be drawn that the trends of grace twsa in the first two sub periods were nearly dominated by the water storage changes of longyang reservoir and ngoring lake meanwhile the sharp increase of grace twsa in the third sub period was primarily contributed by qinghai lake and harla lake 3 2 3 the change characteristics and factors of grace twsa and sws in abnormal years in this study the annual water storage changes were derived by calculating the average value differences between the wet season july september and the dry season january march as shown in fig 5 we further set the average annual change plus half of the standard deviation of grace tws as the reference value in abnormal years compared with the average of all years to select an appropriate number of years for analysis the abnormal years were observed in 2003 2005 2007 and 2011 2012 fig 5 the significant increases in water storage during the abnormal years made a dominant contribution to the overall increase in grace tws over the past 20 years the significant increase of grace tws in 2003 and 2005 was highly consistent with the water storage changes in longyang reservoir and ngoring lake the primary reason for the rapid increase in water storage of longyang reservoir during this period could lie in that its water levels elevated since 2005 and remained in the high stage after the historically extreme low water levels between 2002 and 2003 moreover the water level of huangheyuan reservoir also considerably increased in 2005 which caused the rapidly increasing water level and storage for ngoring lake these events indicated that human regulated reservoir water storage changes in certain anomalous years contributed considerably to twsa the effects of human activities and climate change are not only reflected in the changes in sws but also in the melting of glaciers and permafrost caused by global warming and the reduction in groundwater caused by agricultural irrigation for example fig 5 shows that the cumulative increase in surface water volume in 2011 and 2012 5 21 gt was significantly smaller than the change in twsa 16 27 gt indicating that the change in twsa during this period was dominated by soil moisture storage 7 10 gt more analysis can refer to section 3 3 3 3 the change characteristics of soil moisture and swe on different timescales the study focuses on examining the contributions of different sws types controlled by natural or anthropogenic factors that contributed to the grace tws changes however twsa is not only affected by sws but also by other components such as soil water swe and groundwater however the quantification of soil moisture budgeting is rather limited due to the lack of historical in situ measurements therefore we relied on hydrological models to simulate monthly anomalies in soil moisture and swe the canopy water component was excluded due to its relatively trivial influences in the study area similar to the change trend of grace tws the soil moisture storage showed a rapid increase trend in the long term 0 65 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 therefore in addition to the significant contribution of sws changes to grace tws during the study period the increase in soil moisture storage was also a key factor that cannot be neglected however soil moisture storage change characteristics at different sub periods were significantly different from those of grace twsa for example grace twsa increased in the first period and began to show a significant downward trend from 2013 while soil moisture storage decreased from 2010 and reversed in 2013 in general the change trend of soil moisture storage 0 83 0 09 gt yr p 0 01 is similar to that of grace tws 1 10 0 09 gt yr p 0 01 only in the first sub period while the differences between grace tws and soil moisture storage are significant in the other two sub periods especially in the second period grace tws 1 82 0 29 gt yr p 0 01 soil moisture storage 0 98 0 25 gt yr p 0 01 in addition soil moisture could be the dominant factor to influence grace tws in individual abnormal years 2007 2011 and 2012 as the contribution of soil moisture storage was significantly larger than the cumulative contribution of sws in these years in comparison the change trend of swe was much smaller than sws and soil moisture storage and thus were not quantified explicitly fig 7 4 discussions 4 1 the differences among different grace and grace fo products previous studies have suggested that the differences among different grace solutions can lead to discrepancies in twsa trend estimate jing et al 2019 scanlon et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to compare the averaged result derived from the three spherical harmonic products with three other mascon products during the study period the three mascon solutions consistently exhibited a positive twsa trend over the study area with the change rates of 0 80 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 for jpl mascon 0 98 0 07 gt yr p 0 01 for gsfc mascon and 0 49 0 07 gt yr p 0 01 for csr mascon respectively fig 8 the change direction and amplitudes of the three mascon solutions and grac shc in different sub periods were generally comparable in particular the linear trend of jpl mascon was rather close to the average spherical harmonic result and their correlation was also very high with an r2 of 0 997 in addition the study area was located in an inland basin with an area of close to 200 000 km2 and thus the result error caused by signal leakage was small jing et al 2019 scanlon et al 2016 the preceding verification results suggested that the spherical harmonic products used in the current study is reliable 4 2 uncertainties from the soil moisture and groundwater changes the commonly used large scale hydrological models derive the groundwater component by subtracting other components from the grace tws without exactly considering the changes in all lake and reservoir water storage in finer scales e g this study area li et al 2019a yin et al 2021 therefore we conducted the groundwater contribution analyses by separating the residual between grace tws changes and the estimated total of sws soil moisture storage and swe changes based on our analyzed data the permafrost thawing due to the continuously increasing temperature in the tp considerably affects the water content changes in soil layers with complex hydrological processes which cannot be well constrained in global scale land surface models there is a large range of space in the unsaturated zone that cannot be well described and simulated by these land surface models resulting in uncertainty in the demarcation of soil moisture and groundwater storage and related estimates therefore the accuracy of soil water content estimated based on land surface model is highly compromised considering the uncertainty of soil moisture estimation the groundwater mass change was thus not investigated in detail and analyzed only in discussion the result showed that groundwater storage anomaly exhibited an overall decreasing trend 0 96 0 05 gt yr p 0 01 opposite grace tws changes in the study period fig 9 the decrease in groundwater storage here was likely caused partially by uncertainties in soil moisture storage estimates although the changes in groundwater cannot be accurately estimated to account for the remainders of the grace tws signal they can be basically deemed as natural rather than anthropogenic drivers 5 conclusions to explore the roles of human activities in influencing regional tws changes in the netp in comparison with natural drivers this study quantitatively disaggregated and compared the contributions of lake and reservoir storage changes to the tws changes on different timescales the time series of grace twsa derived from the multi data average exhibited an overall upward trend 0 78 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 with evident periodic fluctuations in the long term trend the grace twsa was dominated by the changes in lake water storage with rapid expansions of natural lakes the cumulative change rate was 0 96 0 02 gt yr while the man regulated longyang reservoir and ngoring lake also made an important contribution to the twsa cumulative change rate was 0 54 0 04 gt yr in addition the increase in soil moisture storage was also a key contributor 0 65 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 of the grace tws change rate that cannot be neglected to examine the temporally heterogeneous changes of tws in different sub periods the time series of grace twsa and different sws were compared at three sub periods 2002 04 2012 12 2013 01 2017 06 2018 06 2020 08 the results indicated that the trends of grace twsa in the first two sub periods increased at a rate of 1 10 0 09 gt yr p 0 01 and then decreased with a rate of 1 82 0 29 gt yr p 0 01 were more consistent with those of longyang reservoir and ngoring lake while the increase of grace twsa in the third sub period changed with a sharp rate at 2 76 0 69 gt yr p 0 01 was dominated by qinghai lake and harla lake the change trend of soil moisture storage 0 83 0 09 gt yr p 0 01 was similar to that of grace tws only in the first sub period while the differences between grace tws and soil moisture storage were significant in the other two sub periods especially in the second sub period soil moisture storage 0 98 0 25 gt yr p 0 01 in certain years e g 2003 and 2005 the annual amplitudes of grace derived water equivalent thickness behaved very anomalously our results inferred that the anomalous twsa could be caused by the reservoir water storage changes due to the human regulations in these years moreover grace tws changes in individual years 2007 2011 and 2012 were also dominated by other factors such as soil moisture our results suggest that anthropogenic forces are becoming one of crucial factors that influence tws changes at different timescales in the netp credit authorship contribution statement

3445,the northeastern tibetan plateau netp bordering the endorheic lake basins and the upper yellow river region has been disturbed by increasing human activities in recent years the netp water storage changes could be a combined effect of climate variability change and human activities e g reservoir operation however whether the human activities have evidently altered hydrological processes and become key drivers of total terrestrial water storage tws changes in the netp remains unclear to explore the roles of human interventions in changing surface water storage sws and thus influencing regional tws changes in the netp in comparison with natural drivers this study quantitatively disaggregated and compared the contributions of tws changes from climate dominated natural lakes and man regulated reservoirs at different timescales time series of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tws anomalies twsa exhibited an overall upward trend 0 78 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 with evident periodic fluctuations from april 2002 to august 2020 although the grace twsa was more substantially influenced by changes in natural lake water storage 0 96 0 02 gt yr rather than reservoirs 0 54 0 04 gt yr in the long term trend the man regulated reservoir water storage changes can significantly dominate the grace twsa on interannual and intra annual timescales especially in the second sub period 2013 01 2017 06 grace twsa change rate 1 82 0 29 gt yr p 0 01 in comparison with the change rate of reservoir water storage of 1 28 0 17 gt yr and the natural lakes of 0 72 0 07 gt yr in some abnormal years the reservoir storage changes were even close to the overall signal of region wide grace twsa in addition the increase in soil moisture storage long term linear trend 0 65 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 was also a key factor that cannot be neglected our results suggest that human activities are becoming one of the key factors influencing tws changes in the netp keywords tibetan plateau water storage lake reservoir global change grace fo 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp together with surrounding high mountains well known as asian water tower is the source of many large rivers of asia such as the yangtze brahmaputra indus and yellow immerzeel et al 2020 kääb et al 2012 lu et al 2005 yang et al 2014 yao et al 2012b it is extensively covered by glaciers and lakes which are important components of the terrestrial water budget and regional hydrological cycle bolch et al 2012 qiu 2008 yao et al 2012b the tp is one of the most sensitive areas in response to global climate change and has been becoming warmer and wetter during the past several decades kuang and jiao 2016 sorg et al 2012 sun et al 2020a yang et al 2011 such a phenomenon correlates well with the lake expansion and glacier melting observed in recent years however the lack of in situ observations in high mountain regions limits our understanding of these hydrological changes fortunately this obstacle has been reduced by rapidly emerging satellite observations with various sensors han et al 2019 long et al 2017 xu et al 2020 many prior studies have used optical satellite imagery laser altimetry observations and microwave detection to examine glacier lake and permafrost changes across space and time in the tp these prior study results have indicated significant changes occurred in the tp such as the glacier retreat bolch et al 2012 kääb et al 2012 yao et al 2007 yao et al 2012a permafrost degradation cheng and wu 2007 guo et al 2012 wu and zhang 2008 yang et al 2010 and lake expansion hwang et al 2019 lei and yang 2017 lei et al 2013 li et al 2019b qiao and zhu 2019 song et al 2013 song et al 2014 yang et al 2018 yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 which were considerably affecting the regional terrestrial water storage tws and hydrological cycle in addition a more comprehensive understanding of water storage change in the tp was facilitated with the launch of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellites in general most studies have reported the strong spatial heterogeneity of tws changes across the tp with a decreasing trend in the plateau periphery and an increasing trend in the inner and northern parts guo et al 2016 jiao et al 2015 meng et al 2019 song et al 2015 xiang et al 2016 yin et al 2021 these studies further disassembled different hydrological components such as glaciers lakes and groundwater to understand the possible causes of spatial heterogeneity on the basis of multi source remote sensing data the results have indicated that the overall glacier retreating is considered to be the primary cause of tws depletion in the peripheral plateau particularly along the himalayas bolch et al 2012 jacob et al 2012 kääb et al 2012 matsuo and heki 2010 yao et al 2012a while for the inner and northern tp the rapid lake mass accumulations that were mainly driven by wetting climate and water vapor transport from the outside the inner tp is consistently deemed as the dominant factor of the tws increase song et al 2013 wang et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 undoubtedly the significant hydrological changes in the inner tp including the qiangtang and hoh xil that are minimally intervened by human activities were dominated by climate change and variability by contrast the northeastern tp netp which borders the endorheic lake basins and the upper yellow river basin and has relatively lower elevations is being disturbed by increasing human activities such as the construction of hydropower stations and mining especially in recent years human interventions have become more frequent with the development of western china for example the water regulation and expansion operations of the longyang reservoir one of the largest dams in the yellow river undoubtedly affect the regional water balance however whether the human activities have evidently altered the hydrological processes and become the critical factors of influencing the tws changes in the netp remain unclear with the successful launch of grace follow on grace fo in may 2018 the scientific gravity observations combined with grace satellites will extend the investigation of tws changes in the netp to nearly two decades to conduct a quantitative comparison of the influences of climate forcing and human activities on tws changes the mass variations of natural lakes affected by climate variability and reservoirs regulated by human activities are quantified separately in the study region the two primary objectives of this study were designed to 1 examine the variations of multiple timescales in the tws anomaly twsa time series in the netp and 2 quantify the contributions of glacier mass natural lakes reservoirs and soil moisture storage changes to tws changes in order to identify the effects of human activities and climate forcing the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area datasets and methodology section 3 presents the analyses on change characteristics of grace tws sws and soil moisture storage at different time scales then the discrepancy among the different grace and grace fo products and groundwater storage changes are discussed in section 4 eventually the major findings of this study are summarized in section 5 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the study area in this work includes the geographic domain between 97 and 101 e and 34 39 n fig 1 the study area mainly includes the eastern qaidam basin the southeastern hexi basin and the upper yellow river basin the geographical environment of this area is diverse and different land cover types are distributed in different basins and elevations the glaciers are mostly located in the northwest the hexi basin of the study area the southern part of the study area is the upper yellow river region in addition many lakes are distributed in the study area and these lakes are currently undergoing significant changes due to the impact of climate changes compared with four large lakes qinghai lake harla lake gyaring lake and donggeicuona lake the water storage changes of other small lakes have few contributions to the tws changes therefore these four large lakes were investigated for quantifying the contribution of lake water storage to the tws changes by contrast the water mass changes of longyang reservoir and ngoring lake its water levels were greatly influenced by the operation of the adjacent reservoir i e huangheyuan reservoir were quantified to indicate the tws influences from human activities 2 2 tws changes from different grace grace fo products the nasa dlr grace twin satellite mission was launched in 2002 and terminated in june 2017 tapley et al 2004 its successor grace fo launched in may 2018 continues the scientific gravimetry observation mission kornfeld et al 2019 sun et al 2020b the official grace science data system continuously released monthly grace solutions derived from three different processing institutions with different parameters and strategies geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz center for space research csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl the current solutions for data processing are the release 06 rl06 gravity field solutions the latest released versions of grace twsa products include the spherical harmonic data and mass concentration mascon data versions more detailed information about the six latest grace products three mascons solutions and three spherical harmonics solutions is provided in table 1 in this study the three spherical harmonic solutions were averaged to minimize the uncertainties associated with data processing we estimated the uncertainty among different grace solutions by calculating the standard deviation of the three solutions moreover a few occurrences of monthly data that are missing in the dataset were interpolated linearly by weighted averaging of the observations before and after the missing month grace tws data from jpl mascon rl06 csr mascon rl06 and goddard space flight center gsfc mascon were also used for the inter comparison 2 3 surface water storage changes from global surface water gsw dataset and multi source altimetry data 2 3 1 water area from joint research center jrc gsw the monthly mapping results of the lake and reservoir inundation areas were generated on the google earth engine platform by using the jrc gsw dataset pekel et al 2016 we employed the monthly water history layer which provides the monthly water detention data to estimate the time series of lake and reservoir water areas then the derived monthly water extents were manually inspected and edited for quality control and converted into the equal area projection before calculating the monthly areas 2 3 2 water level from legos hydroweb and space borne laser altimetry at present many institutions have integrated multi source satellite altimetry measurements to construct the water level datasets for lakes reservoirs and rivers crétaux et al 2009 crétaux et al 2011 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 schwatke et al 2015 the laboratoire d etudes en géophysique et océanographie spatiales legos hydroweb altimetry data archive crétaux et al 2009 crétaux et al 2011 was used in this study for analyzing lake water level changes however the number of lakes or reservoirs included in this data archive is rather limited therefore ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat abshire et al 2005 and icesat 2 abdalati et al 2010 altimetry data were used to supplement the lakes missing in the legos hydroweb dataset icesat was launched in 2003 and terminated in 2010 icesat 2 carrying the enhanced advanced topographic laser altimeter system launched in september 2018 exhibits multi beam and high resolution photon counting characteristics compared with icesat the icesat 2 has a finer laser footprint diameter from 70 m to 17 m and improved data accuracy from 10 cm to 3 cm abdalati et al 2010 icesat 2 atl13 a specifically designed dataset for inland water surface height was applied in the current study https nsidc org data the water mask for extracting the icesat 2 footprints is consistent with that of icesat the outliers of lake measurements were eliminated by the normalized median absolute deviation method höhle and höhle 2009 moreover icesat data was converted to the same reference system wgs 84 and egm 2008 geoid as icesat 2 atlas data bhang et al 2007 in addition donggeicuona lake and longyang reservoir were not covered by these satellite altimetry tracks their water levels were derived from the previously published literature li et al 2019b and in situ data yi et al 2017 respectively in summary the different water level data sources of these studied lakes reservoirs are described in table 2 2 3 3 estimation of the water volume variation of lakes and reservoirs the lake shoreline shifts can remarkably reflect the water level rises with area expansions in the relationship of linear or quasilinear parabolic responses hypsometric curve thus water volume variation of lake generally satisfies the calculation method of cone volume the statistical models of the water level area relationship could be constructed based on the corresponding time pairs of water level and area series table 2 we can reconstruct long term water level and area with available data finally water volume variation can be estimated using the following equation 1 taube 2000 1 δ v 1 3 h 2 h 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 where δ v is the volume variation from elevation h 1 and area a 1 to elevation h 2 and area a 2 for the water volume variation calculation in the method the error source only considers level uncertainties provided in the altimetry data thus the uncertainty of water volume variation was estimated based on the error propagation law by equation 2 chen et al 2021 2 δ v s t d 1 3 h 1 s t d 2 h 2 s t d 2 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 where δ v s t d is the uncertainty of volume variation h 1 s t d and h 2 s t d are the uncertainties of elevation h 1 and elevation h 2 2 4 glacier mass changes from tandem x and srtm dem the shuttle radar topography mission srtm mission was accomplished in february 2000 the data acquired from this mission were considered as the previous glacier surface elevations the terrasar x add on for digital elevation measurement tandem x dem was used as the glacier surface elevations around the period between january 2010 and december 2015 therefore the two dem datasets can be used for calculating glacier elevation changes of different epochs under the constraints of the randolph glacier inventory rgi 6 0 consortium 2017 all glacier related statistics were restricted to glaciers whose centroids fall within the study area similar to many previous studies gardelle et al 2013 lin et al 2008 neckel et al 2017 we first eliminated all on glacier elevation differences dh values that exceeded 150 m by using the modified srtm3 version 4 and then reserved dh values within the threshold of three standard deviations of the mean the mean glacier elevation changes were calculated using the area weighted dh of all bins the glacier volume change was calculated by multiplying the mean dh with the total glacier area it was further converted to the mass change assuming an average glacier density of 850 kg m3 huss 2013 the uncertainty was estimated by referring to ke et al 2020 the error of averaged over glacier elevation difference was the quadratic sum of three independent parts including the mean off glacier dh which refers to the glacier hypsometry weighted average of dh over the off glacier areas the random error of off glacier dh which refers to the standard error of dh over the stable ground and the error of penetration depth estimation finally the error propagation formula was applied for the mass changes brun et al 2017 more details of the methods used to quantify the glacier mass change and uncertainty can be found in ke et al 2020 2 5 soil moisture snow water equivalent swe and canopy water from gldas the goal of the global land data assimilation system gldas is to ingest satellite and ground based observational data products using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques in order to generate optimal fields of land surface states e g soil moisture and fluxes rodell et al 2004 gldas drives four land surface models mosaic koster and suarez 1996 noah chen et al 1996 koren et al 1999 the catchment land surface model clsm dai et al 2003 and the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 unfortunately the mosaic product is no longer included in the latest version of the gldas therefore only the three other products noah clsm and vic with a spatial resolution of 1 1 the same as that of grace data were downloaded from https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets the change characteristics of soil moisture simulated by noah and clsm model were similar to those of natural lakes while the vic model behaved quite differently in addition we can find that the change amplitude of soil moisture time series derived from vic was substantially different from the other two model outputs in the study area fig 6 the different soil depths simulated by different models could be the main factor that induced the discrepancy among the three models to avoid possible biases in trend calculation vic was excluded from the ensemble estimation of soil moisture swe and canopy water anomalies similar to previous studies feng et al 2013 xiang et al 2016 time series of the soil moisture swe and canopy water components from the two models were respectively averaged to reduce the model bias 2 6 linear trends fitting of grace twsa and other component changes the monthly mean anomalies of grace tws and other components in the study area were calculated using the area weighted method moreover the units of change rate for all the variables were converted into mass change rate gt yr for consistency comparison the time series of variables were used to calculate the linear trend by the robust fit linear regression dumouchel and o brien 1989 the significance of the linear trends was tested at the 95 or 99 confidence interval of the grace tws and other components trends by using a monte carlo method wang et al 2018 3 results and analysis 3 1 the time series of grace twsa derived from the multi data average as shown in fig 2 the long time series of grace twsa from the three spherical harmonic products exhibited a generally high consistency however different products presented a sharp difference at the end of the grace mission 2017 01 2017 06 probably due to the loss of the accelerometer on the grace b satellite in october 2016 wouters et al 2019 therefore the averaged result of three spherical harmonic solutions was used to reduce the uncertainties moreover the averaged result demonstrated a robust linear correlation with the three spherical harmonic products with r2 values larger than 0 90 this condition indicates that the averaged result achieves high reliability and can be accepted in this study the result showed that grace twsa exhibited an overall upward trend with evident periodic fluctuations the average water equivalent thickness in the study area increased by 12 78 cm equivalent to 25 41 gt in mass from april 2002 to august 2020 although the grace twsa has experienced a significant increase over the past two decades the ascending tendency was not monotonic in general the time series changes of grace twsa can be decomposed into three sub periods fluctuated increase in 2002 04 2012 12 gradual decline in 2013 01 2017 06 and recently sharp increase in 2018 06 2020 08 in addition the annual amplitudes of water equivalent thickness behaved very anomalously in certain years therefore to better understand the characteristics of tws changes and estimate the contributions from different components time series of grace twsa sws and soil moisture storage were compared at different time scales 3 2 the comparison of the change characteristics between the grace twsa and sws on different timescales the water volume changes of lakes and reservoirs were calculated by constructing hypsometry curves table 2 provides the curve equations for all lakes and reservoirs to compare the long term series of grace twsa with the sws changes the equivalent water thickness averaged sh cm was converted into mass change grace shc gt using the same equal area projection 3 2 1 long term change characteristics of grace twsa and sws fig 3 illustrates the linear trends and their variations of both twsa and sws changes during the study period the grace twsa increased significantly with a change rate of 0 78 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 the water storages for longyang reservoir and ngoring lake regulated by human activities exhibited a fluctuating increase meanwhile the water storages of the lakes affected by climate change and variability decreased in the early 2000 s and then presented a continuously increasing trend in particular it can be clearly found that the change rates of harla lake 0 13 0 01 gt yr p 0 01 ngoring lake 0 03 0 01 gt yr p 0 01 gyaring lake 0 06 0 01 gt yr p 0 01 and donggeicuona lake 0 03 0 00 gt yr p 0 01 were considerably smaller than those of qinghai lake 0 74 0 02 gt yr p 0 01 and longyang reservoir 0 51 0 04 gt yr p 0 01 in addition the change direction and amplitude of grace twsa was highly consistent with the water storage change of longyang reservoir however the influence of the lake water storage change on grace twsa started to strengthen with the accelerated growth rate of qinghai lake water storage for example affected by the significant increase in the water storage of qinghai lake and harla lake the magnitude of the changes in grace twsa after 2018 was significantly higher than that in other sub periods although the long term trend of grace twsa was dominated by lake water storage changes with a rapid increase in the water storage of natural lakes the cumulative change rate was 0 96 0 02 gt yr longyang reservoir and ngoring lake also made a significant contribution the cumulative change rate was 0 54 0 04 gt yr to the twsa driven by a warming climate the melting of glaciers will also lead to a decline in tws as described in section 2 4 glacier melting was estimated quantitatively to decompose the contributions of surface water changes to grace twsa accurately the result was also compared with shean et al 2020 as shown in table 3 the long term glacier mass changes in the study area exhibited a significant decreasing trend 0 31 0 06 gt yr 3 2 2 the change characteristics of grace twsa and sws in different sub periods as shown in fig 4 the time series of grace twsa can be divided into three sub periods 2002 4 2012 12 2013 1 2017 6 and 2018 6 2020 8 in accordance with the change direction and amplitude to explore the dominant factors of the temporal heterogeneity of water storage changes we further analyzed the comparative characteristics of grace twsa with different sws in different sub periods see fig 4 the result showed that grace twsa presented evident periodic fluctuations in the first period with an overall upward trend the total water storage increased by 11 68 gt 1 10 0 09 gt yr p 0 01 from april 2002 to december 2012 in the second stage the total water storage decreased by 5 95 gt with a change rate of 1 82 0 29 gt yr p 0 01 however the tendency was reversed in recent years i e the third stage with a sharply increasing rate at 2 76 0 69 gt yr p 0 01 which is nearly triple that of the first stage to examine the changes in sws all lakes and reservoirs exhibited an upward trend in the first sub period among them the water storage of longyang reservoir increased fastest i e 1 03 0 10 gt yr p 0 01 which was greater than the sum 0 75 0 03 gt yr of the change rates of four other natural lakes nearly accounting for 93 6 of the change rate of grace twsa during the second sub period the sws presented a decline except for qinghai lake and harla lake the water storage of longyang reservoir decreased fastest with a rate of 1 03 0 17 gt yr p 0 01 by contrast the water storage of qinghai lake 0 65 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 and harla lake 0 17 0 03 gt yr p 0 01 increased faster than that of the first sub period the results suggested that man regulated longyang reservoir and ngoring lake jointly contributed 70 3 to the twsa in mass during this sub period during the third sub period the climate dominated natural lakes qinghai lake 1 54 0 20 gt yr p 0 01 harla lake 1 00 0 16 gt yr p 0 01 donggeicuona lake 0 15 0 03 gt yr p 0 01 showed significantly accelerated growths by contrast gyaring lake showed an opposite change trend to the other three natural lakes as it is located in exorheic drainage areas ngoring lake and longyang reservoir presented a decrease in water storage the cumulative change rate of lake water storage changes affected by climate forcing during this period was 2 59 0 28 gt yr which accounted for approximately 87 9 of the change rate of grace twsa a conclusion can be drawn that the trends of grace twsa in the first two sub periods were nearly dominated by the water storage changes of longyang reservoir and ngoring lake meanwhile the sharp increase of grace twsa in the third sub period was primarily contributed by qinghai lake and harla lake 3 2 3 the change characteristics and factors of grace twsa and sws in abnormal years in this study the annual water storage changes were derived by calculating the average value differences between the wet season july september and the dry season january march as shown in fig 5 we further set the average annual change plus half of the standard deviation of grace tws as the reference value in abnormal years compared with the average of all years to select an appropriate number of years for analysis the abnormal years were observed in 2003 2005 2007 and 2011 2012 fig 5 the significant increases in water storage during the abnormal years made a dominant contribution to the overall increase in grace tws over the past 20 years the significant increase of grace tws in 2003 and 2005 was highly consistent with the water storage changes in longyang reservoir and ngoring lake the primary reason for the rapid increase in water storage of longyang reservoir during this period could lie in that its water levels elevated since 2005 and remained in the high stage after the historically extreme low water levels between 2002 and 2003 moreover the water level of huangheyuan reservoir also considerably increased in 2005 which caused the rapidly increasing water level and storage for ngoring lake these events indicated that human regulated reservoir water storage changes in certain anomalous years contributed considerably to twsa the effects of human activities and climate change are not only reflected in the changes in sws but also in the melting of glaciers and permafrost caused by global warming and the reduction in groundwater caused by agricultural irrigation for example fig 5 shows that the cumulative increase in surface water volume in 2011 and 2012 5 21 gt was significantly smaller than the change in twsa 16 27 gt indicating that the change in twsa during this period was dominated by soil moisture storage 7 10 gt more analysis can refer to section 3 3 3 3 the change characteristics of soil moisture and swe on different timescales the study focuses on examining the contributions of different sws types controlled by natural or anthropogenic factors that contributed to the grace tws changes however twsa is not only affected by sws but also by other components such as soil water swe and groundwater however the quantification of soil moisture budgeting is rather limited due to the lack of historical in situ measurements therefore we relied on hydrological models to simulate monthly anomalies in soil moisture and swe the canopy water component was excluded due to its relatively trivial influences in the study area similar to the change trend of grace tws the soil moisture storage showed a rapid increase trend in the long term 0 65 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 therefore in addition to the significant contribution of sws changes to grace tws during the study period the increase in soil moisture storage was also a key factor that cannot be neglected however soil moisture storage change characteristics at different sub periods were significantly different from those of grace twsa for example grace twsa increased in the first period and began to show a significant downward trend from 2013 while soil moisture storage decreased from 2010 and reversed in 2013 in general the change trend of soil moisture storage 0 83 0 09 gt yr p 0 01 is similar to that of grace tws 1 10 0 09 gt yr p 0 01 only in the first sub period while the differences between grace tws and soil moisture storage are significant in the other two sub periods especially in the second period grace tws 1 82 0 29 gt yr p 0 01 soil moisture storage 0 98 0 25 gt yr p 0 01 in addition soil moisture could be the dominant factor to influence grace tws in individual abnormal years 2007 2011 and 2012 as the contribution of soil moisture storage was significantly larger than the cumulative contribution of sws in these years in comparison the change trend of swe was much smaller than sws and soil moisture storage and thus were not quantified explicitly fig 7 4 discussions 4 1 the differences among different grace and grace fo products previous studies have suggested that the differences among different grace solutions can lead to discrepancies in twsa trend estimate jing et al 2019 scanlon et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to compare the averaged result derived from the three spherical harmonic products with three other mascon products during the study period the three mascon solutions consistently exhibited a positive twsa trend over the study area with the change rates of 0 80 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 for jpl mascon 0 98 0 07 gt yr p 0 01 for gsfc mascon and 0 49 0 07 gt yr p 0 01 for csr mascon respectively fig 8 the change direction and amplitudes of the three mascon solutions and grac shc in different sub periods were generally comparable in particular the linear trend of jpl mascon was rather close to the average spherical harmonic result and their correlation was also very high with an r2 of 0 997 in addition the study area was located in an inland basin with an area of close to 200 000 km2 and thus the result error caused by signal leakage was small jing et al 2019 scanlon et al 2016 the preceding verification results suggested that the spherical harmonic products used in the current study is reliable 4 2 uncertainties from the soil moisture and groundwater changes the commonly used large scale hydrological models derive the groundwater component by subtracting other components from the grace tws without exactly considering the changes in all lake and reservoir water storage in finer scales e g this study area li et al 2019a yin et al 2021 therefore we conducted the groundwater contribution analyses by separating the residual between grace tws changes and the estimated total of sws soil moisture storage and swe changes based on our analyzed data the permafrost thawing due to the continuously increasing temperature in the tp considerably affects the water content changes in soil layers with complex hydrological processes which cannot be well constrained in global scale land surface models there is a large range of space in the unsaturated zone that cannot be well described and simulated by these land surface models resulting in uncertainty in the demarcation of soil moisture and groundwater storage and related estimates therefore the accuracy of soil water content estimated based on land surface model is highly compromised considering the uncertainty of soil moisture estimation the groundwater mass change was thus not investigated in detail and analyzed only in discussion the result showed that groundwater storage anomaly exhibited an overall decreasing trend 0 96 0 05 gt yr p 0 01 opposite grace tws changes in the study period fig 9 the decrease in groundwater storage here was likely caused partially by uncertainties in soil moisture storage estimates although the changes in groundwater cannot be accurately estimated to account for the remainders of the grace tws signal they can be basically deemed as natural rather than anthropogenic drivers 5 conclusions to explore the roles of human activities in influencing regional tws changes in the netp in comparison with natural drivers this study quantitatively disaggregated and compared the contributions of lake and reservoir storage changes to the tws changes on different timescales the time series of grace twsa derived from the multi data average exhibited an overall upward trend 0 78 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 with evident periodic fluctuations in the long term trend the grace twsa was dominated by the changes in lake water storage with rapid expansions of natural lakes the cumulative change rate was 0 96 0 02 gt yr while the man regulated longyang reservoir and ngoring lake also made an important contribution to the twsa cumulative change rate was 0 54 0 04 gt yr in addition the increase in soil moisture storage was also a key contributor 0 65 0 06 gt yr p 0 01 of the grace tws change rate that cannot be neglected to examine the temporally heterogeneous changes of tws in different sub periods the time series of grace twsa and different sws were compared at three sub periods 2002 04 2012 12 2013 01 2017 06 2018 06 2020 08 the results indicated that the trends of grace twsa in the first two sub periods increased at a rate of 1 10 0 09 gt yr p

the reservoir water storage changes due to the human regulations in these years moreover grace tws changes in individual years 2007 2011 and 2012 were also dominated by other factors such as soil

3446,recent riverbed sand mining activities have modified estuarine morphology and sedimentation patterns in many southeast asian deltas the soai rap estuary along the dong nai river one of the largest rivers in southern vietnam is one of the most intensively mined areas in the region where large scale sand mining activities have started since the 1990 s in this paper we used hydrodynamic modelling telemac 2d to investigate the estuarine morphological changes and sediment dynamics related to the intensive riverbed mining in the soai rap estuary after the hydraulic calibration and validation of the model we simulate four scenarios two with dredging one with sand excavation and a baseline condition our results show that dredging substantially changed the hydraulic regimes morphological and sediment dynamics of the estuary compared to the baseline dredging substantially influences flow velocity and tidal amplitude these activities reduce the amount of sediment accumulating upstream by 18 to 36 while increasing sediment deposition in the soai rap estuary by 6 to 13 furthermore sediment accumulation in the ganh rai bay area decrease by 5 to 10 due to increased sediment transport from the sea to the estuary our modelled results also show that the mining pits pockmarks created by sand extractions efficiently trap sediment causing discontinuities in the longitudinal transport of sediment and resulting morphological patterns we conclude that the morphology and sediment transport regime of the soai rap estuary has been significantly altered by the river sand dredging as such we recommend that the local government put in place measures to ensure that sand extraction is carried out sustainably in the future to minimise further alterations to the natural sedimentation patterns and geomorphology of this estuary keywords coastal changes hydrodynamic sediment dredging mining estuary mekong 1 introduction estuaries are among the world s most productive ecosystems elliott and whitfield 2011 mclusky and elliott 2004 and are at the dynamic interface between tides waves and fluvial processes dalrymple et al 1992a savenije 2006 this allows mixing of seawater and river water in estuaries creating habitats for an abundance of brackish water organisms perillo 1995 factors influencing morphological characteristics and processes in estuarine areas include tides river flows river sediment transport longshore sediment transport waves and density driven flows xie et al 2019 specifically for interactions between estuarine topographic features suspended sediment transport and bottom sediment transport are the main morphological processes stark et al 2017 wang et al 2020 these processes take place continuously sometimes reaching an equilibrium condition in which estuarine morphology exhibits a relatively steady state du et al 2016 nowacki and grossman 2020 zhou et al 2017 however most estuaries rarely reach this equilibrium condition due to the dynamic nature of the sediment and water cycles as well as the ever increasing impacts of climate change and human activities such as resource exploitation for socio economic development dalrymple et al 1992b 1992a savenije 2006 and upstream dam construction land reclamation and sand excavation dai et al 2018 2016 park et al 2021 in southern vietnam human activities have also affected the morphology of estuaries the soai rap estuary hoàng 2008 hoàng et al 2005a this has become evident after 2009 when sand mining activities accelerated due to the regional needs as well as the soaring national demand along with the rapid urbanization and economic development in vietnam nguyen et al 2012 as a result spatially heterogeneous riverbed erosion with a tendency to migrate upstream has been observed hoàng 2008 nguyen et al 2012 trần and nguyễn 2014 many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the changes in the rivers in southern vietnam most attributing it to climate change and human activities anh and lộc 2017 hoàng et al 2005b loc et al 2021b nguyễn et al 2012 among those sand mining activities have been considered a major factor causing geomorphic changes whereas climate change induced mean sea level rise has amplified coastal tidal regimes that change water flows and marine currents in and out of the estuary anh and lộc 2017 eslami et al 2019 hübler and pothen 2021 tu et al 2019 several studies have examined morphological change and sediment transport in the riverbed of the soai rap estuary and surrounding areas of the mekong gugliotta et al 2020 loc et al 2021b ng and park 2021 tu et al 2019 walling 2008 though these studies provide evidence on estuarine hydrodynamic processes and morphology there remain limitations in explicitly elaborating the large scale morphodynamics caused by sand dredging and mining activities for instance gugliotta et al 2020 analysed 80 sediment samples from the channel bed to understand sediment transport in a short reach of the dong nai river however they did not address the sediment transport mechanism at the soai rap estuary tu et al 2019 assessed sediment transport and morphodynamics changes in the mekong estuaries and the coastal zones using a delft3d model with a 10 year simulation period though their analysis included an evaluation of the impacts of sand extractions the model used a lumped process that did not consider specific sand mining sites distributed along the river to simulate hydrologic processes walling 2008 assessed changes in sediment load in the mekong river but did not account for the influence of sand mining activities recently park et al 2020 and ng and park 2021 elaborated the impact of human activities on the morphology of the lower mekong river including such activities as canal dredging sand mining and dike construction however their study relied mostly on indirect evidence such as the water level analysis of the data from gauge stations and water extent series mapped from remotely sensed data of which the clear link between sand mining and targeted specific environmental consequences could have been better developed through hydrodynamic modelling in addition sediment transport is usually simulated using either non cohesive or cohesive properties sand or mud typically bypassing the complex spatial variability of sediment characteristics in natural estuaries which most studies have excluded although many modelling studies have been carried out to understand hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the mekong region e g hackney et al 2020 manh et al 2014 thanh et al 2017 tu et al 2019 limited studies have used modelling works to elaborate the same problem in the dong nai sai gon river basin as well as soai rap estuary particularly concerning the impacts of dredging and sand mining activities nguyen et al 2005 used a two dimensional hydraulic model mike21c to simulate and predict the morphological changes of the river and propose solutions to stabilize the riverbed in the downstream area of the dong nai river system saigon their results mainly evaluated and predicted the possibility of landslides and accretion locally to determine the riverbank elevation along the river thereby proposing solutions to stabilize the riverbank research by thi bay nguyen et al 2012 used mike 21 and mike 3 hydrodynamic models to calculate and simulate hydrodynamic regimes the propagation of salinity distribution and suspended sediment concentration ssc and the change of riverbed from the long tau confluence soai rap to the sea mouth the study assessing the impacts of soai rap river dredging scenarios with elevations of 9 5 m and 11 0 m showed that the riverbed velocity in the soai rap river relatively decreased and eroded the channel due to dredging recently le et al 2015 applied the hydraulic model mike21 to evaluate the impact of dredging the channel at soai rap estuary the simulation results for the scenario of dredging the soai rap river to the elevations of 9 5 m and 12 0 m presented that dredging the river does not significantly impact the river s dynamic sedimentation and erosion pattern and neighbouring rivers in general the above studies have not shown the distribution of sediment loads between areas from upstream to estuary under the impacts of dredging besides sand mining activities have not been examined sand mining impacted data have been collected using many extensive surveys which are then systematically analysed and evaluated over space and time it is impossible to comprehensively assess the impacts jordan et al 2019 muhammad aqeel ashraf ismail yusoff abdul wajid karamat mahmood 2011 in particular there is an obvious need to understand the mechanism of sediment transport conductivity and riverbed stabilization in the region related to hydrodynamic conditions dung et al 2018 manh et al 2015 tran et al 2019 triet et al 2020 and sand mining activities these could be addressed using a hydrological and morphodynamic model calibrated and verified to understand sediment transport and explore morphological dynamics under scenario based simulations attar et al 2020 thanh et al 2017 tu et al 2019 the modelling works calibration and verification process needs observed data such as water level discharge velocity and ssc as shown by several studies i e manh et al 2014 thanh et al 2017 tu et al 2019 the ssc is one of the most important parameters to assess whether the model performance is reliable to simulate sedimentation and erosion patterns but the ssc calibration and validation process appears to be the most challenging for many modellers our study is one of the first aiming to fill these knowledge gaps by qualitatively assessing the mining impacts using a hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model this study aims to investigate the changes in morphodynamics regimes due to sand mining activities in the dong nai sai gon river system in the southern vietnam we focus on the soai rap estuary analysing the sediment transport with both cohesive and non cohesive properties we developed a two dimensional hydrodynamic model for the estuary using telemac 2d and calibrated and validated the model using water level flow velocity and sediment concentration data this is one of the studies of the estuarine morphodynamics and potential riverbed changes related to the sand mining activities in vietnam furthermore this study demonstrates the practical utility of the modelling approaches in seeking solutions for riverbed stabilization by enhancing the understanding of sediment distributions caused by dredging and mining and subsequently help to advancing strategies for managing exploiting and protecting natural resources in estuarine systems we envision that the findings contribute to the discussion and implementation of sustainable development strategies in the soai rap estuary in southern vietnam in particular but also provides a useful reference for international audiences interested in sand mining impact assessments especially those in southeast asian deltas 2 study area located in southern vietnam the dong nai saigon river passes through three provinces and major cities including dong nai ho chi minh city and long an the soai rap estuary is the last stage of the dong nai river basin before entering the ocean which has a total area of 40 700 km2 the soai rap river is a branch of the downstream system of the dong nai saigon river it is 45 km long and passes through nha be and can gio districts before flowing into the east sea at the soai rap estuary fig 1 the river s width is about 2 420 m and the riverbed elevation varies from 32 0 m to 8 0 m the mean annual discharge of the dong nai river estimated at the soai rap estuary is q o 1 067 m3 s over the 1980 2017 period the total annual volume discharge was 34 billion m3 according to the southern institute for water resources planning in ho chi minh city due to the relatively low topographic relief of the area combined with the intensive local rainfall and the complex network of rivers and canals which are wide and deep the funnel shaped estuary is strongly influenced by the east sea s semi diurnal tidal regime with a 2 4 m difference between high tide and low tide as a result saline water penetrates far inland about 60 80 km affecting the freshwater availability for the region s livelihoods every year anh and lộc 2017 loc et al 2021a besides sediment transport and distribution patterns within the estuary are determined primarily by the tidal current the dong nai river s downstream segment starts below the tri an reservoir and extends to the soai rap estuary this river section has a length of 150 km of which the confluence from the be river to nha be is 76 km long 180 1 400 m wide and 6 6 17 m deep anh and lộc 2017 after nha be the dong nai river splits into two distributaries at a point 76 km from the sea one of these the nha be river extends southward with a width of 1 000 3 000 m and a depth of 10 20 m anh and lộc 2017 the second distributary the long tau river proceeds in a more south easterly direction and is 300 450 m wide with a depth of 30 40 m anh and lộc 2017 due to its depth the long tau is an important navigation route from ho chi minh city to the surrounding provinces and abroad the main tributaries flowing into the dong nai river from the east are the be and saigon rivers and the vam co river the la buong river flows into the dong nai from the west farther to the east the 30 km long thi vai river flows directly into ganh rai bay 3

in many studies to investigate wave propagation changes in river channel morphology flooding frequency and the complex hydrodynamic and morphodynamic situations in estuaries brière et al 2007 dorfmann et al 2014 nelson et al 2006 villaret et al 2013 some advantages of the telemac include i support for parallel computation on large host computers with many microprocessors that enable shorter computation times for extensive hydraulic simulations ii open source allowing users to easily change the source code to incorporate additional parameters and change formulas that are more suitable to the region iii ability to calculate the mixed cohesive and non cohesive mud sand sediment consistencies and vi ability to communicate with the global telemac community telemac 2d uses the two

and around the soai rap estuary while also encompassing processes of sediment transport from the upstream dong nai saigon mekong and bassac rivers fig 3 the modelled area thus includes the upstream section at the confluence of the dong nai and be rivers 165 km from the estuary the confluence of the saigon and thi tinh rivers the area of the long son ferry terminal vam co dong river the vam co tay river at national highway 1a the tien river at the my thuan gauging station and the hau river at the can tho gauging station downstream it extends 120 km into the east sea from the estuary mouth bottom elevations range from 45 to 20 m and the modelled area spans 27 347 km2 the setup of the river network grid strongly affects the quality of the simulation results our telemac 2d model uses both structured quadrilateral and unstructured meshes structured meshes apply to rivers while unstructured meshes represent estuarine and coastal areas the computational domain includes the soai rap and mekong rivers constructed by 154 459 triangular elements with 84 903 nodes the smallest mesh size is 22 100 m for rivers and estuaries the area adjacent to the estuary and east sea has a mesh size of 200 600 m the mesh size for the east sea is 800 12 700 m 3 3 gauge station and field data for numerical modelling table 1 presents the input data for the numerical modelling these consist of i discharge time series data used as upstream boundaries ii water level mean velocity and wave used as downstream boundaries and iii water level flow velocity and suspended sediment concentration ssc used for model calibration and validation 3 4 model calibration and validation the simulated hydrodynamic and morphological processes include hydraulic factors that is water level velocity wave and transport of suspended sediment in the water mass we used suspended sediment and water level data for calibration dry season and validation flood season flow velocity data were used only for dry season validation due to data limitations the coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to test for the suitability and performance of the model before running the scenario simulations and projections attar et al 2020 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 r 2 shows linear relationships between measured values and the model simulation while nse measures the degree of observed variability explained by the simulation nse is commonly used for model validation in hydrology when the value of r 2 approaches 1 and nse is 1 the model is considered to perform to the

range from to 1 with 1 indicating best performance 3 5 sensitivity analysis we analysed four main parameters for sensitivity analysis during the calibration process to empirically evaluate the influence of the parameters on the model s results including settling velocity skin friction correction krone partheniades erosion law constant and sediment diameters see appendix table a1 the ssc is considered the essential component used to evaluate the reliability of the sedimentation and erosion patterns hence we conducted sensitivity analysis by changing the values of the four parameters and then compared with monitoring data at the locations of the tv1 tv2 tv3 tv4 tv5 tv6 measurement stations by changing the parameter values xi δxi and calculating the change of the objective function δyi the sensitivity of the parameters i index is calculated by the following equation 8 i y 2 y 1 y 0 x 2 x 1 x 0 where x1 x0 δx x2 x0 δx y1 y2 are the corresponding objective function values with x1 x2 the objective function using rmse is calculated according to the formula 9 rmse 1 n ss c o s s c s 2 n with ssco and sscs are observed and simulated suspended sediment concentration the sensitivity of the parameters is evaluated using i index referenced from lenhart et al 2002 which is classified into 4 levels as presented at table 2 3 6 model scenarios development in recent years sand exploitation has been increasing in the study area to serve socio economic development needs the exploitation of sand is not strictly controlled in terms of depth and volume of exploitation which greatly impacts flow changes riverbed s morphology and causes river erosion illegal sand exploitation has also been widespread and local authorities have found it is difficult to manage these activities it is estimated that about 70 000 m3 to over 100 000 m3 of sand is exploited every day in saigon and dong nai rivers systems nguyen et al 2012 this study therefore considered four scenarios to evaluate riverbed dredging and the effect of that sand mining have on flow velocity flow volume and morphological dynamics of the riverbed in soai rap estuary and its surrounding table 3 sand mining data is provided by department of natural resources and environment in ho chi minh the depth and width under these scenarios are assumed based on the real river cross sections and the volume of sand mining data the scenarios are as follows sce0 this is the baseline scenario it represents the morphological condition of the riverbed at the soai rap estuary and surroundings in 2014 due to our data availability of water level flow velocity and suspended sediment concentration in this year river depth is 6 1 m in section 1 and 4 1 m in section 2 fig 4 without dredging averaged bottom width is implied as 0 m for both river sections sce1 section 1 and section 2 of the river are dredged lower to the depth of 9 5 m over the entire length from section 1 to 2 and bottom widths b are uniformly expanded to 130 m for section 1 and to 170 m for section 2 the dredged volume is 1 3 106 m3 sce2 section 1 and section 2 are dredged to the depth of 11 m while the bottom widths b of both sections are the same as in sce1 the dredged volume is 3 6 106 m3 sce3 this scenario has the same maximum water depth zmax b and slope m as sce0 but 16 mining sites are added randomly see fig 4 we do not specify in advance the river s bed levels to describe the sand volumes mined hence each site in the model is set with specific mined volumes over time δ v δ t to estimate the sand volumes sucked by pipes as same as mining practices table a3 presents details on the 16 mining sites with a total mined volume is 26 4 106 m3 per year 4 results 4 1 hydraulic calibration and validation and sensitivity analysis the model performance has coefficient of determination of 0 924 991 mean squared error values of 0 4 0 6 and nash coefficients of 0 72 0 97 table 4 however the upstream results such as those for nha be station are not as promising as those near the river mouth this is probably due to the lack of data on riverbed depth although the network of rivers and streams upstream have not been fully modelled and tidal movements in the upstream tributaries could not be adequately represented the results seem acceptable for a large scale model paz et al 2011 figs a1 and a2 in the appendix visualize the model performance presented in table 4 flow velocity is the most important factor as it determines the sediment transport capacity in rivers and estuaries for the calibration and validation results for flow velocity table 4 we found a reasonably good model performance mse 0 08 0 15 me 0 05 0 22 mae 0 15 0 32 though the error of flow velocity was somewhat greater at some locations such as tv5 mae 0 32 however this is relatively far from the soai rap estuary the visualized results are presented in the appendix fig a3 the accuracy of suspended sediment concentration results is an essential element in evaluating the reliability of sediment transport models table 4 also presents these results for suspended sediment concentration at stations tv1 tv2 tv3 tv4 tv5 and tv6 the model exhibits the values of mse and mae in range of 0 001 0 013 and 0 014 0 128 respectively sensitivity analysis results show that the sensitivity changes at the calculated stations table 5 the average value of the sensitivity at six stations is evaluated according to the index as follows sediment diameter variations have a high impact on the ssc modelled level iv with index 2 320 the settling velocity variations also have a high impact level iii with index 0 310 the ratio between skin friction and mean diameter variations also have a high impact level iii with index 0 210 while the impact of the krone partheniades erosion law constant is negligible level iv with index 0 030 as shown in fig 5 the graphs indicate the variation of simulation results when changing the model s parameters at the tv1 station sensitivity analysis of the tv2 tv6 stations are shown in figs a4 a8 in the appendix our model calibration and validation results and sensitivity analysis reveal that the simulation results are still different from the observed results see fig a3 in the appendix indicating the model simulation results uncertainty uncertainty may derive from the model domain not fully representing the semi tidal areas detailed river systems and the additional sediment sources from surrounding systems 4 2 sedimentation and erosion patterns under the baseline scenario sce0 the riverbed evolution under the sce0 scenario at the soai rap estuary after a one year simulation is shown in fig 6 table a9 in the appendix presents the total amount of sediment accumulated by months the change of riverbed morphology at soai rap estuary is influenced by simultaneously three major dynamic factors including i seasonal flow in the river ii tidal regime in the east sea and iii waves and wind in general the combination of seasonal flow factors in the river and sediment flow from the sea under the influence of waves and wind has changed the morphology at soai rap estuary in the dry season sediment is mainly provided by the tidal current due to a weak river flow upstream leading the formation of sand pits bars and small narrow sand islands locally but interspersed with erosion areas in the flood season flow velocity in the river is more substantial combined with the tidal current to form a current combined with high velocity causing intense erosion in the mainstream and pushing the sand mass towards the river mouth as a result the sand pits and small sand islands formed during this season have a more considerable height wide range and gradually move towards the sea under the influence of the seasonal flow regime the sediment deposition erosion evolution between zones in dry and flood seasons is different fig 6 in zone 1 the total amount of sediment in the dry season is 4 1 million m3 deposition 11 2 million m3 erosion 7 1 million m3 and the total amount of mud and sand in the flood season is 1 5 million m3 deposition 3 7 million m3 erosion 5 2 million m3 in the dry season due to the weakening of the river flow the sediment tends to accrete faster in the flood season the flow in the river is strong and pushes the amount of deposited sediment towards the estuary hence the sediment tends to erode and the accumulation trend gradually decreases in zone 2 the sediment source is received from upstream currents and tidal currents from the sea so accretion is dominant in the dry season the total amount of accumulated sediment is 5 8 million m3 deposition 8 2 million m3 erosion 2 4 million m3 while the total sediment amount is about 5 0 million m3 in the flood season deposition 8 4 million m3 erosion 3 4 million m3 zone 3 is affected by wave and monsoon regimes in the coastal area with two monsoon periods northeast and southwest therefore seasonal deposition erosion changes are clearly shown in the dry season the total amount of sediment is about 2 9 million m3 deposition 36 0 million m3 erosion 33 1 million m3 due to receiving a small sediment amount upstream therefore the sediment deposition erosion is influenced by the dominant tidal current with slow fluctuations in the flood season the total amount of sediment is about 32 0 million m3 deposition 54 0 million m3 erosion is 22 0 million m3 due to the massive amount from upstream to the sea causing large fluctuations of the riverbed so the trend of accretion is predominant our study also calculated sediment changes under two different cases of with and without wind wave to clarify the influence of the monsoon regime on the sediment transport at sea fig a9 in the appendix results show that the influence of the northeast monsoon hinders the flow of sediment from the east sea into ganh rai bay and increases the sediment amount in the southwest monsoon period on the other hand during the southwest monsoon the amount of sediment increased by 1 78 million m3 10 compared with the case without wind and decreased by 1 56 million m3 9 3 during the northeast monsoon 4 3 results for riverbed dredging scenarios 4 3 1 hydrodynamic variation between scenarios fig 7 presents flow velocity along the dredging range see fig 4 from upstream to the sea within the study area during the rising phase dredging activities sce1 and sce2 increase river flow velocity compared to the scenario without dredging sce0 the greatest increase in velocity 0 2 m s is found in the river mouth section during low tide flow velocity is greater near the mouth of the river than upstream comparing the dredging scenarios to the baseline dredging increases flow velocity by as much as 0 35 m s on average flow velocity increases even further during high tide than low tide during the low tide but water elevations at a rising phase flow velocity remains fairly unchanged upstream however the estuary mouth s flow velocity is 0 13 m s less than in the baseline scenario in this case the dredging works reverse the hydraulic gradient in the estuary areas due to weak tidal fluxes from the sea compared to the rising tide phase during low tide in the flood season velocity does not change much because of a balanced flows in both directions bravard et al 2013 sutherland et al 2004 in the dry season low tide falling phase and the flood season high tide falling phase flow velocity near the mouth of the river increases by about 0 3 to 0 35 m s compared to the baseline without dredging the change in flow velocity due to dredging on the soai rap river is also found in the tidal regime specifically changes were registered in tidal amplitude peak and base flow at both the soai rap estuary and upstream this applies to both the flood season and in the dry season table a4 appendix in these dredging scenarios tidal amplitude increases compared to sce0 due to higher depths from the dredging activities sce2 results in a greater change than sce1 with tidal amplitude rising by 15 cm during high tide the change in tidal amplitude is more marked downstream than upstream the change in tidal amplitude due to dredging is reflected in flow velocity jordan et al 2019 the rise in tidal amplitude increases the hydraulic slope resulting in increased flow velocity and sediment transport the greater tidal amplitude is caused mainly by the reduced low tide under the dredging scenarios high tide does not change much 4 3 2 simulation results of the riverbed conditions fig 8 presents the simulation results of cumulative monthly sediment load for the river s sections c and d and the differences a and b under dredging scenarios also see table a5 in the appendix for details the simulations show that sedimentation on the dredged river varies substantially with seasons for section 1 see fig 4 sedimentation is low in the dry season with the total sediment deposition rates of 142 477 m3 sce1 and 176 748 m3 sce2 during the flood season larger volumes of sediment are delivered from upstream that is 371 203 m3 sce1 and 167 363 m3 sce2 the total amount of sediment deposited in the river simulated over a year is 513 680 m3 sce1 and 344 111 m3 sce2 for section 2 high river flow velocity transports sediments to the sea sce2 causes more erosion than sce1 which means the higher dredged volume the more erosion the total amount of sediment lost from the dredged river after a year is 3 842 871 m3 sce1 and 4 165 835 m3 sce2 fig 7 shows the riverbed spatial changes in the estuary area after a one year simulation under the influence of dredging of the soai rap river excluding the initial difference of sediment amount due to dredging riverbed evolution of the sce1 and sce2 could be seen in fig a10 in the appendix the riverbed changed in terms of sediment deposition and erosion is under sce1 fig 9 a and under sce2 fig 9b compared to the baseline sce0 dredging can change the riverbed by influencing processes of sediment transport and deposition jordan et al 2019 saad and habib 2021 van maren et al 2015 fig 10 presents the simulation results for sediment accumulation in three zones for the baseline and dredging scenarios the total amount of sedimentation accumulated in zone 1 is 2 1 million m3 under sce1 a decrease of 18 compared to the baseline scenario sedimentation is 1 6 million m3 under sce2 down 36 from the baseline scenario in zone 2 the total amount of sediment is 11 5 million m3 under sce1 an increase of 6 compared to the baseline scenario it is 12 2 million m3 under sce2 a 13 increase over the baseline in zone 3 the total amount of sediment is 33 1 million m3 under sce1 down 5 compared to the baseline scenario it is 31 2 million m3 under sce2 down 10 from the baseline 4 4 impact assessment of sand mining activities 4 4 1 changes in riverbed morphology fig 11 shows the simulated changes in riverbed morphology following one year of sand mining at the 16 locations see fig 4 in general sand mining results in both increased erosion and sediment accretion around the sand mines which corresponded to results by brunier et al 2014 jordan et al 2019 and saad and habib 2021 the riverbed around the quarries showed notable changes compared to the non mining sites in mining sites erosion increased compared to the scenario without sand mining from 0 10 to 0 15 m after a year with most erosion occurring on the concave bank bench of curved river sections due to the increase in local flow velocity van maren et al 2015 most sediment flow on the riverbed will be trapped in the mining pits leading to relative erosion in other areas from the shortage of sand and sediment deposition van maren et al 2015 in the relatively straight river sections the increase in erosion rate is even greater because mining actions maydestabilize the riverbed along these river sections smaller sediments are transported by the river as suspended load while the larger sediment particles are transported as bed load these lager sediment particles move more slowly and have a more direct effect on riverbed morphology as sand is pumped up from the riverbed during sand mining excavation pits are typically created which widen and deepen over time brunier et al 2014 jordan et al 2019 this results in breakpoints and interruptions of bed sediment transport bravard et al 2013 4 4 2 sediment redistribution in the three zones our sand mining results revealed changes in the sediment distribution across the three zones fig 12 in zone 1 the amount of sand extracted is 4 3 million m3 year and total sediment accumulation in this zone is 2 6 million m3 year without sand mining in the sand mining scenario sce3 the total accumulated sediment is 1 9 million m3 year which indicates that erosion is the dominant process which moves sediment downstream bravard et al 2013 in zone 2 the amount of sand extracted is 12 0 million m3 year and total sediment accumulation in this zone without sand extraction is 10 8 million m3 year with sand extraction the volume of accumulated sediment is 144 000 m3 year similar to zone 1 this shows that erosion is dominant in zone 3 the amount of sand extracted is 5 6 million m3 year and without sand mining the total sediment accumulation in this zone is 34 9 million m3 year with sand mining the amount of sediment accumulation is 28 7 million m3 year indicating an accretion trend in zone 1 and zone 3 the amount of sediment lost is greater than the amount extracted by mining in zone 2 the amount of sediment lost is less than the amount extracted by mining considering the study area as a whole zone 2 and zone 3 partially block the quarries in zone 1 from the sea moreover upstream flows to zone 3 are blocked by zone 2 and zone 1 as a result there is an increased hunger for sediment in zone 1 and zone 3 zone 2 being located in the middle section of the river can receive sediment moving in both directions indicating a potential for greater sediment extraction from this location brunier et al 2014 5 discussion 5 1 refection of model performance and sensitivity analysis in our study the presented ssc calibration and validation results are relatively promising however skilful ssc calibration is difficult as shown from previous studies in the vietnamese mekong delta manh et al 2014 thanh et al 2013 2017 tu et al 2019 specifically manh et al 2014 and tu et al 2019 used daily and monthly ssc data and thanh et al 2017 analysed satellite images converted to ssc values for their model validations while our model used hourly ssc data for the model calibration and validation process our results could have been improved if long term daily and monthly measured data were available generally with good calibration and validation of water level with r2 0 9 nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 72 0 97 and mean squared error values of 0 4 0 6 and flow velocity mean squared error values of 0 08 0 15 the model was hydrodynamically reliable sensitivity analysis findings indicate the different sensitivity levels of the four parameters affecting the ssc calibration and validation process and its model performance the highest sensitivity level of sediment diameter reflects that this parameter has a strong relationship with the suspended sediment movement and deposition coarse sand in the bottom layer and fine mud in the top layer and the transport rate in the riverbed and fluxes kaveh et al 2021 manh et al 2014 which forms the movement rate and dense of the ssc lesser than the sediment diameter parameter the settling velocity and the ratio between skin friction and mean diameter are highly sensitive to the ssc model performance because these parameters strongly affect the speed of sediment particles and part of the flow the sediment carried out tu et al 2019 the least sensitivity level of the krone partheniades erosion law constant reflects the erosion flux related to the excess of applied bed shear stress to the bed shear strength at the bed surface 5 2 riverbed morphology changes under scenarios hydrodynamic modelling results also revealed the spatial dynamics of hydrological regimes in the study area and the sedimentation and erosion process under dredging and sand mining scenarios the variation in flow velocity of 0 13 decrease to 0 2 m s increase was found in the river mouth section the velocity increase of 0 3 m s was also detected near the mouth of the river under low in the dry season and high tide in the flood season due to dredging activities compared to the baseline which could be explained as the hydraulic gradient is influenced by the change the river s width and depth saad and habib 2021 in addition tidal amplitude increases by up to 15 cm during high tide more downstream than upstream due to higher depths from the dredging activities brunier et al 2014 schmitt et al 2017 regarding sedimentation and erosion process one year after dredging we found in section 1 an accretion of 513 680 m3 sce1 and 344 111 m3 sce2 section 2 shows an erosion trend losing 3 842 871 m3 sce1 and 4 165 835 m3 sce2 these findings reasonably reflect the sediment movement process of tidal dredged rivers presented by van maren et al 2015 it also confirms previous studies which suggest that dredged canals are highly stable anh and lộc 2017 gugliotta et al 2020 hoang 2020 hoàng 2008 considering the larger picture dredging reduces sediment accumulation upstream zone 1 by 18 under sce1 and by 36 under sce2 in the soai rap area zone 2 sediment accumulation increases by 6 under sce1 and by 13 under sce2 in the ganh rai bay area zone 3 sediment accumulation decreases by 5 under sce1 and decreases by 10 under sce2 these mean that the dredging activities transport sediments from the upper and coastal zones to the middle zone and these trends agreed with the studies by van maren et al 2015 and tu et al 2019 our study presents a novelty in setting the scenario of mining sites in the model compared to previous studies i e dries van den van den eynde et al 2010 hackney et al 2020 tu et al 2019 we did not put the mining river depths in advance but each mining site was attributed with specific mined volumes over time δ v δ t to demonstrate that the sand volumes are extracted consequently the sand excavation creates mining pits which trap sediment causing discontinuities in riverbed sediment movement the consequence of such imbalances in sediment displacement is sand starvation in some areas and sediment redistribution to other river areas as presented by brunier et al 2014 and liangwen et al 2007 our simulation findings suggest that sand excavation amounting to 26 million m3 per year would result in a net loss of sediment everywhere except in zone 3 zone 1 and zone 2 would experience sediment losses amounting to respectively 1 9 million m3 per year and 144 000 m3 per year the accretion in zone 3 would amount to 28 7 million m3 per year regarding sand mining and replacement capacity in the various zones of the river zone 1 exhibited almost no replacement capacity as sand removal exceeded the river s re sedimentation capacity on the soai rap river zone 2 and in the estuary zone 3 levelling sand was the main output replacement capacity in these zones was found to be greater than in zone 1 due to the large mud stores and sand inflows from the sea the main output from zone 1 was sand for construction which is higher in economic value than the sand mining output of the other zones anh and lộc 2017 hoàng et al 2005b yet zone 1 has limited sources of sediment and sand mining here brings a high risk of landslides asabonga et al 2017 this is a particularly difficult problem in exploitation of sediment resources in the riverbed of the study area 5 3 limitations and future outlook in the following studies we would like to address the following points first the impacts of human activities on morphological change of an estuarine river mouth often occur over a longer period hoang 2020 while our study simulated the four scenarios for a relatively short period of one year hence the impacts may not have become fully evident especially when external human activities i e upstream dam construction land reclamation or ground infilling could add more influence dai et al 2018 2016 second many parameters were estimated and trialled hundreds of times during the calibration process using calibrated and validated time series data of water levels flow velocity and ssc the model performance is not fully assessed therefore it is useful to have spatial data satellite ssc data for the model calibration and validation tran et al 2018 also the model reality could be improved if the model output sensitivity analysis is elaborated with all parameter sets under scenarios van der wegen and jaffe 2013 third despite our effort for model calibration and validation applications of process based morphodynamic models are often constrained by the limited availability of data on bed composition in our study actual mophordynamic development results were not fully modelled due to the bed composition data limitation to proceed with a process that a model needs to spin up morphodynamically with defined initial and boundary conditions to finally capture real physical processes exceeding the errors caused by model artifacts due to limited process formulations dam et al 2016 therefore the model should ideally run a morphodynamic spin up period during the initial simulation period that is long enough for instance a run with a fixed bed composition for 2 5 years followed by a period of 10 30 years including bed level changes to have a stable bed to capture the more realistic morphodynamic changes dam et al 2016 future work therefore could further run various periods of morphodynamic spin up representing estuarine system dynamics more realistically if measured bathymetries are available for comparison e g dam et al 2016 van der wegen et al 2011 finally mining activities especially their budgets are difficult to comprehensively and accurately estimate due to the data collection challenges regarding sand output and extraction scope and the presence of illegal sand extraction operations in vietnam jordan et al 2019 ng and park 2021 despite the limitations being considered by future works the proposed approach and scenarios present a lesson learned riverbed evolution difference under scenarios due to dredging and sand mining and put the great potential for application in similar coastal estuaries worldwide 6 conclusions our study evaluated the potential effects of sand mining activities on flow dynamics and sediment distribution in the river and coastal domain in the downstream dong nai saigon river system of southern vietnam using four scenarios based on the telemac 2d hydrodynamic model our results indicate that overall the dredging substantially changes the hydraulic regime and sedimentation and erosion process in the study area the average flow velocity varies between 0 13 and 0 35 m s in different river sections during low and high tide in both flood and dry seasons while the tidal range in the estuary increases by up to 15 cm during high tide in the scenarios with dredging the increased tidal range was attributed mainly to a decreasing tendency of low tide the consistent tidal peak suggests that saline intrusion driven by dredging penetrates more deeply into the river upstream due to the increased speed of tidal transmission our findings provide evidence for the detrimental impacts of dredging activities in the soai rap river and urge dredging plans to include adequate measures to stabilize the riverbed such as structures to regulate mainstream flows furthermore dredging and sand excavation strongly influenced morphological changes and sediment dynamics along the river from the estuary to upstream we found a reduction of 18 and 36 sediment deposition in the upstream zone and increased sediment deposition in the soai rap estuary by 6 and 13 after the one year simulation in addition sediment accumulation decreased by 5 and 10 in the ganh rai bay area due to the sediment transport from the sea to the estuary overall the mines and pits due to sand extractions trapped sediment causing discontinuities in the longitudinal transport of sediment and sand starvation in various areas of the river at the same time the redistribution patterns are heterogeneous across different river sections these forces have driven the riverbed erosion our study provided a valuable example for international rivers particularly those in southeast asian countries i e chao phraya thailand ayeyarwady myanmar mekong vietnam where river

3446,recent riverbed sand mining activities have modified estuarine morphology and sedimentation patterns in many southeast asian deltas the soai rap estuary along the dong nai river one of the largest rivers in southern vietnam is one of the most intensively mined areas in the region where large scale sand mining activities have started since the 1990 s in this paper we used hydrodynamic modelling telemac 2d to investigate the estuarine morphological changes and sediment dynamics related to the intensive riverbed mining in the soai rap estuary after the hydraulic calibration and validation of the model we simulate four scenarios two with dredging one with sand excavation and a baseline condition our results show that dredging substantially changed the hydraulic regimes morphological and sediment dynamics of the estuary compared to the baseline dredging substantially influences flow velocity and tidal amplitude these activities reduce the amount of sediment accumulating upstream by 18 to 36 while increasing sediment deposition in the soai rap estuary by 6 to 13 furthermore sediment accumulation in the ganh rai bay area decrease by 5 to 10 due to increased sediment transport from the sea to the estuary our modelled results also show that the mining pits pockmarks created by sand extractions efficiently trap sediment causing discontinuities in the longitudinal transport of sediment and resulting morphological patterns we conclude that the morphology and sediment transport regime of the soai rap estuary has been significantly altered by the river sand dredging as such we recommend that the local government put in place measures to ensure that sand extraction is carried out sustainably in the future to minimise further alterations to the natural sedimentation patterns and geomorphology of this estuary keywords coastal changes hydrodynamic sediment dredging mining estuary mekong 1 introduction estuaries are among the world s most productive ecosystems elliott and whitfield 2011 mclusky and elliott 2004 and are at the dynamic interface between tides waves and fluvial processes dalrymple et al 1992a savenije 2006 this allows mixing of seawater and river water in estuaries creating habitats for an abundance of brackish water organisms perillo 1995 factors influencing morphological characteristics and processes in estuarine areas include tides river flows river sediment transport longshore sediment transport waves and density driven flows xie et al 2019 specifically for interactions between estuarine topographic features suspended sediment transport and bottom sediment transport are the main morphological processes stark et al 2017 wang et al 2020 these processes take place continuously sometimes reaching an equilibrium condition in which estuarine morphology exhibits a relatively steady state du et al 2016 nowacki and grossman 2020 zhou et al 2017 however most estuaries rarely reach this equilibrium condition due to the dynamic nature of the sediment and water cycles as well as the ever increasing impacts of climate change and human activities such as resource exploitation for socio economic development dalrymple et al 1992b 1992a savenije 2006 and upstream dam construction land reclamation and sand excavation dai et al 2018 2016 park et al 2021 in southern vietnam human activities have also affected the morphology of estuaries the soai rap estuary hoàng 2008 hoàng et al 2005a this has become evident after 2009 when sand mining activities accelerated due to the regional needs as well as the soaring national demand along with the rapid urbanization and economic development in vietnam nguyen et al 2012 as a result spatially heterogeneous riverbed erosion with a tendency to migrate upstream has been observed hoàng 2008 nguyen et al 2012 trần and nguyễn 2014 many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the changes in the rivers in southern vietnam most attributing it to climate change and human activities anh and lộc 2017 hoàng et al 2005b loc et al 2021b nguyễn et al 2012 among those sand mining activities have been considered a major factor causing geomorphic changes whereas climate change induced mean sea level rise has amplified coastal tidal regimes that change water flows and marine currents in and out of the estuary anh and lộc 2017 eslami et al 2019 hübler and pothen 2021 tu et al 2019 several studies have examined morphological change and sediment transport in the riverbed of the soai rap estuary and surrounding areas of the mekong gugliotta et al 2020 loc et al 2021b ng and park 2021 tu et al 2019 walling 2008 though these studies provide evidence on estuarine hydrodynamic processes and morphology there remain limitations in explicitly elaborating the large scale morphodynamics caused by sand dredging and mining activities for instance gugliotta et al 2020 analysed 80 sediment samples from the channel bed to understand sediment transport in a short reach of the dong nai river however they did not address the sediment transport mechanism at the soai rap estuary tu et al 2019 assessed sediment transport and morphodynamics changes in the mekong estuaries and the coastal zones using a delft3d model with a 10 year simulation period though their analysis included an evaluation of the impacts of sand extractions the model used a lumped process that did not consider specific sand mining sites distributed along the river to simulate hydrologic processes walling 2008 assessed changes in sediment load in the mekong river but did not account for the influence of sand mining activities recently park et al 2020 and ng and park 2021 elaborated the impact of human activities on the morphology of the lower mekong river including such activities as canal dredging sand mining and dike construction however their study relied mostly on indirect evidence such as the water level analysis of the data from gauge stations and water extent series mapped from remotely sensed data of which the clear link between sand mining and targeted specific environmental consequences could have been better developed through hydrodynamic modelling in addition sediment transport is usually simulated using either non cohesive or cohesive properties sand or mud typically bypassing the complex spatial variability of sediment characteristics in natural estuaries which most studies have excluded although many modelling studies have been carried out to understand hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the mekong region e g hackney et al 2020 manh et al 2014 thanh et al 2017 tu et al 2019 limited studies have used modelling works to elaborate the same problem in the dong nai sai gon river basin as well as soai rap estuary particularly concerning the impacts of dredging and sand mining activities nguyen et al 2005 used a two dimensional hydraulic model mike21c to simulate and predict the morphological changes of the river and propose solutions to stabilize the riverbed in the downstream area of the dong nai river system saigon their results mainly evaluated and predicted the possibility of landslides and accretion locally to determine the riverbank elevation along the river thereby proposing solutions to stabilize the riverbank research by thi bay nguyen et al 2012 used mike 21 and mike 3 hydrodynamic models to calculate and simulate hydrodynamic regimes the propagation of salinity distribution and suspended sediment concentration ssc and the change of riverbed from the long tau confluence soai rap to the sea mouth the study assessing the impacts of soai rap river dredging scenarios with elevations of 9 5 m and 11 0 m showed that the riverbed velocity in the soai rap river relatively decreased and eroded the channel due to dredging recently le et al 2015 applied the hydraulic model mike21 to evaluate the impact of dredging the channel at soai rap estuary the simulation results for the scenario of dredging the soai rap river to the elevations of 9 5 m and 12 0 m presented that dredging the river does not significantly impact the river s dynamic sedimentation and erosion pattern and neighbouring rivers in general the above studies have not shown the distribution of sediment loads between areas from upstream to estuary under the impacts of dredging besides sand mining activities have not been examined sand mining impacted data have been collected using many extensive surveys which are then systematically analysed and evaluated over space and time it is impossible to comprehensively assess the impacts jordan et al 2019 muhammad aqeel ashraf ismail yusoff abdul wajid karamat mahmood 2011 in particular there is an obvious need to understand the mechanism of sediment transport conductivity and riverbed stabilization in the region related to hydrodynamic conditions dung et al 2018 manh et al 2015 tran et al 2019 triet et al 2020 and sand mining activities these could be addressed using a hydrological and morphodynamic model calibrated and verified to understand sediment transport and explore morphological dynamics under scenario based simulations attar et al 2020 thanh et al 2017 tu et al 2019 the modelling works calibration and verification process needs observed data such as water level discharge velocity and ssc as shown by several studies i e manh et al 2014 thanh et al 2017 tu et al 2019 the ssc is one of the most important parameters to assess whether the model performance is reliable to simulate sedimentation and erosion patterns but the ssc calibration and validation process appears to be the most challenging for many modellers our study is one of the first aiming to fill these knowledge gaps by qualitatively assessing the mining impacts using a hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model this study aims to investigate the changes in morphodynamics regimes due to sand mining activities in the dong nai sai gon river system in the southern vietnam we focus on the soai rap estuary analysing the sediment transport with both cohesive and non cohesive properties we developed a two dimensional hydrodynamic model for the estuary using telemac 2d and calibrated and validated the model using water level flow velocity and sediment concentration data this is one of the studies of the estuarine morphodynamics and potential riverbed changes related to the sand mining activities in vietnam furthermore this study demonstrates the practical utility of the modelling approaches in seeking solutions for riverbed stabilization by enhancing the understanding of sediment distributions caused by dredging and mining and subsequently help to advancing strategies for managing exploiting and protecting natural resources in estuarine systems we envision that the findings contribute to the discussion and implementation of sustainable development strategies in the soai rap estuary in southern vietnam in particular but also provides a useful reference for international audiences interested in sand mining impact assessments especially those in southeast asian deltas 2 study area located in southern vietnam the dong nai saigon river passes through three provinces and major cities including dong nai ho chi minh city and long an the soai rap estuary is the last stage of the dong nai river basin before entering the ocean which has a total area of 40 700 km2 the soai rap river is a branch of the downstream system of the dong nai saigon river it is 45 km long and passes through nha be and can gio districts before flowing into the east sea at the soai rap estuary fig 1 the river s width is about 2 420 m and the riverbed elevation varies from 32 0 m to 8 0 m the mean annual discharge of the dong nai river estimated at the soai rap estuary is q o 1 067 m3 s over the 1980 2017 period the total annual volume discharge was 34 billion m3 according to the southern institute for water resources planning in ho chi minh city due to the relatively low topographic relief of the area combined with the intensive local rainfall and the complex network of rivers and canals which are wide and deep the funnel shaped estuary is strongly influenced by the east sea s semi diurnal tidal regime with a 2 4 m difference between high tide and low tide as a result saline water penetrates far inland about 60 80 km affecting the freshwater availability for the region s livelihoods every year anh and lộc 2017 loc et al 2021a besides sediment transport and distribution patterns within the estuary are determined primarily by the tidal current the dong nai river s downstream segment starts below the tri an reservoir and extends to the soai rap estuary this river section has a length of 150 km of which the confluence from the be river to nha be is 76 km long 180 1 400 m wide and 6 6 17 m deep anh and lộc 2017 after nha be the dong nai river splits into two distributaries at a point 76 km from the sea one of these the nha be river extends southward with a width of 1 000 3 000 m and a depth of 10 20 m anh and lộc 2017 the second distributary the long tau river proceeds in a more south easterly direction and is 300 450 m wide with a depth of 30 40 m anh and lộc 2017 due to its depth the long tau is an important navigation route from ho chi minh city to the surrounding provinces and abroad the main tributaries flowing into the dong nai river from the east are the be and saigon rivers and the vam co river the la buong river flows into the dong nai from the west farther to the east the 30 km long thi vai river flows directly into ganh rai bay 3

and around the soai rap estuary while also encompassing processes of sediment transport from the upstream dong nai saigon mekong and bassac rivers fig 3 the modelled area thus includes the upstream section at the confluence of the dong nai and be rivers 165 km from the estuary the confluence of the saigon and thi tinh rivers the area of the long son ferry terminal vam co dong river the vam co tay river at national highway 1a the tien river at the my thuan gauging station and the hau river at the can tho gauging station downstream it extends 120 km into the east sea from the estuary mouth bottom elevations range from 45 to 20 m and the modelled area spans 27 347 km2 the setup of the river network grid strongly affects the quality of the simulation results our telemac 2d model uses both structured quadrilateral and unstructured meshes structured meshes apply to rivers while unstructured meshes represent estuarine and coastal areas the computational domain includes the soai rap and mekong rivers constructed by 154 459 triangular elements with 84 903 nodes the smallest mesh size is 22 100 m for rivers and estuaries the area adjacent to the estuary and east sea has a mesh size of 200 600 m the mesh size for the east sea is 800 12 700 m 3 3 gauge station and field data for numerical modelling table 1 presents the input data for the numerical modelling these consist of i discharge time series data used as upstream boundaries ii water level mean velocity and wave used as downstream boundaries and iii water level flow velocity and suspended sediment concentration ssc used for model calibration and validation 3 4 model calibration and validation the simulated hydrodynamic and morphological processes include hydraulic factors that is water level velocity wave and transport of suspended sediment in the water mass we used suspended sediment and water level data for calibration dry season and validation flood season flow velocity data were used only for dry season validation due to data limitations the coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to test for the suitability and performance of the model before running the

influence of the parameters on the model s results including settling velocity skin friction correction krone partheniades erosion law constant and sediment diameters see appendix table a1 the ssc is considered the essential component used to evaluate the reliability of the sedimentation and erosion patterns hence we conducted sensitivity analysis by changing the values of the four parameters and then compared with monitoring data at the locations of the tv1 tv2 tv3 tv4 tv5 tv6 measurement stations by changing the parameter values xi δxi and calculating the change of the objective function δyi the sensitivity of the parameters i index is calculated by the following equation 8 i y 2 y 1 y 0 x 2 x 1 x 0 where x1 x0 δx x2 x0 δx y1 y2 are the corresponding objective function values with x1 x2 the objective function using rmse is calculated according to the formula 9 rmse 1 n ss c o s s c s 2 n with ssco and sscs are observed and simulated suspended sediment concentration the sensitivity of the parameters is evaluated using i index referenced from lenhart et al 2002 which is classified into 4 levels as presented at table 2 3 6 model scenarios development in recent years sand exploitation has been increasing in the study area to serve socio economic development needs the exploitation of sand is not strictly controlled in terms of depth and volume of exploitation which greatly impacts flow changes riverbed s morphology and causes river erosion illegal sand exploitation has also been widespread and local authorities have found it is difficult to manage these activities it is estimated that about 70 000 m3 to over 100 000 m3 of sand is exploited every day in saigon and dong nai rivers systems nguyen et al 2012 this study therefore considered four scenarios to evaluate riverbed dredging and the effect of that sand mining have on flow velocity flow volume and morphological dynamics of the riverbed in soai rap estuary and its surrounding table 3 sand mining data is provided by department of natural resources and environment in ho chi minh the depth and width under these scenarios are assumed based on the real river cross sections and the volume of sand mining data the scenarios are as follows sce0 this is the baseline scenario it represents the morphological condition of the riverbed at the soai rap estuary and surroundings in 2014 due to our data availability of water level flow velocity and suspended sediment concentration in this year river depth is 6 1 m in section 1 and 4 1 m in section 2 fig 4 without dredging averaged bottom width is implied as 0 m for both river sections sce1 section 1 and section 2 of the river are dredged lower to the depth of 9 5 m over the entire length from section 1 to 2 and bottom widths b are uniformly expanded to 130 m for section 1 and to 170 m for section 2 the dredged volume is 1 3 106 m3 sce2 section 1 and section 2 are dredged to the depth of 11 m while the bottom widths b of both sections are the same as in sce1 the dredged volume is 3 6 106 m3 sce3 this scenario has the same maximum water depth zmax b and slope m as sce0 but 16 mining sites are added randomly see fig 4 we do not specify in advance the river s bed levels to describe the sand volumes mined hence each site in the model is set with specific mined volumes over time δ v δ t to estimate the sand volumes sucked by pipes as same as mining practices table a3 presents details on the 16 mining sites with a total mined volume is 26 4 106 m3 per year 4 results 4 1 hydraulic calibration and validation and sensitivity analysis the model performance has coefficient of determination of 0 924 991 mean squared error values of 0 4 0 6 and nash coefficients of 0 72 0 97 table 4 however the upstream results such as those for nha be station are not as promising as those near the river mouth this is probably due to the lack of data on riverbed depth although the network of rivers and streams upstream have not been fully modelled and tidal movements in the upstream tributaries could not be adequately represented the results seem acceptable for a large scale model paz et al 2011 figs a1 and a2 in the appendix visualize the model performance presented in table 4 flow velocity is the most important factor as it determines the sediment transport capacity in rivers and estuaries for the calibration and validation results for flow velocity table 4 we found a reasonably good model performance mse 0 08 0 15 me 0 05 0 22 mae 0 15 0 32 though the error of flow velocity was somewhat greater at some locations such as tv5 mae 0 32 however this is relatively far from the soai rap estuary the visualized results are presented in the appendix fig a3 the accuracy of suspended sediment concentration results is an essential element in evaluating the reliability of sediment transport models table 4 also presents these results for suspended sediment concentration at stations tv1 tv2 tv3 tv4 tv5 and tv6 the model exhibits the values of mse and mae in range of 0 001 0 013 and 0 014 0 128 respectively sensitivity analysis results show that the sensitivity changes at the calculated stations table 5 the average value of the sensitivity at six stations is evaluated according to the index as follows sediment diameter variations have a high impact on the ssc modelled level iv with index 2 320 the settling velocity variations also have a high impact level iii with index 0 310 the ratio between skin friction and mean diameter variations also have a high impact level iii with index 0 210 while the impact of the krone partheniades erosion law constant is negligible level iv with index 0 030 as shown in fig 5 the graphs indicate the variation of simulation results when changing the model s parameters at the tv1 station sensitivity analysis of the tv2 tv6 stations are shown in figs a4 a8 in the appendix our model calibration and validation results and sensitivity analysis reveal that the simulation results are still different from the observed results see fig a3 in the appendix indicating the model simulation results uncertainty uncertainty may derive from the model domain not fully representing the semi tidal areas detailed river systems and the additional sediment sources from surrounding systems 4 2 sedimentation and erosion patterns under the baseline scenario sce0 the riverbed evolution under the sce0 scenario at the soai rap estuary after a one year simulation is shown in fig 6 table a9 in the appendix presents the total amount of sediment accumulated by months the change of riverbed morphology at soai rap estuary is influenced by simultaneously three major dynamic factors including i seasonal flow in the river ii tidal regime in the east sea and iii waves and wind in general the combination of seasonal flow factors in the river and sediment flow from the sea under the influence of waves and wind has changed the morphology at soai rap estuary in the dry season sediment is mainly provided by the tidal current due to a weak river flow upstream leading the formation of sand pits bars and small narrow sand islands locally but interspersed with erosion areas in the flood season flow velocity in the river is more substantial combined with the tidal current to form a current combined with high velocity causing intense erosion in the mainstream and pushing the sand mass towards the river mouth as a result the sand pits and small sand islands formed during this season have a more considerable height wide range and gradually move towards the sea under the influence of the seasonal flow regime the sediment deposition erosion evolution between zones in dry and flood seasons is different fig 6 in zone 1 the total amount of sediment in the dry season is 4 1 million m3 deposition 11 2 million m3 erosion 7 1 million m3 and the total amount of mud and sand in the flood season is 1 5 million m3 deposition 3 7 million m3 erosion 5 2 million m3 in the dry season due to the weakening of the river flow the sediment tends to accrete faster in the flood season the flow in the river is strong and pushes the amount of deposited sediment towards the estuary hence the sediment tends to erode and the accumulation trend gradually decreases in zone 2 the sediment source is received from upstream currents and tidal currents from the sea so accretion is dominant in the dry season the total amount of accumulated sediment is 5 8 million m3 deposition 8 2 million m3 erosion 2 4 million m3 while the total sediment amount is about 5 0 million m3 in the flood season deposition 8 4 million m3 erosion 3 4 million m3 zone 3 is affected by wave and monsoon regimes in the coastal area with two monsoon periods northeast and southwest therefore seasonal deposition erosion changes are clearly shown in the dry season the total amount of sediment is about 2 9 million m3 deposition 36 0 million m3 erosion 33 1 million m3 due to receiving a small sediment amount upstream therefore the sediment deposition erosion is influenced by the dominant tidal current with slow fluctuations in the flood season the total amount of sediment is about 32 0 million m3 deposition 54 0 million m3 erosion is 22 0 million m3 due to the massive amount from upstream to the sea causing large fluctuations of the riverbed so the trend of accretion is predominant our study also calculated sediment changes under two different cases of with and without wind wave to clarify the influence of the monsoon regime on the sediment transport at sea fig a9 in the appendix results show that the influence of the northeast monsoon hinders the flow of sediment from the east sea into ganh rai bay and increases the sediment amount in the southwest monsoon period on the other hand during the southwest monsoon the amount of sediment increased by 1 78 million m3 10 compared with the case without wind and decreased by 1 56 million m3 9 3 during the northeast monsoon 4 3 results for riverbed dredging scenarios 4 3 1 hydrodynamic variation between scenarios fig 7 presents flow velocity along the dredging range see fig 4 from upstream to the sea within the study area during the rising phase dredging activities sce1 and sce2 increase river flow velocity compared to the scenario without dredging sce0 the greatest increase in velocity 0 2 m s is found in the river mouth section during low tide flow velocity is greater near the mouth of the river than upstream comparing the dredging scenarios to the baseline dredging increases flow velocity by as much as 0 35 m s on average flow velocity increases even further during high tide than low tide during the low tide but water elevations at a rising phase flow velocity remains fairly unchanged upstream however the estuary mouth s flow velocity is 0 13 m s less than in the baseline scenario in this case the dredging works reverse the hydraulic gradient in the estuary areas due to weak tidal fluxes from the sea compared to the rising tide phase during low tide in the flood season velocity does not change much because of a balanced flows in both directions bravard et al 2013 sutherland et al 2004 in the dry season low tide falling phase and the flood season high tide falling phase flow velocity near the mouth of the river increases by about 0 3 to 0 35 m s compared to the baseline without dredging the change in flow velocity due to dredging on the soai rap river is also found in the tidal regime specifically changes were registered in tidal amplitude peak and base flow at both the soai rap estuary and upstream this applies to both the flood season and in the dry season table a4 appendix in these dredging scenarios tidal amplitude increases compared to sce0 due to higher depths from the dredging activities sce2 results in a greater change than sce1 with tidal amplitude rising by 15 cm during high tide the change in tidal amplitude is more marked downstream than upstream the change in tidal amplitude due to dredging is reflected in flow velocity jordan et al 2019 the rise in tidal amplitude increases the hydraulic slope resulting in increased flow velocity and sediment transport the greater tidal amplitude is caused mainly by the reduced low tide under the dredging scenarios high tide does not change much 4 3 2 simulation results of the riverbed conditions fig 8 presents the simulation results of cumulative monthly sediment load for the river s sections c and d and the differences a and b under dredging scenarios also see table a5 in the appendix for details the simulations show that sedimentation on the dredged river varies substantially with seasons for section 1 see fig 4 sedimentation is low in the dry season with the total sediment deposition rates of 142 477 m3 sce1 and 176 748 m3 sce2 during the flood season larger volumes of sediment are delivered from upstream that is 371 203 m3 sce1 and 167 363 m3 sce2 the total amount of sediment deposited in the river simulated over a year is 513 680 m3 sce1 and 344 111 m3 sce2 for section 2 high river flow velocity transports sediments to the sea sce2 causes more erosion than sce1 which means the higher dredged volume the more erosion the total amount of sediment lost from the dredged river after a year is 3 842 871 m3 sce1 and 4 165 835 m3 sce2 fig 7 shows the riverbed spatial changes in the estuary area after a one year simulation under the influence of dredging of the soai rap river excluding the initial difference of sediment amount due to dredging riverbed evolution of the sce1 and sce2 could be seen in fig a10 in the appendix the riverbed changed in terms of sediment deposition and erosion is under sce1 fig 9 a and under sce2 fig 9b compared to the baseline sce0 dredging can change the riverbed by influencing processes of sediment transport and deposition jordan et al 2019 saad and habib 2021 van maren et al 2015 fig 10 presents the simulation results for sediment accumulation in three zones for the baseline and dredging scenarios the total amount of sedimentation accumulated in zone 1 is 2 1 million m3 under sce1 a decrease of 18 compared to the baseline scenario sedimentation is 1 6 million m3 under sce2 down 36 from the baseline scenario in zone 2 the total amount of sediment is 11 5 million m3 under sce1 an increase of 6 compared to the baseline scenario it is 12 2 million m3 under sce2 a 13 increase over the baseline in zone 3 the total amount of sediment is 33 1 million m3 under sce1 down 5 compared to the baseline scenario it is 31 2 million m3 under sce2 down 10 from the baseline 4 4 impact assessment of sand mining activities 4 4 1 changes in riverbed morphology fig 11 shows the simulated changes in riverbed morphology following one year of sand mining at the 16 locations see fig 4 in general sand mining results in both increased erosion and sediment accretion around the sand mines which corresponded to results by brunier et al 2014 jordan et al 2019 and saad and habib 2021 the riverbed around the quarries showed notable changes compared to the non mining sites in mining sites erosion increased compared to the scenario without sand mining from 0 10 to 0 15 m after a year with most erosion occurring on the concave bank bench of curved river sections due to the increase in local flow velocity van maren et al 2015 most sediment flow on the riverbed will be trapped in the mining pits leading to relative erosion in other areas from the shortage of sand and sediment deposition van maren et al 2015 in the relatively straight river sections the increase in erosion rate is even greater because mining actions maydestabilize the riverbed along these river sections smaller sediments are transported by the river as suspended load while the larger sediment particles are transported as bed load these lager sediment particles move more slowly and have a more direct effect on riverbed morphology as sand is pumped up from the riverbed during sand mining excavation pits are typically created which widen and deepen over time brunier et al 2014 jordan et al 2019 this results in breakpoints and interruptions of bed sediment transport bravard et al 2013 4 4 2 sediment redistribution in the three zones our sand mining results revealed changes in the sediment distribution across the three zones fig 12 in zone 1 the amount of sand extracted is 4 3 million m3 year and total sediment accumulation in this zone is 2 6 million m3 year without sand mining in the sand mining scenario sce3 the total accumulated sediment is 1 9 million m3 year which indicates that erosion is the dominant process which moves sediment downstream bravard et al 2013 in zone 2 the amount of sand extracted is 12 0 million m3 year and total sediment accumulation in this zone without sand extraction is 10 8 million m3 year with sand extraction the volume of accumulated sediment is 144 000 m3 year similar to zone 1 this shows that erosion is dominant in zone 3 the amount of sand extracted is 5 6 million m3 year and without sand mining the total sediment accumulation in this zone is 34 9 million m3 year with sand mining the amount of sediment accumulation is 28 7 million m3 year indicating an accretion trend in zone 1 and zone 3 the amount of sediment lost is greater than the amount extracted by mining in zone 2 the amount of sediment lost is less than the amount extracted by mining considering the study area as a whole zone 2 and zone 3 partially block the quarries in zone 1 from the sea moreover upstream flows to zone 3 are blocked by zone 2 and zone 1 as a result there is an increased hunger for sediment in zone 1 and zone 3 zone 2 being located in the middle section of the river can receive sediment moving in both directions indicating a potential for greater sediment extraction from this location brunier et al 2014 5 discussion 5 1 refection of model performance and sensitivity analysis in our study the presented ssc calibration and validation results are relatively promising however skilful ssc calibration is difficult as shown from previous studies in the vietnamese mekong delta manh et al 2014 thanh et al 2013 2017 tu et al 2019 specifically manh et al 2014 and tu et al 2019 used daily and monthly ssc data and thanh et al 2017 analysed satellite images converted to ssc values for their model validations while our model used hourly ssc data for the model calibration and validation process our results could have been improved if long term daily and monthly measured data were available generally with good calibration and validation of water level with r2 0 9 nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 72 0 97 and mean squared error values of 0 4 0 6 and flow velocity mean squared error values of 0 08 0 15 the model was hydrodynamically reliable sensitivity analysis findings indicate the different sensitivity levels of the four parameters affecting the ssc calibration and validation process and its model performance the highest sensitivity level of sediment diameter reflects that this parameter has a strong relationship with the suspended sediment movement and deposition coarse sand in the bottom layer and fine mud in the top layer and the transport rate in the riverbed and fluxes kaveh et al 2021 manh et al 2014 which forms the movement rate and dense of the ssc lesser than the sediment diameter parameter the settling velocity and the ratio between skin friction and mean diameter are highly sensitive to the ssc model performance because these parameters strongly affect the speed of sediment particles and part of the flow the sediment carried out tu et al 2019 the least sensitivity level of the krone partheniades erosion law constant reflects the erosion flux related to the excess of applied bed shear stress to the bed shear strength at the bed surface 5 2 riverbed morphology changes under scenarios hydrodynamic modelling results also revealed the spatial dynamics of hydrological regimes in the study area and the sedimentation and erosion process under dredging and sand mining scenarios the variation in flow velocity of 0 13 decrease to 0 2 m s increase was found in the river mouth section the velocity increase of 0 3 m s was also detected near the mouth of the river under low in the dry season and high tide in the flood season due to dredging activities compared to the baseline which could be explained as the hydraulic gradient is influenced by the change the river s width and depth saad and habib 2021 in addition tidal amplitude increases by up to 15 cm during high tide more downstream than upstream due to higher depths from the dredging activities brunier et al 2014 schmitt et al 2017 regarding sedimentation and erosion process one year after dredging we found in section 1 an accretion of 513 680 m3 sce1 and 344 111 m3 sce2 section 2 shows an erosion trend losing 3 842 871 m3 sce1 and 4 165 835 m3 sce2 these findings reasonably reflect the sediment movement process of tidal dredged rivers presented by van maren et al 2015 it also confirms previous studies which suggest that dredged canals are highly stable anh and lộc 2017 gugliotta et al 2020 hoang 2020 hoàng 2008 considering the larger picture dredging reduces sediment accumulation upstream zone 1 by 18 under sce1 and by 36 under sce2 in the soai rap area zone 2 sediment accumulation increases by 6 under sce1 and by 13 under sce2 in the ganh rai bay area zone 3 sediment accumulation decreases by 5 under sce1 and decreases by 10 under sce2 these mean that the dredging activities transport sediments from the upper and coastal zones to the middle zone and these trends agreed with the studies by van maren et al 2015 and tu et al 2019 our study presents a novelty in setting the scenario of mining sites in the model compared to previous studies i e dries van den van den eynde et al 2010 hackney et al 2020 tu et al 2019 we did not put the mining river depths in advance but each mining site was attributed with specific mined volumes over time δ v δ t to demonstrate that the sand volumes are extracted consequently the sand excavation creates mining pits which trap sediment causing discontinuities in riverbed sediment movement the consequence of such imbalances in sediment displacement is sand starvation in some areas and sediment redistribution to other river areas as presented by brunier et al 2014 and liangwen et al 2007 our simulation findings suggest that sand excavation amounting to 26 million m3 per year would result in a net loss of sediment everywhere except in zone 3 zone 1 and zone 2 would experience sediment losses amounting to respectively 1 9 million m3 per year and 144 000 m3 per year the accretion in zone 3 would amount to 28 7 million m3 per year regarding sand mining and replacement capacity in the various zones of the river zone 1 exhibited almost no replacement capacity as sand removal exceeded the river s re sedimentation capacity on the soai rap river zone 2 and in the estuary zone 3 levelling sand was the main output replacement capacity in these zones was found to be greater than in zone 1 due to the large mud stores and sand inflows from the sea the main output from zone 1 was sand for construction which is higher in economic value than the sand mining output of the other zones anh and lộc 2017 hoàng et al 2005b yet zone 1 has limited sources of sediment and sand mining here brings a high risk of landslides asabonga et al 2017 this is a particularly difficult problem in exploitation of sediment resources in the riverbed of the study area 5 3 limitations and future outlook in the following studies we would like to address the following points first the impacts of human activities on morphological change of an estuarine river mouth often occur over a longer period hoang 2020 while our study simulated the four scenarios for a relatively short period of one year hence the impacts may not have become fully evident especially when external human activities i e upstream dam construction land reclamation or ground infilling could add more influence dai et al 2018 2016 second many parameters were estimated and trialled hundreds of times during the calibration process using calibrated and validated time series data of water levels flow velocity and ssc the model performance is not fully assessed therefore it is useful to have spatial data satellite ssc data for the model calibration and validation tran et al 2018 also the model reality could be improved if the model output sensitivity analysis is elaborated with all parameter sets under scenarios van der wegen and jaffe 2013 third despite our effort for model calibration and validation applications of process based morphodynamic models are often constrained by the limited availability of data on bed composition in our study actual mophordynamic development results were not fully modelled due to the bed composition data limitation to proceed with a process that a model needs to spin up morphodynamically with defined initial and boundary conditions to finally capture real physical processes exceeding the errors caused by model artifacts due to limited process formulations dam et al 2016 therefore the model should ideally run a morphodynamic spin up period during the initial simulation period that is long enough for instance a run with a fixed bed composition for 2 5 years followed by a period of 10 30 years including bed level changes to have a stable bed to capture the more realistic morphodynamic changes dam et al 2016 future work therefore could further run various periods of morphodynamic spin up representing estuarine system dynamics more realistically if measured bathymetries are available for comparison e g dam et al 2016 van der wegen et al 2011 finally mining activities especially their budgets are difficult to comprehensively and accurately estimate due to the data collection challenges regarding sand output and extraction scope and the presence of illegal sand extraction operations in vietnam jordan et al 2019 ng and park 2021 despite the limitations being considered by future works the proposed approach and scenarios present a lesson learned riverbed evolution difference under scenarios due to dredging and sand mining and put the great potential for application in similar coastal estuaries worldwide 6 conclusions our study evaluated the potential effects of sand mining activities on flow dynamics and sediment distribution in the river and coastal domain in the downstream dong nai saigon river system of southern vietnam using four scenarios based on the telemac 2d hydrodynamic model our results indicate that overall the dredging substantially changes the hydraulic regime and sedimentation and erosion process in the study area the average flow velocity varies between 0 13 and 0 35 m s in different river sections during low and high tide in both flood and dry seasons while the tidal range in the estuary increases by up to 15 cm during high tide in the scenarios with dredging the increased tidal range was attributed mainly to a decreasing tendency of low tide the consistent tidal peak suggests that saline intrusion driven by dredging penetrates more deeply into the river upstream due to the increased speed of tidal transmission our findings provide evidence for the detrimental impacts of dredging activities in the soai rap river and urge dredging plans to include adequate measures to stabilize the riverbed such as structures to regulate mainstream flows furthermore dredging and sand excavation strongly influenced morphological changes and sediment dynamics along the river from the estuary to upstream we found a reduction of 18 and 36 sediment deposition in the upstream zone and increased sediment deposition in the soai rap estuary by 6 and 13 after the one year simulation in addition sediment accumulation decreased by 5 and 10 in the ganh rai bay area due to the sediment transport from the sea to the estuary overall the mines and pits due to sand extractions trapped sediment causing discontinuities in the longitudinal transport of sediment and sand starvation in various areas of the river at the same time the redistribution patterns are heterogeneous across different river sections these forces have driven the riverbed erosion our study provided a valuable example for international rivers particularly those in southeast asian countries i e chao phraya thailand ayeyarwady myanmar mekong vietnam where river

3447,accurate and effective assessment of groundwater vulnerability is very important for ensuring a healthy groundwater ecosystem we evaluate the vulnerability of shallow porous aquifers by modifying the drastic model and verify the effectiveness of the variable weight model vwm firstly topography aquifer media and the impact of the vadose zone are replaced by land use type aquifer thickness and the hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone second the weighting is optimized using the analytical hierarchy process ahp and variable weight theory vwt thirdly the original and the improved drastic methods were used to evaluate groundwater vulnerability finally three sets of samples hydrochemical parameters no 3 mg2 cod were used to verify the improved frameworks using the receiver operating curve roc method the improved model increases the dispersion degree of groundwater vulnerability compared with the original drastic method the correlation of the vwm is significantly improved in terms of the area under curve auc for no 3 0 786 cod 0 753 and mg2 0 831 in short it is necessary to optimize the parameters and weights of the model in order to realize reliable estimations of groundwater

1 introduction groundwater resources represent one of the most important sources for drinking water and have an important role in sustaining life and human activities cassardo and jones 2011 salman et al 2019 yu et al 2020 in recent decades due to the increasing environmental influence of human activities e g agriculture industry and urbanization the quality of groundwater has been adversely affected zhang et al 2018 li and wu 2019 aravinthasamy et al 2019 there are technical and cost related problems in the treatment of groundwater pollution so the proper introduction of prevention and control measures is very important for effective groundwater management and protection babiker et al 2005 elçi 2017 traditional groundwater monitoring and sampling techniques are subject to spatial variability and data limitations which make the prevention and control activities time consuming and labor intensive jang et al 2017 ziyad et al 2021 the assessment of groundwater vulnerability can be used as an effective prediction tool for decision makers to restore and protect groundwater quality kumar et al 2015 jaseela et al 2016 asfaw and ayalew 2020 margat 1968 proposed the concept of groundwater vulnerability in the 1960 s the basic idea is that some aquifers are more vulnerable to pollution than others whereby it is possible to delineate between aquifers that are inherently vulnerable and those with specific vulnerabilities national research council 1993 gogu and dassargues 2000 in reviewing past studies researchers have used various models to assess groundwater vulnerability such as epik doerfliger and zwahlen 1997 nekkoub et al 2020 sintacs civita 1994 civita et al 1997 fis pathak and bhandary 2020 god foster 1987 boulabeiz et al 2019 taazzouzte et al 2020

divided into four categories overlay index methods statistical procedures process based methods and or a combination of these methods oh et al 2011 li and merchant 2013 neh et al 2015 the overlay index methods tend to be the most widely used huan et al 2012 bordbar et al 2020 the drastic method proposed by the national water well association nwwa and the u s environmental protection agency usepa is one of the most commonly used and reliable overlay index techniques for assessing the intrinsic vulnerability of aquifers aller et al 1987 antonakos and lambrakis 2007 barzegar et al 2019 the probability of groundwater pollution caused by a single factor is very small in general pollution incidents are multifactorial by design in essence many complex and interrelated factors affect groundwater vulnerability seven hydrological and geological parameters of aquifers are considered in this method d depth to water r net recharge a aquifer media s soil media t topography i impact of the vadose zone and c hydraulic conductivity rates and weights are allocated to these parameters to calculate the groundwater vulnerability index rupert 2001 this method has been widely used in china the united states india and iran over spatial scales covering hundreds to thousands of square kilometers differences in groundwater vulnerability due to the hydrogeological characteristics and the environment of different aquifers make the selection of the parameter weights and rating specifications for the drastic method quite subjective babiker et al 2005 lasagna et al 2018 several researchers have modified the parameters for drastic e g alam et al 2014 barzegar et al 2018 noori et al 2018 and compared and verified the parameter weights and rating scale and have achieved good results thirumalaivasan et al 2003 abdullah et al 2018 jhariya et al 2019 in the traditional drastic model using the delphi approach to determine the weights of the parameters the lack of input of expert opinions or the use of fixed weights for the various parameters represent procedural weaknesses khosravi et al 2018 predefined values cannot fully reflect the diversity of the study area shrestha et al 2016 in previous studies ahp neshat et al 2014a kang et al 2017 karan et al 2018 genetic algorithm jafari and nikoo 2017 yang et al 2017 the entropy and genetic algorithm methods

optimization and genetic algorithm torkashvand et al 2021a torkashvand et al 2021b were used to optimize the weights of the drastic method however in prior research on groundwater vulnerability assessment the parameter weights remain constant a constant weight indicates that the relative importance of a single index to the target remains unchanged and will not vary with changes in the situation i e changes in parameter values caused by changes in hydrogeological conditions are directly ignored jiang and liu 2019 this obviously lacks a certain rationality the importance of a single parameter also depends on the ranking of other indicators and the general characteristics of the research site both of which are affected by the combination of multiple indicators napolitano and fabbri 1996 zheng et al 2020 vwt establishes a relationship between the weight vector and the state vector this relationship adjusts the weight of the decision making influencing parameters according to changes in the decision making state with the intent of obtaining a reasonable weight distribution in the multi objective decision making process wu et al 2016a lin et al 2020 this approach has been used in the military cheng et al 1999 renewable energy li et al 2018 geology wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 lin et al 2020 telecommunications wu 2010 seyedzadeh et al 2013 biomedicine liu et al 2019 and other fields for aggregated preference ranking and weight optimization llamazares and pena 2013 to overcome the limitation that the weights of different parameters remain constant in groundwater vulnerability assessment we combine vwm with drastic model first the parameters for the drastic model are optimized according to the actual situation of the study area second the ahp method and vwt are used to optimize the parameter weighting then based on the results for weight optimization and the improved drastic model the groundwater vulnerability evaluation results are obtained finally a comparison study involving the original and the improved drastic models was undertaken whereby the no 3 cod and mg2 concentrations in the groundwater were used to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the new method 2 study area the research area focuses on the northern henan province in central china with an area of approximately 2400 km2 fig 1 the area in question has two municipal districts jiaozuo and jiyuan three counties wenxian wuzhi and boai two county level cities mengzhou city and qinyang city and a total of 1600 villages the study area experiences a typical warm temperate continental monsoon climate characterized by dry and windy conditions in spring hot and rainy conditions in the summer warm days and cool nights in the autumn and a cold and dry climate in winter the annual average temperature is 14 6 c and the annual average precipitation is 580 mm the study area is 86 282 m above sea level the primary land use types are agriculture 74 0 urban 14 4 and pasture 9 6 from a geological standpoint the area located south of the t ai hang mountains and northwest of the yellow river alluvial and proluvial plain is part of the north china plain according to the characteristics of the aquifer media and the water storage conditions the working area can be divided into two main aquifer groups consisting of a shallow porous aquifer group 40 60 m a middle deep porous aquifer group 60 150 m and a deep porous aquifer group 150 m the water yield of a single well varies typically from 1000 3000 m3 d the middle and deep layers belong to the upper part of the middle pleistocene and the lower pleistocene the lithology of the aquifer is composed of a set of coarse and fine sand sand gravel and argillaceous loose deposits which are formed by proluvial and alluvial deposits the thickness of the layers is 7 5 59 m and the water inflow for a single well is typically 500 3000 m3 d based on the results of borehole pumping tests in the study area the water permeability coefficient ranges from 0 03 to 32 72 m d according to previous studies water is supplied to the study area mainly from the shallow unconfined aquifers kendy et al 2004 zheng et al 2010 the pumping of groundwater provides 70 of the water used for irrigation and 60 of the total water supply in the north china plain liu and xia 2004 the study area is a major agricultural and industrial area in recent decades with the rapid increase of population and the rapid development of industry agriculture and cities the demand for water resources has increased and the risk of groundwater pollution is rising at present the water in the shallow porous aquifer in the study area is not suitable for drinking therefore it is very important to select an appropriate shallow porous water aquifer as the research objective when evaluating the groundwater vulnerability for aquifer protection and management 3 methodology and materials 3 1 drastic method seven important hydrogeological parameters are considered in the drastic method and each of them is defined in this section a rate scale of 1 10 and a weight scale of 1 5 are assigned to each of the above parameters table 1 the drastic index is computed as follows aller et al 1987 1 di d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where r denotes the rate and w denotes the weight the higher the drastic index the higher is the vulnerability most researchers assess vulnerability by manually drawing the groundwater vulnerability map and using the natural interruption method jenks 1977 nadiri et al 2018 khashei siuki et al 2020 for the calculation process all the data are normalized in the form of a grid in the the present work the formula is as follows 2 v i x y i 1 n w i i 1 n i r i i χ a i i c x y p i where v i x y is the cell vulnerability value w i is the weight of character i n is the total number of features n i is the number of sub features for the i th feature r i i is the rating of i the sub feature for the i th feature c x y p i denotes the class value of the cell x y for the i th feature a i i denotes the sub feature interval and χ a i i denotes the indicator function for the i th sub feature of the i th feature which is defined as 3 χ a i i c x y p 1 c x y p i a i i 0 c x y p i a i i 3 1 1 the depth to water d the d represents the distance from the surface to the water table in the unconfined aquifer and is an indication of the distance that pollutants must travel from the surface to reach the groundwater the measurement of d is based on 192 observations of wells 20 national monitoring wells 20 provincial monitoring wells and 152 civilian wells in the study area for the wet and dry periods in the years 2019 2020 according to the water level measurement data the kriging interpolation method commonly used in hydrological analysis is applied to calculate the groundwater depth of the whole region and generate the groundwater level map kumar 2007 gundogdu and guney 2007 according to the range defined by aller et al 1987 the drastic model has an assigned weight of 5 and a ratio of 1 10 3 1 2 the net recharge r in the drastic model r represents the net recharge which refers to the amount of water that seeps into the ground and flows to the groundwater through the unsaturated area in the study area the main sources of r are rainfall infiltration and irrigation infiltration according to fang et al 1996 qian et al 2012 and wu et al 2016b 4 r i r pi r ii p α i β i q i where r i is the total net recharge r pi and r ii are the recharge from rainfall and irrigation respectively p is the average annual rainfall is calculated based on interpolation of the average annual rainfall of two municipal and six county level rainfall stations and where α i is the rainfall infiltration coefficient and is calculated following the handbook of hydrogeology liu 2005 β i is the irrigation infiltration coefficient and q i depends on the land use type and the rated value for the irrigation water for different crops 3 1 3 the aquifer media a a represents the aquifer media and is a reflection of the capacity for attenuation control of the pollutant by the aquifer according to the drilling profiles for 28 boreholes there are few types of aquifer and poor dispersive media in the study area according to the classification in the drastic model the aquifer media may be divided into two types the first is sand and gravel which is distributed in a small part of the boundary of the research area and accounting for 21 of the total area the second is sandstone the most important component of the water bearing layer and this has a wide distribution area of 79 3 1 4 the soil media s the s stands for the soil media which is very important for controlling the infiltration of water and pollutants into the ground according to the hydrogeological report for the study area the soil is composed mainly of four soil types silty loam loam sandy loam and sand according to the drastic model the rate values are 4 5 6 and 9 respectively and the weight value is 2 3 1 5 the topography t the t of the area can best be represented by the slope of the area and is divided into five classes ranging from 0 to 2 2 6 6 12 12 18 and 18 the slope of the study area was calculated using the dem digital elevation data with a resolution of 30 m in arcmap 10 3 3 1 6 the impact of the vadose zone i the impact of the seepage zone or the vadose zone refers to the unsaturated zone situated above the water table this zone determines the attenuation characteristics of the contaminants aller et al 1987 in this study i is classified according to the profile and geometric map of each well and is assigned rates of 3 6 and 8 3 1 7 the hydraulic conductivity c the c refers to the ability of the materials in the aquifer to allow the passage of water through the material and can be estimated by performing a pumping test based on the pumping test results the c rangs from 0 0341 to 32 715 m d the kriging method was then used to interpolate c over the study area the rates of conductivity were then calculated for the waters as reported elsewhere aller et al 1987 3 2 ahp the ahp was conceived to solve multi criteria decision making problems wu et al 2013 2016c zeng et al 2016 wu and yu 2021 different from subjective weighting this method is based on the pairwise comparison matrix and compares all criteria the principal steps are 1 select the element to build the hierarchical structure 2 according to a scale of 1 9 saaty 1980 table 2 allocate a value for the relative importance of each element and construct a judgment matrix based on the numerical values 3 establish the pairwise comparison matrices by quantitatively evaluating each parameter and calculating the respective weights of the primary control element and 4 after the weight is determined the consideration index ci and the checking of the consideration rate cr are calculated as follows 5 ci λ max n n 1 6 cr ci ri where λ max is the largest principal eigenvalue of the matrix and n is the number of parameters as a general guideline cr should be less than or equal to 0 1 cr 0 1 to maintain the consistency of the ahp matrix saaty 2003 according to the ahp method the weights of the original drastic and drashcl models are optimized respectively and the groundwater vulnerability value is calculated using eq 7 7 ahp v i x y i 1 n w ahp i 1 n i r i i χ a i i c x y p i where w ahp is determined by the ahp method after satisfying the consistency test 3 3 variable weight theory 3 3 1 definition of axiomatic in the delphi method the ahp method and the entropy method the weights remain unchanged when the whole parameter value changes clearly this kind of fixed existence is not reasonable the emergence of the vwm is a good solution to this problem based on vwt wang 1985 and since refined by other researchers e g li 1996 li 2004 li and hao 2009 the vwm is defined as follows li and li 2002 cai and li 2001 wang et al 2014 definition 1 let the vector w 0 w 1 0 w 2 0 w n 0 0 1 n is an n dimensional constant weight vector and j 1 n w

partition variable weight in the process of applying vwt considering the spatial difference of each combination of parameters the basic evaluation unit of the study area was set as a 45 m 45 m grid in arcgis analysis of the groundwater vulnerability variable weight evaluation indicated that a state variable weight vector was required to provide a numerical incentive or punishment to the weighted value of the parameters thus adjusting the groundwater vulnerability level a single high index will significantly increase the risk of groundwater pollution but a single low index does not necessarily reduce significantly the risk of groundwater pollution at this time the incentive index value parameters are needed to facilitate groundwater pollution whereas punishment index value parameters hinder groundwater pollution according to the characteristics of the groundwater vulnerability the range of incentives should be greater than that of punishment the zoning state variable weight vector of groundwater vulnerability is selected as follows wu et al 2016a 8 s j x e a 1 d 1 x c 1 0 x d 1 c d 1 x d 2 e a 2 x d 2 c 1 d 2 x d 3 e a 3 x d 3 e a 2 d 3 d 2 c 1 d 3 x 1 the function s j x is smooth and continuous over the interval 0 1 a1 a2 a3 and c are the parameters to be determined and are called the weight adjustment parameters d1 d2 and d3 are the thresholds of the variable weight intervals determined by the fuzzy c method in this study the weight optimization is calculated according to the ahp method and vwt the variable weight is determined according to the formula 9 w x w 1 0 s 1 x w 2 0 s 2 x w n 0 s n x j 1 n w j s j x w 0 s j x j 1 n w j s j x where w x is the variable weight of the parameter w 0 is the fixed weight and s j x is the state variable weight vector 3 3 3 groundwater vulnerability assessment based on vwm the application of vwt to establish a groundwater vulnerability evaluation model is common to establishing a mathematical model that is affected by multiple parameters through the objective analysis of parameter characteristics to reflect the degree of groundwater vulnerability of an evaluation unit the mathematical model of groundwater vulnerability assessment in the study area is as follows 10 v i x y i 1 n w i i 1 n i r i i χ a i i c x y p i i 1 n w 0 s j x j 1 m w j s j x i 1 n i r i i χ a i i c x y p i 3 4 optimization of the drastic method for groundwater vulnerability assessment parameter optimization is based on the drastic model and fully considers the hydrogeological conditions of the study area in this way the original model parameters were revised table 3 for each of the parameters the data were normalized and then superposed in arcgis the natural interruption method of jenks 1977 was used to divide the data into five levels very low low medium high and very high the groundwater vulnerability map was then drawn the methodology adopted to modify the drastic modeling for groundwater vulnerability assessment is illustrated in fig 2 3 4 1 delete topography t in the drastic method t is a quantitative parameter and its lowest weight value is 1 however the terrain of the whole study area is gentle so the impact of the t on the groundwater is essentially the same at all locations additionally the spatial difference and dispersion are poor therefore in this improved groundwater vulnerability assessment model t was deleted from the drastic parameter system miao et al 2020 3 4 2 addition of the land use l parameter there is a strong and significant correlation between water quality and different l types mehaffey et al 2005 stutter et al 2007 williams et al 2014 different l types generate different pollutant loads tasdighi et al 2017 many studies have shown that l can have an important impact on groundwater vulnerability pórcel et al 2014 yang et al 2017 therefore in the improved drastic model the parameter l has been added sener and davraz 2012 brindha and elango 2015 al abadi 2017 the classification and rates are shown in table 3 3 4 3 replacing aquifer media with aquifer thickness according to the hydrogeological conditions many studies have adopted the aquifer thickness as an alternative to the aquifer medium when applying the drastic model wang et al 2007 ong or and long cang 2007 in general the aquifer thickness parameters may be readily obtained from the hydrogeological profile and there is typically a negative correlation with groundwater vulnerability huan et al 2012 as described earlier the aquifer medium of this study are sandstone and sand and gravel thus the aquifer thickness was used as a replacement for the aquifer medium term the rating scales are listed in table 3 3 4 4 replacement of i by the hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone h the vadose zone has good connectivity with the atmosphere and the saturated water zone diverse pollution sources at the surface must pass through the vadose zone to describe the influence of the vadose zone quantitatively the concept of hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone is introduced kazakis and voudouris 2015 this represents the relative transit time from the surface to the saturated zone and this transit time is calculated by using the thickness of the vadose zone and the estimated hydraulic conductivity the concept of hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone has been used previously in modifications of the drastic method kazakis and voudouris 2015 jia et al 2019 after parameter optimization the original drastic model has become the drashcl model 3 5 data sampling and analysis before undertaking an assessment of the groundwater vulnerability field investigations and data collection were carried out in the study area in 2019 to determine the scope of the study area the layout of sampling points collection and preservation of samples were arranged per the national geological and mineral industry standards specification regional groundwater contamination investigation and evaluation dz t 0288 2015 mlr ministry of land and resources of the people s republic of china 2015 the sampling period was from june to september in the anomalously wet season of 2020 and the sampling horizon was shallow porous phreatic aquifers including 92 national monitoring wells provincial monitoring wells and civilian wells all the samples were sent to the laboratory of the institute of natural resources monitoring of henan province for chemical analysis all the groundwater vulnerability assessment data were obtained from different sources the details are listed in table 4 3 6 validation of groundwater vulnerability chemical parameters are often used to validate and verify the accuracy of the drastic model jamrah et al 2008 srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 in this study mg2 no 3 and cod were selected to verify the test results in the samples using the roc method the aim was to reveal the pollution status of groundwater in the study area the roc method was used to predict the accuracy of the classification model and the prediction system metz 1978 pham et al 2017 pham and prakash 2017 the area under the roc curve auc was used to measure the performance and compare the accuracy of the different frames torkashvand et al 2021a torkashvand et al 2021b the auc value is in the range 0 1 values closer to 1 indicate better the prediction accuracy in drawing the roc the x axis represents the false positive rate 1 specificity which indicates the rate of incorrectly classified instances and the y axis represents a false negative rate sensitivity indicating the rate of correctly classified instances the roc method is effective and can be used to verify the relationship between the groundwater vulnerability classification and the hydrochemical parameters of the samples mogaji and san lim 2017 kumar and krishna 2020 bera et al 2021 4 results and discussion 4 1 the original drastic model according to aller et al 1987 the thematic map grid basis of each parameter is divided and a rate is assigned which is then multiplied by the respective weight for each parameter fig 3 a g equation 1 is used to carry out the overlay calculation in arcgis and the groundwater vulnerability index map is drawn fig 4 according to the results it is easy to quantitatively judge the vulnerability area the lower the level the lower the pollution risk as given by the seven parameters the higher the index the higher the groundwater pollution potential using the natural interruption method the index is divided into five levels very low 55 78 low 78 95 medium 95 111 high 111 126 and very high 126 157 which cover 34 67 14 74 10 59 10 98 and 29 02 of the total area in the original drastic method the most vulnerable areas are mainly concentrated in the north of the study area indicating that these areas are most vulnerable to pollution the buried depth of groundwater is less than 9 m the soil medium is sandy and the lithology of the vadose zone is sandstone which has high net recharge conditions the lowest vulnerability level covers the largest area mainly in the northernmost edge and central area of the study area indicating that these regions are not vulnerable to pollution this may be because of the large buried depth of groundwater and lower rate of recharge which reduces the chance of aquifer pollution 4 2 the ahp drastic and ahp drashcl models in the improved ahp drastic the weights of the initial seven parameters are modified by the ahp method table 5 the consistency test indicates that ci value is less than 0 1 the final groundwater vulnerability calculated by eq 7 is shown in fig 5 the areas with high vulnerability according to ahp drastic are mainly concentrated in the northern and southwestern portions of the study area and the main determinant parameters are d and i low vulnerability areas are concentrated in the middle western portion of the domain the relative value of the vulnerability index does not represent the true degree of pollution but instead indicates which parts of the study area are more vulnerable to pollution gogu and dassargues 2000 fijani et al 2013 in the ahp drashcl the weights of the modified parameters are the same as those in the reference neshat et al 2015 jia et al 2019 and the thematic map is shown in fig 6 the weight values of the normalized parameters for ahp drashcl are listed in table 6 the results indicate that the most influential parameter was d and the least influential was s in the ahp drashcl results the area of medium and high vulnerability were concentrated in the middle and east of the study area fig 7 occupying 59 84 of the total area fig 8 compared with drastic and ahp drastic the areas with the highest vulnerability increased in size mainly in the northeast of the study area the reason for this is that the aquifer thickness has replaced the aquifer media and this parameter can be quantified the large thickness of the aquifer implies a large water storage capacity which serves to enchance the dilution of pollutants according to the modified data the degree of dispersion of the vulnerability level improves and the main influencing parameter is the l different l types have greater influences on water quality such that the groundwater vulnerability increases as a result of the discharge of pollutants such as domestic sewage industrial wastewater agricultural irrigation and fertilizers singh et al 2015 baghapour et al 2016 ouedraogo et al 2016 the two improved ahp drastic and ahp drashcl methods optimize the vulnerability index with respect to the parameter weights and quantitative parameters however it is not reasonable to apply the same weight to a parameter across the whole study area this aspect of the model needs to be improved 4 3 the vwm drashcl model the normalized values for the parameters are clustered into four variable weight intervals as described in table 7 through the analysis and debugging of various parameters in the study area the unit values satisfying the constraint conditions were selected finally for the study area the following values were obtained a1 4 84 a2 3 20 a3 0 56 and c 1 9 the state variable weight vectors constructed using the seven parameters are as follows 11 s j x e 4 84 d 1 x 1 9 1 0 x d 1 1 9 d 1 x d 2 e 3 20 x d 2 1 9 1 d 2 x d 3 e 0 56 x d 3 e 3 20 x d 2 1 9 1 d 3 x 1 where 0 d1 is the penalty interval d1 d2 is the weight invariant interval d2 d3 is the initial incentive interval and d3 1 is the strong incentive interval with a gradual increase in the independent variables the penalty value gradually decreases then transits to a constant value and then presents as an overall growth trend combined with the groundwater vulnerability index as the risk parameter data gradually improves the penalty of variable weight function vwf gradually decreases when the data changes to a certain extent the penalty of the vwf will be zero which equates to no penalty and no incentive when the data show that the groundwater pollution risk is sufficiently small the influence of the function on the weight acts as an the situation of initial and strong incentive which is rational fig 9 shows the groundwater vulnerability results calculated according to eq 10 the results for vwm drashcl illustrate that for the groundwater vulnerability assessment of the study area the vwm optimizes the parameter weights by punishment and incentive compared with the constant weight model the overall trend is similar and the degree of dispersion is more obvious wu et al 2016b liu et al 2018 in general regions in which d is small may be vulnerable to pollution but the actual situation depends on a combination of parameters such as the aquifer thickness the nature of the vadose zone and the nature and location on the ground which is the reason why the results are different from those of ahp drashcl khosravi et al 2018 given that the range of the incentive weight is larger than that of punishment the most vulnerable area increases in size mainly in the southwest and middle sections of the model the reason for this is that the punishment suppresses the low impact parameters of the groundwater associated with vulnerability and stimulates the high impact parameters 4 4 model validation validation using only one hydrochemical parameter of the samples is not considered to be an acceptable way to demonstrate the vulnerability of an aquifer because the level of an indicator may be affected by its exposure to several pollutants hamza et al 2015 more than one hydrochemical parameter should be used for verification purposes herlinger and viero 2007 moratalla et al 2011 hasan et al 2019 the drastic the ahp drastic the ahp drashcl and the vwm drashcl were verified and compared according to the water quality inspection results for 92 sampling points the roc method was used for verification and comparison the roc method has previously been effectively used to verify the reliability and prediction accuracy of a groundwater vulnerability model mogaji and san lim 2017 the correlation analysis results show that the modified model significantly improves the relationship between the vulnerability index and the relevant hydrochemical parameters fig 10 the auc values for the three water samples exhibit clear regularity with the vwm drashcl method giving the best correlation followed by the ahp drashcl method followed by the ahp drastic method the drastic method gives the smallest degree of correlation the auc for the improved parameters in the ahp method increases indicating improved performance for the optimized parameters in the study region compared with the drastic method the vwm drashcl produces a significant increase of 0 452 for no 3 and 0 184 for cod the necessity and superiority of modifying the drastic method are confirmed again by this result according to yesilnacar and topal 2005 the classification criteria are poor 0 5 0 6 average 0 6 0 7 good 0 7 0 8 very good 0 8 0 9 and excellent 0 9 1 see table 8 for details after optimizing the parameters and weights the performance of the model is enhanced the discretization is ensured and the correlation is increased most of the roc curves are basically above the diagonal and the auc is 0 5 1 which represents an above average percentage of the prediction value however in the drastic model no 3 0 334 and mg2 0 497 are below the diagonal the results of the existing data show that the correlation of the original method is poor that is the drastic method offers no statistical significance for the description of groundwater vulnerability and the description of aquifer vulnerability is poor these results show that the optimized parameter and the weighting approach are more effective and physically sound than the original method therefore the improved vwm may be used to assess the groundwater vulnerability of the aquifers in the study area more accurately 5 conclusions the improved drastic model further optimizes the groundwater vulnerability evaluation results by considering the state values and combined values of various parameters at different locations in the study area vmt was applied for weight optimization vwm overcomes the deficiency of using equal weights in the whole study area the improved model has a high degree of dispersion and more reasonable results which shows the impact of varying the weight of each parameter on the vulnerability value the validation results show that the auc values for the vulnerability index and the three hydrochemical parameters increase in the results for the drastic method ahp drastic method ahp drashcl method and vwm drashcl method in particular drastic gives the lowest auc values and vwm drashcl gives the highest these results indicate that the accuracy of the model can be increased by improving the parameters and by considering the quantitative parameters associated with aquifers and human activities additionally the vwm verification results show the accuracy and rationality of the groundwater vulnerability evaluation method based on vwt thus the proposed model can be used to formulate groundwater protection policies that are more in line with the actual situation in vulnerable areas effective engineering and non engineering measures should be implemented and regular groundwater quality monitoring should be carried out to prevent further increases in pollution in future work we propose to collect and test groundwater samples in different periods to obtain more data on the impact of hydrochemical parameters on groundwater vulnerability which may overcome some limitations of this study data availability statement data cannot be made publicly available readers should

3447,accurate and effective assessment of groundwater vulnerability is very important for ensuring a healthy groundwater ecosystem we evaluate the vulnerability of shallow porous aquifers by modifying the drastic model and verify the effectiveness of the variable weight model vwm firstly topography aquifer media and the impact of the vadose zone are replaced by land use type aquifer thickness and the hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone second the weighting is optimized using the analytical hierarchy process ahp and variable weight theory vwt thirdly the original and the improved drastic methods were used to evaluate groundwater vulnerability finally three sets of samples hydrochemical parameters no 3 mg2 cod were used to verify the improved frameworks using the receiver operating

of the area under curve auc for no 3 0 786 cod 0 753 and mg2 0 831 in short it is necessary to optimize the parameters and weights of the model in order to realize reliable estimations of groundwater

1 introduction groundwater resources represent one of the most important sources for drinking water and have an important role in sustaining life and human activities cassardo and jones 2011 salman et al 2019 yu et al 2020 in recent decades due to the increasing environmental influence of human activities e g agriculture industry and urbanization the quality of groundwater has been adversely affected zhang et al 2018 li and wu 2019 aravinthasamy et al 2019 there are technical and cost related problems in the treatment of groundwater pollution so the proper introduction of prevention and control measures is very important for effective groundwater management and protection babiker et al 2005 elçi 2017 traditional groundwater monitoring and sampling techniques are subject to spatial variability and data limitations which make the prevention and control activities time consuming and labor intensive jang et al 2017 ziyad et al 2021 the assessment of groundwater vulnerability can be used as an effective prediction tool for decision makers to restore and protect groundwater quality kumar et al 2015 jaseela et al 2016 asfaw and ayalew 2020 margat 1968 proposed the concept of groundwater vulnerability in the 1960 s the basic idea is that some aquifers are more vulnerable to pollution than others whereby it is possible to delineate between aquifers that are inherently vulnerable and those with specific vulnerabilities national research council 1993 gogu and dassargues 2000 in reviewing past studies researchers have used various models to assess groundwater vulnerability such as epik doerfliger and zwahlen 1997 nekkoub et al 2020 sintacs civita 1994 civita et al 1997 fis pathak and bhandary 2020 god foster 1987 boulabeiz et al 2019 taazzouzte et al 2020

divided into four categories overlay index methods statistical procedures process based methods and or a combination of these methods oh et al 2011 li and merchant 2013 neh et al 2015 the overlay index methods tend to be the most widely used huan et al 2012 bordbar et al 2020 the drastic method proposed by the national water well association nwwa and the u s environmental protection agency usepa is one of the most commonly used and reliable overlay index techniques for assessing the intrinsic vulnerability of aquifers aller et al 1987 antonakos and lambrakis 2007 barzegar et al 2019 the probability of groundwater pollution caused by a single factor is very small in general pollution incidents are multifactorial by design in essence many complex and interrelated factors affect groundwater vulnerability seven hydrological and geological parameters of aquifers are considered in this method d depth to water r net recharge a aquifer media s soil media t topography i impact of the vadose zone and c hydraulic conductivity rates and weights are allocated to these parameters to calculate the groundwater vulnerability index rupert 2001 this method has been widely used in china the united states india and iran over spatial scales covering hundreds to thousands of square kilometers differences in groundwater vulnerability due to the hydrogeological characteristics and the environment of different aquifers make the selection of the parameter weights and rating specifications for the drastic method quite subjective babiker et al 2005 lasagna et al 2018 several researchers have modified the parameters for drastic e g alam et al 2014 barzegar et al 2018 noori et al 2018 and compared and verified the parameter weights and rating scale and have achieved good results thirumalaivasan et al 2003 abdullah et al 2018 jhariya et al 2019 in the traditional drastic model using the delphi approach to determine the weights of the parameters the lack of input of expert opinions or the use of fixed weights for the various parameters represent procedural weaknesses khosravi et al 2018 predefined values cannot fully reflect the diversity of the study area shrestha et al 2016 in previous studies ahp neshat et al 2014a kang et al 2017 karan et al 2018 genetic algorithm jafari and nikoo 2017 yang et al 2017 the entropy and genetic algorithm methods

optimization and genetic algorithm torkashvand et al 2021a torkashvand et al 2021b were used to optimize the weights of the drastic method however in prior research on groundwater vulnerability assessment the parameter weights remain constant a constant weight indicates that the relative importance of a single index to the target remains unchanged and will not vary with changes in the situation i e changes in parameter values caused by changes in hydrogeological conditions are directly ignored jiang and liu 2019 this obviously lacks a certain rationality the importance of a single parameter also depends on the ranking of other indicators and the general characteristics of the research site both of which are affected by the combination of multiple indicators napolitano and fabbri 1996 zheng et al 2020 vwt establishes a relationship between the weight vector and the state vector this relationship adjusts the weight of the decision making influencing parameters according to changes in the decision making state with the intent of obtaining a reasonable weight distribution in the multi objective decision making process wu et al 2016a lin et al 2020 this approach has been used in the military cheng et al 1999 renewable energy li et al 2018 geology wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 lin et al 2020 telecommunications wu 2010 seyedzadeh et al 2013 biomedicine liu et al 2019 and other fields for aggregated preference ranking and weight optimization llamazares and pena 2013 to overcome the limitation that the weights of different parameters remain constant in groundwater vulnerability assessment we combine vwm with drastic model first the parameters for the drastic model are optimized according to the actual situation of the study area second the ahp method and vwt are used to optimize the parameter weighting then based on the results for weight optimization and the improved drastic model the groundwater vulnerability evaluation results are obtained finally a comparison study involving the original and the improved drastic models was undertaken whereby the no 3 cod and mg2 concentrations in the groundwater were used to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the new method 2 study area the research area focuses on the northern henan province in central china with an area of approximately 2400 km2 fig 1 the area in question has two municipal districts jiaozuo and jiyuan three counties wenxian wuzhi and boai two county level cities mengzhou city and qinyang city and a total of 1600 villages the study area experiences a typical warm temperate continental monsoon climate characterized by dry and windy conditions in spring hot and rainy conditions in the summer warm days and cool nights in the autumn and a cold and dry climate in winter the annual average temperature is 14 6 c and the annual average precipitation is 580 mm the study area is 86 282 m above sea level the primary land use types are agriculture 74 0 urban 14 4 and pasture 9 6 from a geological standpoint the area located south of the t ai hang mountains and northwest of the yellow river alluvial and proluvial plain is part of the north china plain according to the characteristics of the aquifer media and the water storage conditions the working area can be divided into two main aquifer groups consisting of a shallow porous aquifer group 40 60 m a middle deep porous aquifer group 60 150 m and a deep porous aquifer group 150 m the water yield of a single well varies typically from 1000 3000 m3 d the middle and deep layers belong to the upper part of the middle pleistocene and the lower pleistocene the lithology of the aquifer is composed of a set of coarse and fine sand sand gravel and argillaceous loose deposits which are formed by proluvial and alluvial deposits the thickness of the layers is 7 5 59 m and the water inflow for a single well is typically 500 3000 m3 d based on the results of borehole pumping tests in the study area the water permeability coefficient ranges from 0 03 to 32 72 m d according to previous studies water is supplied to the study area mainly from the shallow unconfined aquifers kendy et al 2004 zheng et al 2010 the pumping of groundwater provides 70 of the water used for irrigation and 60 of the total water supply in the north china plain liu and xia 2004 the study area is a major agricultural and industrial area in recent decades with the rapid increase of population and the rapid development of industry agriculture and cities the demand for water resources has increased and the risk of groundwater pollution is rising at present the water in the shallow porous aquifer in the study area is not suitable for drinking therefore it is very important to select an appropriate shallow porous water aquifer as the research objective when evaluating the groundwater vulnerability for aquifer protection and management 3 methodology and materials 3 1 drastic method seven important hydrogeological parameters are considered in the drastic method and each of them is defined in this section a rate scale of 1 10 and a weight scale of 1 5 are assigned to each of the above parameters table 1 the drastic index is computed as follows aller et al 1987 1 di d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where r denotes the rate and w denotes the weight the higher the drastic index the higher is the vulnerability most researchers assess vulnerability by manually drawing the groundwater vulnerability map and using the natural interruption method jenks 1977 nadiri et al 2018 khashei siuki et al 2020 for the calculation process all the data are normalized in the form of a grid in the the present work the formula is as follows 2 v i x y i 1 n w i i 1 n i r i i χ a i i c x y p i where v i x y is the cell vulnerability value w i is the weight of character i n is the total number of features n i is the number of sub features for the i th feature r i i is the rating of i the sub feature for the i th feature c x y p i denotes the class value of the cell x y for the i th feature a i i denotes the sub feature interval and χ a i i denotes the indicator function for the i th sub feature of the i th feature which is defined as 3 χ a i i c x y p 1 c x y p i a i i 0 c x y p i a i i 3 1 1 the depth to water d the d represents the distance from the surface to the water table in the unconfined aquifer and is an indication of the distance that pollutants must travel from the surface to reach the groundwater the measurement of d is based on 192 observations of wells 20 national monitoring wells 20 provincial monitoring wells and 152 civilian wells in the study area for the wet and dry periods in the years 2019 2020 according to the water level measurement data the kriging interpolation method commonly used in hydrological analysis is applied to calculate the groundwater depth of the whole region and generate the groundwater level map kumar 2007 gundogdu and guney 2007 according to the range defined by aller et al 1987 the drastic model has an assigned weight of 5 and a ratio of 1 10 3 1 2 the net recharge r in the drastic model r represents the net recharge which refers to the amount of water that seeps into the ground and flows to the groundwater through the unsaturated area in the study area the main sources of r are rainfall infiltration and irrigation infiltration according to fang et al 1996 qian et al 2012 and wu et al 2016b 4 r i r pi r ii p α i β i q i where r i is the total net recharge r pi and r ii are the recharge from rainfall and irrigation respectively p is the average annual rainfall is calculated based on interpolation of the average annual rainfall of two municipal and six county level rainfall stations and where α i is the rainfall infiltration coefficient and is calculated following the handbook of hydrogeology liu 2005 β i is the irrigation infiltration coefficient and q i depends on the land use type and the rated value for the irrigation water for different crops 3 1 3 the aquifer media a a represents the aquifer media and is a reflection of the capacity for attenuation control of the pollutant by the aquifer according to the drilling profiles for 28 boreholes there are few types of aquifer and poor dispersive media in the study area according to the classification in the drastic model the aquifer media may be divided into two types the first is sand and gravel which is distributed in a small part of the boundary of the research area and accounting for 21 of the total area the second is sandstone the most important component of the water bearing layer and this has a wide distribution area of 79 3 1 4 the soil media s the s stands for the soil media which is very important for controlling the infiltration of water and pollutants into the ground according to the hydrogeological report for the study area the soil is composed mainly of four soil types silty loam loam sandy loam and sand according to the drastic model the rate values are 4 5 6 and 9 respectively and the weight value is 2 3 1 5 the topography t the t of the area can best be represented by the slope of the area and is divided into five classes ranging from 0 to 2 2 6 6 12 12 18 and 18 the slope of the study area was calculated using the dem digital elevation data with a resolution of 30 m in arcmap 10 3 3 1 6 the impact of the vadose zone i the impact of the seepage zone or the vadose zone refers to the unsaturated zone situated above the water table this zone determines the attenuation characteristics of the contaminants aller et al 1987 in this study i is classified according to the profile and geometric map of each well and is assigned rates of 3 6 and 8 3 1 7 the hydraulic conductivity c the c refers to the ability of the materials in the aquifer to allow the passage of water through the material and can be estimated by performing a pumping test based on the pumping test results the c rangs from 0 0341 to 32 715 m d the kriging method was then used to interpolate c over the study area the rates of conductivity were then calculated for the waters as reported elsewhere aller et al 1987 3 2 ahp the ahp was conceived to solve multi criteria decision making problems wu et al 2013 2016c zeng et al 2016 wu and yu 2021 different from subjective weighting this method is based on the pairwise comparison matrix and compares all criteria the principal steps are 1 select the element to build the hierarchical structure 2 according to a scale of 1 9 saaty 1980 table 2 allocate a value for the relative importance of each element and construct a judgment matrix based on the numerical values 3 establish the pairwise comparison matrices by quantitatively evaluating each parameter and calculating the respective weights of the primary control element and 4 after the weight is determined the consideration index ci and the checking of the consideration rate cr are calculated as follows 5 ci λ max n n 1 6 cr ci ri where λ max is the largest principal eigenvalue of the matrix and n is the number of parameters as a general guideline cr should be less than or equal to 0 1 cr 0 1 to maintain the consistency of the ahp matrix saaty 2003 according to the ahp method the weights of the original drastic and drashcl models are optimized respectively and the groundwater vulnerability value is calculated using eq 7 7 ahp v i x y i 1 n w ahp i 1 n i r i i χ a i i c x y p i where w ahp is determined by the ahp method after satisfying the consistency test 3 3 variable weight theory 3 3 1 definition of axiomatic in the delphi method the ahp method and the entropy method the weights remain unchanged when the whole parameter value changes clearly this kind of fixed existence is not reasonable the emergence of the vwm is a good solution to this problem based on vwt wang 1985 and since refined by other researchers e g li 1996 li 2004 li and hao 2009 the vwm is defined as follows li and li 2002 cai and li 2001 wang et al 2014 definition 1 let the vector w 0 w 1 0 w 2 0 w n 0 0 1 n is an n dimensional constant weight vector and j 1 n w

partition variable weight in the process of applying vwt considering the spatial difference of each combination of parameters the basic evaluation unit of the study area was set as a 45 m 45 m grid in arcgis analysis of the groundwater vulnerability variable weight evaluation indicated that a state variable weight vector was required to provide a numerical incentive or punishment to the weighted value of the parameters thus adjusting the groundwater vulnerability level a single high index will significantly increase the risk of groundwater pollution but a single low index does not necessarily reduce significantly the risk of groundwater pollution at this time the incentive index value parameters are needed to facilitate groundwater pollution whereas punishment index value parameters hinder groundwater pollution according to the characteristics of the groundwater vulnerability the range of incentives should be greater than that of punishment the zoning state variable weight vector of groundwater vulnerability is selected as follows wu et al 2016a 8 s j x e a 1 d 1 x c 1 0 x d 1 c d 1 x d 2 e a 2 x d 2 c 1 d 2 x d 3 e a 3 x d 3 e a 2 d 3 d 2 c 1 d 3 x 1 the function s j x is smooth and continuous over the interval 0 1 a1 a2 a3 and c are the parameters to be determined and are called the weight adjustment parameters d1 d2 and d3 are the thresholds of the variable weight intervals determined by the fuzzy c method in this study the weight optimization is calculated according to the ahp method and vwt the variable weight is determined according to the formula 9 w x w 1 0 s 1 x w 2 0 s 2 x w n 0 s n x j 1 n w j s j x w 0 s j x j 1 n w j s j x where w x is the variable weight of the parameter w 0 is the fixed weight and s j x is the state variable weight vector 3 3 3 groundwater vulnerability assessment based on vwm the application of vwt to establish a groundwater vulnerability evaluation model is common to establishing a mathematical model that is affected by multiple parameters through the objective analysis of parameter characteristics to reflect the degree of groundwater vulnerability of an evaluation unit the mathematical model of groundwater vulnerability assessment in the study area is as follows 10 v i x y i 1 n w i i 1 n i r i i χ a i i c x y p i i 1 n w 0 s j x j 1 m w j s j x i 1 n i r i i χ a i i c x y p i 3 4 optimization of the drastic method for groundwater vulnerability assessment parameter optimization is based on the drastic model and fully considers the hydrogeological conditions of the study area in this way the original model parameters were revised table 3 for each of the parameters the data were normalized and then superposed in arcgis the natural interruption method of jenks 1977 was used to divide the data into five levels very low low medium high and very high the groundwater vulnerability map was then drawn the methodology adopted to modify the drastic modeling for groundwater vulnerability assessment is illustrated in fig 2 3 4 1 delete topography t in the drastic method t is a quantitative parameter and its lowest weight value is 1 however the terrain of the whole study area is gentle so the impact of the t on the groundwater is essentially the same at all locations additionally the spatial difference and dispersion are poor therefore in this improved groundwater vulnerability assessment model t was deleted from the drastic parameter system miao et al 2020 3 4 2 addition of the land use l parameter there is a strong and significant correlation between water quality and different l types mehaffey et al 2005 stutter et al 2007 williams et al 2014 different l types generate different pollutant loads tasdighi et al 2017 many studies have shown that l can have an important impact on groundwater vulnerability pórcel et al 2014 yang et al 2017 therefore in the improved drastic model the parameter l has been added sener and davraz 2012 brindha and elango 2015 al abadi 2017 the classification and rates are shown in table 3 3 4 3 replacing aquifer media with aquifer thickness according to the hydrogeological conditions many studies have adopted the aquifer thickness as an alternative to the aquifer medium when applying the drastic model wang et al 2007 ong or and long cang 2007 in general the aquifer thickness parameters may be readily obtained from the hydrogeological profile and there is typically a negative correlation with groundwater vulnerability huan et al 2012 as described earlier the aquifer medium of this study are sandstone and sand and gravel thus the aquifer thickness was used as a replacement for the aquifer medium term the rating scales are listed in table 3 3 4 4 replacement of i by the hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone h the vadose zone has good connectivity with the atmosphere and the saturated water zone diverse pollution sources at the surface must pass through the vadose zone to describe the influence of the vadose zone quantitatively the concept of hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone is introduced kazakis and voudouris 2015 this represents the relative transit time from the surface to the saturated zone and this transit time is calculated by using the thickness of the vadose zone and the estimated hydraulic conductivity the concept of hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone has been used previously in modifications of the drastic method kazakis and voudouris 2015 jia et al 2019 after parameter optimization the original drastic model has become the drashcl model 3 5 data sampling and analysis before undertaking an assessment of the groundwater vulnerability field investigations and data collection were carried out in the study area in 2019 to determine the scope of the study area the layout of sampling points collection and preservation of samples were arranged per the national geological and mineral industry standards specification regional groundwater contamination investigation and evaluation dz t 0288 2015 mlr ministry of land and resources of the people s republic of china 2015 the sampling period was from june to september in the anomalously wet season of 2020 and the sampling horizon was shallow porous phreatic aquifers including 92 national monitoring wells provincial monitoring wells and civilian wells all the samples were sent to the laboratory of the institute of natural resources monitoring of henan province for chemical analysis all the groundwater vulnerability assessment data were obtained from different sources the details are listed in table 4 3 6 validation of groundwater vulnerability chemical parameters are often used to validate and verify the accuracy of the drastic model jamrah et al 2008 srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 in this study mg2 no 3 and cod were selected to verify the test results in the samples using the roc method the aim was to reveal the pollution status of groundwater in the study area the roc method was used to predict the accuracy of the classification model and the prediction system metz 1978 pham et al 2017 pham and prakash 2017 the area under the roc curve auc was used to measure the performance and compare the accuracy of the different frames torkashvand et al 2021a torkashvand et al 2021b the auc value is in the range 0 1 values closer to 1 indicate better the prediction accuracy in drawing the roc the x axis represents the false positive rate 1 specificity which indicates the rate of incorrectly classified instances and the y axis represents a false negative rate sensitivity indicating the rate of correctly classified instances the roc method is effective and can be used to verify the relationship between the groundwater vulnerability classification and the hydrochemical parameters of the samples mogaji and san lim 2017 kumar and krishna 2020 bera et al 2021 4 results and discussion 4 1 the original drastic model according to aller et al 1987 the thematic map grid basis of each parameter is divided and a rate is assigned which is then multiplied by the respective weight for each parameter fig 3 a g equation 1 is used to carry out the overlay calculation in arcgis and the groundwater vulnerability index map is drawn fig 4 according to the results it is easy to quantitatively judge the vulnerability area the lower the level the lower the pollution risk as given by the seven parameters the higher the index the higher the groundwater pollution potential using the natural interruption method the index is divided into five levels very low 55 78 low 78 95 medium 95 111 high 111 126 and very high 126 157 which cover 34 67 14 74 10 59 10 98 and 29 02 of the total area in the original drastic method the most vulnerable areas are mainly concentrated in the north of the study area indicating that these areas are most vulnerable to pollution the buried depth of groundwater is less than 9 m the soil medium is sandy and the lithology of the vadose zone is sandstone which has high net recharge conditions the lowest vulnerability level covers the largest area mainly in the northernmost edge and central area of the study area indicating that these regions are not vulnerable to pollution this may be because of the large buried depth of groundwater and lower rate of recharge which reduces the chance of aquifer pollution 4 2 the ahp drastic and ahp drashcl models in the improved ahp drastic the weights of the initial seven parameters are modified by the ahp method table 5 the consistency test indicates that ci value is less than 0 1 the final groundwater vulnerability calculated by eq 7 is shown in fig 5 the areas with high vulnerability according to ahp drastic are mainly concentrated in the northern and southwestern portions of the study area and the main determinant parameters are d and i low vulnerability areas are concentrated in the middle western portion of the domain the relative value of the vulnerability index does not represent the true degree of pollution but instead indicates which parts of the study area are more vulnerable to pollution gogu and dassargues 2000 fijani et al 2013 in the ahp drashcl the weights of the modified parameters are the same as those in the reference neshat et al 2015 jia et al 2019 and the thematic map is shown in fig 6 the weight values of the normalized parameters for ahp drashcl are listed in table 6 the results indicate that the most influential parameter was d and the least influential was s in the ahp drashcl results the area of medium and high vulnerability were concentrated in the middle and east of the study area fig 7 occupying 59 84 of the total area fig 8 compared with drastic and ahp drastic the areas with the highest vulnerability increased in size mainly in the northeast of the study area the reason for this is that the aquifer thickness has replaced the aquifer media and this parameter can be quantified the large thickness of the aquifer implies a large water storage capacity which serves to enchance the dilution of pollutants according to the modified data the degree of dispersion of the vulnerability level improves and the main influencing parameter is the l different l types have greater influences on water quality such that the groundwater vulnerability increases as a result of the discharge of pollutants such as domestic sewage industrial wastewater agricultural irrigation and fertilizers singh et al 2015 baghapour et al 2016 ouedraogo et al 2016 the two improved ahp drastic and ahp drashcl methods optimize the vulnerability index with respect to the parameter weights and quantitative parameters however it is not reasonable to apply the same weight to a parameter across the whole study area this aspect of the model needs to be improved 4 3 the vwm drashcl model the normalized values for the parameters are clustered into four variable weight intervals as described in table 7 through the analysis and debugging of various parameters in the study area the unit values satisfying the constraint conditions were selected finally for the study area the following values were obtained a1 4 84 a2 3 20 a3 0 56 and c 1 9 the state variable weight vectors constructed using the seven parameters are as follows 11 s j x e 4 84 d 1 x 1 9 1 0 x d 1 1 9 d 1 x d 2 e 3 20 x d 2 1 9 1 d 2 x d 3 e 0 56 x d 3 e 3 20 x d 2 1 9 1 d 3 x 1 where 0 d1 is the penalty interval d1 d2 is the weight invariant interval d2 d3 is the initial incentive interval and d3 1 is the strong incentive interval with a gradual increase in the independent variables the penalty value gradually decreases then transits to a constant value and then presents as an overall growth trend combined with the groundwater vulnerability index as the risk parameter data gradually improves the penalty of variable weight function vwf gradually decreases when the data changes to a certain extent the penalty of the vwf will be zero which equates to no penalty and no incentive when the data show that the groundwater pollution risk is sufficiently small the influence of the function on the weight acts as an the situation of initial and strong incentive which is rational fig 9 shows the groundwater vulnerability results calculated according to eq 10 the results for vwm drashcl illustrate that for the groundwater vulnerability assessment of the study area the vwm optimizes the parameter weights by punishment and incentive compared with the constant weight model the overall trend is similar and the degree of dispersion is more obvious wu et al 2016b liu et al 2018 in general regions in which d is small may be vulnerable to pollution but the actual situation depends on a combination of parameters such as the aquifer thickness the nature of the vadose zone and the nature and location on the ground which is the reason why the results are different from those of ahp drashcl khosravi et al 2018 given that the range of the incentive weight is larger than that of punishment the most vulnerable area increases in size mainly in the southwest and middle sections of the model the reason for this is that the punishment suppresses the low impact parameters of the groundwater associated with vulnerability and stimulates the high impact parameters 4 4 model validation validation using only one hydrochemical parameter of the samples is not considered to be an acceptable way to demonstrate the vulnerability of an aquifer because the level of an indicator may be affected by its exposure to several pollutants hamza et al 2015 more than one hydrochemical parameter should be used for verification purposes herlinger and viero 2007 moratalla et al 2011 hasan et al 2019 the drastic the ahp drastic the ahp drashcl and the vwm drashcl were verified and compared according to the water quality inspection results for 92 sampling points the roc method was used for verification and comparison the roc method has previously been effectively used to verify the reliability and prediction accuracy of a groundwater vulnerability model mogaji and san lim 2017 the correlation analysis results show that the modified model significantly improves the relationship between the vulnerability index and the relevant hydrochemical parameters fig 10 the auc values for the three water samples exhibit clear regularity with the vwm drashcl method giving the best correlation followed by the ahp drashcl method followed by the ahp drastic method the drastic method gives the smallest degree of correlation the auc for the improved parameters in the ahp method increases indicating improved performance for the optimized parameters in the study region compared with the drastic method the vwm drashcl produces a significant increase of 0 452 for no 3 and 0 184 for cod the necessity and superiority of modifying the drastic method are confirmed again by this result according to yesilnacar and topal 2005 the classification criteria are poor 0 5 0 6 average 0 6 0 7 good 0 7 0 8 very good 0 8 0 9 and excellent 0 9 1 see table 8 for details after optimizing the parameters and weights the performance of the model is enhanced the discretization is ensured and the correlation is increased most of the roc curves are basically above the diagonal and the auc is 0 5 1 which represents an above average percentage of the prediction value however in the drastic model no 3 0 334 and mg2 0 497 are below the diagonal the results of the existing data show that the correlation of the original method is poor that is the drastic method offers no statistical significance for the description of groundwater vulnerability and the description of aquifer vulnerability is poor these results show that the optimized parameter and the weighting approach are more effective and physically sound than the original method therefore the improved vwm may be used to assess the groundwater vulnerability of the aquifers in the study area more accurately 5 conclusions the improved drastic model further optimizes the groundwater vulnerability evaluation results by considering the state values and combined values of various parameters at different locations in the study area vmt was applied for weight optimization vwm overcomes the deficiency of using equal weights in the whole study area the improved model has a high degree of dispersion and more reasonable results which shows the impact of varying the weight of each parameter on the vulnerability value the validation results show that the auc values for the vulnerability index and the three hydrochemical parameters increase in the results for the drastic method ahp drastic method ahp drashcl method and vwm drashcl method in particular drastic gives the lowest auc values and vwm drashcl gives the highest these results indicate that the accuracy of the model can be increased by improving the parameters and by considering the quantitative parameters associated with aquifers and human activities additionally the vwm verification results show the accuracy and rationality of the groundwater vulnerability evaluation method based on vwt thus the proposed model can be used to formulate groundwater protection policies that are more in line with the actual situation in vulnerable areas effective engineering and non engineering measures should be implemented and regular groundwater quality monitoring should be carried out to prevent further increases in pollution in future work we propose to collect and test groundwater samples in different periods to obtain more data on the impact of hydrochemical parameters on groundwater vulnerability which may overcome some limitations of this study data availability statement data cannot be made publicly available readers should

3448,capturing the ecological effects of climate induced shifts in hydrologic and thermal regimes in regulated river systems remains a challenge in regional scale studies in this study we used a well established species distribution model to analyze the results of a process based hydrologic modeling approach that accounts explicitly for regulation impacts on river flow and temperatures we also accounted for the stream network fragmentation resulting from dam blockage this combined model framework can be used to predict historical environmental suitability of river reaches for specific fish species and estimate changes in suitability in response to changes in climate and reservoir operations as a case study in the highly regulated and fragmented tennessee river system we examined the environmental suitability for nonnative rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss a species of high recreational value and native blackfin darter etheostoma nigripinne an endemic species of unique ecological importance to quantify the impacts of reservoir regulation we examined the historical environmental suitability climate change signals and the environmental drivers of change between the regulated and unregulated model setups by the end of the 21st century 2080s historically suitable streams for rainbow trout will disappear due to higher river temperatures only 8 of historically suitable streams for blackfin darter will remain but over half of them will be unreachable by current populations due to dam blockage for river reaches influenced by reservoir regulations the regulated model projects decreasing environmental suitability for blackfin darter while the unregulated model projects the opposite because of higher river temperatures the contradictory climate signals between regulated and unregulated models highlight the necessity of considering reservoir regulation keywords climate change impacts reservoir regulation regulated river systems hydrologic modeling environmental suitability maxent model 1 introduction by modifying hydrology altering thermal regimes and fragmenting physical habitat dams and diversions are considered a global threat to freshwater biodiversity reid et al 2019 tickner et al 2020 as a global hotspot of freshwater biodiversity the southeastern us has lost large portions of suitable habitat for endemic fish species as a result of dam construction over the past century jenkins et al 2015 liermann et al 2012 for example deep water releases from stratified reservoirs can cause significant coldwater pollution for extended downstream distances olden and naiman 2010 leading to the displacement of endemic native fishes neves and angermeier 1990 these altered thermal regimes often favor populations of nonnative coldwater species such as rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss which have been introduced to support local economies through enhanced recreational opportunities brooks et al 2018 recent decades have witnessed unprecedented stream warming in many regions of the world isaak et al 2012 causing dramatic shifts in freshwater fish distributions comte and grenouillet 2013 freshwater fish species are also highly vulnerable to projected future climate change due to high intrinsic sensitivities to changes in thermal regimes and evidence for low past rates of evolution in thermal tolerances comte and olden 2017 projected higher river temperature may lead to significant reductions in the geographic ranges of coldwater fishes raising conservation concerns for trout in their native range bassar et al 2016 isaak and rieman 2013 ruesch et al 2012 in addition rising river temperatures can reduce the introduced range of coldwater fishes e g reservoir tailwaters where trout serves important cultural and economic purposes climate change is motivating humans to explore a different way to design and operate water infrastructures including reservoirs chadwick et al 2020 this has led to heightened calls to examine how reservoir management may modify the response of hydrologic and thermal regimes to climate change which may result in unexpected ecological impacts thermal stratification in large reservoirs can depress tailwater temperature by over 10 c which far exceeds the changes associated with climate change olden and naiman 2010 in the western u s cold reservoir releases from big reservoirs including dworshak reservoir shasta reservoir and ross reservoir have been managed to relieve the thermal stress for coldwater species mantua et al 2010b rheinheimer et al 2015 however thermal extremes i e high river temperature events will be more severe by the 2080s in the southeastern us and only a small fraction can be mitigated cheng et al 2020b we need better tools that explicitly account for the intertwined impacts of climate change and dam operations and that will allow us to investigate the ecological effects of climate induced shifts in hydrologic and thermal regimes in ecological studies the climate induced response of river temperatures in unregulated rivers has been estimated using statistical models and process based river temperature models lawrence et al 2014 mantua et al 2010a vancompernolle et al 2019 however quantifying climate induced signals in regulated river temperatures remains challenging because reservoir operations are not accounted for in most stream temperature models but can have a large effect on downstream temperatures chapra 1997 niemeyer et al 2018 even if reservoir effects are accounted for in statistical stream temperature models as in the norwest project which provides high resolution river temperature products for the western u s isaak et al 2018 rubenson and olden 2020 potential changes in reservoir dynamics under climate change are not explicitly represented in this study we demonstrate the use of a process based model chain that includes hydrologic water management and stream temperature models cheng et al 2020a to account explicitly for the flow and thermal effects of regulation including seasonal thermal stratification in managed reservoirs we integrate this model chain with a well established species distribution model sdm to quantify the projected changes in environmental suitability as a result of modified flow and thermal regimes due to damming and climate change cheng et al 2020a phillips et al 2006 the contribution of this study lies in our evaluation of the need to include the effects of water management on streamflow and stream temperature when applying sdms in highly regulated river systems biological predictors e g food availability and community interactions are not specifically considered in this study we use two fish species as exemplars of the range of distributional responses expected blackfin darter etheostoma nigripinne an endemic species with irreplaceable ecological importance and rainbow trout a nonnative species with high recreational and economic value as a native species in the southeast blackfin darter favors warm water while rainbow trout thrives in cold water with a lethal temperature of 25 c matthews and berg 1997 we anticipated that the projected higher river temperature might facilitate the expansion of blackfin darter while dams could prevent them from migrating to newly suitable habitat rainbow trout might not be able to tolerate the higher stream temperatures under climate change but reservoirs cold releases could help relieve the thermal stress 2 methods the tennessee river basin trb a hotspot of freshwater fish endemism jenkins et al 2015 is a highly regulated river system with 36 major dams that are primarily operated by the tennessee valley authority fig 1 a nine dams in the tennessee river impound extensive reservoirs covering most of the tennessee river mainstem reservoirs are masked in black in fig 1a for this reason we excluded most of the tennessee river mainstem from this study blackfin darter is endemic to the eastern united states in our study domain it mostly inhabits stream reaches in the lower tennessee river basin rainbow trout is native to the western united states and was introduced throughout north america it inhabits headwater reaches in the appalachians as well as reservoir tailwaters throughout the trb fig 1a 2 1 data sources surface meteorological data was collated to force the process based model chain and simulate river flow and temperatures for the historical period 1980 2009 we used gridmet abatzoglou 2013 a gridded meteorology dataset for the future period 2070 2099 referred to as 2080s we used downscaled meteorology data from 20 global climate models gcm table s1 with s indicating material in the supplemental materials based on a high emission scenario rcp 8 5 from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 downscaled using the multivariate constructed analogue method maca abatzoglou and brown 2012 species distribution models were trained using fish locality data for rainbow trout tennessee wildlife resources agency 2020 and for blackfin darters from a list of agencies table s2 accessed through the fishnet2 portal www fishnet2 org 2020 02 07 the fish locality data were collected from 1950 to 2018 mostly overlapping with the historical period in this study 2 2 statistical analysis we used the output from a process based model chain to represent the hydrologic and thermal conditions in the complex river reservoir system in the trb fig 2 cheng et al 2020a this model chain comprises three physically based models 1 a large scale spatially distributed hydrologic model variable infiltration capacity model or vic liang et al 1994 hamman et al 2018 2 a river routing model model for scale adaptive river transport or mosart li et al 2013 coupled with a water management model wm voisin et al 2013 and 3 a stream temperature model river basin model or rbm yearsley 2012 coupled with a two layer reservoir thermal stratification module 2l niemeyer et al 2018 wm estimates daily reservoir storage and reservoir releases based on operating rule curves which specify monthly storage targets these rule curves were calculated by cheng et al 2020a based on historical reservoir storage data from the tennessee valley authority tennessee valley authority 2012 2016 we assumed that the operating rule curves remain the same under climate change even with fixed rule curves reservoir outflow will still show interannual variability because of changes in inflow to better capture reservoir impacts on downstream temperature we used reservoir operation data and other relevant information to determine whether a reservoir releases from the surface layer epilimnion or bottom layer hypolimnion table s3 we refer the reader to cheng et al 2020a 2020b for more details concerning reservoir dynamics and changes in streamflow and temperatures this model framework was configured based on a 1 8 gridded river network 12 km and resulted in daily river flow and temperature time series for each 1 8 grid cell the output was mapped to a 400 m grid which was used to configure the species distribution model see panel s1 for details mapped river flow and temperature simulations were evaluated using usgs observations with 177 gauges with flow observations and 14 gauges with river temperature observations see panel s1 2 for details in addition we refer the readers to cheng et al 2020a for a more extensive evaluation of the flow and temperature simulations for the southeastern united states including trb we used the maximum entropy maxent species distribution model to calculate the environmental suitability p for a given species over a defined region using fish presence data with environmental predictors phillips et al 2006 eight streamflow predictors 8 stream temperature predictors and 3 time invariant predictors were selected as candidates to train the maxent model fig 2 table 1 the selection of the candidate predictors is based upon earlier studies fausch et al 2001 vancompernolle et al 2019 wenger et al 2011 and we categorized all predictors into three groups i e descriptors of mean states variability and extremes the reason for selecting each predictor is shown in table 1 historical and future river flow and temperature predictors were calculated using the historical 30 year time series 1980 2009 and the future 30 year time series 2070 2099 respectively to train a parsimonious model for each fish species we used the variance inflation factor analysis to remove predictors with high collinearity and conducted forward stepwise predictor selection fig 2 details of the maxent setup and evaluation can be found in supplemental panel s1 to explicitly quantify the ecological impacts of reservoir regulation we trained a maxent model using the unregulated flow and temperature fig 3 and referred to it as the unregulated model to simulate flow and temperature in the absence of regulation we turned off the water management model and thermal stratification model compare the left hand panels in fig 3 and fig 2 that is for the unregulated case we used mosart instead of mosart wm to route river flows and we used rbm instead of rbm 2l to simulate stream temperature note that the river system is modeled in its entirety for both the regulated and unregulated scenarios resulting in two sets of model results regulated and unregulated for all stream reaches including for stream reaches not affected by regulation because the regulation impact on river temperatures gradually dissipates as rivers flow downstream cheng et al 2020a we focused our analysis on river segments that are influenced by reservoirs we assumed that the river segment is influenced by reservoir regulations if regulation leads to a difference in mean summer temperature larger than 1 c compared to the unregulated case cheng et al 2020a thirteen percent of all 400 m grid cells in our study domain are influenced by regulation five percent of observed blackfin darter localities and 13 of rainbow trout localities are influenced by reservoirs a pixel i e a 400 m grid cell was categorized as a suitable river segment when its environmental suitability exceeded a threshold equal to the value that excludes the 10 percent of localities with the lowest predicted values p 10 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 this metric is more stable and relatively insensitive to outliers compared to the commonly employed lowest presence threshold radosavljevic and anderson 2014 by the 2080s only pixels for which the probability of presence exceeded the p 10 threshold for at least 16 out of all 20 gcms were classified as suitable we adopted the 80 model agreement 16 out of 20 from kjellström et al 2017 we determined for each pixel the predictor that contributed the most to changes in environmental suitability the maxent model provided the relative contribution of each environmental predictor to fish presence probability permutation importance for the historic period but does not tell us which predictor contributed most to a change in this probability we introduced the shapley decomposition to determine the main environmental driver of changes in environmental suitability roth 1988 we adapted the shapley decomposition to quantify the contribution of each time variant predictor φ γ to the projected changes in fish presence probability δ p with subscript γ representing the time variant predictors ang et al 2003 we kept the time invariant predictors constant under climate change so their contribution to δ p is zero this technique provides a decomposition without residuals i e 1 p t f γ t λ 2 δ p p 2080 s p hist 3 δ p γ φ γ where p denotes presence probability f denotes the trained maxent model for one fish species subscript t denotes time periods t hist 2080s denoting the historical 1980 2009 and future periods 2080 2099 respectively γ t denotes the list of all time variant predictors for period t λ denotes the list of all time invariant predictors which remain static under climate change and φ γ denotes the unique contribution of time variant predictors γ for the selected species the predictor with the largest absolute φ γ value is defined as the primary driver of changes in environmental suitability under climate change which is calculated for every pixel more details can be found in panel s2 while the modeling techniques capture the dam impacts on fish redistribution via modified river flow and thermal regimes they do not account for the physical blockage of fish passages therefore we evaluated the accessibility of fish habitat to address the impacts of dam blockage we fragmented the river network at dam locations as shown in fig 1b fish are only able to migrate within each colored subregion for each fish species we defined a subregion accessible based on historical fish localities that is if a fish species exists anywhere within a given subregion then that entire subregion will be marked as accessible 3 results 3 1 regulation affected historical environmental suitability due to changes in flow and thermal regimes reservoir regulation affected river flow and thermal regimes and further influenced environmental suitability when constructing the maxent models different predictors were selected for the regulated and unregulated maxent models even though we followed the identical workflow fig 3 the regulated maxent model used fewer predictors than the unregulated models for both blackfin darter and rainbow trout in addition for observed fish localities influenced by reservoir regulations simulated environmental suitability in the regulated maxent model was higher than that in the unregulated model in the reservoir influenced localities the mean environmental suitability for blackfin darters was 0 43 and 0 31 and the mean environmental suitability for rainbow trout was 0 33 and 0 29 for the regulated blue and unregulated green maxent models respectively fig 4 a and 4c the environmental suitability threshold p 10 for blackfin darters was 0 31 and 0 29 for the regulated and unregulated maxent models respectively for rainbow trout it was 0 23 and 0 26 respectively for reservoir influenced localities 67 and 38 of blackfin darter localities were categorized as suitable habitat for regulated and unregulated maxent models respectively for rainbow trout these numbers were 71 and 68 by necessity we used the same fish locality data to train both the regulated and unregulated maxent models the regulated maxent model slightly outperforms the unregulated model likely because the training data reflects the real world conditions in which regulation occurs for reservoir influenced stream reaches the flow and thermal predictors used in the unregulated model are not consistent with the real world flow and thermal regimes that are subject to reservoir regulations therefore the model performance differences reveal the necessity to include reservoir operations in species distribution models for regulated river systems for the localities minimally impacted by reservoirs both maxent models perform equally well for sites that are not affected by regulations the mean environmental suitability for blackfin darters was 0 51 and 0 50 for the regulated blue and unregulated green maxent models respectively fig 4b and 4d for rainbow trout the mean environmental suitability was 0 59 and 0 61 respectively 3 2 climate change impacts on environmental suitability in the regulated river systems climate change will modify the environmental suitability of river reaches and existing dams will prevent fish from reaching the newly suitable habitat the environmental suitability for blackfin darter will greatly decrease in the lower trb where 92 of historically suitable streams will disappear as shown by the red pixels in fig 5 a in the upper trb the environmental suitability will increase especially in the clinch river and powell river navy blue pixels in fig 5a however the existing dams will prevent blackfin darter from swimming upstream and reaching their projected suitable habitat as a result 8 of all stream segments will be suitable but only 45 of these can be accessible from current stream segments where blackfin darters are present rainbow trout will face an even larger threat under climate change the models project that historically suitable streams including most southern appalachian streams will completely disappear for rainbow trout red pixels in fig 5b even at reservoir tailwaters where cold reservoir releases currently provide suitable conditions no stream segments that are currently unsuitable will become environmentally suitable by the 2080s the primary driver of decreasing environmental suitability is flow related for blackfin darter and temperature related for rainbow trout for subregions with a net gain or net loss of environmentally suitable streams we determined the primary drivers of all corresponding river segments and took their mode as the sub regional primary driver for blackfin darter higher spring and summer flow variability leads to the shrinkage of environmentally suitable streams in the lower trb while a decreasing number of low temperature days contributes to the increased suitability in the upper trb by the 2080s especially in the clinch river and powell river an unhatched pink region in the southeastern corner in fig 6 a for rainbow trout the decreased suitability primarily results from an increase in the number of high temperature days and a decrease in the number of low temperature days fig 6b the primary drivers of change are different for reservoir tailwaters than for nearby unregulated river systems as an example we highlighted the duck river system in fig 6c which includes normandy dam colored dots denoted the different primary drivers of the change in environmental suitability at locations where fish presence was observed in the nearby unregulated rivers projected higher spring and summer flow variability primarily leads to worse environmental suitability for blackfin darter however immediate downstream of the normandy dam the primary driver for change in environmental suitability for blackfin darter is the number of low temperature days further downstream from normandy dam regulation impacts gradually dissipate and the primary driver becomes flow related as in nearby unregulated stream segments the primary drivers of decreasing environmental suitability for rainbow trout vary among different reservoirs as shown in fig 6d the primary driver at tailwaters of normandy dam apalachia dam and cherokee dam is the decreasing number of low temperature days at the tailwaters of fontana dam watauga dam and south holston dam it is the increasing number of high river temperature days at tailwaters of tims ford dam norris dam boone dam it is the higher interannual variability of mean annual flow 3 3 reservoir regulation will affect the ecological response to climate change environmental suitability showed a different response to climate change in reservoir influenced river segments between the regulated and unregulated maxent models fig 7 a and 7b showed the distribution of environmental suitability as probability density functions pdfs for all river segments influenced by regulations we quantified the climate change signals via the distance between the historical mean environmental suitability green and blue horizontal lines and median value of the future mean environmental suitability across all 20 gcms by the 2080s dark green and dark blue horizontal lines for blackfin darter the mean environmental suitability is projected to increase from 0 07 to 0 15 by the 2080s in the unregulated model setup left side while it is projected to decrease from 0 12 to 0 10 in the regulated model setup right side for rainbow trout mean environmental suitability is projected to decrease from 0 06 to 0 in the unregulated model setup and projected to decrease from 0 07 to 0 01 by the 2080s in the regulated model setup reservoir regulation changes the primary environmental drivers for changes in the suitability of river segments in the regulated model setup the decreasing environmental suitability at the tailwater of normandy dam primarily results from a decreasing number of low temperature days different than nearby unregulated rivers fig 6c however this difference does not exist in the unregulated model setup figure s3 in addition the primary drivers of decreasing environmental suitability for rainbow trout vary greatly between the regulated and unregulated model setups the lower right table in fig 8 showed the primary drivers of changes at reservoir tailwaters for both regulated and unregulated model setups seven out of 9 tailwater locations showed different primary drivers 4 discussion dams and reservoirs modify downstream hydrologic and thermal responses to climate change cheng et al 2020a 2020b and result in habitat fragmentation but the impacts of these processes on species habitat suitability are rarely considered in combination because of the large effects of dams on river temperature and flow the ecological responses at reservoir tailwaters are different than in nearby unregulated river segments for example reservoir regulation alters the primary environmental driver of environmental suitability for blackfin darter at the tailwaters downstream of normandy dam the primary driver changes from the increasing spring and summer flow variability nearby unregulated river segments to the decreasing number of low temperature days regulated tailwaters however the ecological impacts of reservoir regulations are spatially constrained and dissipate as rivers flow downstream this is consistent with dams dissipating impacts on hydrologic and thermal regimes because surface hydrology and energy fluxes become increasingly important as rivers flow farther away from dams cheng et al 2020a reservoir regulation influences blackfin darter and rainbow trout distribution in different ways for blackfin darter the impact of dams is predominantly through river fragmentation under climate change increased flow variability during the spring and summer months flow cv ss in table 1 will potentially decrease the spawning rate and juvenile survival rate for blackfin darter shea et al 2015 since dams impacts on flow and thermal regimes are spatially constrained the climate driven changes primarily contribute to the regional signal of environmental suitability changes for blackfin darter however the blackfin darter cannot relocate to environmentally suitable streams under climate change because of dam induced river fragmentation even though the projected suitable range is smaller than the historical suitable range this finding aligns with the existing literature on the effects of dam blockage on migratory fish couto et al 2021 olden and naiman 2010 however for rainbow trout environmental suitability is greatly affected by dam induced changes in flow and thermal regimes rainbow trout an exotic cold water species that benefits from cold hypolimnetic releases will suffer from excessive heat under climate change even though the reservoir thermal stratification will persist by the 2080s and the dam releases remain colder than nearby unregulated rivers cheng et al 2020a the outflow will not be cold enough to accommodate rainbow trout decreasing environmental suitability driven by higher river temperatures is consistent with earlier studies bassar et al 2016 rubenson and olden 2020 in regional fish studies failing to consider reservoir regulation can misidentify the responses to climate change the bias mostly occurs in reaches that are influenced by reservoir regulations because the impacts dissipate as rivers flow downstream in this study the regulated and unregulated model setups show discrepancies in predictor selection historical environmental suitability responses to climate change and primary environmental drivers of these responses generally the regulated model used fewer predictors while predicting higher environmental suitability for observed fish localities than the unregulated model in addition the regulated and unregulated models show contradictory climate signals for blackfin darter in reservoir influenced rivers although both models predict decreasing suitability for rainbow trout the regulated models still predict higher than zero suitability by the 2080s because of reservoirs cooling outflow furthermore distinct primary drivers for rainbow trout at reservoir tailwaters probably result from the discrepancies in maxent models i e predictor selection and projected changes in flow and temperatures early studies assessed the contribution of environmental predictors in climate change signals by their corresponding permutation importance vancompernolle et al 2019 this metric evaluates the dependence of the final maxent model on the selected predictor for one predictor its permutation importance is higher when replacing the predictor with random values leads to worse model performance we found that predictors with high permutation importance did not necessarily have large contributions to climate induced changes in environmental suitability for example the number of low temperature days has the highest permutation importance for blackfin darter while the primary driver of decreasing environmental suitability in the lower trb is the projected higher spring and summer flow variability the permutation importance is only based on historical environmental predictors and does not account for climate induced changes therefore we would recommend that future climate impact studies use the shapley decomposition which synthesizes both permutation importance as well as climate induced changes of environmental predictors a loss of habitat for rainbow trout is consistent with earlier studies bassar et al 2016 mantua et al 2010b but our projected complete disappearance of suitable habitat may result in part because our modeling methodology ignores small headwater streams the shading impacts of riparian vegetation and a lack of biological variables small headwaters that are strongly influenced by cold groundwater might provide cold sanctuaries for rainbow trout under climate change mantua et al 2010b lawrence et al 2014 and yearsley et al 2019 showed that restoration of riparian vegetation can reduce solar radiation and mitigate the climate change impact on river temperatures especially along smaller streams without accounting for this impact we may be overestimating stream temperatures in southern appalachian streams which are covered by forest and underestimating their environmental suitability for blackfin darter and rainbow trout under climate change in addition this study ignores biological variables e g food availability and community interactions which affect the distribution of these species 5 conclusions this study for the first time assessed the ecological effects of climate induced shifts in hydrologic and thermal regimes that explicitly consider reservoir dynamics these combined interactions provide new insights into expected future fish distributions in the trb reservoirs modify the ecological responses at tailwaters by altering their flow and thermal regimes as a result the primary driver for changing environmental suitability under climate change at reservoir tailwaters are different than nearby unregulated river systems this impact also gradually dissipates as rivers flow downstream in addition reservoir regulation influences rainbow trout and blackfin darter in different ways rainbow trout s environmental suitability is largely affected by dam induced changes in flow and thermal regimes primary drivers for decreasing environmental suitability at tailwaters vary among different reservoirs but are mostly temperature related historically suitable streams for rainbow trout will disappear due to higher river temperatures by the 2080s likewise for blackfin darter only 8 of historically suitable will remain and over half of the stream segments that are projected to be suitable will be inaccessible due to blockage by dams similar dilemmas may be encountered by other endemic species with limited spatial coverage to explicitly quantify the impacts of regulation we conducted an experiment to compare the regulated and unregulated model setups generally regulated models use fewer predictors while predicting higher environmental suitability for observed fish localities than the unregulated models for blackfin darter contradictory climate signals between regulated and unregulated models highlight the necessity of considering reservoir regulation finally we recommend the use of the shapley decomposition to determine the dominant change

3448,capturing the ecological effects of climate induced shifts in hydrologic and thermal regimes in regulated river systems remains a challenge in regional scale studies in this study we used a well established species distribution model to analyze the results of a process based hydrologic modeling approach that accounts explicitly for regulation impacts on river flow and temperatures we also accounted for the stream network fragmentation resulting from dam blockage this combined model framework can be used to predict historical environmental suitability of river reaches for specific fish species and estimate changes in suitability in response to changes in climate and reservoir operations as a case study in the highly regulated and fragmented tennessee river system we examined the environmental suitability for nonnative rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss a species of high recreational value and native blackfin darter etheostoma nigripinne an endemic species of unique ecological importance to quantify the impacts of reservoir regulation we examined the historical environmental suitability climate change signals and the environmental drivers of change between the regulated and unregulated model setups by the end of the 21st century 2080s historically suitable streams for rainbow trout will disappear due to higher river temperatures only 8 of historically suitable streams for blackfin darter will remain but over half of them will be unreachable by current populations due to dam blockage for river reaches influenced by reservoir regulations the regulated model projects decreasing environmental suitability for blackfin darter while the unregulated model projects the opposite because of higher river temperatures the contradictory climate signals between regulated and unregulated models highlight the necessity of considering reservoir regulation keywords climate change impacts reservoir regulation regulated river systems hydrologic modeling environmental suitability maxent model 1 introduction by modifying hydrology altering thermal regimes and fragmenting physical habitat dams and diversions are considered a global threat to freshwater biodiversity reid et al 2019 tickner et al 2020 as a global hotspot of freshwater biodiversity the southeastern us has lost large portions of suitable habitat for endemic fish species as a result of dam construction over the past century jenkins et al 2015 liermann et al 2012 for example deep water releases from stratified reservoirs can cause significant coldwater pollution for extended downstream distances olden and naiman 2010 leading to the displacement of endemic native fishes neves and angermeier 1990 these altered thermal regimes often favor populations of nonnative coldwater species such as rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss which have been introduced to support local economies through enhanced recreational opportunities brooks et al 2018 recent decades have witnessed unprecedented stream warming in many regions of the world isaak et al 2012 causing dramatic shifts in freshwater fish distributions comte and grenouillet 2013 freshwater fish species are also highly vulnerable to projected future climate change due to high intrinsic sensitivities to changes in thermal regimes and evidence for low past rates of evolution in thermal tolerances comte and olden 2017 projected higher river temperature may lead to significant reductions in the geographic ranges of coldwater fishes raising conservation concerns for trout in their native range bassar et al 2016 isaak and rieman 2013 ruesch et al 2012 in addition rising river temperatures can reduce the introduced range of coldwater fishes e g reservoir tailwaters where trout serves important cultural and economic purposes climate change is motivating humans to explore a different way to design and operate water infrastructures including reservoirs chadwick et al 2020 this has led to heightened calls to examine how reservoir management may modify the response of hydrologic and thermal regimes to climate change which may result in unexpected ecological impacts thermal stratification in large reservoirs can depress tailwater temperature by over 10 c which far exceeds the changes associated with climate change olden and naiman 2010 in the western u s cold reservoir releases from big reservoirs including dworshak reservoir shasta reservoir and ross reservoir have been managed to relieve the thermal stress for coldwater species mantua et al 2010b rheinheimer et al 2015 however thermal extremes i e high river temperature events will be more severe by the 2080s in the southeastern us and only a small fraction can be mitigated cheng et al 2020b we need better tools that explicitly account for the intertwined impacts of climate change and dam operations and that will allow us to investigate the ecological effects of climate induced shifts in hydrologic and thermal regimes in ecological studies the climate induced response of river temperatures in unregulated rivers has been estimated using statistical models and process based river temperature models lawrence et al 2014 mantua et al 2010a vancompernolle et al 2019 however quantifying climate induced signals in regulated river temperatures remains challenging because reservoir operations are not accounted for in most stream temperature models but can have a large effect on downstream temperatures chapra 1997 niemeyer et al 2018 even if reservoir effects are accounted for in statistical stream temperature models as in the norwest project which provides high resolution river temperature products for the western u s isaak et al 2018 rubenson and olden 2020 potential changes in reservoir dynamics under climate change are not explicitly represented in this study we demonstrate the use of a process based model chain that includes hydrologic water management and stream temperature models cheng et al 2020a to account explicitly for the flow and thermal effects of regulation including seasonal thermal stratification in managed reservoirs we integrate this model chain with a well established species distribution model sdm to quantify the projected changes in environmental suitability as a result of modified flow and thermal regimes due to damming and climate change cheng et al 2020a phillips et al 2006 the contribution of this study lies in our evaluation of the need to include the effects of water management on streamflow and stream temperature when applying sdms in highly regulated river systems biological predictors e g food availability and community interactions are not specifically considered in this study we use two fish species as exemplars of the range of distributional responses expected blackfin darter etheostoma nigripinne an endemic species with irreplaceable ecological importance and rainbow trout a nonnative species with high recreational and economic value as a native species in the southeast blackfin darter favors warm water while rainbow trout thrives in cold water with a lethal temperature of 25 c matthews and berg 1997 we anticipated that the projected higher river temperature might facilitate the expansion of blackfin darter while dams could prevent them from migrating to newly suitable habitat rainbow trout might not be able to tolerate the higher stream temperatures under climate change but reservoirs cold releases could help relieve the thermal stress 2 methods the tennessee river basin trb a hotspot of freshwater fish endemism jenkins et al 2015 is a highly regulated river system with 36 major dams that are primarily operated by the tennessee valley authority fig 1 a nine dams in the tennessee river impound extensive reservoirs covering most of the tennessee river mainstem reservoirs are masked in black in fig 1a for this reason we excluded most of the tennessee river mainstem from this study blackfin darter is endemic to the eastern united states in our study domain it mostly inhabits stream reaches in the lower tennessee river basin rainbow trout is native to the western united states and was introduced throughout north america it inhabits headwater reaches in the appalachians as well as reservoir tailwaters throughout the trb fig 1a 2 1 data sources surface meteorological data was collated to force the process based model chain and simulate river flow and temperatures for the historical period 1980 2009 we used gridmet abatzoglou 2013 a gridded meteorology dataset for the future period 2070 2099 referred to as 2080s we used downscaled meteorology data from 20 global climate models gcm table s1 with s indicating material in the supplemental materials based on a high emission scenario rcp 8 5 from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 downscaled using the multivariate constructed analogue method maca abatzoglou and brown 2012 species distribution models were trained using fish locality data for rainbow trout tennessee wildlife resources agency 2020 and for blackfin darters from a list of agencies table s2 accessed through the fishnet2 portal www fishnet2 org 2020 02 07 the fish locality data were collected from 1950 to 2018 mostly overlapping with the historical period in this study 2 2 statistical analysis we used the output from a process based model chain to represent the hydrologic and thermal conditions in the complex river reservoir system in the trb fig 2 cheng et al 2020a this model chain comprises three physically based models 1 a large scale spatially distributed hydrologic model variable infiltration capacity model or vic liang et al 1994 hamman et al 2018 2 a river routing model model for scale adaptive river transport or mosart li et al 2013 coupled with a water management model wm voisin et al 2013 and 3 a stream temperature model river basin model or rbm yearsley 2012 coupled with a two layer reservoir thermal stratification module 2l niemeyer et al 2018 wm estimates daily reservoir storage and reservoir releases based on operating rule curves which specify monthly storage targets these rule curves were calculated by cheng et al 2020a based on historical reservoir storage data from the tennessee valley authority tennessee valley authority 2012 2016 we assumed that the operating rule curves remain the same under climate change even with fixed rule curves reservoir outflow will still show interannual variability because of changes in inflow to better capture reservoir impacts on downstream temperature we used reservoir operation data and other relevant information to determine whether a reservoir releases from the surface layer epilimnion or bottom layer hypolimnion table s3 we refer the reader to cheng et al 2020a 2020b for more details concerning reservoir dynamics and changes in streamflow and temperatures this model framework was configured based on a 1 8 gridded river network 12 km and resulted in daily river flow and temperature time series for each 1 8 grid cell the output was mapped to a 400 m grid which was used to configure the species distribution model see panel s1 for details mapped river flow and temperature simulations were evaluated using usgs observations with 177 gauges with flow observations and 14 gauges with river temperature observations see panel s1 2 for details in addition we refer the readers to cheng et al 2020a for a more extensive evaluation of the flow and temperature simulations for the southeastern united states including trb we used the maximum entropy maxent species distribution model to calculate the environmental suitability p for a given species over a defined region using fish presence data with environmental predictors phillips et al 2006 eight streamflow predictors 8 stream temperature predictors and 3 time invariant predictors were selected as candidates to train the maxent model fig 2 table 1 the selection of the candidate predictors is based upon earlier studies fausch et al 2001 vancompernolle et al 2019 wenger et al 2011 and we categorized all predictors into three groups i e descriptors of mean states variability and extremes the reason for selecting each predictor is shown in table 1 historical and future river flow and temperature predictors were calculated using the historical 30 year time series 1980 2009 and the future 30 year time series 2070 2099 respectively to train a parsimonious model for each fish species we used the variance inflation factor analysis to remove predictors with high collinearity and conducted forward stepwise predictor selection fig 2 details of the maxent setup and evaluation can be found in supplemental panel s1 to explicitly quantify the ecological impacts of reservoir regulation we trained a maxent model using the unregulated flow and temperature fig 3 and referred to it as the unregulated model to simulate flow and temperature in the absence of regulation we turned off the water management model and thermal stratification model compare the left hand panels in fig 3 and fig 2 that is for the unregulated case we used mosart instead of mosart wm to route river flows and we used rbm instead of rbm 2l to simulate stream temperature note that the river system is modeled in its entirety for both the regulated and unregulated scenarios resulting in two sets of model results regulated and unregulated for all stream reaches including for stream reaches not affected by regulation because the regulation impact on river temperatures gradually dissipates as rivers flow downstream cheng et al 2020a we focused our analysis on river segments that are influenced by reservoirs we assumed that the river segment is influenced by reservoir regulations if regulation leads to a difference in mean summer temperature larger than 1 c compared to the unregulated case cheng et al 2020a thirteen percent of all 400 m grid cells in our study domain are influenced by regulation five percent of observed blackfin darter localities and 13 of rainbow trout localities are influenced by reservoirs a pixel i e a 400 m grid cell was categorized as a suitable river segment when its environmental suitability exceeded a threshold equal to the value that excludes the 10 percent of localities with the lowest predicted values p 10 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 this metric is more stable and relatively insensitive to outliers compared to the commonly employed lowest presence threshold radosavljevic and anderson 2014 by the 2080s only pixels for which the probability of presence exceeded the p 10 threshold for at least 16 out of all 20 gcms were classified as suitable we adopted the 80 model agreement 16 out of 20 from kjellström et al 2017 we determined for each pixel the predictor that contributed the most to changes in environmental suitability the maxent model provided the relative contribution of each environmental predictor to fish presence probability permutation importance for the historic period but does not tell us which predictor contributed most to a change in this probability we introduced the shapley decomposition to determine the main environmental driver of changes in environmental suitability roth 1988 we adapted the shapley decomposition to quantify the contribution of each time variant predictor φ γ to the projected changes in fish presence probability δ p with subscript γ representing the time variant predictors ang et al 2003 we kept the time invariant predictors constant under climate change so their contribution to δ p is zero this technique provides a decomposition without residuals i e 1 p t f γ t λ 2 δ p p 2080 s p hist 3 δ p γ φ γ where p denotes presence probability f denotes the trained maxent model for one fish species subscript t denotes time periods t hist 2080s denoting the historical 1980 2009 and future periods 2080 2099 respectively γ t denotes the list of all time variant predictors for period t λ denotes the list of all time invariant predictors which remain static under climate change and φ γ denotes the unique contribution of time variant predictors γ for the selected species the predictor with the largest absolute φ γ value is defined as the primary driver of changes in environmental suitability under climate change which is calculated for every pixel more details can be found in panel s2 while the modeling techniques capture the dam impacts on fish redistribution via modified river flow and thermal regimes they do not account for the physical blockage of fish passages therefore we evaluated the accessibility of fish habitat to address the impacts of dam blockage we fragmented the river network at dam locations as shown in fig 1b fish are only able to migrate within each colored subregion for each fish species we defined a subregion accessible based on historical fish localities that is if a fish species exists anywhere within a given subregion then that entire subregion will be marked as accessible 3 results 3 1 regulation affected historical environmental suitability due to changes in flow and thermal regimes reservoir regulation affected river flow and thermal regimes and further influenced environmental suitability when constructing the maxent models different predictors were selected for the regulated and unregulated maxent models even though we followed the identical workflow fig 3 the regulated maxent model used fewer predictors than the unregulated models for both blackfin darter and rainbow trout in addition for observed fish localities influenced by reservoir regulations simulated environmental suitability in the regulated maxent model was higher than that in the unregulated model in the reservoir influenced localities the mean environmental suitability for blackfin darters was 0 43 and 0 31 and the mean environmental suitability for rainbow trout was 0 33 and 0 29 for the regulated blue and unregulated green maxent models respectively fig 4 a and 4c the environmental suitability threshold p 10 for blackfin darters was 0 31 and 0 29 for the regulated and unregulated maxent models respectively for rainbow trout it was 0 23 and 0 26 respectively for reservoir influenced localities 67 and 38 of blackfin darter localities were categorized as suitable habitat for regulated and unregulated maxent models respectively for rainbow trout these numbers were 71 and 68 by necessity we used the same fish locality data to train both the regulated and unregulated maxent models the regulated maxent model slightly outperforms the unregulated model likely because the training data reflects the real world conditions in which regulation occurs for reservoir influenced stream reaches the flow and thermal predictors used in the unregulated model are not consistent with the real world flow and thermal regimes that are subject to reservoir regulations therefore the model performance differences reveal the necessity to include reservoir operations in species distribution models for regulated river systems for the localities minimally impacted by reservoirs both maxent models perform equally well for sites that are not affected by regulations the mean environmental suitability for blackfin darters was 0 51 and 0 50 for the regulated blue and unregulated green maxent models respectively fig 4b and 4d for rainbow trout the mean environmental suitability was 0 59 and 0 61 respectively 3 2 climate change impacts on environmental suitability in the regulated river systems climate change will modify the environmental suitability of river reaches and existing dams will prevent fish from reaching the newly suitable habitat the environmental suitability for blackfin darter will greatly decrease in the lower trb where 92 of historically suitable streams will disappear as shown by the red pixels in fig 5 a in the upper trb the environmental suitability will increase especially in the clinch river and powell river navy blue pixels in fig 5a however the existing dams will prevent blackfin darter from swimming upstream and reaching their projected suitable habitat as a result 8 of all stream segments will be suitable but only 45 of these can be accessible from current stream segments where blackfin darters are present rainbow trout will face an even larger threat under climate change the models project that historically suitable streams including most southern appalachian streams will completely disappear for rainbow trout red pixels in fig 5b even at reservoir tailwaters where cold reservoir releases currently provide suitable conditions no stream segments that are currently unsuitable will become environmentally suitable by the 2080s the primary driver of decreasing environmental suitability is flow related for blackfin darter and temperature related for rainbow trout for subregions with a net gain or net loss of environmentally suitable streams we determined the primary drivers of all corresponding river segments and took their mode as the sub regional primary driver for blackfin darter higher spring and summer flow variability leads to the shrinkage of environmentally suitable streams in the lower trb while a decreasing number of low temperature days contributes to the increased suitability in the upper trb by the 2080s especially in the clinch river and powell river an unhatched pink region in the southeastern corner in fig 6 a for rainbow trout the decreased suitability primarily results from an increase in the number of high temperature days and a decrease in the number of low temperature days fig 6b the primary drivers of change are different for reservoir tailwaters than for nearby unregulated river systems as an example we highlighted the duck river system in fig 6c which includes normandy dam colored dots denoted the different primary drivers of the change in environmental suitability at locations where fish presence was observed in the nearby unregulated rivers projected higher spring and summer flow variability primarily leads to worse environmental suitability for blackfin darter however immediate downstream of the normandy dam the primary driver for change in environmental suitability for blackfin darter is the number of low temperature days further downstream from normandy dam regulation impacts gradually dissipate and the primary driver becomes flow related as in nearby unregulated stream segments the primary drivers of decreasing environmental suitability for rainbow trout vary among different reservoirs as shown in fig 6d the primary driver at tailwaters of normandy dam apalachia dam and cherokee dam is the decreasing number of low temperature days at the tailwaters of fontana dam watauga dam and south holston dam it is the increasing number of high river temperature days at tailwaters of tims ford dam norris dam boone dam it is the higher interannual variability of mean annual flow 3 3 reservoir regulation will affect the ecological response to climate change environmental suitability showed a different response to climate change in reservoir influenced river segments between the regulated and unregulated maxent models fig 7 a and 7b showed the distribution of environmental suitability as probability density functions pdfs for all river segments influenced by regulations we quantified the climate change signals via the distance between the historical mean environmental suitability green and blue horizontal lines and median value of the future mean environmental suitability across all 20 gcms by the 2080s dark green and dark blue horizontal lines for blackfin darter the mean environmental suitability is projected to increase from 0 07 to 0 15 by the 2080s in the unregulated model setup left side while it is projected to decrease from 0 12 to 0 10 in the regulated model setup right side for rainbow trout mean environmental suitability is projected to decrease from 0 06 to 0 in the unregulated model setup and projected to decrease from 0 07 to 0 01 by the 2080s in the regulated model setup reservoir regulation changes the primary environmental drivers for changes in the suitability of river segments in the regulated model setup the decreasing environmental suitability at the tailwater of normandy dam primarily results from a decreasing number of low temperature days different than nearby unregulated rivers fig 6c however this difference does not exist in the unregulated model setup figure s3 in addition the primary drivers of decreasing environmental suitability for rainbow trout vary greatly between the regulated and unregulated model setups the lower right table in fig 8 showed the primary drivers of changes at reservoir tailwaters for both regulated and unregulated model setups seven out of 9 tailwater locations showed different primary drivers 4 discussion dams and reservoirs modify downstream hydrologic and thermal responses to climate change cheng et al 2020a 2020b and result in habitat fragmentation but the impacts of these processes on species habitat suitability are rarely considered in combination because of the large effects of dams on river temperature and flow the ecological responses at reservoir tailwaters are different than in nearby unregulated river segments for example reservoir regulation alters the primary environmental driver of environmental suitability for blackfin darter at the tailwaters downstream of normandy dam the primary driver changes from the increasing spring and summer flow variability nearby unregulated river segments to the decreasing number of low temperature days regulated tailwaters however the ecological impacts of reservoir regulations are spatially constrained and dissipate as rivers flow downstream this is consistent with dams dissipating impacts on hydrologic and thermal regimes because surface hydrology and energy fluxes become increasingly important as rivers flow farther away from dams cheng et al 2020a reservoir regulation influences blackfin darter and rainbow trout distribution in different ways for blackfin darter the impact of dams is predominantly through river fragmentation under climate change increased flow variability during the spring and summer months flow cv ss in table 1 will potentially decrease the spawning rate and juvenile survival rate for blackfin darter shea et al 2015 since dams impacts on flow and thermal regimes are spatially constrained the climate driven changes primarily contribute to the regional signal of environmental suitability changes for blackfin darter however the blackfin darter cannot relocate to environmentally suitable streams under climate change because of dam induced river fragmentation even though the projected suitable range is smaller than the historical suitable range this finding aligns with the existing literature on the effects of dam blockage on migratory fish couto et al 2021 olden and naiman 2010 however for rainbow trout environmental suitability is greatly affected by dam induced changes in flow and thermal regimes rainbow trout an exotic cold water species that benefits from cold hypolimnetic releases will suffer from excessive heat under climate change even though the reservoir thermal stratification will persist by the 2080s and the dam releases remain colder than nearby unregulated rivers cheng et al 2020a the outflow will not be cold enough to accommodate rainbow trout decreasing environmental suitability driven by higher river temperatures is consistent with earlier studies bassar et al 2016 rubenson and olden 2020 in regional fish studies failing to consider reservoir regulation can misidentify the responses to climate change the bias mostly occurs in reaches that are influenced by reservoir regulations because the impacts dissipate as rivers flow downstream in this study the regulated and unregulated model setups show discrepancies in predictor selection historical environmental suitability responses to climate change and primary environmental drivers of these responses generally the regulated model used fewer predictors while predicting higher environmental suitability for observed fish localities than the unregulated model in addition the regulated and unregulated models show contradictory climate signals for blackfin darter in reservoir influenced rivers although both models predict decreasing suitability for rainbow trout the regulated models still predict higher than zero suitability by the 2080s because of reservoirs cooling outflow furthermore distinct primary drivers for rainbow trout at reservoir tailwaters probably result from the discrepancies in maxent models i e predictor selection and projected changes in flow and temperatures early studies assessed the contribution of environmental predictors in climate change signals by their corresponding permutation importance vancompernolle et al 2019 this metric evaluates the dependence of the final maxent model on the selected predictor for one predictor its permutation importance is higher when replacing the predictor with random values leads to worse model performance we found that predictors with high permutation importance did not necessarily have large contributions to climate induced changes in environmental suitability for example the number of low temperature days has the highest permutation importance for blackfin darter while the primary driver of decreasing environmental suitability in the lower trb is the projected higher spring and summer flow variability the permutation importance is only based on historical environmental predictors and does not account for climate induced changes therefore we would recommend that future climate impact studies use the shapley decomposition which synthesizes both permutation importance as well as climate induced changes of environmental predictors a loss of habitat for rainbow trout is consistent with earlier studies bassar et al 2016 mantua et al 2010b but our projected complete disappearance of suitable habitat may result in part because our modeling methodology ignores small headwater streams the shading impacts of riparian vegetation and a lack of biological variables small headwaters that are strongly influenced by cold groundwater might provide cold sanctuaries for rainbow trout under climate change mantua et al 2010b lawrence et al 2014 and yearsley et al 2019 showed that restoration of riparian vegetation can reduce solar radiation and mitigate the climate change impact on river temperatures especially along smaller streams without accounting for this impact we may be overestimating stream temperatures in southern appalachian streams which are covered by forest and underestimating their environmental suitability for blackfin darter and rainbow trout under climate change in addition this study ignores biological variables e g food availability and community interactions which affect the distribution of these species 5 conclusions this study for the first time assessed the ecological effects of climate induced shifts in hydrologic and thermal regimes that explicitly consider reservoir dynamics these combined interactions provide new insights into expected future fish distributions in the trb reservoirs modify the ecological responses at tailwaters by altering their flow and thermal regimes as a result the primary driver for changing environmental suitability under climate change at reservoir tailwaters are different than nearby unregulated river systems this impact also gradually dissipates as rivers flow downstream in addition reservoir regulation influences rainbow trout and blackfin darter in different ways rainbow trout s environmental suitability is largely affected by dam induced changes in flow and thermal regimes primary drivers for decreasing environmental suitability at tailwaters vary among different reservoirs but are mostly temperature related historically suitable streams for rainbow trout will disappear due to higher river temperatures by the 2080s likewise for blackfin darter only 8 of historically suitable will remain and over half of the stream segments that are projected to be suitable will be inaccessible due to blockage by dams similar dilemmas may be encountered by other endemic species with limited spatial coverage to explicitly quantify the impacts of regulation we conducted an experiment to compare the regulated and unregulated model setups generally regulated models use fewer predictors while predicting higher environmental suitability for observed fish localities than the unregulated models for blackfin darter contradictory climate signals between regulated and unregulated models highlight the necessity of considering reservoir regulation finally we recommend the use of the shapley decomposition to determine the dominant change

3449,assessing natural background levels nbls of groundwater chemical components is useful to the identification of geochemical factors controlling the origin of high levels of chemical components in groundwater this study assessed the nbls of phosphate in various groundwater units in the pearl river delta prd where urbanization is a large scale by the combination of a modified pre selection method and grubbs test and discussed main geochemical processes controlling the origin of high levels of phosphate in groundwater here the prd is divided into four groundwater units according to its hydrogeological conditions the modified pre selection method consists of detected organic contaminants the oxidation capacity as well as the high levels of ammonium and nitrate in groundwater results showed that the nbl of phosphate in the coastal alluvial aquifer was abnormal high 1 8 mg l and was 4 times that in other groundwater units this is mainly attributed to the co release of phosphate bicarbonate and fe ii accompanied with the elevated ph and decreased eh which resulted from the mineralization of organic matter accompanied with the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides as well as the desorption of other secondary minerals such as aluminum oxyhydroxides in the overlaid marine stratum besides unlike other groundwater units the property of discharge area of the coastal alluvial aquifer with more reducing environment also contributes the higher nbl of phosphate in the coastal alluvial aquifer than in other groundwater units keywords geochemical processes natural

zhang et al 2020 for example the pearl river delta prd is the largest urbanized area in china groundwater quality as well as high levels of groundwater phosphate in this area is controlled not only by natural factors but also by many anthropogenic activities accompanied by the process of urbanization zhang et al 2019 huang et al 2020a at present identifying the contributions of natural and

et al 2014 here nbl is defined as concentrations present in groundwater as controlled by natural processes molinari et al 2012 which is generally assessed by statistical techniques or pre selection ps methods statistical techniques such as finite normal mixture model median of the absolute deviations from the median median 2mad box whisker plot 4δ outlier test as well as grubbs test aim at eliminating the outliers and then remain background dataset for the nbl assessment gao et al 2020a huang et al 2022 kim et al 2015 li et al 2021 parrone et al 2019 ps methods propose to exclude the data with high levels of anthropogenic indicators such as nitrate and organic contaminants select the dataset with little influence of human activities for the nbl assessment hinsby et al 2008 recent studies commonly used the combination of ps methods and statistical methods for the nbl assessment apollaro et al 2022 huang et al 2022 molinari et al 2019 parrone et al 2019 to date geochemical processes and nbls of many chemical components such as no3 cl so4 nh4 as fe and mn in groundwater in coastal urbanized areas have already been studied for instance kim et al 2015 studied the nbl of no3 in south korean groundwater by using a finite normal mixture model griffioen et al 2008 investigated nbls of cl so4 and nh4 in four groundwater units in western river rhine of netherlands by using a historic method a tritium method as well as a oxidation capacity method ducci et al 2016 focused on groundwater nbls of as fe and mn in three coastal areas of portugal and italy by using a ps method consisting of the oxidation capacity and the high levels of cl no3 nh4 and organic contaminants in groundwater however the nbl of groundwater phosphate in coastal urbanized areas has still been ignored actually it is urgent to understand the nbl of groundwater phosphate in some coastal urbanized areas because large scales contamination of groundwater phosphate often occurred in these areas such as the prd huang et al 2020a for this reason the present study aims to assess the nbl of phosphate in various groundwater units in the prd by using the combination of a modified ps method and grubbs test and to discuss geochemical factors controlling these nbls in various groundwater units here a modified ps method consists of detected organic contaminants the oxidation capacity as well as high levels of ammonium and nitrate in groundwater because high levels of ammonium nitrate and detected organic contaminants in shallow groundwater in this area originated from various anthropogenic activities huang et al 2018b li et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the prd is divided into four groundwater units according to its hydrogeological conditions because different groundwater units generally have their unique properties to affect the groundwater nbl note that the effectiveness of the modified ps method for the nbl assessment was evaluated by the variation of groundwater phosphate concentrations in areas with different urbanization levels before and after handling by the ps method with grubbs test in addition this study also highlighted that revealing main geochemical processes of groundwater phosphate in a large scale urbanized area is based on the nbl assessment the conclusions would be helpful for understanding the origin and fate of groundwater phosphate in coastal urbanized areas improving groundwater management in the prd and as a reference approach for assessing the nbl of groundwater phosphate in urbanized areas worldwide 2 study area 2 1 geographical geological and hydrogeological conditions the prd is located within guangdong province in south china and covers a total area of 41 698 km2 with a population density of over 1500 inhabitants km2 in 2018 it is bounded by hills in the east west and north and by the south china sea in the south major rivers such as east river west river as well as north river merge in the south and form the pearl river which finally discharges into the south china sea the prd is situated on the southern boundary of the cathaysia block zhang et al 2013 it is composed of a metamorphosed pre paleozoic basement in stratigraphy which is overlain by a discontinuous paleozoic to mesozoic continental formations petrographic complexities in these bedrocks are increased by numerous transformations via regional and contact metamorphism ren et al 2016 as far as the structure is concerned the prd is a neo paleozoic depression resulted from paleozoic to mesozoic tectonic events lancia et al 2020 the depression is filled with marine and continental formations during the quaternary period quaternary sequence in some localities of the study area is faulted tang et al 2011 faults in the prd are grouped into three sets according to the trend the first set is ne sw with well preserved another two fault sets with the trends of nw se and w e are less developed lancia et al 2020 the prd is divided into four groundwater units according to hydrogeological conditions fig 1 specifically a coastal alluvial plain is located in the central and southern parts of the prd and its strata consists of two marine formations and two continental formations interbedded with each other zong et al 2009a the young marine formation m1 was deposited during the holocene 6800 and 2000 yr bp and dominated by silt and clay zong et al 2009b continental formations and the old marine formation m2 were deposited during the pleistocene jiao et al 2010 the young and old continental formations c1 and c2 are dominated by sandy fluvial deposits or sand gravel and compose a coastal alluvial aquifer unit a outside of the coastal alluvial plain are valley and inter hill plains where marine formations are missing and one or two continental formations dominated by sandy fluvial deposits compose alluvial proluvial aquifers unit b the groundwater in units a and b is mainly recharged by vertical infiltration of precipitation and agricultural irrigation and the lateral flow of rivers huang et al 2020b besides the groundwater in unit a near the pearl river estuary 25 km is still sometimes affected by the seawater intrusion sun et al 2009 huang et al 2018a fissured aquifers are distributed in hilly areas where bedrocks crop out unit c as seen in fig s1 bedrocks formed in sinian mainly crop out in northwest of the prd and dominated by quartz schist sandstone and limestone bedrocks aged in cambrian mainly crop out in west of the prd and dominated by sandstone and limestone bedrocks aged in ordovician and silurian are dominated by shale granite and clastic rocks and mainly crop out in dongguan city and northwest of the prd bedrocks aged from devonian to permian are dominated by sandstone shale limestone and mudstone and and crop out in west north and east of the prd widely bedrocks aged in triassic and jurassic also crop out in west north and east of the prd widely and dominated by sandstone and mudstone bedrocks formed in cretaceous and tertiary mainly crop out in south of the prd and dominated by granite and mudstone liu et al 2019 karst aquifers account for 10 of the total area unit d which distributed in areas where bedrocks aged from devonian to permian are presented fig 1 and fig s1 the general direction of the regional groundwater flow in the aquifers of the prd is northwest and northeast toward the coast fig s2 in the prd the properties of vadose zones containing soils in various groundwater units are controlled by geological conditions the vadose zone in groundwater unit a consists of marine sediments and dominated by silt or clay with relatively low permeability fig 1 by contrast the vadose zone in groundwater unit b is dominated by continental sediments with relatively coarse media such as sandy clay fig 1 in addition vadose zones in groundwater units c and d are resulted from the weathering of bedrocks liu et al 2019 thus the vadose zone is dominated by sand and gravel after the weathering of bedrocks such as sandstone and clastic rocks by contrast the weathering of mudstone and limestone results in the vadose zone dominated by clay fig s1 2 2 characteristics of urbanization in the prd the prd is often divided into three areas such as urbanized area ua peri urban area pua as well as non urbanized area nua according to different urbanization levels hou et al 2020 the ua is associated with large scale construction land and characterized by dense populations many factories and huge productions of domestic sewage the pua is the epitaxial area 2km outside ua of the ua and shows less factories and population in comparison with ua the nua mainly refers to woodlands small villages and agricultural lands huang et al 2013 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical techniques a total number of 399 groundwater samples 124 samples from unit a 134 samples from unit b 132 samples from unit c and 9 samples from unit d were collected from 392 civil wells and 7 springs in the prd samples were collected in situ and below 50 cm of the water table with a stainless steel sampler two 250 ml high density polyethylene sampling bottles were filled for the analyses of trace elements and other inorganic components respectively both of them were filtered with 1 2 μm membrane on site one bottle for the analysis of trace elements was acidified with nitric acid to a ph 2 by contrast the other bottle for the analysis of major ions was not acidified another 1 l brown glass bottle was filled without headspace by a stainless steel sampler in situ below water table 50 cm for the analysis of organic components all the samples were stored at 4 c until the laboratory procedures could be performed fifteen inorganic components in samples were measured redox potential eh ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured on site using a multiparameter instrument wtw multi 340i set germany metals k na ca mg fe and mn were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan hco3 and po4 were measured using acid base titration and molybdenum blue methods respectively nh4 and other anions no3 so4 and cl were analyzed by ion chromatography shimadzu lc 10advp japan to ensure data quality each sample was analyzed in triplicate and sample batches were regularly interspersed with standards and blanks the relative errors of inorganic parameters were 5 in addition 55 selected organic chemicals were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry agilent 6890 gas chromatograph with hp 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 μm agilent 5975 ms santa clara ca usa a list of selected organic components including 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 8 chlorobenzenes cbs 10 monocylic aromatics mas and 21 halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons hahs was shown in table s1 quality control of all analyzed organic chemicals followed the us epa protocols in which the recovery of surrogates was in a range of 83 to 115 3 2 nbl assessment as seen in fig 2 the procedure of the nbl assessment in this study has three main steps note that the modified ps method consists of the former two steps step 1 eliminating samples with detected organic contaminants or no3 concentrations 50 mg l or nh4 concentrations 0 5 mg l in original datasets and the remaining datasets are denoted as onn datasets reasons for these criteria these criteria are often used in ps methods for nbl assessment in areas where high concentrations of organic contaminants no3 and nh4 in groundwater ascribe to human activities ducci et al 2016 moreover huang et al 2018b and li et al 2019 also reported that high levels of these chemical components in shallow groundwater of the prd originated from various anthropogenic sources step 2 samples with oxidation capacity 3 meq l and cl concentrations 200 mg l in onn datasets are deleted and the remaining datasets are denoted as ps datasets oxidation capacity 2 meq l is often as an indicator to eliminate fresh groundwater with anthropogenic influence ducci et al 2016 and the oxidation capacity is calculated as 7 so4 5 no3 with the concentration of the species in mmol l griffioen et al 2008 the details are in supplementary material section 3 2 in this study a higher value of 3 meq l is selected as the threshold value for oxidation capacity because geogenic sources are sometimes responsible for high levels of so4 in groundwater in the prd huang et al 2022 wang et al 2012 step 3 grubbs test for ps datasets until normal distributions po4 concentrations in ps datasets in various groundwater units are tested by the grubbs test α 0 01 until normal distributions are obtained and the outliers in various groundwater units are deleted supplementary material section 3 2 analytical methods committee 2015 the remaining datasets are denoted as residual datasets note that only one datum as a half of the detection limit remained in ps datasets in various groundwater units for the grubbs test when data with po4 concentrations below the detection limit similar to the method reported by parrone et al 2019 the maximum concentration of po4 in residual datasets in various groundwater units is extracted as the nbl 4 results 4 1 nbl assessment 4 1 1 contaminated groundwaters in original datasets eliminated by the modified ps method in this study contaminated groundwater samples were removed out of the original datasets by a modified ps method which consists of no3 concentrations 50 mg l nh4 concentrations 0 5 mg l detected organic contaminants as well as the oxidation capacity 3 meq l and cl concentrations 200 mg l as shown in fig 3 approximately 40 of groundwater samples in original datasets were eliminated due to their high levels of no3 and nh4 or detected organic contaminants and the remaining datasets were denoted as onn datasets after that about 39 of groundwater samples in onn datasets were further eliminated by the oxidation capacity 3 meq l and cl concentrations 200 mg l fig 4 and the remaining datasets were denoted as ps datasets 4 1 2 grubbs test for ps datasets in various groundwater units generally datasets for the nbl assessment of anthropogenic contaminants in grondwater should be normal distribution parrone et al 2019 thus po4 concentrations in ps datasets in various groundwater units were tested by the grubbs test α 0 01 and outliers in ps datasets were eliminated fig 5 the remaining datasets were denoted as residual datasets and the maximum concentrations of po4 in residual datasets in various groundwater units were extracted as nbls as a consequence the nbl of po4 in groundwater units a was 1 84 mg l fig 5a which was 4 times that in other groundwater units fig 5b 5c and 5d by contrast the nbls of po4 in groundwater units b to d were close to each other 0 3 0 42 mg l and the differences between them were within 0 4 times fig 5b 5c and 5d 4 2 effectiveness of the modified ps method for the nbl assessment in the prd groundwater is easier to be contaminated with the increase of urbanization levels because sources of groundwater contamination in ua are much more than that in nua qian et al 2011 huang et al 2018b for instance the mean concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants such as po4 and so4 in groundwater of the prd in ua were approximately two times those in nua huang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 on the other hand concentrations of groundwater anthropogenic contaminants in residual datasets in areas with different urbanization levels will be independent of urbanization levels if the modified ps method is effective to the nbl assessment for this groundwater po4 concentrations in areas with different urbanization levels in original and residual datasets in groundwater units b and c too few samples remained in residual datasets in other units were investigated as shown in table 1 in groundwater unit b the maximum and 75th values of po4 concentration in the original dataset in ua and pua were two or more times those in nua similarly in groundwater unit c the maximum value of po4 concentration in the original dataset in ua was also more than two times that in nua these indicate that urbanization enhanced groundwater po4 concentrations in the prd by contrast the maximum values of po4 in residual datasets in groundwater unit b in ua and pua were a little bit lower than that in nua moreover in residual datasets the differences of maximum concentrations of po4 in groundwater unit c in areas with different urbanization levels were all within 0 2 times these indicate that groundwater po4 concentrations in residual datasets in areas with different urbanization levels was irrelevant to urbanization levels therefore the modified ps method in this study is useful for the nbl assessment of po4 in the prd 4 3 hydrogeochemical characteristics in residual datasets in various groundwater units in residual datasets the mean ph value in groundwater unit a was higher than that in other groundwater units table 2 this indicates that groundwater unit a was a little bit more alkaline environment in comparison with other groundwater units the median do value and mean eh value in groundwater unit a were lower than those in other groundwater units table 2 likewise the mean value of another reducing indicator such as nh4 in groundwater unit a was 1 5 times that in other groundwater units table 2 these indicates that groundwater unit a was characterized by a more reducing environment in comparison with other groundwater units except the no3 the mean concentrations of other major components in groundwater unit a were markedly higher than those in other groundwater units table 2 similarly the mean concentrations of fe and mn in groundwater unit a were more than two and five times those in other groundwater units respectively table 2 5 discussions as shown in fig 5 the nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a was 4 times that in other groundwater units and all of the nbls of po4 in other groundwater units were at a low level 0 5 mg l thus this study focuses on the geochemical factors controlling the high nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a when the impact of human activities is excluded groundwater po4 is commonly released from phosphorus rich minerals in vadose zones and aquifers through soil water and rock water interactions mcginley et al 2016 huang et al 2020a redox condition and ph are generally two crucial factors controlling the release of po4 in vadose zones and aquifers carlyle and hill 2001 huang et al 2020a therefore we reveal geochemical processes controlling the high nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a according to these two aspects 5 1 redox conditions more reducing environment in groundwater unit a in comparison with other groundwater units is probably one of the main factors for the much higher nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a than in other groundwater units because reducing environment is in favor of the release of po4 from sediments into groundwater carlyle and hill 2001 for example the mean value of eh in groundwater unit a 75 mv in residual datasets was markedly lower than that in other groundwater units 88 mv table 2 because groundwater unit a is located at low altitude areas and forms a discharge area with relatively reducing environment in groundwater figs s2 and s3 besides relatively high levels 0 8 mg l of po4 in groundwater unit a were characterized by relatively low eh values 50 mv and the po4 concentration was significantly negatively correlated with the eh value fig 6 a these indicate that more reducing environment in groundwater resulted from the discharge area was in favor of the higher nbl po4 in groundwater unit a in comparison with that in other groundwater units this is also supported by the relationships of po4 and other redox sensitive indicators e g do and no3 in groundwater units in residual datasets for instance relatively high levels 0 8 mg l of po4 in groundwater unit a were accompanied with relatively low do values 4 mg l fig 6b by contrast the mean values of do in almost all of groundwater units except groundwater unit d in residual datasets were 4 mg l table 2 similarly in residual datasets mean concentrations 6 6 mg l of no3 in various groundwater units were two or more times that 3 6 mg l in groundwater unit a characterized by po4 0 8 mg l table 2 and fig 6e on the other hand a more reducing environment of vadose zone in groundwater unit a in comparison with other groundwater units presents this is supported by two evidences one evidence is that the vadose zone in groundwater unit a is dominated by silt or clay with relatively low permeability while vadose zones in other groundwater units such b show coarse media such as sandy clay with relatively high permeability fig 1 ghst 1981 the other evidence is that the vadose zone of groundwater unit a consists of a marine stratum containing abundant organic matter and the mineralization of organic matter results in more reducing environment of vadose zone in groundwater unit a in comparison with other groundwater units jiao et al 2010 in this case the release of po4 in vadose zone media of groundwater unit a resulting from the mineralization of organic matter accompanied by the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides would occur because organic phosphorus and iron bound phosphorus are the two dominant fractions of phosphorus in sediments in the pearl river estuary where is adjacent to groundwater unit a gao et al 2020b tao et al 2020 meanwhile this would be accompanied by the release of fe ii and hco3 resulted from the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides and the mineralization of organic matter in this marine stratum where fe iii hydr oxides and organic matter are common bourg and bertin 1993 wang et al 2012 as a consequence the released po4 fe ii as well as hco3 in vadose zone will enter into groundwater through the water flow this assumption is supported by the relationships of concentrations of po4 and fe as well as hco3 in groundwater units in residual datasets for instance the mean value of fe in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was approximately or more than three times that in other groundwater units table 2 and the relatively high levels 0 8 mg l of po4 in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset were accompanied by a high mean fe concentration of 0 53 mg l fig 6c besides all of the dissolved forms of fe in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was fe ii according to a function of eh and ph fig s4 similarly the mean value of hco3 in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was approximately two times that in other groundwater units table 2 and the po4 concentration in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was significantly positively correlated with the hco3 concentration fig 6d 5 2 ph conditions apart from redox conditions elevated ph is likely another crucial factor for the higher nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a than in other groundwater units in this study the relatively high levels 0 8 mg l of po4 in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset were accompanied by a relatively high ph range of 7 0 7 3 which was significantly higher than the mean values of ph in various groundwater units in residual datasets table 2 meanwhile the po4 concentration in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was significantly positively correlated with the ph value fig 6f these indicate that groundwater alkalization was in favor of the higher nbl po4 in groundwater unit a in comparison with other groundwater units in the prd two main natural factors probably result in the alkalization in groundwater unit a rather than in other groundwater units one factor is the seawater intrusion because the intrusion of seawater with higher ph value 7 6 8 2 often occurs in groundwater unit a but not in other groundwater units ghst 1981 chen et al 2006 however it should not be the main source for groundwater alkalization in groundwater unit a because the correlation between the ph value and the concentration of cl represent the seawater intrusion in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was insignificant fig s5 besides the relatively high levels 0 8 mg l of po4 in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was accompanied with high values of ph 6 5 and hydrochemical facies of ca hco3 rather than na cl represent the seawater intrusion fig s6 another factor is the infiltration of alkaline amphoteric substances from vadose zones including soils into groundwater because the vadose zone in groundwater unit a consists of a marine stratum where abundant organic matter presents jiao et al 2010 and a large amount of hco3 amphoteric substances is formed because of the mineralization of organic matter bourg and bertin 1993 in this case a large amount of hco3 in the vadose zone will enter into groundwater through water flow and increase groundwater ph through the conversion of carbonate equilibrium system in groundwater as the equation of h2co3 hco3 h this assumption is supported by two evidences one evidence is the significantly positively correlation between the ph value and the hco3 concentration in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset fig s5 the other evidence is that the soil vadose zone in groundwater unit a was commonly shown relatively higher ph values 5 5 7 5 in comparison with that in other groundwater units in the prd during 2002 2007 fig 7 moreover more than one of third of the soil ph in groundwater unit a increased to a range of 6 5 7 5 from 1980s to 2000s guo et al 2011 therefore it can be concluded that a large amount of hco3 input resulted from the mineralization of abundant organic matter in the vadose zone of groundwater unit a should be mainly responsible for the groundwater alkalization in groundwater unit a besides tanada et al 2003 reported that adsorption capacities of secondary minerals such as aluminum oxyhydroxides to po4 are commonly decreased with the increase of ph when the ph exceeds 4 zhou et al 2005 reported that po4 adsorbed onto secondary minerals will be replaced by hydroxyl when the ph exceeds 6 these indicate that po4 adsorbed onto the media of vadose zone in groundwater unit a will be released accompanied by the mineralization of organic matter and enter into groundwater through the water flow this inference is supported by the evidence that relatively high levels 0 5 mg l of groundwater po4 in residual datasets were located at groundwater unit a where the soil ph was relatively high 5 5 7 5 fig 7 to sum up much higher nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a than in other groundwater units is mainly attributed to the co release of po4 hco3 and fe ii accompanied with the elevated ph and decreased eh which resulted from the mineralization of organic matter accompanied with the reductive dissolution of fe hydr oxides as well as the desorption of other secondary minerals such as aluminum oxyhydroxides in the overlaid marine sediment fig 8 besides unlike other groundwater units the property of discharge area of groundwater unit a with relatively reducing environment also contributes the higher nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a than in other groundwater units 6 conclusions phosphate is selected as an anthropogenic contaminant for its nbl assessment in this study nbls of po4 in four groundwater units in the prd were evaluated by the combination of a modified ps method and grubbs test the modified ps method consists of detected organic contaminants the oxidation capacity as well as the high levels of ammonium and nitrate in groundwater results showed that nbls of po4 in groundwater units a to d were 1 84 mg l 0 3 mg l 0 42 mg l and 0 37 mg l respectively this modified ps method is considered to be useful for the nbl assessment of po4 in this study according to the comparison of groundwater po4 concentrations in areas with different urbanization levels in original and residual datasets the nbl of phosphate in groundwater unit a was 4 times that in other groundwater units this mainly ascribes to the following geochemical processes unlike in other groundwater units the mineralization of organic matter in marine sediments of groundwater unit a occurs which is accompanied with the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides owing to the decrease of eh as well as the desorption of other secondary minerals e g aluminum oxyhydroxides because of the increase of ph and finally resulting in the co release of po4 hco3 and fe ii into groundwater via the water flow in addition in contrast to other groundwater units groundwater unit a is a discharge area accompanied with relatively reducing environment this also contributes the higher nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a than in other groundwater units this study provides useful nbls of po4 as a reference for the assessment of groundwater contamination in coastal urbanized areas such as the prd this study also provides a reference for understanding the origin and fate of groundwater po4 in coastal urbanized areas moreover this study shows that revealing geochemical processes of po4 rich groundwater in large scale urbanized areas based on the nbl assessment is feasible declaration of competing interest

3449,assessing natural background levels nbls of groundwater chemical components is useful to the identification of geochemical factors controlling the origin of high levels of chemical components in groundwater this study assessed the nbls of phosphate in various groundwater units in the pearl river delta prd where urbanization is a large scale by the combination of a modified pre selection method and grubbs test and discussed main geochemical processes controlling the origin of high levels of phosphate in groundwater here the prd is divided into four groundwater units according to its hydrogeological conditions the modified pre selection method consists of detected organic contaminants the oxidation capacity as well as the high levels of ammonium and nitrate in groundwater results showed that the nbl of phosphate in the coastal alluvial aquifer was abnormal high 1 8 mg l and was 4 times that in other groundwater units this is mainly attributed to the co release of phosphate bicarbonate and fe ii accompanied with the elevated ph and decreased eh which resulted from the mineralization of organic matter accompanied with the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides as well as the desorption of other secondary minerals such as aluminum oxyhydroxides in the overlaid marine stratum besides unlike other groundwater units the property of discharge area of the coastal alluvial aquifer with more reducing environment also contributes the higher nbl of phosphate in the coastal alluvial aquifer than in other groundwater units keywords geochemical processes natural background levels groundwater units pre selection method pearl river delta 1 introduction groundwater plays a critical role in providing drinking water and domestic water for human beings nowadays more than half of drinking water is sourced from groundwater in global mukherjee et al 2020 however large scale urbanization often results in groundwater contamination worldwide huang et al 2018a zhang et al 2020 for example the pearl river delta prd is the largest urbanized area in china groundwater quality as well as high levels of groundwater phosphate in this area is controlled not only by natural factors but also by many anthropogenic activities accompanied by the process of urbanization zhang et al 2019 huang et al 2020a at present identifying the contributions of natural and anthropogenic factors on high levels of chemical components such as phosphate in groundwater in the prd where urbanization continues and complex hydrogeological conditions present is challenging guangdong hydrogeological second team 1981 li et al 2022 one of our previously studies has focused on anthropogenic factors controlling high levels of phosphate in groundwater in the prd huang et al 2020a while the contributions of natural factors such as geochemical processes on high levels of phosphate in groundwater are unclear nowadays in order to evaluate groundwater contamination accurately as well as identify natural factors controlling high levels of chemical components in groundwater it is useful to assess natural background levels nbls of chemical components in groundwater preziosi et al 2014 here nbl is defined as concentrations present in groundwater as controlled by natural processes molinari et al 2012 which is generally assessed by statistical techniques or pre selection ps methods statistical techniques such as finite normal mixture model median of the absolute deviations from the median median 2mad box whisker plot 4δ outlier test as well as grubbs test aim at eliminating the outliers and then remain background dataset for the nbl assessment gao et al 2020a huang et al 2022 kim et al 2015 li et al 2021 parrone et al 2019 ps methods propose to exclude the data with high levels of anthropogenic indicators such as nitrate and organic contaminants select the dataset with little influence of human activities for the nbl assessment hinsby et al 2008 recent studies commonly used the combination of ps methods and statistical methods for the nbl assessment apollaro et al 2022 huang et al 2022 molinari et al 2019 parrone et al 2019 to date geochemical processes and nbls of many chemical components such as no3 cl so4 nh4 as fe and mn in groundwater in coastal urbanized areas have already been studied for instance kim et al 2015 studied the nbl of no3 in south korean groundwater by using a finite normal mixture model griffioen et al 2008 investigated nbls of cl so4 and nh4 in four groundwater units in western river rhine of netherlands by using a historic method a tritium method as well as a oxidation capacity method ducci et al 2016 focused on groundwater nbls of as fe and mn in three coastal areas of portugal and italy by using a ps method consisting of the oxidation capacity and the high levels of cl no3 nh4 and organic contaminants in groundwater however the nbl of groundwater phosphate in coastal urbanized areas has still been ignored actually it is urgent to understand the nbl of groundwater phosphate in some coastal urbanized areas because large scales contamination of groundwater phosphate often occurred in these areas such as the prd huang et al 2020a for this reason the present study aims to assess the nbl of phosphate in various groundwater units in the prd by using the combination of a modified ps method and grubbs test and to discuss geochemical factors controlling these nbls in various groundwater units here a modified ps method consists of detected organic contaminants the oxidation capacity as well as high levels of ammonium and nitrate in groundwater because high levels of ammonium nitrate and detected organic contaminants in shallow groundwater in this area originated from various anthropogenic activities huang et al 2018b li et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the prd is divided into four groundwater units according to its hydrogeological conditions because different groundwater units generally have their unique properties to affect the groundwater nbl note that the effectiveness of the modified ps method for the nbl assessment was evaluated by the variation of groundwater phosphate concentrations in areas with different urbanization levels before and after handling by the ps method with grubbs test in addition this study also highlighted that revealing main geochemical processes of groundwater phosphate in a large scale urbanized area is based on the nbl assessment the conclusions would be helpful for understanding the origin and fate of groundwater phosphate in coastal urbanized areas improving groundwater management in the prd and as a reference approach for assessing the nbl of groundwater phosphate in urbanized areas worldwide 2 study area 2 1 geographical geological and hydrogeological conditions the prd is located within guangdong province in south china and covers a total area of 41 698 km2 with a population density of over 1500 inhabitants km2 in 2018 it is bounded by hills in the east west and north and by the south china sea in the south major rivers such as east river west river as well as north river merge in the south and form the pearl river which finally discharges into the south china sea the prd is situated on the southern boundary of the cathaysia block zhang et al 2013 it is composed of a metamorphosed pre paleozoic basement in stratigraphy which is overlain by a discontinuous paleozoic to mesozoic continental formations petrographic complexities in these bedrocks are increased by numerous transformations via regional and contact metamorphism ren et al 2016 as far as the structure is concerned the prd is a neo paleozoic depression resulted from paleozoic to mesozoic tectonic events lancia et al 2020 the depression is filled with marine and continental formations during the quaternary period quaternary sequence in some localities of the study area is faulted tang et al 2011 faults in the prd are grouped into three sets according to the trend the first set is ne sw with well preserved another two fault sets with the trends of nw se and w e are less developed lancia et al 2020 the prd is divided into four groundwater units according to hydrogeological conditions fig 1 specifically a coastal alluvial plain is located in the central and southern parts of the prd and its strata consists of two marine formations and two continental formations interbedded with each other zong et al 2009a the young marine formation m1 was deposited during the holocene 6800 and 2000 yr bp and dominated by silt and clay zong et al 2009b continental formations and the old marine formation m2 were deposited during the pleistocene jiao et al 2010 the young and old continental formations c1 and c2 are dominated by sandy fluvial deposits or sand gravel and compose a coastal alluvial aquifer unit a outside of the coastal alluvial plain are valley and inter hill plains where marine formations are missing and one or two continental formations dominated by sandy fluvial deposits compose alluvial proluvial aquifers unit b the groundwater in units a and b is mainly recharged by vertical infiltration of precipitation and agricultural irrigation and the lateral flow of rivers huang et al 2020b besides the groundwater in unit a near the pearl river estuary 25 km is still sometimes affected by the seawater intrusion sun et al 2009 huang et al 2018a fissured aquifers are distributed in hilly areas where bedrocks crop out unit c as seen in fig s1 bedrocks formed in sinian mainly crop out in northwest of the prd and dominated by quartz schist sandstone and limestone bedrocks aged in cambrian mainly crop out in west of the prd and dominated by sandstone and limestone bedrocks aged in ordovician and silurian are dominated by shale granite and clastic rocks and mainly crop out in dongguan city and northwest of the prd bedrocks aged from devonian to permian are dominated by sandstone shale limestone and mudstone and and crop out in west north and east of the prd widely bedrocks aged in triassic and jurassic also crop out in west north and east of the prd widely and dominated by sandstone and mudstone bedrocks formed in cretaceous and tertiary mainly crop out in south of the prd and dominated by granite and mudstone liu et al 2019 karst aquifers account for 10 of the total area unit d which distributed in areas where bedrocks aged from devonian to permian are presented fig 1 and fig s1 the general direction of the regional groundwater flow in the aquifers of the prd is northwest and northeast toward the coast fig s2 in the prd the properties of vadose zones containing soils in various groundwater units are controlled by geological conditions the vadose zone in groundwater unit a consists of marine sediments and dominated by silt or clay with relatively low permeability fig 1 by contrast the vadose zone in groundwater unit b is dominated by continental sediments with relatively coarse media such as sandy clay fig 1 in addition vadose zones in groundwater units c and d are resulted from the weathering of bedrocks liu et al 2019 thus the vadose zone is dominated by sand and gravel after the weathering of bedrocks such as sandstone and clastic rocks by contrast the weathering of mudstone and limestone results in the vadose zone dominated by clay fig s1 2 2 characteristics of urbanization in the prd the prd is often divided into three areas such as urbanized area ua peri urban area pua as well as non urbanized area nua according to different urbanization levels hou et al 2020 the ua is associated with large scale construction land and characterized by dense populations many factories and huge productions of domestic sewage the pua is the epitaxial area 2km outside ua of the ua and shows less factories and population in comparison with ua the nua mainly refers to woodlands small villages and agricultural lands huang et al 2013 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical techniques a total number of 399 groundwater samples 124 samples from unit a 134 samples from unit b 132 samples from unit c and 9 samples from unit d were collected from 392 civil wells and 7 springs in the prd samples were collected in situ and below 50 cm of the water table with a stainless steel sampler two 250 ml high density polyethylene sampling bottles were filled for the analyses of trace elements and other inorganic components respectively both of them were filtered with 1 2 μm membrane on site one bottle for the analysis of trace elements was acidified with nitric acid to a ph 2 by contrast the other bottle for the analysis of major ions was not acidified another 1 l brown glass bottle was filled without headspace by a stainless steel sampler in situ below water table 50 cm for the analysis of organic components all the samples were stored at 4 c until the laboratory procedures could be performed fifteen inorganic components in samples were measured redox potential eh ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured on site using a multiparameter instrument wtw multi 340i set germany metals k na ca mg fe and mn were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan hco3 and po4 were measured using acid base titration and molybdenum blue methods respectively nh4 and other anions no3 so4 and cl were analyzed by ion chromatography shimadzu lc 10advp japan to ensure data quality each sample was analyzed in triplicate and sample batches were regularly interspersed with standards and blanks the relative errors of inorganic parameters were 5 in addition 55 selected organic chemicals were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry agilent 6890 gas chromatograph

monocylic aromatics mas and 21 halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons hahs was shown in table s1 quality control of all analyzed organic chemicals followed the us epa protocols in which the recovery of surrogates was in a range of 83 to 115 3 2 nbl assessment as seen in fig 2 the procedure of the nbl assessment in this study has three main steps note that the modified ps method consists of the former two steps step 1 eliminating samples with detected organic contaminants or no3 concentrations 50 mg l or nh4 concentrations 0 5 mg l in original datasets and the remaining datasets are denoted as onn datasets reasons for these criteria these criteria are often used in ps methods for nbl assessment in areas where high concentrations of organic contaminants no3 and nh4 in groundwater ascribe to human activities ducci et al 2016 moreover huang et al 2018b and li et al 2019 also reported that high levels of these chemical components in shallow groundwater of the prd originated from various anthropogenic sources step 2 samples with oxidation capacity 3 meq l and cl concentrations 200 mg l in onn datasets are deleted and the remaining datasets are denoted as ps datasets oxidation capacity 2 meq l is often as an indicator to eliminate fresh groundwater with anthropogenic influence ducci et al 2016 and the oxidation capacity is calculated as 7 so4 5 no3 with the concentration of the species in mmol l griffioen et al 2008 the details are in supplementary material section 3 2 in this study a higher value of 3 meq l is selected as the threshold value for oxidation capacity because geogenic sources are sometimes responsible for high levels of so4 in groundwater in the prd huang et al 2022 wang et al 2012 step 3 grubbs test for ps datasets until normal distributions po4 concentrations in ps datasets in various groundwater units are tested by the grubbs test α 0 01 until normal distributions are obtained and the outliers in various groundwater units are deleted supplementary material section 3 2 analytical methods committee 2015 the remaining datasets are denoted as residual datasets note that only one datum as a half of the detection limit remained in ps datasets in various groundwater units for the grubbs test when data with po4 concentrations below the detection limit similar to the method reported by parrone et al 2019 the maximum concentration of po4 in residual datasets in various groundwater units is extracted as the nbl 4 results 4 1 nbl assessment 4 1 1 contaminated groundwaters in original datasets eliminated by the modified ps method in this study contaminated groundwater samples were removed out of the original datasets by a modified ps method which consists of no3 concentrations 50 mg l nh4 concentrations 0 5 mg l detected organic contaminants as well as the oxidation capacity 3 meq l and cl concentrations 200 mg l as shown in fig 3 approximately 40 of groundwater samples in original datasets were eliminated due to their high levels of no3 and nh4 or detected organic contaminants and the remaining datasets were denoted as onn datasets after that about 39 of groundwater samples in onn datasets were further eliminated by the oxidation capacity 3 meq l and cl concentrations 200 mg l fig 4 and the remaining datasets were denoted as ps datasets 4 1 2 grubbs test for ps datasets in various groundwater units generally datasets for the nbl assessment of anthropogenic contaminants in grondwater should be normal distribution parrone et al 2019 thus po4 concentrations in ps datasets in various groundwater units were tested by the grubbs test α 0 01 and outliers in ps datasets were eliminated fig 5 the remaining datasets were denoted as residual datasets and the maximum concentrations of po4 in residual datasets in various groundwater units were extracted as nbls as a consequence the nbl of po4 in groundwater units a was 1 84 mg l fig 5a which was 4 times that in other groundwater units fig 5b 5c and 5d by contrast the nbls of po4 in groundwater units b to d were close to each other 0 3 0 42 mg l and the differences between them were within 0 4 times fig 5b 5c and 5d 4 2 effectiveness of the modified ps method for the nbl assessment in the prd groundwater is easier to be contaminated with the increase of urbanization levels because sources of groundwater contamination in ua are much more than that in nua qian et al 2011 huang et al 2018b for instance the mean concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants such as po4 and so4 in groundwater of the prd in ua were approximately two times those in nua huang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 on the other hand concentrations of groundwater anthropogenic contaminants in residual datasets in areas with different urbanization levels will be independent of urbanization levels if the modified ps method is effective to the nbl assessment for this groundwater po4 concentrations in areas with different urbanization levels in original and residual datasets in groundwater units b and c too few samples remained in residual datasets in other units were investigated as shown in table 1 in groundwater unit b the maximum and 75th values of po4 concentration in the original dataset in ua and pua were two or more times those in nua similarly in groundwater unit c the maximum value of po4 concentration in the original dataset in ua was also more than two times that in nua these indicate that urbanization enhanced groundwater po4 concentrations in the prd by contrast the maximum values of po4 in residual datasets in groundwater unit b in ua and pua were a little bit lower than that in nua moreover in residual datasets the differences of maximum concentrations of po4 in groundwater unit c in areas with different urbanization levels were all within 0 2 times these indicate that groundwater po4 concentrations in residual datasets in areas with different urbanization levels was irrelevant to urbanization levels therefore the modified ps method in this study is useful for the nbl assessment of po4 in the prd 4 3 hydrogeochemical characteristics in residual datasets in various groundwater units in residual datasets the mean ph value in groundwater unit a was higher than that in other groundwater units table 2 this indicates that groundwater unit a was a little bit more alkaline environment in comparison with other groundwater units the median do value and mean eh value in groundwater unit a were lower than those in other groundwater units table 2 likewise the mean value of another reducing indicator such as nh4 in groundwater unit a was 1 5 times that in other groundwater units table 2 these indicates that groundwater unit a was characterized by a more reducing environment in comparison with other groundwater units except the no3 the mean concentrations of other major components in groundwater unit a were markedly higher than those in other groundwater units table 2 similarly the mean concentrations of fe and mn in groundwater unit a were more than two and five times those in other groundwater units respectively table 2 5 discussions as shown in fig 5 the nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a was 4 times that in other groundwater units and all of the nbls of po4 in other groundwater units were at a low level 0 5 mg l thus this study focuses on the geochemical factors controlling the high nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a when the impact of human activities is excluded groundwater po4 is commonly released from phosphorus rich minerals in vadose zones and aquifers through soil water and rock water interactions mcginley et al 2016 huang et al 2020a redox condition and ph are generally two crucial factors controlling the release of po4 in vadose zones and aquifers carlyle and hill 2001 huang et al 2020a therefore we reveal geochemical processes controlling the high nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a according to these two aspects 5 1 redox conditions more reducing environment in groundwater unit a in comparison with other groundwater units is probably one of the main factors for the much higher nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a than in other groundwater units because reducing environment is in favor of the release of po4 from sediments into groundwater carlyle and hill 2001 for example the mean value of eh in groundwater unit a 75 mv in residual datasets was markedly lower than that in other groundwater units 88 mv table 2 because groundwater unit a is located at low altitude areas and forms a discharge area with relatively reducing environment in groundwater figs s2 and s3 besides relatively high levels 0 8 mg l of po4 in groundwater unit a were characterized by relatively low eh values 50 mv and the po4 concentration was significantly negatively correlated with the eh value fig 6 a these indicate that more reducing environment in groundwater resulted from the discharge area was in favor of the higher nbl po4 in groundwater unit a in comparison with that in other groundwater units this is also supported by the relationships of po4 and other redox sensitive indicators e g do and no3 in groundwater units in residual datasets for instance relatively high levels 0 8 mg l of po4 in groundwater unit a were accompanied with relatively low do values 4 mg l fig 6b by contrast the mean values of do in almost all of groundwater units except groundwater unit d in residual datasets were 4 mg l table 2 similarly in residual datasets mean concentrations 6 6 mg l of no3 in various groundwater units were two or more times that 3 6 mg l in groundwater unit a characterized by po4 0 8 mg l table 2 and fig 6e on the other hand a more reducing environment of vadose zone in groundwater unit a in comparison with other groundwater units presents this is supported by two evidences one evidence is that the vadose zone in groundwater unit a is dominated by silt or clay with relatively low permeability while vadose zones in other groundwater units such b show coarse media such as sandy clay with relatively high permeability fig 1 ghst 1981 the other evidence is that the vadose zone of groundwater unit a consists of a marine stratum containing abundant organic matter and the mineralization of organic matter results in more reducing environment of vadose zone in groundwater unit a in comparison with other groundwater units jiao et al 2010 in this case the release of po4 in vadose zone media of groundwater unit a resulting from the mineralization of organic matter accompanied by the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides would occur because organic phosphorus and iron bound phosphorus are the two dominant fractions of phosphorus in sediments in the pearl river estuary where is adjacent to groundwater unit a gao et al 2020b tao et al 2020 meanwhile this would be accompanied by the release of fe ii and hco3 resulted from the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides and the mineralization of organic matter in this marine stratum where fe iii hydr oxides and organic matter are common bourg and bertin 1993 wang et al 2012 as a consequence the released po4 fe ii as well as hco3 in vadose zone will enter into groundwater through the water flow this assumption is supported by the relationships of concentrations of po4 and fe as well as hco3 in groundwater units in residual datasets for instance the mean value of fe in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was approximately or more than three times that in other groundwater units table 2 and the relatively high levels 0 8 mg l of po4 in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset were accompanied by a high mean fe concentration of 0 53 mg l fig 6c besides all of the dissolved forms of fe in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was fe ii according to a function of eh and ph fig s4 similarly the mean value of hco3 in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was approximately two times that in other groundwater units table 2 and the po4 concentration in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was significantly positively correlated with the hco3 concentration fig 6d 5 2 ph conditions apart from redox conditions elevated ph is likely another crucial factor for the higher nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a than in other groundwater units in this study the relatively high levels 0 8 mg l of po4 in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset were accompanied by a relatively high ph range of 7 0 7 3 which was significantly higher than the mean values of ph in various groundwater units in residual datasets table 2 meanwhile the po4 concentration in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was significantly positively correlated with the ph value fig 6f these indicate that groundwater alkalization was in favor of the higher nbl po4 in groundwater unit a in comparison with other groundwater units in the prd two main natural factors probably result in the alkalization in groundwater unit a rather than in other groundwater units one factor is the seawater intrusion because the intrusion of seawater with higher ph value 7 6 8 2 often occurs in groundwater unit a but not in other groundwater units ghst 1981 chen et al 2006 however it should not be the main source for groundwater alkalization in groundwater unit a because the correlation between the ph value and the concentration of cl represent the seawater intrusion in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was insignificant fig s5 besides the relatively high levels 0 8 mg l of po4 in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset was accompanied with high values of ph 6 5 and hydrochemical facies of ca hco3 rather than na cl represent the seawater intrusion fig s6 another factor is the infiltration of alkaline amphoteric substances from vadose zones including soils into groundwater because the vadose zone in groundwater unit a consists of a marine stratum where abundant organic matter presents jiao et al 2010 and a large amount of hco3 amphoteric substances is formed because of the mineralization of organic matter bourg and bertin 1993 in this case a large amount of hco3 in the vadose zone will enter into groundwater through water flow and increase groundwater ph through the conversion of carbonate equilibrium system in groundwater as the equation of h2co3 hco3 h this assumption is supported by two evidences one evidence is the significantly positively correlation between the ph value and the hco3 concentration in groundwater unit a in the residual dataset fig s5 the other evidence is that the soil vadose zone in groundwater unit a was commonly shown relatively higher ph values 5 5 7 5 in comparison with that in other groundwater units in the prd during 2002 2007 fig 7 moreover more than one of third of the soil ph in groundwater unit a increased to a range of 6 5 7 5 from 1980s to 2000s guo et al 2011 therefore it can be concluded that a large amount of hco3 input resulted from the mineralization of abundant organic matter in the vadose zone of groundwater unit a should be mainly responsible for the groundwater alkalization in groundwater unit a besides tanada et al 2003 reported that adsorption capacities of secondary minerals such as aluminum oxyhydroxides to po4 are commonly decreased with the increase of ph when the ph exceeds 4 zhou et al 2005 reported that po4 adsorbed onto secondary minerals will be replaced by hydroxyl when the ph exceeds 6 these indicate that po4 adsorbed onto the media of vadose zone in groundwater unit a will be released accompanied by the mineralization of organic matter and enter into groundwater through the water flow this inference is supported by the evidence that relatively high levels 0 5 mg l of groundwater po4 in residual datasets were located at groundwater unit a where the soil ph was relatively high 5 5 7 5 fig 7 to sum up much higher nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a than in other groundwater units is mainly attributed to the co release of po4 hco3 and fe ii accompanied with the elevated ph and decreased eh which resulted from the mineralization of organic matter accompanied with the reductive dissolution of fe hydr oxides as well as the desorption of other secondary minerals such as aluminum oxyhydroxides in the overlaid marine sediment fig 8 besides unlike other groundwater units the property of discharge area of groundwater unit a with relatively reducing environment also contributes the higher nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a than in other groundwater units 6 conclusions phosphate is selected as an anthropogenic contaminant for its nbl assessment in this study nbls of po4 in four groundwater units in the prd were evaluated by the combination of a modified ps method and grubbs test the modified ps method consists of detected organic contaminants the oxidation capacity as well as the high levels of ammonium and nitrate in groundwater results showed that nbls of po4 in groundwater units a to d were 1 84 mg l 0 3 mg l 0 42 mg l and 0 37 mg l respectively this modified ps method is considered to be useful for the nbl assessment of po4 in this study according to the comparison of groundwater po4 concentrations in areas with different urbanization levels in original and residual datasets the nbl of phosphate in groundwater unit a was 4 times that in other groundwater units this mainly ascribes to the following geochemical processes unlike in other groundwater units the mineralization of organic matter in marine sediments of groundwater unit a occurs which is accompanied with the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides owing to the decrease of eh as well as the desorption of other secondary minerals e g aluminum oxyhydroxides because of the increase of ph and finally resulting in the co release of po4 hco3 and fe ii into groundwater via the water flow in addition in contrast to other groundwater units groundwater unit a is a discharge area accompanied with relatively reducing environment this also contributes the higher nbl of po4 in groundwater unit a than in other groundwater units this study provides useful nbls of po4 as a reference for the assessment of groundwater contamination in coastal urbanized areas such as the prd this study also provides a reference for understanding the origin and fate of groundwater po4 in coastal urbanized areas moreover this study shows that revealing geochemical processes of po4 rich groundwater in large scale urbanized areas based on the nbl assessment is feasible declaration of competing interest
