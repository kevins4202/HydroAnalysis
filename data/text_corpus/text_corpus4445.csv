underwater vehicle region tracking prescribed transient performance fault tolerant control thruster fault 1 introduction due to their advantages in terms of mobility and onboard sensing autonomous underwater vehicles auvs can be transformed as autonomous platforms equipped with samplers and sensors to detect dynamic ocean features which are always laborious and difficult for traditional ship based methods or even practically impossible to long term track such features using ships das et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a 2019b therefore auvs have been widely used in marine ecosystem monitoring das et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b in auvs based monitoring auv should follow the trajectory pre programmed or planned based on real time analysis to achieve this task a trajectory tracking system with high reliability is required allibert et al 2019 ferreira et al 2018 guerrero et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in conventional control schemes high tracking precision is the first requirement by users i e the controller s goal is to force the tracking error to converge to zero as much as possible due to ocean current and measurement noise more frequent fluctuation will be introduced in the control input with the increase of the tracking precision in general however in some special applications an auv should be controlled to maintain a special region for observation or data collection li et al 2010 for example in order to detect maximum plankton abundance within the water column the control goal is to maintain the auv within a minimum and maximum depth in water therefore region reaching tracking concept has been proposed for auvs i e the desired target is defined as a region instead of a point li et al 2010 sun and cheah 2008 at present potential energy functions constructed based on the desired region boundary is one typical method to achieve region tracking control for auv where the controller s goal is to guarantee the tracking error at the steady state to be within the desired region based on this region tracking concept ismail and dunnigan 2011a and ismail and dunnigan 2011b developed region tracking control schemes for auv and auv with an on board manipulator respectively however external disturbances e g ocean current were not considered in the mentioned above research works in order to remedy this drawback and guarantee the convergence ability of the tracking error zhang and chu 2014 developed adaptive region tracking control method based on pd neural sliding mode algorithm furthermore mukherjee et al 2015 investigated the compensation of actuator delay in region tracking for auvs with a much strict assumption that input delay was a known constant apart from the above mentioned researches region tracking control with thruster fault also attracts researchers interests ismail et al 2014 developed a fault tolerant region based control for auv by combining with weighted pseudoinverse based control re allocation and the region tracking concept in this design the thruster information including occurrence time magnitude and position of thruster fault should be known in priori in order to be independent with the fault diagnosis system chu and zhu 2017 also investigated the problem of region tracking fault tolerant control and a neural network was used to approximate the unknown function including the effect of thruster fault different from the design principle of region tracking control in the above mentioned references zhang et al 2017 proposed a backstepping based region tracking fault tolerant control scheme for auv with unknown thruster fault where a piecewise and smooth lyapunov function was constructed according to the given desired region all the mentioned above references about region tracking control only focus on the performance of the tracking error in the steady state and the transient performance of the tracking error is not considered however it is a practically crucial but difficult to guarantee the tracking error to satisfy the requirement of both the transient state and the steady state performances prescribed by users shao et al 2018 fortunately prescribed performance control concept was proposed by bechlioulis and rovithakis 2010 in this concept an exponential decay function is used to describe the requirement about the tracking error in both transient state and steady state including steady error convergence time and overshoot for example the prescribed performance control was achieved by error mapping function combined with an exponential decay function describing the performance requirement and extra approximation or compensation structures were not used in theodorakopoulos and rovithakis 2015 and zhang and yang 2019 prescribed performance control concept also was applied to the control of underactuated marine vehicles see in park and yoo 2016 bechlioulis et al 2017 and li et al 2019 case studies have been reported in these references about prescribed performance control where the tracking error in both transient and steady states satisfied the prescribed performance requirements but the tracking error in the steady state still tends to converge to zero motivated by the mentioned above discussion this paper further investigates region tracking problem for auv in presence of ocean current and unknown thruster fault by combining with region tracking concept and prescribed performance control concept the objective of this paper is to synthesize an adaptive region tracking fault tolerant controller for an auv with unknown thruster fault to guarantee that the transient state and steady state performances of the tracking error including overshoot convergence time and the steady error are within the bound of the prescribed performance requirement the main contributions of this paper are presented as follows 1 an adaptive region tracking fault tolerant control scheme with prescribed transient performance is proposed for auvs subject to ocean current and unknown thruster fault in our previous work in zhang et al 2017 the region tracking control was achieved by constructing a piecewise and smooth lyapunov function according to the given desired region and this design only focused on the steady state performance of the tracking error in contrast to the design in zhang et al 2017 the proposed control scheme focuses on both the transient state performance and the steady state performance of the tracking error in region tracking problem on the basis of the piecewise and smooth lyapunov function in zhang et al 2017 a logarithmic error mapping function is used by combining with an exponential decay function describing the performance requirement so as to guarantee that the tracking error in the transient state can satisfy the prescribed performance and the tracking error in the steady state is within the prescribed region but not converges to zero 2 the convergence problem of tracking error is transformed as a boundedness problem by error transformation and the compensation of ocean current modelling uncertainty and thruster fault is achieved in the framework of backstepping technique combined with estimation of the bound of the general uncertainty term and the variation of the thrust distribution matrixes this paper is organized as follows auv s dynamic model is briefly described in the following section section 3 gives adaptive region tracking fault tolerant control with prescribed transient performance the proposed control scheme is verified by simulation results presented in section 4 followed by the conclusions of this paper 2 auv dynamic model with ocean current and thruster fault the dynamic model of an auv with thruster fault is described as eq 1 fossen 2011 zhang et al 2017 1 η m η 1 j t h η b δ b u m η

constant δ 0 1 such that the following inequality holds 2 δ b b δ where the superscript denotes a pseudo inverse operation and denotes euclidean norm based on the system identification method such as towing tank method in rout and subudhi 2017 an estimated quantity can be obtained for the term f η η denoted as f 0 η η and the difference between f 0 η η and f η η is denoted as f η η and there exists fixed but unknown vectors t i 0 i 0 1 2 the following inequality holds zhang et al 2017 3 f η η t 0 t 1 η t 2 η 2 3 adaptive region tracking fault tolerant control with prescribed transient performance in this section it will at first transform the tracking error to a virtual error variable based on prescribed performance functions and logarithm functions and then the region tracking fault tolerant control law is derived in the framework of backstepping technique and adaptive technique is used to estimate the parameters in the bound of the unknown function the transient state and steady state performance requirement of the tracking error can be described by an exponential decay function theodorakopoulos and rovithakis 2015 shown as 4a σ ρ t e i t ρ t i f e i 0 0 4b ρ t e i t σ ρ t i f e i 0 0 where e t η η d and e i t is the ith element of e t for easy of presentation the dependence of e t is suppressed in the later η d is a vector describing auv s desired position and attitude σ is non negative constant and belongs to 0 1 ρ t is an exponentially decaying function described as 5 ρ t ρ 0 ρ exp μ t ρ where ρ 0 and ρ are the initial values and the infinite value of the exponential decay function respectively μ is a non negative constant determining the minimum admissible convergence rate ρ describes the maximum allowable tracking error at the steady state ρ 0 exp μ t also limits the overshoot of the tracking error it should be noticed that the value of ρ 0 should be larger than the absolute value of the auv s initial tracking error in order to guarantee the tracking error to satisfy the requirement in eq 4 the following transformation is adopted 6a z 1 ln l o ξ u p ξ 6b z 2 η α v where ξ e t ρ t if e 0 0 l o i u p σi otherwise l o σi u p i i denotes a vector of compatible dimensions whose elements are one α v is a virtual variable designed later the time derivative of the variable z 1 is expressed by 7 z 1 u p l o u p ξ ξ l o z 2 α v η d ρ t ρ t e ρ t 2 where η d is a vector describing auv s desired velocity in the earth fixed frame denotes the hadamard product according to the routine steps in the framework of backstepping technique the following lyapunov function is selected for the variable z 1 to derive the expression of the virtual variable α v 8 v 1 i 1 6 p 3 ε 1 z 1 i i 1 6 exp λ z 1 i ε 1 i z 1 i ε 1 i 3 3 z 1 i ε 1 i 0 z 1 i ε 1 i where λ is a non negative constant ε 1 is a positive constant vector describing a region that the variable z 1 should be sustained at the steady state z 1 i denotes the ith element of the vector z 1 remark 1 in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2014 theodorakopoulos and rovithakis 2015 and shao et al 2018 the common way is to derive the control law by directly selecting the square of z 1 as a lyapunov function which guarantees the tracking error to satisfy the prescribed transient state and steady state performance however from their simulation results in the above mentioned references the tracking error tends to converge to zero in region tracking the goal is to drive the tracking error into the prescribed region in the steady state rather than converge to zero different from these methods after transforming the tracking error a new lyapunov function 8 is constructed based on a piecewise function so as to achieve region tracking differentiate both sides of eq 8 with respect to time and it follows that 9 v 1 λ p 3 ε 1 z 1 p 2 ε 1 z 1 u p l o u p ξ ξ l o z 2 α v η d ρ t ρ t e 1 ρ t 2 t s i g n z 1 where p 2 ε 1 has the similar form as p 3 ε 1 there exists a sign function in eq 9 which will result in the discontinuity of the virtual variable α v as in the conventional backstepping control design but observing further the expression of eq 9 it is found that the discontinuous point of the sign function is at z 1 0 but v 1 equals to zero when z 1 belongs to the range ε 1 ε 1 due to the special forms of p 2 ε 1 and p 3 ε 1 therefore it provides us a chance to modify the sign function as a continuous one shown as eq 10 10 sgn ε x s i g n x x ε sin π 2 cos π 2 x ε ε x ε then after modifying the form of the sign function eq 9 is rewritten as 11 v 1 λ p 3 ε 1 z 1 p 2 ε 1 z 1 t u p l o u p ξ ξ l o z 2 α v η d ρ t ρ t e 1 ρ t 2 sgn ε 1 z 1 where sgn ε 1 z 1 sgn ε 1 1 z 1 1 sgn ε 1 6 z 1 6 t define the virtual variable α v 12 α v η d ρ t ξ k 1 u p l o sgn ε 1 z 1 f z z 1 n ζ i f z z 1 ε 2 sgn ε 1 z 1 where k 1 is a constant f z z 1 ρ t u p ξ ξ l o n ζ is nussbaum function and its definition can be found in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2011 ε 2 is another positive region vector remark 2 due to the modification of the sign function it can be proved that the virtual variable α v is continuous and smooth now the time derivative of lyapunov function v 1 is rewritten as 13 v 1 λ p 3 ε 1 z 1 p 2 ε 1 z 1 t k 1 i u p l o n ζ i sgn ε 1 z 1 λ p 3 ε 1 z 1 p 2 ε 1 z 1 t u p l o f z z 1 z 2 ε 2 after designing the virtual variable α v the next step is to derive the control law by selecting the following lyapunov function 14 v 2 i 1 6 p 2 ε 2 z 2 i i 1 6 exp λ z 2 i ε 2 i z 2 i ε 2 i 2 2 z 2 i ε 2 i 0 z 2 i ε 2 i also differentiate both sides of eq 14 substitute eq 1 and eq 6b and modify the sign function as eq 10 to give 15 v 2 λ p 2 ε 2 z 2 p 1 ε 2 z 2 f η η h η b δ b u α v t sgn ε 2 z 2 where p 1 ε 2 has the similar form as p 2 ε 2 and sgn ε 2 z 2 also has the similar form as sgn ε 1 z 1 from eq 15 if all terms are known it will be convenient to derive the control law however in practical only an estimated quantity of the term f η η can be obtained and the term δ b caused by the thruster fault is unknown in this paper the adaptive technique is used to achieve region tracking fault tolerant control with prescribed transient state and steady state performances the main results are presented as follows theorem consider an auv in presence of ocean current modelling uncertainty and unknown thruster fault under the action of the continuous control law presented in eqs 16 19 with the adaptive rate shown in eq 20 and eq 21 if the auv s initial state meets that e i 0 ρ 0 the region tracking fault tolerant control with prescribed transient performance are achieved without the help of fault diagnosis system specifically the signals in the closed loop system are bounded without any information of fault diagnosis system and the transformed error remains within the set z 1 i 1 i e the prescribed transient performances are guaranteed while the tracking error at the steady state also stays in the prescribed range 16 u h η b ϕ i

as eqs 16 19 due to the continuity of the virtual variable α v and the feature of p 2 ε 2 when z 2 is within ε 2 ε 2 the control law is continuous and the developed control law is also independent of

prescribed tracking performance i e eq 4 holds on t 0 t f the next step is to prove t f here the proof process in zhang and yang 2017 is adopted i e contradiction method define t f is the time instant when the tracking error is larger than the prescribed performance function due to the continuity of the tracking error it follows that 29a lim t t f e i t lim t t f ρ t o r lim t t f e i t lim t t f σ

indicating that for any t 0 eq 4 holds i e the transformed error also remains the prescribed range at the steady state under the proposed control law 4 simulation verification the proposed adaptive region tacking control scheme with prescribed performance is applied to odin auv to conduct a series of simulations to validate its effectiveness odin auv is a typical open frame underwater vehicle with four horizontal thrusters and four horizontal thrusters and its model parameters were presented in podder and sarkar 2001 in simulation the odin auv s initial state is set as η 0 1 1 1 π 18 π 18 2π 9 and η 0 0 04 0 04 0 04 0 02 0 02 0 02 to be similar to the real ocean environment slowly time varying ocean current is added into the simulations generated by a first order gauss markov process with gaussian white noise mean 1 5 and variance 1 in addition the sideslip angle of ocean current is generated by the sum of gaussian noise with mean 0 and variance 50 and the value of angle of attack equals to half of sideslip angle fossen 2011 zhang et al 2017 although an approximate dynamic model can be obtained by towing tank method modelling uncertainty is evitable in simulations 30 modelling uncertainty is considered i e the parameters of odin auv in the controller is only 70 of the nominal system dynamics in addition it is assumed that the fault is occurred in the second thruster in the horizontal plane and its expression is given as eq 30 where this expression indicates that the thruster is healthy from 0th second to 20th second and then the magnitude of thruster fault is gradually increased after 50th second the magnitude of thruster fault is kept on 0 29 in general however as for controller it does not know this fault in priori 30 k 22 0 t 20 0 29 30 t 20 0 01 sin π 5 t 20 20

as eq 19 and eq 20 in zhang et al 2017 is used to illustrate the advantages of the proposed region tracking control scheme in terms of the transient state and steady state performances of the tracking error the control parameters of the comparative region tracking control in zhang et al 2017 are shown as below ε 2 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 6 g 1 2 g 2 5 k 1 σ 0 1 4 1 first simulation case in this simulation odin auv is controlled to track a spiral trajectory to test the performance of the proposed control scheme in comparison with the controller in zhang et al 2017 and the desired spiral trajectory in the earth fixed frame is described as eq 31 31 ηd xd yd zd φd θd ψd where x d 4 1 cos 0 15t y d 4sin 0 15t z d 0 2t φ d 0 θ d 0 ψ d 0 at first a performance function ρ t 1 2 0 5 e x p 0 1 t 0 5 is used to perform simulations fig 1 is the tracking error and control input for odin auv without thruster fault under the proposed control scheme while the simulation results for odin auv with thruster fault are presented in fig 2 where the dash line denotes the bound of the prescribed performance functions we also conduct simulation for the requirement of high convergence rate in this case the performance function ρ t 1 2 0 5 e x p 0 5 t 0 5 is selected and fig 4 gives the simulation results for this case from figs 1 3 it is seen that tracking error always stays within the bound of the prescribed performance function whether the thruster fault is occurred or not the results are coincidence with the results of the theoretical analysis presented in the above section and the first figures in both figs 1 3 show that the tracking error especially the position tracking error remains the prescribed region but does not converge to zero indicating that the region tracking is achieved under the proposed control law the region tracking control scheme developed in zhang et al 2017 is applied on odin auv to perform comparative simulation in the same environment setup where the desired region is set as 0 5 the simulation result is presented in fig 4 it follows from the results in fig 4 the tracking error after entering the steady state is maintained within the desired region since the region tracking control scheme in zhang et al 2017 only focuses on the tracking performance of the tracking error in the steady stage the transient performance of the tracking error including convergence rate and overshooting cannot be adjusted however the proposed control scheme can adjust the transient performance of the tracking error by selecting different performance functions which are demonstrated by figs 2 and 3 as confirmed by these results the proposed control scheme can guarantee both the transient performance and steady performance of the tracking error in comparison with the region tracking control scheme in zhang et al 2017 for those auv missions that more superior tracking precision is needed the value of ρ should be decreased the proposed control scheme is applied on odin auv with thruster fault to conduct simulations where the performance of the tracking error should satisfy two performance function with the same ρ and different convergence rates fig 5 and fig 6 respectively present the simulation results of the proposed control scheme for the performance function ρ t 1 2 0 1 e x p 0 1 t 0 1 and ρ t 1 2 0 1 e x p 0 5 t 0 1 for comparison the region tracking scheme in zhang et al 2017 is also applied to odin auv to conduct comparative simulation where the desired region is 0 1 unfortunately the region tracking scheme in zhang et al 2017 fails for this case a relatively smaller auv s initial condition is chosen for this simulation case and the simulation results of the comparative method is shown in fig 7 as the value of ρ is reduced the tracking precision of the proposed control scheme is improved see figs 5 and 6 and from figs 5 and 6 it is shown that the tracking error remains within the bound of the pre designed performance function even if the thruster fault is occurred after 20th second it indicates that the proposed region tracking control scheme also can provides a precision tracking when it is required however apart from the convergence rate of the tracking error cannot be adjusted it can be seen from fig 7 a that the position tracking error in y axle based on the comparative controller is out of the desired region 4 2 simulation case with measurement noise this simulation case is to show the performance of the proposed control scheme in presence of measurement noise in this subsection apart from the desired spiral trajectory described in the previous subsection another desired line trajectory is also considered where x d 0 4t y d 0 4t 0 4sin 0 2t z d 0 2t φ d 0 θ d 0 ψ d 0 in simulation a gaussian noise with zero mean and 0 05 variance through a lowpass filter with cut off frequency 1 rad s is added on auv s position signals η while another gaussian noise with zero mean and 0 01 variance through a lowpass filter with cut off frequency 1 rad s is added on auv s speed signals η fig 8 presents the spiral trajectory tracking results for the pre designed performance function ρ t 1 2 0 5 e x p 0 1 t 0 5 when odin auv suffers from thruster fault after 20th second to demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can provide precise tracking performance if required another pre designed performance function ρ t 1 2 0 1 e x p 0 5 t 0 1 is chosen and the spiral trajectory tracking results are presented in fig 9 in line trajectory tracking the tracking error combined with the performance function ρ t 1 2 0 5 e x p 0 1 t 0 5 is shown in fig 10 b under the proposed region tracking control scheme when odin auv is controlled to track a line trajectory while fig 10 a and c respectively present the corresponding path and control input applied to thrusters when increasing the tracking precision and convergence speed simultaneously the line trajectory tracking results are shown in fig 11 where the performance function is chosen as ρ t 1 2 0 1 e x p 0 5 t 0 1 from figs 8 11 it is verified that the proposed control scheme still can satisfy the pre designed performance requirement described by different performance functions in presence of measurement noise but when more superior tracking precision is required a little serious change would occur in the control input when measurement noise is added to auv s states overall these simulation results confirm that in comparison with the region tracking controller in zhang et al 2017 the tracking error obtained from the proposed control scheme can satisfy the requirements of both the transient performance and steady performance even if in presence of measurement noise and the convergence rate and steady error can be tuned based on the mission requirement in the proposed control scheme 5 conclusions this paper proposed an adaptive region tracking control scheme with prescribed transient performance for an auv with thruster fault by combining with prescribed performance control technique and piecewise lyapunov function the stability analysis based on lyapunov theory shows that under the proposed control scheme the tracking error is guaranteed to remain within the prescribed tracking performance even if in presence of unknown thruster fault modelling uncertainty and unknown ocean current simulation results on odin auv also demonstrate that the tracking error in both transient state and steady state under the proposed adaptive region tracking control scheme remain within the bound of the prescribed performance function even if in presence of measurement noise while the comparative controller cannot adjust the transient performance of the tracking error in addition for those mission requiring high precision and quick convergence rate the proposed control scheme still provides satisfactory tracking results whereas the comparative controller fails in terms of region tracking acknowledge this work is

underwater vehicle region tracking prescribed transient performance fault tolerant control thruster fault 1 introduction due to their advantages in terms of mobility and onboard sensing autonomous underwater vehicles auvs can be transformed as autonomous platforms equipped with samplers and sensors to detect dynamic ocean features which are always laborious and difficult for traditional ship based methods or even practically impossible to long term track such features using ships das et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a 2019b therefore auvs have been widely used in marine ecosystem monitoring das et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b in auvs based monitoring auv should follow the trajectory pre programmed or planned based on real time analysis to achieve this task a trajectory tracking system with high reliability is required allibert et al 2019 ferreira et al 2018 guerrero et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in conventional control schemes high tracking precision is the first requirement by users i e the controller s goal is to force the tracking error to converge to zero as much as possible due to ocean current and measurement noise more frequent fluctuation will be introduced in the control input with the increase of the tracking precision in general however in some special applications an auv should be controlled to maintain a special region for observation or data collection li et al 2010 for example in order to detect maximum plankton abundance within the water column the control goal is to maintain the auv within a minimum and maximum depth in water therefore region reaching tracking concept has been proposed for auvs i e the desired target is defined as a region instead of a point li et al 2010 sun and cheah 2008 at present potential energy functions constructed based on the desired region boundary is one typical method to achieve region tracking control for auv where the controller s goal is to guarantee the tracking error at the steady state to be within the desired region based on this region tracking concept ismail and dunnigan 2011a and ismail and dunnigan 2011b developed region tracking control schemes for auv and auv with an on board manipulator respectively however external disturbances e g ocean current were not considered in the mentioned above research works in order to remedy this drawback and guarantee the convergence ability of the tracking error zhang and chu 2014 developed adaptive region tracking control method based on pd neural sliding mode algorithm furthermore mukherjee et al 2015 investigated the compensation of actuator delay in region tracking for auvs with a much strict assumption that input delay was a known constant apart from the above mentioned researches region tracking control with thruster fault also attracts researchers interests ismail et al 2014 developed a fault tolerant region based control for auv by combining with weighted pseudoinverse based control re allocation and the region tracking concept in this design the thruster information including occurrence time magnitude and position of thruster fault should be known in priori in order to be independent with the fault diagnosis system chu and zhu 2017 also investigated the problem of region tracking fault tolerant control and a neural network was used to approximate the unknown function including the effect of thruster fault different from the design principle of region tracking control in the above mentioned references zhang et al 2017 proposed a backstepping based region tracking fault tolerant control scheme for auv with unknown thruster fault where a piecewise and smooth lyapunov function was constructed according to the given desired region all the mentioned above references about region tracking control only focus on the performance of the tracking error in the steady state and the transient performance of the tracking error is not considered however it is a practically crucial but difficult to guarantee the tracking error to satisfy the requirement of both the transient state and the steady state performances prescribed by users shao et al 2018 fortunately prescribed performance control concept was proposed by bechlioulis and rovithakis 2010 in this concept an exponential decay function is used to describe the requirement about the tracking error in both transient state and steady state including steady error convergence time and overshoot for example the prescribed performance control was achieved by error mapping function combined with an exponential decay function describing the performance requirement and extra approximation or compensation structures were not used in theodorakopoulos and rovithakis 2015 and zhang and yang 2019 prescribed performance control concept also was applied to the control of underactuated marine vehicles see in park and yoo 2016 bechlioulis et al 2017 and li et al 2019 case studies have been reported in these references about prescribed performance control where the tracking error in both transient and steady states satisfied the prescribed performance requirements but the tracking error in the steady state still tends to converge to zero motivated by the mentioned above discussion this paper further investigates region tracking problem for auv in presence of ocean current and unknown thruster fault by combining with region tracking concept and prescribed performance control concept the objective of this paper is to synthesize an adaptive region tracking fault tolerant controller for an auv with unknown thruster fault to guarantee that the transient state and steady state performances of the tracking error including overshoot convergence time and the steady error are within the bound of the prescribed performance requirement the main contributions of this paper are presented as follows 1 an adaptive region tracking fault tolerant control scheme with prescribed transient performance is proposed for auvs subject to ocean current and unknown thruster fault in our previous work in zhang et al 2017 the region tracking control was achieved by constructing a piecewise and smooth lyapunov function according to the given desired region and this design only focused on the steady state performance of the tracking error in contrast to the design in zhang et al 2017 the proposed control scheme focuses on both the transient state performance and the steady state performance of the tracking error in region tracking problem on the basis of the piecewise and smooth lyapunov function in zhang et al 2017 a logarithmic error mapping function is used by combining with an exponential decay function describing the performance requirement so as to guarantee that the tracking error in the transient state can satisfy the prescribed performance and the tracking error in the steady state is within the prescribed region but not converges to zero 2 the convergence problem of tracking error is transformed as a boundedness problem by error transformation and the compensation of ocean current modelling uncertainty and thruster fault is achieved in the framework of backstepping technique combined with estimation of the bound of the general uncertainty term and the variation of the thrust distribution matrixes this paper is organized as follows auv s dynamic model is briefly described in the following section section 3 gives adaptive region tracking fault tolerant control with prescribed transient performance the proposed control scheme is verified by simulation results presented in section 4 followed by the conclusions of this paper 2 auv dynamic model with ocean current and thruster fault the dynamic model of an auv with thruster fault is described as eq 1 fossen 2011 zhang et al 2017 1 η m η 1 j t h η b δ b u m η

towing tank method in rout and subudhi 2017 an estimated quantity can be obtained for the term f η η denoted as f 0 η η and the difference between f 0 η η and f η η is denoted as f η η and there exists fixed but unknown vectors t i 0 i 0 1 2 the following inequality holds zhang et al 2017 3 f η η t 0 t 1 η t 2 η 2 3 adaptive region tracking fault tolerant control with prescribed transient performance in this section it will at first transform the tracking error to a virtual error variable based on prescribed performance functions and logarithm functions and then the region tracking fault tolerant control law is derived in the framework of backstepping technique and adaptive technique is used to estimate the parameters in the bound of the unknown function the transient state and steady state performance requirement of the tracking error can be described by an exponential decay function theodorakopoulos and rovithakis 2015 shown as 4a σ ρ t e i t ρ t i f e i 0 0 4b ρ t e i t σ ρ t i f e i 0 0 where e t η η d and e i t is the ith element of e t for easy of presentation the dependence of e t is suppressed in the later η d is a vector describing auv s desired position and attitude σ is non negative constant and belongs to 0 1 ρ t is an exponentially decaying function described as 5 ρ t ρ 0 ρ exp μ t ρ where ρ 0 and ρ are the initial values and the infinite value of the exponential decay function respectively μ is a non negative constant determining the minimum admissible convergence rate ρ describes the maximum allowable tracking error at the steady state ρ 0 exp μ t also limits the overshoot of the tracking error it should be noticed that the value of ρ 0 should be larger than the absolute value of the auv s initial tracking error in order to guarantee the tracking error to satisfy the requirement in eq 4 the following transformation is adopted 6a z 1 ln l o ξ u p ξ 6b z 2 η α v where ξ e t ρ t if e 0 0 l o i u p σi otherwise l o σi u p i i denotes a vector of compatible dimensions whose elements are one α v is a virtual variable designed later the time derivative of the variable z 1 is expressed by 7 z 1 u p l o u p ξ ξ l o z 2 α v η d ρ t ρ t e ρ t 2 where η d is a vector describing auv s desired velocity in the earth fixed frame denotes the hadamard product according to the routine steps in the framework of backstepping technique the following lyapunov function is selected for the variable z 1 to derive the expression of the virtual variable α v 8 v 1 i 1 6 p 3 ε 1 z 1 i i 1 6 exp λ z 1 i ε 1 i z 1 i ε 1 i 3 3 z 1 i ε 1 i 0 z 1 i ε 1 i where λ is a non negative constant ε 1 is a positive constant vector describing a region that the variable z 1 should be sustained at the steady state z 1 i denotes the ith element of the vector z 1 remark 1 in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2014 theodorakopoulos and rovithakis 2015 and shao et al 2018 the common way is to derive the control law by directly selecting the square of z 1 as a lyapunov function which guarantees the tracking error to satisfy the prescribed transient state and steady state performance however from their simulation results in the above mentioned references the tracking error tends to converge to zero in region tracking the goal is to drive the tracking error into the prescribed region in the steady state rather than converge to zero different from these methods after transforming the tracking error a new lyapunov function 8 is constructed based on a piecewise function so as to achieve region tracking differentiate both sides of eq 8 with respect to time and it follows that 9 v 1 λ p 3 ε 1 z 1 p 2 ε 1 z 1 u p l o u p ξ ξ l o z 2 α v η d ρ t ρ t e 1 ρ t 2 t s i g n z 1 where p 2 ε 1 has the similar form as p 3 ε 1 there exists a sign function in eq 9 which will result in the discontinuity of the virtual variable α v as in the conventional backstepping control design but observing further the expression of eq 9 it is found that the discontinuous point of the sign function is at z 1 0 but v 1 equals to zero when z 1 belongs to the range ε 1 ε 1 due to the special forms of p 2 ε 1 and p 3 ε 1 therefore it provides us a chance to modify the sign function as a continuous one shown as eq 10 10 sgn ε x s i g n x x ε sin π 2 cos π 2 x ε ε x ε then after modifying the form of the sign function eq 9 is rewritten as 11 v 1 λ p 3 ε 1 z 1 p 2 ε 1 z 1 t u p l o u p ξ ξ l o z 2 α v η d ρ t ρ t e 1 ρ t 2 sgn ε 1 z 1 where sgn ε 1 z 1 sgn ε 1 1 z 1 1 sgn ε 1 6 z 1 6 t define the virtual variable α v 12 α v η d ρ t ξ k 1 u p l o sgn ε 1 z 1 f z z 1 n ζ i f z z 1 ε 2 sgn ε 1 z 1 where k 1 is a constant f z z 1 ρ t u p ξ ξ l o n ζ is nussbaum function and its definition can be found in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2011 ε 2 is another positive region vector remark 2 due to the modification of the sign function it can be proved that the virtual variable α v is continuous and smooth now the time derivative of lyapunov function v 1 is rewritten as 13 v 1 λ p 3 ε 1 z 1 p 2 ε 1 z 1 t k 1 i u p l o n ζ i sgn ε 1 z 1 λ p 3 ε 1 z 1 p 2 ε 1 z 1 t u p l o f z z 1 z 2 ε 2 after designing the virtual variable α v the next step is to derive the control law by selecting the following lyapunov function 14 v 2 i 1 6 p 2 ε 2 z 2 i i 1 6 exp λ z 2 i ε 2 i z 2 i ε 2 i 2 2 z 2 i ε 2 i 0 z 2 i ε 2 i also differentiate both sides of eq 14 substitute eq 1 and eq 6b and modify the sign function as eq 10 to give 15 v 2 λ p 2 ε 2 z 2 p 1 ε 2 z 2 f η η h η b δ b u α v t sgn ε 2 z 2 where p 1 ε 2 has the similar form as p 2 ε 2 and sgn ε 2 z 2 also has the similar form as sgn ε 1 z 1 from eq 15 if all terms are known it will be convenient to derive the control law however in practical only an estimated quantity of the term f η η can be obtained and the term δ b caused by the thruster fault is unknown in this paper the adaptive technique is used to achieve region tracking fault tolerant control with prescribed transient state and steady state performances the main results are presented as follows theorem consider an auv in presence of ocean current modelling uncertainty and unknown thruster fault under the action of the continuous control law presented in eqs 16 19 with the adaptive rate shown in eq 20 and eq 21 if the auv s initial state meets that e i 0 ρ 0 the region tracking fault tolerant control with prescribed transient performance are achieved without the help of fault diagnosis system specifically the signals in the closed loop system are bounded without any information of fault diagnosis system and the transformed error remains within the set z 1 i 1 i e the prescribed transient performances are guaranteed while the tracking error at the steady state also stays in the prescribed range 16 u h η b ϕ i

as eqs 16 19 due to the continuity of the virtual variable α v and the feature of p 2 ε 2 when z 2 is within ε 2 ε 2 the control law is continuous and the developed control law is also independent of

prescribed tracking performance i e eq 4 holds on t 0 t f the next step is to prove t f here the proof process in zhang and yang 2017 is adopted i e contradiction method define t f is the time instant when the tracking error is larger than the prescribed performance function due to the continuity of the tracking error it follows that 29a lim t t f e i t lim t t f ρ t o r lim t t f e i t lim t t f σ

indicating that for any t 0 eq 4 holds i e the transformed error also remains the prescribed range at the steady state under the proposed control law 4 simulation verification the proposed adaptive region tacking control scheme with prescribed performance is applied to odin auv to conduct a series of simulations to validate its effectiveness odin auv is a typical open frame underwater vehicle with four horizontal thrusters and four horizontal thrusters and its model parameters were presented in podder and sarkar 2001 in simulation the odin auv s initial state is set as η 0 1 1 1 π 18 π 18 2π 9 and η 0 0 04 0 04 0 04 0 02 0 02 0 02 to be similar to the real ocean environment slowly time varying ocean current is added into the simulations generated by a first order gauss markov process with gaussian white noise mean 1 5 and variance 1 in addition the sideslip angle of ocean current is generated by the sum of gaussian noise with mean 0 and variance 50 and the value of angle of attack equals to half of sideslip angle fossen 2011 zhang et al 2017 although an approximate dynamic model can be obtained by towing tank method modelling uncertainty is evitable in simulations 30 modelling uncertainty is considered i e the parameters of odin auv in the controller is only 70 of the nominal system dynamics in addition it is assumed that the fault is occurred in the second thruster in the horizontal plane and its expression is given as eq 30 where this expression indicates that the thruster is healthy from 0th second to 20th second and then the magnitude of thruster fault is gradually increased after 50th second the magnitude of thruster fault is kept on 0 29 in general however as for controller it does not know this fault in priori 30 k 22 0 t 20 0 29 30 t 20 0 01 sin π 5 t 20 20

as eq 19 and eq 20 in zhang et al 2017 is used to illustrate the advantages of the proposed region tracking control scheme in terms of the transient state and steady state performances of the tracking error the control parameters of the comparative region tracking control in zhang et al 2017 are shown as below ε 2 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 6 g 1 2 g 2 5 k 1 σ 0 1 4 1 first simulation case in this simulation odin auv is controlled to track a spiral trajectory to test the performance of the proposed control scheme in comparison with the controller in zhang et al 2017 and the desired spiral trajectory in the earth fixed frame is described as eq 31 31 ηd xd yd zd φd θd ψd where x d 4 1 cos 0 15t y d 4sin 0 15t z d 0 2t φ d 0 θ d 0 ψ d 0 at first a performance function ρ t 1 2 0 5 e x p 0 1 t 0 5 is used to perform simulations fig 1 is the tracking error and control input for odin auv without thruster fault under the proposed control scheme while the simulation results for odin auv with thruster fault are presented in fig 2 where the dash line denotes the bound of the prescribed performance functions we also conduct simulation for the requirement of high convergence rate in this case the performance function ρ t 1 2 0 5 e x p 0 5 t 0 5 is selected and fig 4 gives the simulation results for this case from figs 1 3 it is seen that tracking error always stays within the bound of the prescribed performance function whether the thruster fault is occurred or not the results are coincidence with the results of the theoretical analysis presented in the above section and the first figures in both figs 1 3 show that the tracking error especially the position tracking error remains the prescribed region but does not converge to zero indicating that the region tracking is achieved under the proposed control law the region tracking control scheme developed in zhang et al 2017 is applied on odin auv to perform comparative simulation in the same environment setup where the desired region is set as 0 5 the simulation result is presented in fig 4 it follows from the results in fig 4 the tracking error after entering the steady state is maintained within the desired region since the region tracking control scheme in zhang et al 2017 only focuses on the tracking performance of the tracking error in the steady stage the transient performance of the tracking error including convergence rate and overshooting cannot be adjusted however the proposed control scheme can adjust the transient performance of the tracking error by selecting different performance functions which are demonstrated by figs 2 and 3 as confirmed by these results the proposed control scheme can guarantee both the transient performance and steady performance of the tracking error in comparison with the region tracking control scheme in zhang et al 2017 for those auv missions that more superior tracking precision is needed the value of ρ should be decreased the proposed control scheme is applied on odin auv with thruster fault to conduct simulations where the performance of the tracking error should satisfy two performance function with the same ρ and different convergence rates fig 5 and fig 6 respectively present the simulation results of the proposed control scheme for the performance function ρ t 1 2 0 1 e x p 0 1 t 0 1 and ρ t 1 2 0 1 e x p 0 5 t 0 1 for comparison the region tracking scheme in zhang et al 2017 is also applied to odin auv to conduct comparative simulation where the desired region is 0 1 unfortunately the region tracking scheme in zhang et al 2017 fails for this case a relatively smaller auv s initial condition is chosen for this simulation case and the simulation results of the comparative method is shown in fig 7 as the value of ρ is reduced the tracking precision of the proposed control scheme is improved see figs 5 and 6 and from figs 5 and 6 it is shown that the tracking error remains within the bound of the pre designed performance function even if the thruster fault is occurred after 20th second it indicates that the proposed region tracking control scheme also can provides a precision tracking when it is required however apart from the convergence rate of the tracking error cannot be adjusted it can be seen from fig 7 a that the position tracking error in y axle based on the comparative controller is out of the desired region 4 2 simulation case with measurement noise this simulation case is to show the performance of the proposed control scheme in presence of measurement noise in this subsection apart from the desired spiral trajectory described in the previous subsection another desired line trajectory is also considered where x d 0 4t y d 0 4t 0 4sin 0 2t z d 0 2t φ d 0 θ d 0 ψ d 0 in simulation a gaussian noise with zero mean and 0 05 variance through a lowpass filter with cut off frequency 1 rad s is added on auv s position signals η while another gaussian noise with zero mean and 0 01 variance through a lowpass filter with cut off frequency 1 rad s is added on auv s speed signals η fig 8 presents the spiral trajectory tracking results for the pre designed performance function ρ t 1 2 0 5 e x p 0 1 t 0 5 when odin auv suffers from thruster fault after 20th second to demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can provide precise tracking performance if required another pre designed performance function ρ t 1 2 0 1 e x p 0 5 t 0 1 is chosen and the spiral trajectory tracking results are presented in fig 9 in line trajectory tracking the tracking error combined with the performance function ρ t 1 2 0 5 e x p 0 1 t 0 5 is shown in fig 10 b under the proposed region tracking control scheme when odin auv is controlled to track a line trajectory while fig 10 a and c respectively present the corresponding path and control input applied to thrusters when increasing the tracking precision and convergence speed simultaneously the line trajectory tracking results are shown in fig 11 where the performance function is chosen as ρ t 1 2 0 1 e x p 0 5 t 0 1 from figs 8 11 it is verified that the proposed control scheme still can satisfy the pre designed performance requirement described by different performance functions in presence of measurement noise but when more superior tracking precision is required a little serious change would occur in the control input when measurement noise is added to auv s states overall these simulation results confirm that in comparison with the region tracking controller in zhang et al 2017 the tracking error obtained from the proposed control scheme can satisfy the requirements of both the transient performance and steady performance even if in presence of measurement noise and the convergence rate and steady error can be tuned based on the mission requirement in the proposed control scheme 5 conclusions this paper proposed an adaptive region tracking control scheme with prescribed transient performance for an auv with thruster fault by combining with prescribed performance control technique and piecewise lyapunov function the stability analysis based on lyapunov theory shows that under the proposed control scheme the tracking error is guaranteed to remain within the prescribed tracking performance even if in presence of unknown thruster fault modelling uncertainty and unknown ocean current simulation results on odin auv also demonstrate that the tracking error in both transient state and steady state under the proposed adaptive region tracking control scheme remain within the bound of the prescribed performance function even if in presence of measurement noise while the comparative controller cannot adjust the transient performance of the tracking error in addition for those mission requiring high precision and quick convergence rate the proposed control scheme still provides satisfactory tracking results whereas the comparative controller fails in terms of region tracking acknowledge this work is

purpose of this paper is to study the fatigue crack propagation rates of dh36 steel with the different scenarios between the conventional base metal and butt weld specimens at room temperature rt and 60 c the fatigue crack propagation test and vickers hardness test of butt weld and base metal were performed as a result the fatigue crack propagation test demonstrated a reduced crack propagation rate in both the base metal and the butt weld with a decreasing ambient temperature for the vickers hardness both the welded joint and the base metal at 60 c presents higher hardness values than rt furthermore the welded joint trends to demonstrates a higher value of vickers hardness than base metal finally the behavior of fatigue crack propagation in the micro scale between base metal and butt weld at low temperature was described by the fractography keywords dh36 steel vickers hardness fatigue crack propagation rates compliance procedures low temperature 1 introduction with the continuous development of offshore activities in the polar region the demand of polar ships and offshore structures has considerably increased to operate in the polar environment polar ships and offshore structures in polar region has to encounter with the present sea ice which is the major loads on the structures and low temperatures especially the topside structures or open decks of polar ships above the cold water line cwl which exposes to the harsh marine environments with extremely cold air below freezing temperatures the low temperature causes great changes in the mechanical properties of materials and structures which bring new challenge to the safety operation for polar ships and offshore structures zhao et al 2018 polar ships and offshore structures typically experience millions of load cycles during their service under harsh marine environments which may result in fatigue failure fricke et al 2012 with the increase in the use of high strength steel material for polar ships and offshore structures the fatigue of these structures become more serious polar ships are prone to fatigue degradation due to the dynamic ice loads mainly caused by ship ice interaction chai and leira studied the ice loads acting on ship hulls and the fatigue damage resulting from ice loads actions and observed that the fatigue damage due to ice load actions is directly related to the number and distribution of the stress ranges chai et al 2018 in the polar environment the fatigue properties of steels is considerably affected by the substantial decrease in temperature yan et al 2016 the research methods of fatigue are typically divided into the s n curve method and fracture mechanics method according to the physical integrity of structures krupp 2007 the s n method is mainly used to evaluate the fatigue crack initiation life of the structure nolte k 1976 while the fracture mechanics method is mainly used to evaluate the fatigue crack propagation life paris p 1963 the fatigue properties of structures are evaluated by the s n method in the design phase of the structure once the structure is found to have cracks in the service phase the fracture mechanics method is used to evaluate the fatigue properties of the structure in this state thereby determining whether the structure needs to be repaired or declare worthless the purpose of this paper is to provide theoretical support for fatigue properties in the service phase so the fatigue properties based on fracture mechanics are studied in this paper in addition the fracture mechanics approach can be divided into linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm and elastoplastic fracture mechanics epfm the size of the plastic zone is negligible compared to the length of the crack in most polar structures which is consistent with the conditions of the linear elastic fracture mechanics method lefm therefore the linear elastic fracture mechanics method lefm was used to study the effect of low temperature on fatigue crack propagation rates in this paper based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics method lefm a number of design procedures hsu et al 2013 josefson and ringsberg 2009 kiss and dunai 2002 pipinato et al 2011 have been developed for fatigue prone structural details to evaluate the fatigue properties of polar ships and other welded steel structures albuquerque et al 2015 qian et al 2013 however most of these studies only focus on the parameters in the formulation of paris s law at rt the parameters of the paris formula used in estimating the fatigue life in these design codes derive primarily from the experimental database recorded at rt their validity of these parameters at a low ambient temperature requires further validation to enhance fatigue assessment of welded components in polar ships besides previous investigations have examined experimentally the fatigue crack propagation behavior of structural steels at low temperature such as q345qd liao et al 2018 daeho jeong investigated the fatigue crack propagation behavior of fe25mn and fe16mn2al austenitic steels at 298 and 110 k jeong et al 2016 jae hoon kim carried out the fatigue crack propagation characteristics of base metal and weld joint of 9 ni steel for lng storage tank using ct specimen at rt and 162 c jae hoon kim et al 2010 however the steel that they studied was not commonly used in polar ships or the temperatures they studied were not suitable for the polar environment the low temperature fatigue properties of materials that can be applied to polar structural applications remain to be studied in the polar temperature range 60 c 20 c abs 2019 since dh36 steel is a common steel abs 2019 dnvgl 2017 ccs 2018a for polar structures the evaluation of fatigue crack propagation properties for dh36 grade plates plays an important role in the safety of polar structures dh36 steel is commonly employed on open decks of polar ships side and transverse bulkheads above cwl and strength decks other than 0 4 times the length of the ship the applicable temperature of materials for such components was shown in table 1 ccs 2018b it can be seen that the dh36 steel of these components can cover temperatures of 60 c a similar specification is given by dnv gl dnvgl 2017 therefore the study of fatigue crack propagation rates of dh36 steel at 60 c has great practical significance for the evaluation of fatigue properties of polar ships however there has been limited research on the fatigue crack propagation rates of dh36 steel in low temperature environment therefore the fatigue crack propagation behavior of dh36 steel and its weld commonly used in polar ships at low temperature remains to be studied the fatigue crack propagation behavior can be analyzed by many factors such as the microstructure vickers hardness and fractography some research efforts have studied the effects of vickers hardness on the fatigue crack propagation under low temperature zhang et al 2012 casagrande et al 2011 li et al 2018 chapetti 2017 such as chunguo zhang studied and examined using hardness measurements in conjunction with fatigue crack propagation measurements he found that vickers hardness and fatigue crack propagation rates have a close relationship zhang et al 2012 it is worth noting that all of them found that the hardness has a non negligible impact on the fatigue crack propagation this paper aims to investigate the effect of low temperature on the fatigue crack propagation behavior of the dh36 steel and its butt weld the tests also try to determine the relationship between the vickers hardness and fatigue crack propagation behavior based on the experimental results this study attempts to recommend reasonable paris law parameters for the fatigue life assessment of cracked welded details under a low ambient temperature this study firstly describes the testing material and the detailed experimental procedure in section 2 section 3 presents the testing results and their data processing section 4 discusses the effect of low temperatures on the fatigue crack propagation behavior and compares the fatigue crack propagation properties of the base metal and butt weld the last section summarizes the primary conclusions drawn from the present study 2 fatigue crack propagation test 2 1 material descriptions the steel plate used in this test was dh36 steel plate certified by american bureau of shipping abs table 2 shows the chemical compositions of dh36 the typical mechanical properties of dh36 steel were shown in table 3 the sampling direction was the rolling direction of the steel plate to ensure the same mechanical properties as shown in fig 1 a the welded plate consists of two pieces of dh36 base steel plates butt welded together with a y groove through a multi pass manual flux cored arc welding process the groove size is shown in fig 1 b the welding procedure is performed according to the welding process of the actual ship the carbon dioxide arc welding was used for welding the welding wire is che50 and the welding current is 200a other details refer to rulers for material and welding given by china classification society ccs ccs 2018c it is worth noting that the butt weld specimen was created such that the crack will initiate at the fusion zone rather than initiating within the weld zone for polar structures cracks usually initiate at the weld toe and then propagate along the fusion zone xiong and hu 2012 therefore the crack propagation properties of the fusion zone play an important role in the safety of polar structures generally the fatigue crack propagation behavior with different microstructures is different so it is necessary to investigate the microstructure of the crack propagation zone the microstructure of base metal and its butt weld is different yuan et al 2018 observations under an optical microscope reveals the microstructures of the base metal and butt weld the comparison of these materials was shown in fig 2 in the weld zone wz there is a great amount of bainite and it contains a part of the m a island the m a island consists of martensite and retained austenite lan et al 2011 as shown in fig 2 a the fusion zone fz is in the transition zone from the weld metal to the base metal in the area close to the weld the fz is narrow with the completely melted weld zone and the completely infusible heat affected zone on both sides and as shown in fig 2 b the grains in the zone are coarse and the chemical composition and composition are very complex a certain amount of lath like martensite exists in the heat affected zone haz and a part of ferrite staggered as shown in fig 2 c the zone of the base material bm portion is mainly flaky pearlite and quasi polygonal ferrite as shown in fig 2 d 2 2 the design of specimens the size of specimens was referred to the astm e647 15 alvaro and akselsen simulated butt weld by heating the crack extension zone to 1350 c and then cooling to rt antonio alvaro et al 2015 however this method of heating did not directly reflect the characteristics of the weld therefore this paper created a real weld on the specimen to study the crack propagation characteristics of the weld fig 3 and fig 4 are dimensional drawings of specimens in two forms base metal butt weld there were six specimens for base metal and butt weld respectively for the specimen of butt weld the weld seam needed to be ground away on a grinding machine as this paper is to study the low temperature crack propagation characteristics of the fusion zone it is necessary to eliminate the influence of the weld geometric stress concentration the specimen of butt weld needed to be welded the two plates need to meet the parallelism requirements which means the misalignment at any point should be no more than 5 of the thickness as shown in fig 5 ccs 2018c 2 3 crack prefabrication the experimental procedure consisted of a fatigue pre cracking stage and a crack propagation stage the fatigue pre cracking produced a sharp crack tip ahead of the machined notch with a pre cracking length of approximately 2 3 mm cracks were prefabricated according to astm e647 15 the importance of precracking is to provide a sharpened fatigue crack of adequate size and straightness which ensures that 1 the effect of the machined starter notch is removed from the specimen k calibration 2 the effects on subsequent crack growth rate data caused by changing crack front shape or precrack load history are eliminated 2 4 load the test was carried out at rt 20 c and 60 c the temperature was controlled by a low chamber fig 6 a the temperature change was not more than 2 c and the loading equipment was a pws 250 fatigue machine the specimen was rigidly clamped at one end and loaded at the other end as shown in fig 6 b the peak of loading force was 15 kn the valley value was 1 5 kn the stress ratio r was 0 1 the load form was sinusoidal tensile load and the loading frequency was 10 hz as shown in fig 7 3 results in the fatigue crack propagation rate test the crack length could be determined by the compliance procedures astm 2015 the test procedure engaged a displacement gauge to monitor the displacement was shown in fig 8 which allowed a measurement of the crack size 1 u 0 b e v 0 f 1 2 1 1 where u 0 denotes the compliance which is the reciprocal of the force displacement slope normalized for elastic modulus and specimen thickness b denotes the thickness of specimen e denotes the elastic modulus v 0 denotes the displacement at the measuring point that is the displacement measured by the crack opening displacement cod gauge f denotes the load the relationship between compliance and normalized crack length is shown in equation 2 2 a w 1 001 4 6695 u 0 18 46 u 0 2 236 82 u 0 3 1214 9 u 0 4 2143 6 u 0 5 where a denotes the length of crack w denotes the width of specimen in order to obtain more stable and accurate results the relationship of a n measured by the test is processed by 7 point incremental polynomial method paris pointed out that the stress intensity factor δ k is the main parameter controlling the fatigue crack propagation rate and gives a formula describing the fatigue crack propagation rate astm 2015 3 d a d n c δ k m 4 δ k δ p b w 2 α 1 α 3 2 0 886 4 64 α 13 32 α 2 14 72 α 3 5 6 α 4 where a denotes the length of crack n denotes cycles c m denotes crack propagation parameters determined by test δ k denotes the range of stress intensity factor δ p denotes the range of load b denotes the thickness of specimen w denotes the width of specimen α denotes the crack depth ratio a w the above test data was processed by the compliance procedures in astm e647 2015 however the specification does not give a test temperature low temperature can cause the changing of mechanical properties such as elastic modulus and yield strength of dh36 steel it can affect the fatigue crack propagation behavior of dh36 steel accordingly the applicability of the compliance procedures was studied at 60 c which is the minimum range of temperature that structures can be experienced abs 2019 based on the interactive platform of franc 3d and abaqus the fatigue crack propagation behavior of dh36 steel was simulated at rt and 60 c the specimen used c3d8r reduction elements the initial crack was introduced in franc 3d and the element type of the crack tip was set to singular elements the effect of low temperature on the mechanical properties of the material elastic modulus yield strength etc was considered the stress intensity factor of the crack tip evaluated by m integral knowles and stemberg kiss and dunai 2002 pipinato et al 2011 applied the nocther s theory to the variational principle and the elastic potential energy principle to propose m integral the mathematical explanation for each conservation law is that the integral of a certain function is equal to 0 around the region of the deformation elastic body in the case of type i loading 5 m 2 a 1 μ 2 e k i 2 2 a g i where m devotes the m integral a devotes the crack length μ devotes the poisson s ratio e devotes the elastic modulus k i devotes the stress intensity factor g i devotes the energy release rate what s more the temperature 60 c was not applied to the finite element model while calculating the δ k at 60 c the finite element model of the c t specimen is shown in fig 9 the results of fem are plotted in one figure as the a v 0 curve obtained by the compliance procedures as shown in fig 10 a it can be seen from the fig 10 a that there is a clear difference between the crack length considering the change of the elastic modulus and the crack length without considering the change of the elastic modulus this means that the crack length a of the c t specimen obtained by the compliance procedures should take into account the change in elastic modulus then the accuracy of the δ k obtained by the compliance procedures was verified by the compliance procedures fem and theoretical method as shown in fig 10 b among them the theoretical solution of the stress intensity factor of the c t sample is as follows 6 k p b w 29 6 a w 1 2 185 5 a w 3 2 655 7 a w 5 2 1017 a w 7 2 639 a w 9 2 where k is the stress intensity factor p is the load it can be seen from fig 10 a that the a v 0 curve obtained by the compliance procedures without considering the change of elastic modulus fem have obvious differences however there is no significant difference between the various methods in fig 10 b the difference in the a v 0 curve is caused by the change of elastic modulus however δ k and the elastic modulus are not theoretically directly related therefore δ k is not affected by the change of elastic modulus in summary as long as the change of the elastic modulus of dh36 steel was considered in this paper the a and δ k obtained by the compliance and fem method can be accurate at rt and 60 c taking the logarithm of both sides of equation 1 is shown in equation 7 7 lg d a d n lg c m lg δ k it can be seen that lg d a d n and lg δ k became a linear relationship which can be applied with the linear regression on the data by the mean of least squares method in order to estimate c and m parameters table 4 summarizes the paris law parameters c and m of both materials for the tested stress ratios at different temperatures which derive from the best fitting curves of the fatigue data the values of all the correlation coefficient r 2 of the paris law fitting approach exceed 0 9 showing a high level of correlation between the test data and the paris equation for the base metal at the stress ratio of r 0 1 with the descent of temperature the m value increases and the c value decreases for the butt weld at stress ratios r 0 1 the same variation in the m and c value with respect to the decreasing temperature exists as the base metal at the stress ratios of r 0 1 however the change in c and m of butt weld is smaller than that of base metal the six sets of fatigue crack propagation rates curves of base metal and butt weld are converted to the mean fatigue crack propagation rates curves by least squares respectively the mean of fatigue crack propagation rates of base metal at rt and 60 c butt weld at rt and 60 c are plotted in fig 11 a in general the crack propagation rate of base metal and butt weld at rt is higher than that of 60 c at the same δ k fig 11 b shows that the mean of fatigue crack propagation rate of the base metal at rt and 60 c it can be seen that the fatigue crack propagation rate of base metal at rt is 45 396 58 644 higher than that of 60 c at the same δ k for butt weld the mean fatigue crack propagation rate at rt and 60 c is demonstrated in fig 11 c propagation rate of fatigue crack for butt weld at rt is about 56 211 58 644 higher than that of 60 c at the same δ k fig 11 d shows the comparison of propagation rate for mean fatigue crack between the base metal and butt weld at rt the results of base mental represents the higher value of crack propagation rate than butt weld at rt when δ k 40 mpa m on the other hand the results demonstrate the opposite trend when the value of stress intensity factor δ k higher than 40 mpa m the crack propagation rate of fatigue for the base metal at rt has lower values than butt weld the results of mean fatigue crack propagation for the base metal and the butt weld at 60 c are plotted in the same figure as illustrated in fig 11 e it can be seen that propagation rate of fatigue crack depends on the value of stress intensity factors δ k when δ k 35 mpa m the fatigue crack propagation rate of the base metal is higher than that the butt weld whereas δ k 35 mpa m the fatigue crack propagation rate of the butt weld is higher than the base metal 4 discussion in order to investigated the fatigue crack propagation the microstructure of crack path should be addressed clearly the behavior of fatigue crack propagation can be divided into three stages the crack initiation stage the crack stable propagation stage and the crack instable propagation stage after the crack initiation under the action of the alternating load the main slip surface of the slip band ie the direction of the maximum shear stress extends immediately toward the interior of the metal eisenhut et al 2017 then the crack enters a stable propagation stage at this time the crack propagates in a direction perpendicular to the normal stress stably and the crack always extends along the fusion zone as shown in fig 12 eventually the behavior of fatigue crack propagation approaches to the last stage or instable stage which produces the larger crack size and reduces the cross sectional area of the specimen significantly this causes a high stress in the sample and it occurs only a few cycles before the specimen failure the fatigue crack is propagated along the direction of the maximum shear stress combined with vickers hardness and fractography the effect of temperature on the fatigue crack propagation rate of dh36 steel and its butt weld was analyzed in this paper the crack propagation rate of dh36 steel base metal and its butt weld at the same temperature was also discussed 4 1 low temperature effects as can be seen from fig 11 a and b the fatigue crack propagation rate of the base metal and the butt weld at rt is higher than 60 c in order to analyze the effect of low temperature on fatigue crack propagation behavior the paper illustrated the vickers hardness and fractography of base and weld c t specimens at rt and 60 c under the stable propagation zone for r 0 1 4 1 1 hardness profiles the vickers hardness plays an important role in fatigue crack propagation rate cortés et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 shaniavskiy and toushentsov 2010 vickers hardness tests were conducted near the fatigue crack propagation path across the bm haz fz wz of specimen at rt and 60 c all vickers hardness were obtained at indentation load of 20 kg f by using mitutoyo hardness tester model avk c2 the vickers hardness profiles are presented in fig 13 as can be seen from fig 13 at rt the vickers hardness of bm is 161 171hv the vickers hardness of haz is 170 199 hv the vickers hardness of fz is 211 223 hv and the vickers hardness of wz is 182 205 hv at 60 c the vickers hardness of bm is 169 180 7hv the vickers hardness of haz is 176 3 223 4 hv the vickers hardness of fz is 223 4 229 4 hv and the vickers hardness of wz is 187 8 198 6 hv the vickers hardness of the base metal at 60 c is 17 4 hv higher than that of rt the vickers hardness at 60 c is 12 4 hv higher than that of rt combined with figs 11 and 13 it can be found that the discrepancy in vickers hardness is caused by the different temperature the relationship between the vickers hardness and the fatigue crack propagation rate is closely correlated at entire δ k regime however when the discrepancy in vickers hardness is caused by the different temperature the relationship between the vickers hardness and the fatigue crack propagation rate is only correlated at low δ k regime besides it is also found that the influence of low temperature on the vickers hardness of different regions of the welded joint is different the microstructure of bm is mainly flaky pearlite and quasi polygonal ferrite and the vickers hardness increases from rt to 60 c by an average of 10 08 hv the microstructure of haz is a lath like martensite and a small amount of ferrite and the vickers hardness changes little from rt to 60 c the vickers hardness of fz increased by an average of 9 4 hv from rt to 60 c the microstructure of wz is bainite and the vickers hardness at rt to 60 c is only increased by 0 54 hv one can find that only the vickers hardness of bm and fz is sensitive to low temperatures which is related to the microstructure inside the area one can also be considered that the vickers hardness of flaky pearlite and quasi polygonal ferrite is sensitive to low temperature and the vickers hardness of lath like martensite and bainite is not sensitive to low temperature 4 1 2 fractography for base metal specimens the fracture surface of the crack initiation zone in fig 14 a and fig 14 d shows a typical transgranular cleavage surface characterized by a river pattern and a cleavage step the fracture surface of stable propagation stage in fig 14 b and fig 14 e fracture surface at both temperatures have obvious fatigue striations according to the plastic passivation model proposed by laird and krause 1968 each propagation of the crack has to pass through the process of opening passivation expansion sharpening such a complete process is a stress cycle that leaves a trace on the crack surface called the fatigue striation therefore a fatigue striation represents a stress cycle process and the spacing of the fatigue striations represents the distance corresponding to the crack propagation of the stress cycle which can reflect the fatigue crack propagation rate richter trummer et al 2013 the spacing of fatigue striations at the rt is wider than that of 60 c which reflects the fatigue crack propagation rate of the base metal at rt is higher than that of 60 c the fracture surface of instantaneous fracture zone in fig 14 c and fig 14 f the fractures have obvious dimples at the two temperatures and the fracture states in this region are plastic fractures therefore there is no remarkable morphological difference between base metal at rt and 60 c in the fracture mode for butt weld specimens the fracture surface fig 15 a and fig 15 d of the crack initiation zone at the rt features the transgranular quasi cleavage facet with a mixture of short river pattern small cleavage plane and tearing ridge while the fractographs at 60 c exhibit cleavage fracture with river patterns and cleavage steps the fracture surface of the stable propagation stage in fig 15 b and fig 15 e the spacing of fatigue striations at the rt is wider than that of 60 c which reflects the fatigue crack propagation rate of the butt metal at rt is higher than 60 c the fracture surface of instantaneous fracture zone in fig 15 c and fig 15 f the cleavage step of the butt weld fracture at rt coexists with the dimple which is a mixed fracture the fracture at 60 c presents a fan shaped cleavage river pattern at low temperatures when the difference in orientation between adjacent grains is large the cleavage cracks along the expansion direction to the grain boundary and impacts the grain boundary and nucleates in the next grain and expands outward in the shape of a fan a fan shaped cleavage fracture is formed srivatsan et al 1991 this implies the fracture mode has shifted from quasi cleavage to cleavage as the temperature decreases from the rt to 60 c the vickers hardness at 60 c is higher than that of rt the fatigue crack propagation rate of dh36 steel base metal and butt weld at 60 c is lower than that of rt and the spacing of fatigue fringes on the fracture at 60 c is also smaller than that of rt at entire δ k it can be found that the vickers hardness fatigue crack propagation rates and fatigue fracture surface characterizations are closely correlated at low δ k regime these results of base metal are in agreement with the conclusions reported by x w liao but results of butt weld are opposite to conclusion reported by him liao et al 2018 the resistance against fatigue crack propagation of the butt weld increases at a decreasing ambient temperature in this paper while the fatigue crack propagation rate of butt weld accelerates at the low ambient temperature in his research this is because the crack tip he studied is located on the center line of the butt weld and the crack spreads on this center line the area where this center line is located at wz the crack tip of this paper is located at the boundary line between the butt weld and the base metal and the crack extends along this boundary line which is located at fz in the study of x w liao the microstructure of the wz is a mixture of bainite acicular ferrite and a little perlite which leads to satisfactory low temperature toughness in this paper the microstructure of the fz is very complex with coarse grains the mechanical properties of fz are weak in welded joints which largely determine the properties of welded joints it can be seen that the fz in this paper and wz in study of x w liao have different microstructure and mechanical properties their crack propagation performance is also very different 4 2 comparison of fatigue crack propagation behavior between base metal and butt weld 1 discussion of results with vickers hardness measurements the vickers hardness of the fz is 62 hv higher than that of the bm at rt and the vickers hardness of the fz is 68 4 hv higher than that of the bm at 60 c fig 12 combining figs 12 10 a and b it is worth noting that the fatigue crack propagation rate increases with the vickers hardness decreases at low δ k regime but as δ k increases this relationship is no longer maintained this can attribute to the micro failure mode in the low expansion rate region is single shear and the influence of the microstructure property is large so the hardness of the material has a great influence on it in the stable propagation stage its micro failure mode is the striated or double slip mode and the influence of microstructure performance is small so the hardness of the material has little influence on it in the instantaneous fracture zone its micro failure mode is the additional static mode the fatigue crack propagation rate at this time is quite sensitive to hardness however the fatigue crack propagation rates at this stage is so large that the effect of hardness is not significant landersheim et al 2012 the fatigue crack propagation rates of base metal and butt weld tend to decrease with decreasing temperature due to different mechanisms other than the vickers hardness residual stress and a variety of metallurgical factors including grain size and phase transformation may affect the fatigue crack propagation behavior of the welds which further complicates the understanding on the fatigue crack propagation behavior of the welds because of such difficulties the fatigue crack propagation studies on steel welds are extremely limited despite the practical importance in order to understand the effect of microstructure of dh36 steel and its butt weld on fatigue crack propagation behavior optical micrographic observation was conducted combined with fig 2 b and d it can be seen that the microstructure of both zones is absolutely different the grains in fz are coarse the chemical composition and composition in fz are very complex fig 2 b the microstructure of the bm is mainly flaky pearlite and quasi polygonal ferrite fig 2 d 2 discussion of results with the analysis of the fracture surfaces there is no remarkable morphological difference between base metal and butt weld at rt in the fracture mode at 60 c the fracture surface of the stable propagation stage is shown in figs 14 e and fig 15 e the spacing of fatigue striations of butt weld is wider than that of base metal at 60 c which reflects the fatigue crack propagation rate of the butt weld is higher than base metal at 60 c the fracture surface of instantaneous fracture zone is shown in figs 14 f and fig 15 f the cleavage step of the butt weld fracture at rt coexists with the dimple which is a mixed fracture the fracture at 60 c presents a fan shaped cleavage river pattern 5 conclusions this paper investigated the fatigue crack propagation behavior of dh36 base metal and its butt weld by fatigue crack propagation tests and vickers hardness tests at rt and 60 c the above investigation leads to the following conclusions 1 the compliance procedures in the specification is still suitable at 60 c but the effect of low temperature on the elastic modulus of the material must be considered 2 the presence of low temperature causes a decrease in the fatigue crack propagation rate of the base metal and weld fusion zone at 60 c the fatigue crack propagation rate at the weld fusion zone is higher than that of the base metal 3 vickers hardness has a significant effect on crack propagation rate only at low δ k but vickers hardness may have insignificant effects on crack propagation rate at high δ k 4 for ship structures that are exposed to 60 c the anti fatigue design of these ship structures can refer to the fatigue crack growth rate at 60 c similarly for ship structures that are exposed to room temperature the anti fatigue design of these ship structures can refer to the fatigue crack growth rate at room temperature

22226,as common marine steel for polar ships the fatigue crack propagation rates of dh36 steel at low temperature have a crucial influence on the evaluation of the fatigue strength of polar ships the purpose of this paper is to study the fatigue crack propagation rates of dh36 steel with the different scenarios between the conventional base metal and butt weld specimens at room temperature rt and 60 c the fatigue crack propagation test and vickers hardness test of butt weld and base metal were performed as a result the fatigue crack propagation test demonstrated a reduced crack propagation

development of offshore activities in the polar region the demand of polar ships and offshore structures has considerably increased to operate in the polar environment polar ships and offshore

evaluate the fatigue properties of the structure in this state thereby determining whether the structure needs to be repaired or declare worthless the purpose of this paper is to provide theoretical support for fatigue properties in the service phase so the fatigue properties based on fracture mechanics are studied in this paper in addition the fracture mechanics approach can be divided into linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm and elastoplastic fracture mechanics epfm the size of the plastic zone is negligible compared to the length of the crack in most polar structures which is consistent with the conditions of the linear elastic fracture mechanics method lefm therefore the linear elastic fracture mechanics method lefm was used to study the effect of low temperature on fatigue crack propagation rates in this paper based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics method lefm a number of design procedures hsu et al 2013 josefson and ringsberg 2009 kiss and dunai 2002 pipinato et al 2011 have been developed for fatigue prone structural details to evaluate the fatigue properties of polar ships and other welded steel structures albuquerque et al 2015 qian et al 2013 however most of these studies only focus on the parameters in the formulation of paris s law at rt the parameters of the paris formula used in estimating the fatigue life in these design codes derive primarily from the experimental database recorded at rt their validity of these parameters at a low ambient temperature requires further validation to enhance fatigue assessment of welded components in polar ships besides previous investigations have examined experimentally the fatigue crack propagation behavior of structural steels at low temperature such as q345qd liao et al 2018 daeho jeong investigated the fatigue crack propagation behavior of fe25mn and fe16mn2al austenitic steels at 298 and 110 k jeong et al 2016 jae hoon kim carried out the fatigue crack propagation characteristics of base metal and weld joint of 9 ni steel for lng storage tank using ct specimen at rt and 162 c jae hoon kim et al 2010 however the steel that they studied was not commonly used in polar ships or the temperatures they studied were not suitable for the polar environment the low temperature fatigue properties of materials that can be applied to polar structural applications remain to be studied in the polar temperature range 60 c 20 c abs 2019 since dh36 steel is a common steel abs 2019 dnvgl 2017 ccs 2018a for polar structures the evaluation of fatigue crack propagation properties for dh36 grade plates plays an important role in the safety of polar structures dh36 steel is commonly employed on open decks of polar ships side and transverse bulkheads above cwl and strength decks other than 0 4 times the length of the ship the applicable temperature of materials for such components was shown in table 1 ccs 2018b it can be seen that the dh36 steel of these components can cover temperatures of 60 c a similar specification is given by dnv gl dnvgl 2017 therefore the study of fatigue crack propagation rates of dh36 steel at 60 c has great practical significance for the evaluation of fatigue properties of polar ships however there has been limited research on the fatigue crack propagation rates of dh36 steel in low temperature environment therefore the fatigue crack propagation behavior of dh36 steel and its weld commonly used in polar ships at low temperature remains to be studied the fatigue crack propagation behavior can be analyzed by many factors such as the microstructure vickers hardness and fractography some research efforts have studied the effects of vickers hardness on the fatigue crack propagation under low temperature zhang et al 2012 casagrande et al 2011 li et al 2018 chapetti 2017 such as chunguo zhang studied and examined using hardness measurements in conjunction with fatigue crack propagation measurements he found that vickers hardness and fatigue crack propagation rates have a close relationship zhang et al 2012 it is worth noting that all of them found that the hardness has a non negligible impact on the fatigue crack propagation this paper aims to investigate the effect of low temperature on the fatigue crack propagation behavior of the dh36 steel and its butt weld the tests also try to determine the relationship between the vickers hardness and fatigue crack propagation behavior based on the experimental results this study attempts to recommend reasonable paris law parameters for the fatigue life assessment of cracked welded details under a low ambient temperature this study firstly describes the testing material and the detailed experimental procedure in section 2 section 3 presents the testing results and their data processing section 4 discusses the effect of low temperatures on the fatigue crack propagation behavior and compares the fatigue crack propagation properties of the base metal and butt weld the last section summarizes the primary conclusions drawn from the present study 2 fatigue crack propagation test 2 1 material descriptions the steel plate used in this test was dh36 steel plate certified by american bureau of shipping abs table 2 shows the chemical compositions of dh36 the typical mechanical properties of dh36 steel were shown in table 3 the sampling direction was the rolling direction of the steel plate to ensure the same mechanical properties as shown in fig 1 a the welded plate consists of two pieces of dh36 base steel plates butt welded together with a y groove through a multi pass manual flux cored arc welding process the groove size is shown in fig 1 b the welding procedure is performed according to the welding process of the actual ship the carbon dioxide arc welding was used for welding the welding wire is che50 and the welding current is 200a other details refer to rulers for material and welding given by china classification society ccs ccs 2018c it is worth noting that the butt weld specimen was created such that the crack will initiate at the fusion zone rather than initiating within the weld zone for polar structures cracks usually initiate at the weld toe and then propagate along the fusion zone xiong and hu 2012 therefore the crack propagation properties of the fusion zone play an important role in the safety of polar structures generally the fatigue crack propagation behavior with different microstructures is different so it is necessary to investigate the microstructure of the crack propagation zone the microstructure of base metal and its butt weld is different yuan et al 2018 observations under an optical microscope reveals the microstructures of the base metal and butt weld the comparison of these materials was shown in fig 2 in the weld zone wz there is a great amount of bainite and it contains a part of the m a island the m a island consists of martensite and retained austenite lan et al 2011 as shown in fig 2 a the fusion zone fz is in the transition zone from the weld metal to the base metal in the area close to the weld the fz is narrow with the completely melted weld zone and the completely infusible heat affected zone on both sides and as shown in fig 2 b the grains in the zone are coarse and the chemical composition and composition are very complex a certain amount of lath like martensite exists in the heat affected zone haz and a part of ferrite staggered as shown in fig 2 c the zone of the base material bm portion is mainly flaky pearlite and quasi polygonal ferrite as shown in fig 2 d 2 2 the design of specimens the size of specimens was referred to the astm e647 15 alvaro and akselsen simulated butt weld by heating the crack extension zone to 1350 c and then cooling to rt antonio alvaro et al 2015 however this method of heating did not directly reflect the characteristics of the weld therefore this paper created a real weld on the specimen to study the crack propagation characteristics of the weld fig 3 and fig 4 are dimensional drawings of specimens in two forms base metal butt weld there were six specimens for base metal and butt weld respectively for the specimen of butt weld the weld seam needed to be ground away on a grinding machine as this paper is to study the low temperature crack propagation characteristics of the fusion zone it is necessary to eliminate the influence of the weld geometric stress concentration the specimen of butt weld needed to be welded the two plates need to meet the parallelism requirements which means the misalignment at any point should be no more than 5 of the thickness as shown in fig 5 ccs 2018c 2 3 crack prefabrication the experimental procedure consisted of a fatigue pre cracking stage and a crack propagation stage the fatigue pre cracking produced a sharp crack tip ahead of the machined notch with a pre cracking length of approximately 2 3 mm cracks were prefabricated according to astm e647 15 the importance of precracking is to provide a sharpened fatigue crack of adequate size and straightness which ensures that 1 the effect of the machined starter notch is removed from the specimen k calibration 2 the effects on subsequent crack growth rate data caused by changing crack front shape or precrack load history are eliminated 2 4 load the test was carried out at rt 20 c and 60 c the temperature was controlled by a low chamber fig 6 a the temperature change was not more than 2 c and the loading equipment was a pws 250 fatigue machine the specimen was rigidly clamped at one end and loaded at the other end as shown in fig 6 b the peak of loading force was 15 kn the valley value was 1 5 kn the stress ratio r was 0 1 the load form was sinusoidal tensile load and the loading frequency was 10 hz as shown in fig 7 3 results in the fatigue crack propagation rate test the crack length could be determined by the compliance procedures astm 2015 the test procedure engaged a displacement gauge to monitor the displacement was shown in fig 8 which allowed a measurement of the crack size 1 u 0 b e v 0 f 1 2 1 1 where u 0 denotes the compliance which is the reciprocal of the force displacement slope normalized for elastic modulus and specimen thickness b denotes the thickness of specimen e denotes the elastic modulus v 0 denotes the displacement at the measuring point that is the displacement measured by the crack opening displacement cod gauge f denotes the load the relationship between compliance and normalized crack length is shown in equation 2 2 a w 1 001 4 6695 u 0 18 46 u 0 2 236 82 u 0 3 1214 9 u 0 4 2143 6 u 0 5 where a denotes the length of crack w denotes the width of specimen in order to obtain more stable and accurate results the relationship of a n measured by the test is processed by 7 point incremental polynomial method paris pointed out that the stress intensity factor δ k is the main parameter controlling the fatigue crack propagation rate and gives a formula describing the fatigue crack propagation rate astm 2015 3 d a d n c δ k m 4 δ k δ p b w 2 α 1 α 3 2 0 886 4 64 α 13 32 α 2 14 72 α 3 5 6 α 4 where a denotes the length of crack n denotes cycles c m denotes crack propagation parameters determined by test δ k denotes the range of stress intensity factor δ p denotes the range of load b denotes the thickness of specimen w denotes the width of specimen α denotes the crack depth ratio a w the above test data was processed by the compliance procedures in astm e647 2015 however the specification does not give a test temperature low temperature can cause the changing of mechanical properties such as elastic modulus and yield strength of dh36 steel it can affect the fatigue crack propagation behavior of dh36 steel accordingly the applicability of the compliance procedures was studied at 60 c which is the minimum range of temperature that structures can be experienced abs 2019 based on the interactive platform of franc 3d and abaqus the fatigue crack propagation behavior of dh36 steel was simulated at rt and 60 c the specimen used c3d8r reduction elements the initial crack was introduced in franc 3d and the element type of the crack tip was set to singular elements the effect of low temperature on the mechanical properties of the material elastic modulus yield strength etc was considered the stress intensity factor of the crack tip evaluated by m integral knowles and stemberg kiss and dunai 2002 pipinato et al 2011 applied the nocther s theory to the variational principle and the elastic potential energy principle to propose m integral the mathematical explanation for each conservation law is that the integral of a certain function is equal to 0 around the region of the deformation elastic body in the case of type i loading 5 m 2 a 1 μ 2 e k i 2 2 a g i where m devotes the m integral a devotes the crack length μ devotes the poisson s ratio e devotes the elastic modulus k i devotes the stress intensity factor g i devotes the energy release rate what s more the temperature 60 c was not applied to the finite element model while calculating the δ k at 60 c the finite element model of the c t specimen is shown in fig 9 the results of fem are plotted in one figure as the a v 0 curve obtained by the compliance procedures as shown in fig 10 a it can be seen from the fig 10 a that there is a clear difference between the crack length considering the change of the elastic modulus and the crack length without considering the change of the elastic modulus this means that the crack length a of the c t specimen obtained by the compliance procedures should take into account the change in elastic modulus then the accuracy of the δ k obtained by the compliance procedures was verified by the compliance procedures fem and theoretical method as shown in fig 10 b among them the theoretical solution of the stress intensity factor of the c t sample is as follows 6 k p b w 29 6 a w 1 2 185 5 a w 3 2 655 7 a w 5 2 1017 a w 7 2 639 a w 9 2 where k is the stress intensity factor p is the load it can be seen from fig 10 a that the a v 0 curve obtained by the compliance procedures without considering the change of elastic modulus fem have obvious differences however there is no significant difference between the various methods in fig 10 b the difference in the a v 0 curve is caused by the change of elastic modulus however δ k and the elastic modulus are not theoretically directly related therefore δ k is not affected by the change of elastic modulus in summary as long as the change of the elastic modulus of dh36 steel was considered in this paper the a and δ k obtained by the compliance and fem method can be accurate at rt and 60 c taking the logarithm of both sides of equation 1 is shown in equation 7 7 lg d a d n lg c m lg δ k it can be seen that lg d a d n and lg δ k became a linear relationship which can be applied with the linear regression on the data by the mean of least squares method in order to estimate c and m parameters table 4 summarizes the paris law parameters c and m of both materials for the tested stress ratios at different temperatures which derive from the best fitting curves of the fatigue data the values of all the correlation coefficient r 2 of the paris law fitting approach exceed 0 9 showing a high level of correlation between the test data and the paris equation for the base metal at the stress ratio of r 0 1 with the descent of temperature the m value increases and the c value decreases for the butt weld at stress ratios r 0 1 the same variation in the m and c value with respect to the decreasing temperature exists as the base metal at the stress ratios of r 0 1 however the change in c and m of butt weld is smaller than that of base metal the six sets of fatigue crack propagation rates curves of base metal and butt weld are converted to the mean fatigue crack propagation rates curves by least squares respectively the mean of fatigue crack propagation rates of base metal at rt and 60 c butt weld at rt and 60 c are plotted in fig 11 a in general the crack propagation rate of base metal and butt weld at rt is higher than that of 60 c at the same δ k fig 11 b shows that the mean of fatigue crack propagation rate of the base metal at rt and 60 c it can be seen that the fatigue crack propagation rate of base metal at rt is 45 396 58 644 higher than that of 60 c at the same δ k for butt weld the mean fatigue crack propagation rate at rt and 60 c is demonstrated in fig 11 c propagation rate of fatigue crack for butt weld at rt is about 56 211 58 644 higher than that of 60 c at the same δ k fig 11 d shows the comparison of propagation rate for mean fatigue crack between the base metal and butt weld at rt the results of base mental represents the higher value of crack propagation rate than butt weld at rt when δ k 40 mpa m on the other hand the results demonstrate the opposite trend when the value of stress intensity factor δ k higher than 40 mpa m the crack propagation rate of fatigue for the base metal at rt has lower values than butt weld the results of mean fatigue crack propagation for the base metal and the butt weld at 60 c are plotted in the same figure as illustrated in fig 11 e it can be seen that propagation rate of fatigue crack depends on the value of stress intensity factors δ k when δ k 35 mpa m the fatigue crack propagation rate of the base metal is higher than that the butt weld whereas δ k 35 mpa m the fatigue crack propagation rate of the butt weld is higher than the base metal 4 discussion in order to investigated the fatigue crack propagation the microstructure of crack path should be addressed clearly the behavior of fatigue crack propagation can be divided into three stages the crack initiation stage the crack stable propagation stage and the crack instable propagation stage after the crack initiation under the action of the alternating load the main slip surface of the slip band ie the direction of the maximum shear stress extends immediately toward the interior of the metal eisenhut et al 2017 then the crack enters a stable propagation stage at this time the crack propagates in a direction perpendicular to the normal stress stably and the crack always extends along the fusion zone as shown in fig 12 eventually the behavior of fatigue crack propagation approaches to the last stage or instable stage which produces the larger crack size and reduces the cross sectional area of the specimen significantly this causes a high stress in the sample and it occurs only a few cycles before the specimen failure the fatigue crack is propagated along the direction of the maximum shear stress combined with vickers hardness and fractography the effect of temperature on the fatigue crack propagation rate of dh36 steel and its butt weld was analyzed in this paper the crack propagation rate of dh36 steel base metal and its butt weld at the same temperature was also discussed 4 1 low temperature effects as can be seen from fig 11 a and b the fatigue crack propagation rate of the base metal and the butt weld at rt is higher than 60 c in order to analyze the effect of low temperature on fatigue crack propagation behavior the paper illustrated the vickers hardness and fractography of base and weld c t specimens at rt and 60 c under the stable propagation zone for r 0 1 4 1 1 hardness profiles the vickers hardness plays an important role in fatigue crack propagation rate cortés et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 shaniavskiy and toushentsov 2010 vickers hardness tests were conducted near the fatigue crack propagation path across the bm haz fz wz of specimen at rt and 60 c all vickers hardness were obtained at indentation load of 20 kg f by using mitutoyo hardness tester model avk c2 the vickers hardness profiles are presented in fig 13 as can be seen from fig 13 at rt the vickers hardness of bm is 161 171hv the vickers hardness of haz is 170 199 hv the vickers hardness of fz is 211 223 hv and the vickers hardness of wz is 182 205 hv at 60 c the vickers hardness of bm is 169 180 7hv the vickers hardness of haz is 176 3 223 4 hv the vickers hardness of fz is 223 4 229 4 hv and the vickers hardness of wz is 187 8 198 6 hv the vickers hardness of the base metal at 60 c is 17 4 hv higher than that of rt the vickers hardness at 60 c is 12 4 hv higher than that of rt combined with figs 11 and 13 it can be found that the discrepancy in vickers hardness is caused by the different temperature the relationship between the vickers hardness and the fatigue crack propagation rate is closely correlated at entire δ k regime however when the discrepancy in vickers hardness is caused by the different temperature the relationship between the vickers hardness and the fatigue crack propagation rate is only correlated at low δ k regime besides it is also found that the influence of low temperature on the vickers hardness of different regions of the welded joint is different the microstructure of bm is mainly flaky pearlite and quasi polygonal ferrite and the vickers hardness increases from rt to 60 c by an average of 10 08 hv the microstructure of haz is a lath like martensite and a small amount of ferrite and the vickers hardness changes little from rt to 60 c the vickers hardness of fz increased by an average of 9 4 hv from rt to 60 c the microstructure of wz is bainite and the vickers hardness at rt to 60 c is only increased by 0 54 hv one can find that only the vickers hardness of bm and fz is sensitive to low temperatures which is related to the microstructure inside the area one can also be considered that the vickers hardness of flaky pearlite and quasi polygonal ferrite is sensitive to low temperature and the vickers hardness of lath like martensite and bainite is not sensitive to low temperature 4 1 2 fractography for base metal specimens the fracture surface of the crack initiation zone in fig 14 a and fig 14 d shows a typical transgranular cleavage surface characterized by a river pattern and a cleavage step the fracture surface of stable propagation stage in fig 14 b and fig 14 e fracture surface at both temperatures have obvious fatigue striations according to the plastic passivation model proposed by laird and krause 1968 each propagation of the crack has to pass through the process of opening passivation expansion sharpening such a complete process is a stress cycle that leaves a trace on the crack surface called the fatigue striation therefore a fatigue striation represents a stress cycle process and the spacing of the fatigue striations represents the distance corresponding to the crack propagation of the stress cycle which can reflect the fatigue crack propagation rate richter trummer et al 2013 the spacing of fatigue striations at the rt is wider than that of 60 c which reflects the fatigue crack propagation rate of the base metal at rt is higher than that of 60 c the fracture surface of instantaneous fracture zone in fig 14 c and fig 14 f the fractures have obvious dimples at the two temperatures and the fracture states in this region are plastic fractures therefore there is no remarkable morphological difference between base metal at rt and 60 c in the fracture mode for butt weld specimens the fracture surface fig 15 a and fig 15 d of the crack initiation zone at the rt features the transgranular quasi cleavage facet with a mixture of short river pattern small cleavage plane and tearing ridge while the fractographs at 60 c exhibit cleavage fracture with river patterns and cleavage steps the fracture surface of the stable propagation stage in fig 15 b and fig 15 e the spacing of fatigue striations at the rt is wider than that of 60 c which reflects the fatigue crack propagation rate of the butt metal at rt is higher than 60 c the fracture surface of instantaneous fracture zone in fig 15 c and fig 15 f the cleavage step of the butt weld fracture at rt coexists with the dimple which is a mixed fracture the fracture at 60 c presents a fan shaped cleavage river pattern at low temperatures when the difference in orientation between adjacent grains is large the cleavage cracks along the expansion direction to the grain boundary and impacts the grain boundary and nucleates in the next grain and expands outward in the shape of a fan a fan shaped cleavage fracture is formed srivatsan et al 1991 this implies the fracture mode has shifted from quasi cleavage to cleavage as the temperature decreases from the rt to 60 c the vickers hardness at 60 c is higher than that of rt the fatigue crack propagation rate of dh36 steel base metal and butt weld at 60 c is lower than that of rt and the spacing of fatigue fringes on the fracture at 60 c is also smaller than that of rt at entire δ k it can be found that the vickers hardness fatigue crack propagation rates and fatigue fracture surface characterizations are closely correlated at low δ k regime these results of base metal are in agreement with the conclusions reported by x w liao but results of butt weld are opposite to conclusion reported by him liao et al 2018 the resistance against fatigue crack propagation of the butt weld increases at a decreasing ambient temperature in this paper while the fatigue crack propagation rate of butt weld accelerates at the low ambient temperature in his research this is because the crack tip he studied is located on the center line of the butt weld and the crack spreads on this center line the area where this center line is located at wz the crack tip of this paper is located at the boundary line between the butt weld and the base metal and the crack extends along this boundary line which is located at fz in the study of x w liao the microstructure of the wz is a mixture of bainite acicular ferrite and a little perlite which leads to satisfactory low temperature toughness in this paper the microstructure of the fz is very complex with coarse grains the mechanical properties of fz are weak in welded joints which largely determine the properties of welded joints it can be seen that the fz in this paper and wz in study of x w liao have different microstructure and mechanical properties their crack propagation performance is also very different 4 2 comparison of fatigue crack propagation behavior between base metal and butt weld 1 discussion of results with vickers hardness measurements the vickers hardness of the fz is 62 hv higher than that of the bm at rt and the vickers hardness of the fz is 68 4 hv higher than that of the bm at 60 c fig 12 combining figs 12 10 a and b it is worth noting that the fatigue crack propagation rate increases with the vickers hardness decreases at low δ k regime but as δ k increases this relationship is no longer maintained this can attribute to the micro failure mode in the low expansion rate region is single shear and the influence of the microstructure property is large so the hardness of the material has a great influence on it in the stable propagation stage its micro failure mode is the striated or double slip mode and the influence of microstructure performance is small so the hardness of the material has little influence on it in the instantaneous fracture zone its micro failure mode is the additional static mode the fatigue crack propagation rate at this time is quite sensitive to hardness however the fatigue crack propagation rates at this stage is so large that the effect of hardness is not significant landersheim et al 2012 the fatigue crack propagation rates of base metal and butt weld tend to decrease with decreasing temperature due to different mechanisms other than the vickers hardness residual stress and a variety of metallurgical factors including grain size and phase transformation may affect the fatigue crack propagation behavior of the welds which further complicates the understanding on the fatigue crack propagation behavior of the welds because of such difficulties the fatigue crack propagation studies on steel welds are extremely limited despite the practical importance in order to understand the effect of microstructure of dh36 steel and its butt weld on fatigue crack propagation behavior optical micrographic observation was conducted combined with fig 2 b and d it can be seen that the microstructure of both zones is absolutely different the grains in fz are coarse the chemical composition and composition in fz are very complex fig 2 b the microstructure of the bm is mainly flaky pearlite and quasi polygonal ferrite fig 2 d 2 discussion of results with the analysis of the fracture surfaces there is no remarkable morphological difference between base metal and butt weld at rt in the fracture mode at 60 c the fracture surface of the stable propagation stage is shown in figs 14 e and fig 15 e the spacing of fatigue striations of butt weld is wider than that of base metal at 60 c which reflects the fatigue crack propagation rate of the butt weld is higher than base metal at 60 c the fracture surface of instantaneous fracture zone is shown in figs 14 f and fig 15 f the cleavage step of the butt weld fracture at rt coexists with the dimple which is a mixed fracture the fracture at 60 c presents a fan shaped cleavage river pattern 5 conclusions this paper investigated the fatigue crack propagation behavior of dh36 base metal and its butt weld by fatigue crack propagation tests and vickers hardness tests at rt and 60 c the above investigation leads to the following conclusions 1 the compliance procedures in the specification is still suitable at 60 c but the effect of low temperature on the elastic modulus of the material must be considered 2 the presence of low temperature causes a decrease in the fatigue crack propagation rate of the base metal and weld fusion zone at 60 c the fatigue crack propagation rate at the weld fusion zone is higher than that of the base metal 3 vickers hardness has a significant effect on crack propagation rate only at low δ k but vickers hardness may have insignificant effects on crack propagation rate at high δ k 4 for ship structures that are exposed to 60 c the anti fatigue design of these ship structures can refer to the fatigue crack growth rate at 60 c similarly for ship structures that are exposed to room temperature the anti fatigue design of these ship structures can refer to the fatigue crack growth rate at room temperature

22227,in this study the effects of the scale on the evolution of propeller wake is simulated and analyzed under open water conditions the simulation is conducted using numerical techniques based on the detached eddy simulation method the open water performance such as thrust and torque are analyzed for validation and the instantaneous flow field vortical structure and the kinetic energy spectra are investigated for the scale effect on the wake dynamics of a propeller the results indicated that the influence of scale effect on load and wake dynamics of a propeller can differ significantly under different conditions under lighter loading condition the average spanwise circulation at full scale are considerably larger than those at model scale at the range of inner radius and the full scale propeller exhibits a stronger blade shed vortex analysis of vortical structure shows that the transition to instability position of vortices vary under different conditions power spectral density analysis of the kinetic energy demonstrates that the kinetic energy of full scale propellers is generally proportionally larger than that of model scale propellers keywords scale effect propeller des wake dynamics 1 introduction model tests are regarded as an effective method to predict the performance of marine propellers at full scale however due to the limitations of the test conditions the diameter of the model propeller cannot be large enough and the rotation speed of the model propeller is also limited by the dynamometer capacity which makes the reynolds number of the model propeller far smaller than that of a full scale propeller due to the differences in reynolds numbers the hydrodynamic performance characteristics of a full scale propeller directly are not similar to those of the model scale propeller a well known consensus is that tip vortex cavitation inception on the full scale propeller occurs at significantly higher cavitation number i e lower ship speed than in model scale mccormick 1962 shen et al 2009 hsiao and chahine 2008 consequently scaling procedures are required to correct the performance characteristics measured in the model test the scale effect of the propeller is also one of the important topics for the international towing tank conference ittc the advantages of computational fluid dynamics cfd methods for predicting scale effects have led mass research on the scale effect on distinguished type propellers scale effects have been studied for open propellers in stanier 1998 funeno 2002 li et al 2006 and koushan and krasilnikov 2008 scale effects on podded propellers are presented in lobachev and chitcherin 2001 sanchez caja et al 2003 and chicherin et al 2004 scale effects on ducted propellers are investigated by abdel maksoud and heinke 2002 krasilnikov et al 2007 and mertes and heinke 2008 effort to reach a deeper understanding of scale effects on propeller performance characteristics has been made recently müller et al 2009 developed an extrapolation method that considers both the main parameters of the propeller geometry and the radial distribution of the force differences between full scale and model scale jung kyu et al 2014 investigated the scale effects on performance of a tractor type podded propeller he found that the pod housing drag under the condition of propeller in operation is a key factor of the scale effect on the performance between model and full scale podded propellers bhattacharyya et al 2015 2016a 2016b systematically investigated the scaling approach and scale effects of ducted propellers he pointed out that duct thrust and propeller torque have the most prominent scale effects krasilnikov et al 2007 attempted to study the influence of blade skew loading and area ratio on scaling through the analysis of flow patterns around the blades it is noted that the above research concerning the scale effect of the propeller mainly focuses on the correction of the thrust and torque measured in a model propeller few studies have reported on the scale effect of propeller wake field however previous studies showed that the physical nature and evolution mechanism of the propeller wake are directly related to the hydrodynamic performance vibration radiated noise and structural issues of modern ships and help to provide a more accurate and comprehensive prediction of propeller performance recently with further research and improved computational ability the investigation of the viscous flow field associated with propellers has attracted considerable attention in the research field of ship dynamics and propulsion felli et al 2011 chase and carrica 2013 muscari et al 2017 wang et al 2018 a great number of experimental and numerical studies have explored the viscous flow field of propellers under various operating conditions felli et al 2006 2011 and 2018 systematically carried out experimental studies on propeller wake felli et al 2006 experimentally analyzed the wake evolution of a propeller from pressure and velocity phase measurements they studied the effect of the spiral to spiral distance and blade number on the evolution and instability of the hub vortex and tip vortex using a time resolved visualization device and a velocity measurement device felli et al 2011 felli and falchi 2018 performed an experimental particle image velocimetry piv analysis of the propeller wake field under oblique inflow conditions using a multi camera configuration this work extended the knowledge of propeller wake dynamics and revealed the evolution instability and breakdown mechanisms of propeller wake vortices under non axisymmetric inflow conditions propeller wake field has also been numerically studied using various methods including reynolds averaged navier stokes rans large eddy simulation les and detached eddy simulation des methods muscari et al 2013 demonstrated that rans provides better predictions of macroscale quantities such as thrust and torque however when the unsteady fluctuation of the flow or instability processes in the wake are of interest ranse modeling proves to be too dissipative as it smoothens out most of the finest flow features on the contrary des can track the vorticity field for a longer distance and successfully predict the onset of instabilities in the wake jang and mahesh 2013 analyzed the flow around a reverse rotating propeller in a uniform free stream using the les method rotation of the propeller in the reverse direction causes the interaction between the free stream and the reverse flow to produce a vortex ring in the vicinity of the propeller disk kumar and mahesh 2017 studied the wake of a five bladed marine propeller under designed operating conditions they examined the mechanisms of wake instability by analyzing the phase averaged and azimuthal averaged flow fields and identified a mutual induction mechanism of instability based on the abovementioned literature it is necessary to carry out further research to assess the scale effect of the viscous flow field of a propeller in this study the flow field of a potsdam propeller test case pptc marine propeller at full and model scale is analyzed using the des method the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents details of the numerical simulations section

analysis of the kinetic energy ke finally concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 simulation details 2 1 governing equations for incompressible flow the rans equation can be expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t x j u i u j p x i τ i j x j s i where u i and u j i j 1 2 3 represent the time averaged velocity components p is the time averaged pressure and s i is the general source term of the momentum equation the reynolds stress tensor τ i j is defined as 3 τ i j v t re u i x j u j x i 2 3 u i x i δ i j where the turbulent viscosity v t can be expressed in terms of an intermediate variable v as v t v f v 1 χ here χ v v and f v 1 χ 3 χ 3 c v 1 3 is a dumping function the intermediate variable v can be calculated using the following dimensionless transport equation based on the spalart allmaras turbulent model spalart and allmaras 1994 4 v t u j v x j c b 1 s v 1 re σ x i 1 v v x i c b 2 v x i 2 c w 1 f w re v y 2 where s s 1 re v k 2 y 2 f v 2 and f v 2 1 χ 1 χ f v 1 the parameter f w is given by f w g 1 c w 3 6 g 6 c w 3 6 1 6 where g r c w 2 r 6 r and r 1 re v s k 2 y 2 the constants used in the above equation are c v 1 7 1 c b 1 0 1355 σ 2 3 c b 2 0 622 k 0 41 c w 1 c b 1 k 2 1 c b 2 σ c w 2 0 3 and c w 3 2 respectively when employing the spalart allmaras model the production and destruction of turbulent viscosity at each point in the computational domain is determined by the distance to the nearest wall i e the parameter y in eq 4 spalart 1997 stated that the des can be modified by replacing y with a new length scale d defined by 5 d min d c d e s δ based on the above equation the length scale used for solving the near wall field in the spalart allmaras model is the new wall distance d in this case the model is functioning in a rans like mode at locations far away from the wall the length scale is converted to an les like filter width that is related to the dimension of the mesh δ by a constant c d e s different expressions of δ have been proposed in the literature in this work the most primitive expression is adopted nitkin et al 2000 6 δ max δ x δ y δ z 2 2 numerical models the siding mesh method was used to simulate propeller rotation the three dimensional viscous flow field is solved using the finite volume method based on the segregated flow solver in the star ccm computational fluid dynamics code in des the coupling of the pressure and velocity is solved using the simple algorithm second order upwind center difference and second order implicit time discrete schemes are used to determine the convection diffusion and time terms respectively in addition when performing unsteady des the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition is used to balance the time and spatial scales during the calculation the cfl number is defined by 7 c f l δ t u δ min where u is the magnitude of the local velocity and δ min min δ x δ y δ z according to the minimal spacing in the mesh the time step used in the des simulation must satisfy the requirement that cfl 1 0 2 3 test case the pptc propeller published by sva potsdam held at the smp 11 conference in hamburg is employed in this study the geometric model and reference coordinate system are shown in fig 1 the geometric characteristics are summarized in table 1 model scale λ 12 and full scale λ 1 propellers are simulated in this study together with advance coefficients of j 1 0 and j 0 6 where the advance coefficient is defined by j u n d these two coefficients correspond to light and heavy loading conditions respectively the different advance coefficients are obtained by changing the freestream velocity u with a fixed rotation speed n based on the discretization of the final mesh the time steps are set as δ t m 1 85 e 4 and δ t f 6 42 e 4 which correspond to the time taken for the propeller to rotate by 1 respectively for convenience of description and comparison propeller working conditions are defined in table 2 2 4 mesh details the computational domain is a cylinder with a diameter of 8r that extends 4r and 16r upstream and downstream from the propeller respectively according to kumar and mahesh 2017 the size effect of the computational domain on the evolution of the propeller wake is negligible in this study an unstructured trimmed mesh is used in the simulations multiple control volumes are employed to increase the mesh density in the tip vortex and hub vortex regions all trimmed meshes were generated using the star ccm software to minimize the influence of the difference of grid the grid topologies for the model and full scale propellers were the same except for the absolute near wall spacing which was calculated by the wall function and y values to satisfy the requirements of the des algorithm y is always less than 1 as suggested by gaggero et al 2014 the number of prism boundary layers is set to 20 the distribution of the control volume and the details of the local mesh are shown in fig 2 for the mesh convergence analysis two sets of meshes are considered for model and full scale as shown in table 3 here m represents one million 3 mesh verification to assess the numerical uncertainty in our simulation model two sets of meshes are developed a constant value of δ t δ min is used to ensure that the cfl number remains constant based on the work of muscari et al 2013 the two grid assessment procedure proposed by roache 1997 is used to perform uncertainty analysis the refinement ratio of the mesh must be determined before the mesh convergence study according to baek et al 2015 and gong et al 2018 the refinement ratio of the mesh should be defined by 8 r n f i n e n c o a r s e 1 d where n is the total number of cells and d is the dimension of the problem explored in the simulation in this study we consider a three dimensional problem d 3 the refinement ratio of both meshes used in this study is approximately 1 2 the error of the fine mesh is defined by 9 e f 2 f 1 1 r p where f 1 and f 2 correspond to the calculation results of the fine mesh and the medium mesh respectively and p is the formal order of accuracy p 2 the uncertainty is estimated by 10 u n f s e where f s is a safety factor assumed to be 3 the mesh convergence analysis in the present numerical simulation is based on the thrust and torque of the propeller the results are summarized in tables 4 and 5 note that the results obtained using the medium mesh are very close to those obtained using the fine mesh this suggests that the simulation results are reliable muscari et al 2017 in addition the uncertainty in the propeller load is less than 2 in all cases fig 3 shows the computation results of the open water characteristics as shown in this figure the calculation results agree with the experimental measurement based on the current number of cells and computational resources the medium mesh is fully capable of performing the simulation task considered in this study therefore all computational results are obtained using the medium mesh 4 results and discussions 4 1 scale effects on open water performance characteristics the thrust and torque of the propeller were calculated for completeness and validation although the main objective of this study is to evaluate the scale effect on the propeller wake dynamics the validation of propeller loading can be considered as the sign of good accuracy for the wake computation to some extent to study the scale effect on open water performance characteristics the relative differences between the model scale and full scale values of thrust and torque coefficients are computed as follows bhattacharyya a et al 2016a b 11 δ k t k t f u l l k t m o d e l k t m o d e l 100 12 δ k q k q f u l l k q m o d e l k q m o d e l 100 k t and 10k q are shown in fig 4 along with the relative differences between their model scale and full scale values it can be observed that with the increase of the j δ k t and δ k q increase gradually in addition k t increases at full scale at all advance coefficients which is mainly ascribed to the increase of lift and reduction of drag of the blade sections at higher reynolds numbers re this increase is rather small and the maximum relative difference between the model scale and full scale values of thrust is 1 12 on the contrary for the propeller torque coefficient 10k q fig 4 b one observes a decrease for full scale and the amplitude of δ k q is larger than that of δ k t under equivalent loading conditions in other words the influence of scale effect on torque is greater than that on thrust this result is explained as follows on the one hand research results of a wing test fiddes et al 1985 show that re has little effect on the lift coefficient while re has great influence on the drag coefficient caused by viscous force on the other hand the tangential component of the friction drag is usually larger than its axial component and consequently reduction of the drag has a larger effect on the torque than on the thrust the aforementioned thrust and torque variations with scale are in good agreement with the results presented in earlier referred works by jung kyu c et al 2014 sánchez caja a et al 2014 and peters a et al 2018 the re also has a strong influence on flow regime on the blade surface in general the centrifugal acceleration on a fluid element is independent of the flow regime therefore the lower shear stress in a laminar boundary layer causes the flow to be radially directed for a turbulent boundary layer the shear stress increases and the streamlines become more circumferentially directed j baltazar et al 2018 fig 5 visualizes the distribution of limiting streamlines and skin friction coefficient cf distribution on the pressure and suction sides of the blade for both advance ratios under light loading condition fig 5 a and c it is shown that compared to full scale propeller the model has a more radially extended separation region at the trailing edge while the distribution of limiting streamlines at the leading edge are similar for the high loading condition fig 5 b and d an extensive leading edge separation region is present on the propeller suction side with a smaller leading edge separation region at higher re these phenomena can be explained by the discussion from kuiper 1981 his investigation indicated that as for the lower radii near the trailing edge a laminar separation area is generated due to lower velocities and thicker root sections for the upper radii a laminar leading edge separation due to a strong adverse pressure gradient is present the average spanwise circulation plays a great role in the wake field characteristics of the propeller according to the studies of sánchez caja a et al 2014 and kumar et al 2017 the average spanwise circulation on each blade can be computed from the circumferentially averaged tangential velocity similar to jessup et al 2004 as follows 13 g r r u θ r 2 π r v z where z is the number of blades it is noted that the average spanwise circulation is made non dimensional with 2πrv where r is the propeller radius and v is the inflow velocity the radial distribution of average spanwise circulation for the model and full scale propeller are computed at 0 23r downstream of the propeller using 13 as shown in fig 6 the following features can be observed 1 all curves exhibit the same variation pattern in which the average circulation for the propeller blades reaches a maximum at approximately 0 75r followed by a decrease to the minimum at the tip which indicates the blade is gently loaded at the tip this has an effect on the strength of the tip vortices generated by the propeller in general a higher circulation near the tip would generate a stronger and larger tip vortex kumar et al 2017 2 the values at the higher loading condition are notably larger than those at the lighter loading condition at all range of propeller radius the maximum value at j 0 6 is approximately 0 1 for both the model and full scale propellers while the maximum value at j 1 0 is only approximately 0 04 3 in terms of scale effect it is noted that the values of g r at full scale are larger than those at model scale at a range of inner radii 0 3 r r 0 6 especially under light loading condition this suggests that this propeller at light loading condition is expected to have a stronger blade trailing edge wake at full scale when compared to model scale as for the spanwise circulation near the tip it shows almost the same values with a slight bigger one for the model scale the different radial distribution of spanwise circulation comes from the diversity of flow regime on the blade surface which has been discussed above 4 2 instantaneous wake field characteristics in addition to the blade boundary layer flow the re significantly affects the velocity distribution of the wake flow especially around the vortex core fig 7 compares the axial velocity component between model and full scale in longitudinal plane x z plane the strong flow acceleration near the tip due to the rotation of the propeller and the presence of the tip vortex are observed it is also observed that the wake field is dependent on the loading condition and scale when increasing the blade loading condition reducing j it resulted in a reduction on the distance between two consecutive tip vortices followed by a stronger velocity perturbation induced by the propeller and a smaller pitch of the wake this is consistent with the experimental results by di felice et al 2004 fig 8 presents the radial distribution of axial velocity and tangential velocity components along the black dotted lines in fig 7 the variation of the velocity distribution around the tip vortex is evident between the model and full scale higher velocity gradient is observed around the tip vortex for full scale this is ascribed to be the larger shear stress due to the thinner boundary layer in full scale the distribution of vorticity in the longitudinal plane at different advance coefficients and different scales is compared in fig 9 additionally fig 10 shows the mesh density in the red solid rectangle region in fig 9 a it is observed that the mesh resolution is sufficient to capture the core of two adjacent tip vortices as well as the small scale vortices the instantaneous wake fields are analyzed after the simulations reaching numerical convergence and achieving a statistically steady state regime that is after the propeller rotates 30 cycles for the convenience of comparative analysis the standardized physical quantities are described as follows the x and z axes are defined as x r and z r respectively the axial vorticity is standardized as ω x v o r t i c i t y i u x d where vorticity i is the axial vorticity s 1 u x is the local axial velocity m s and d is the propeller diameter m it should be noted that the vorticity contour levels of all conditions are the same in fig 9 ω x 5 5 the main features are as follows 1 both models at different loading conditions evidently display a tip vortex region 0 8 r r 1 1 a blade shed vortex region 0 3 r r 0 8 and a hub vortex region 0 r r 0 3 2 in terms of loading conditions see fig 9a b c d the wake fields of the light loading condition j 1 0 exhibit a more organized distribution of vorticities in the tip vortex region when compared to the high loading condition j 0 6 furthermore the vortex paring process denoted by the dashed circles and vortex distortion denoted by the solid circles moves more downstream as j increases more specifically as for the model scale the vortex pairing occurs at x 8r for j 1 0 while it emerges at x 2r for j 0 6 which corresponds to the experimental visualization photograph described in felli et al 2011 similar change rules are found at full scale it follows that by reducing j increasing propeller loading the wake becomes less stable owing to the instability of the wake vortex this phenomenon is obviously presented by the vortical structure shown in fig 11 and it will be analyzed in detail in the following section 3 in terms of scale effects see fig 9a c b d the vortex paring process and vortex distortion move downstream more as re increases regardless of the blade loading conditions as shown in fig 8 the full scale case experiences larger velocity and larger velocity gradient due to the larger shear stress which will cause a stronger periodic wake field in full scale case another noticeable difference is that under the light loading condition the full scale propeller exhibits more obvious blade shed vortex than the model scale one it follows that a full scale blade shed vortex remains independence up to x 7r and then merges with the hub vortex denoted by the solid rectangle at approximately x 8r on the contrary the blade shed vortex is merged by the hub vortex at approximately x 5 5r for the model scale 4 3 vortical structures in order to have a better understanding of the evolution mechanism of the wake vortex of full and model scale propellers under different loads the q criterion hunt et al 1988 is used to help visualize the spatial structure of vortices in the near wake field q is defined as follows 14 q 1 2 u x 2 v y 2 w z 2 u y v x u z w x v z w y taking case 2 as an example here we will briefly introduce the instability transitions of the vorticity structure in the wake of the propeller a general overview of vortical structure is shown in fig 11 the surface shown in this figure corresponds to q 3000s 2 in particular the tip vortices deform from the helical path and tend to interact each other to form a group while the hub vortex undergoes a sudden deformation from straight to a spiralling geometry as shown in the above figure after a slight initial reduction of the radial position of the vortex tubes which corresponds to the wake contraction stage we define this as the first stage caused by the acceleration of the flow behind the propeller the helices formed by the tip vortices remain located on a cylinder of almost constant radius to the downstream without any instabilities and they conserve their geometric characteristics fixed pitch and spiral to spiral distance this is the second stage the inception of the tip vortex instability third stage is estimated through a statistical approach considering the change of radius of the helical geometries the tip vortex perturbation fourth stage and pairing process fifth stage are clearly presented in fig 11 considering the positions where the hub vortices start to deviate from the straight geometries the onset of hub vortex instability is defined sixth stage with the further transition of vortices the secondary vortex gradually emerges seventh stage and the mutual interaction of different vortices makes the wake vortex of the propeller less stable and more chaotic similar transition processes were visualized by experimental findings in felli et al 2011 fig 12 shows the transition to instability of wake vortices under different conditions the effect of the blade loading conditions is shown in fig 12a b c d while the effect of scales is compared in fig 12a c b d it is noted that under the light loading conditions see fig 12a c only the first 4 stages are exhibited for both model and full scale simulations the analysis of the results achieved at different loading conditions and scales shows a distinct diverse evolution process in the wake vortices more specifically 1 with respect to the blade loading conditions it shows that inception of the tip vortex instability third stage moves downstream more when increasing j this is probably ascribed to the increase in the loading j 0 6 leading to an increase in the strength of the tip vortices which promotes self and mutual induction between adjacent tip vortices this phenomenon is consistent with the finding in fig 9 in fact according to okulov 2004 the transition to instability shows clear dependence on the spiral to spiral distance more specifically the blade loading condition has an effect on the hydrodynamic pitch of the wake and thus on the spiral to spiral distance indirectly in particular the smaller the blade loading condition the wider the spiral to spiral distance and the transition to instability position moves more downstream 2 when it comes to the scale effect some tiny delays are found during the transition to the instability of wake vortices for the full scale propeller these delays are more obvious at the high loading condition j 0 6 and they can be seen from the third to sixth stages in fig 12 b and d these delays suggest that the blade loading of full scale should be smaller than that of model scale when considering the high loading conditions however this seems to be contrasting with the results of table 3 that the thrust coefficient of full scale is slightly larger than that of the model scale in fact if we inspect the data in fig 6 the deeper reason for the delay is revealed as discussed in section 4 1 the average spanwise circulation values at the tip of the model scale are slightly larger than those of the full scale for both j 0 6 and j 1 0 it is concluded that the average spanwise circulation at the tip affects the strength of the tip vortices generated by the propeller more accurately due to the smaller average spanwise circulation at the tip rather than at the blade loading there is a delay of the transition to instability position at different conditions 4 4 psd analysis of kinetic energy spectra the propeller wake can also be explored by analyzing the energy transfer process felli et al 2011 di mascio et al 2014 specifically this energy transfer process involves psd analysis of ke where ke is defined as k e 0 5 u 2 v 2 w 2 v 2 it is noted that ke is made non dimensional with v 2 where v is the inflow velocity the change in ke at different locations is determined by setting up a series of probe points in the wake field a sketch of the arrangement of the probes in the wake is shown in fig 13 to ensure that the probe points are positioned on the trajectory of the tip vortex the radial locations of the probe points are set as y r 0 9 and the axial locations of these points with non uniform spacing downstream of the propeller are set as x r 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 and 6 0 as recommended by di mascio et al 2014 for convenience of description the probe points are divided into three groups near field p1 p2 p3 middle field p4 p5 p6 and far field p7 p8 fig 14 shows box charts of ke fluctuations with two different advance coefficients j 1 0 and j 0 6 in model and full scale these charts demonstrate the fluctuation and average value of ke at different probe points and the illustration of the box chart can be seen in fig 15 the effect of the loading conditions and scale effects on the spectrum characteristics of wake are as follows 1 fig 14 a and c shows that under the light loading conditions j 1 0 the average ke levels are higher in p 1 than in p 2 and p 3 in the near field for both model and full scale the higher value in p 1 is caused by the acceleration of the flow behind the propeller and this effect gradually reduces with an increase in the distance between the probe points and the propeller it follows that compared with p 1 the fluctuation and average value of other probe points in near field and middle field experience dramatic decreases this can probably be ascribed to the fact that after an acceleration of the flow by the propeller the wake of the propeller and the helices formed by the tip vortices remain stable as shown in fig 8 a and c for the far field p 7 and p 8 there appears to be a slight increase in the fluctuation and average which should be caused by the inception of tip vortex destabilization 2 with respect to the case of j 0 6 fig 14 b and d the ke values experience a similar trend to the case of j 1 0 in the near field whereas they show completely different regulation in the middle and far fields it is noted that the fluctuation and the average of ke gradually increase from p 4 furthermore there exist outliers on some probe points in the middle and far fields this is probably to be ascribed to the early onset of instability of tip vortices in the heavy loading conditions as shown in fig 12 b and d which results in the increase of the ke value as well as the appearance of outliers 3 in terms of scale effect it is clearly shown that the ke fluctuation of full scale is generally larger than that of model scale to facilitate analysis of the scale effect of ke the average values of ke k e at model and full scale and their difference are listed in table 5 wherein the subscripts m f represent the model full scale respectively and δ k e represents the difference between model and full scale which is defined by eq 15 15 δ k e k e f k e m k e f k e m 2 the data in table 6 show that the k e m is generally smaller than the k e f at all probing points this is related to the different boundary layer flow the influence of the boundary layer of the blade on viscous wake can be represented by a defect in the velocity as shown in fig 16 smaller velocity defect is observed in full scale due to the thinner boundary layer it follows that higher value of k e is obtained in full scale additionally it is noticeable that there is a large decrease of k e passing from p1 to p2 at higher loading condition which is also observed from the numerical calculation by di mascio et al 2014 and gong et al 2018 fig 17 shows the variation of ke during a cycle of rotation for case 2 it is pictured that the induced velocities are strong closely behind the propeller further downstream these induced velocities tend to disappear quickly according to the experimental investigation by di felice et al 2004 it is indicated that the longitudinal decay of the tip vortex vorticity is higher at the initial phase where tip vortex formation is still in progress especially in lower j in fact after the separation from the blade the tip vortex starts an intense and complex phase of roll up of the blade wake vortical filaments shed from the trailing edge as shown in fig 18 when increasing the blade loading the wake of the actual blade starts to be rolled by the tip vortex released by the previous blade due to the effect of the large difference between the hydrodynamic pitch of the blade wake and of the tip vortices this blade to blade interaction is shifted more downstream at higher j value due to the higher pitch of the wake with respect to the tip vortex figs 19 and 20 show the distributions of the normalized power spectrum of ke at the same streamwise positions for model and full scale propellers respectively for the convenience of comparison and analysis some definitions and explanation are as follows blade passing frequency bpf n z i e bpf 75 hz for the model scale propeller and bpf 21 65 hz for the full scale propeller and axial passing frequency apf n 2 the wavenumber k is standardized based on the bpf i e the bpf corresponds to k 1 while the apf corresponds to k 0 2 by comparing all four cases several common characteristics can be concluded from the streamwise evolution of the psd of ke 1 the main peaks appear at the bpf and apf as well as their integral multiples with the peak being the largest at the bpf or apf as expected because of the small distance from the propeller plane 2 the peaks gradually attenuate afterwards and the farther the distance between the probe point and the propeller the faster the attenuation 3 the streamwise evolution of the psd of ke signals shows a mechanism of energy relocation where energy transfers from the blade to the shaft harmonic felli et al 2006 4 in the case of the high loading condition in the middle and far field most of the peaks have vanished or there exist some peaks associated with non integer values of k and whole curves have shifted to higher values these phenomena are caused by the pairing process between neighboring tip vortices or the growth of a secondary vortex and its interaction with the main vortical structure according to the research of muscari et al 2013 and di mascio et al 2014 this cause effect relation can also be validated if we come back to inspect fig 9 b d and fig 12 b d in order to describe the effect of loading condition in detail the psd of ke at probe points p 3 p 5 and p 7 as shown in fig 21 which represents the near medium and far field respectively are compared fig 22 shows the spectra at p 3 p 5 and p 7 under the two loading conditions as shown in the figure the peaks in bpf and its multiples are almost same at different positions with respect to the peaks in apf and its multiples they show distinct differences from the bpf more specifically the difference of peaks in apf and its multiples between light and high loading is quite small in the near field however along with the probe points moving downstream the peaks under the high loading condition increase gradually which enlarges the difference of peaks in apf and its multiples under the two loading conditions this can be attributed to the instability of the wake field and the wake vortex morphology as shown in fig 21 for both light and high loading conditions p 3 is located in a stable wake field when it comes to p 5 and p 7 the advance onset of wake field instability under high loading condition makes p 5 and p 7 lie in a more chaotic wake field which will induce an increase in the peaks in fact the fluctuations of the wake signals at a point depend on two aspects 1 the high levels of turbulence in the tip vortex and 2 the fluctuating positions of the tip vortex felli et al 2011 in the near wake the former contribution is predominant because the tip vortex passage is regular and the oscillations are small the latter contribution becomes more predominant further downstream as a consequence of the strong distortions that the tip vortices undergo in the transition and the far wake see fig 21 a another noticeable feature is that the speed of energy relocation under the heavy loading condition is faster than that of the light loading condition for both model and full scale the peak of bpf is larger than that of apf at p 3 for both loading conditions if we inspect the data at p 5 it is found that the peak of bpf is still larger than that of apf for the light loading condition but the result is opposite for the heavy loading condition to better explore the scale effect of the ke spectrum psd spectra for model and full scale propellers at p 3 p 5 and p 7 are compared in fig 23 it is interesting to note that the whole curves of full scale and the peaks of full scale associated with the abf bpf and their harmonics k 0 4 0 6 and k 1 2 are generally larger than the model scale equivalents independently of the propeller loading conditions more specifically fig 23 shows significant higher peaks of ke in the full scale case this can be related to the distribution of velocity around the tip vortex as shown in figs 7 and 8 the full scale case experiences larger velocity and larger velocity gradient due to the larger shear stress as mentioned in section 4 2 this will cause a stronger periodic wake field in full scale case which is illustrated by the growth of axial vorticity showing in fig 12 in fact figs 9 and 12 indicate that the propeller wake experiences an increasing instability as going downstream especially under high loading condition when increasing the blade loading the wake of the actual blade starts to be rolled by the tip vortex released by the previous blade due to the effect of the large difference between the hydrodynamic pitch of the blade wake and of the tip vortices another important physical phenomenon which is active in the propeller wake is spiral roll up of the blade trailing edge vortex sheet as shown in fig 18 this phenomenon is responsible for detaching the tip vortices from the blade trailing edge wake after complete roll up and formation of smaller fragments of the trailing edge wake which eventually dissipate to form the far wake as described by joukowski 1912 consisting of only tip and hub vortices besides the higher peaks full scale ke spectra are also characterized by higher broadband levels this is ascribed to be the difference of the boundary layer between the model and full scale case showing in fig 16 smaller velocity defect is observed in full scale due to the thinner boundary layer the larger ke in the wake of the full scale propeller is indeed an interesting aspect which could cause higher noise however the problem of propeller noise scaling is very complex and involves many other aspects e g hull wake nuclei content bubble dynamics cavitation inception etc this will warrant a future works 5 conclusions in this study the scale effect of propeller wake under open water conditions has been analyzed by numerical methods based on des particularly the open water performance is analyzed for the sake of validation and a detailed analysis of instantaneous flow field vortical structure and ke spectra under different advance coefficients are explored for the scale effect of the propeller wake furthermore the study revealed the relation between the blade loading and the wake vortical structure of the propeller the results presented in this paper lead us to the following conclusions 1 the average spanwise circulation reaches the maximum at approximately 0 75r and the values of average spanwise circulation at the higher loading condition are considerably larger than those at the lighter loading condition at all ranges of propeller radius scale effect on the average spanwise circulation varies with the loading conditions specifically the values of g r at full scale are larger than those at model scale at a range of inner radii 0 3 r r 0 6 especially under light loading condition as for the spanwise circulation near the tip they show almost same values with a slight bigger one for the model scale 2 under the light loading condition the full scale propeller exhibits stronger blade shed vortex than the model scale it follows that the blade shed vortex of the full scale keeps independence up to x 7r and then it merges with the hub vortex at approximately x 8r on the contrary the blade shed vortex is merged by the hub vortex at approximately x 5 5r for the model scale 3 the vortical structure visualizations allowed us to clarify the relationship between the load and the wake of the propeller besides the average spanwise circulation at the tip the development of the tip vortex and vortex roll up also have an effect on the strength of the tip vortices generated by the propeller further the strength of the tip vortices plays a critical role in the onset of the instability of wake 4 the influence of scale effect on k e can differ significantly under the light and high loading conditions with respect to the high loading condition k e of full scale is at least 15 larger than that of model scale while in the case of the light loading condition the maximum average difference is merely approximately 5 the psd analysis of ke demonstrates that the total values of full scale are generally larger than those of model scale which could cause higher noise for a full scale propeller we did not consider the effect of the wake field of the ship in this study subsequent research could be based on these findings and will focus on the effect of wake field on wake dynamics of the propeller declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

are investigated for the scale effect on the wake dynamics of a propeller the results indicated that the influence of scale effect on load and wake dynamics of a propeller can differ significantly under different conditions under lighter loading condition the average spanwise circulation at full scale are considerably larger than those at model scale at the range of inner radius and the full scale propeller exhibits a stronger blade shed vortex analysis of vortical structure shows that the transition to instability position of vortices vary under different conditions power spectral density analysis of the kinetic energy demonstrates that the kinetic energy of full scale propellers is generally proportionally larger than that of model scale propellers keywords scale effect propeller des wake dynamics 1 introduction model tests are regarded as an effective method to predict the performance of marine propellers at full scale however due to the limitations of the test conditions the diameter of the model propeller cannot be large enough and the rotation speed of the model propeller is also limited by the dynamometer capacity which makes the reynolds number of the model propeller far smaller than that of a full scale propeller due to the differences in reynolds numbers the hydrodynamic performance characteristics of a full scale propeller directly are not similar to those of the model scale propeller a well known consensus is that tip vortex cavitation inception on the full scale propeller occurs at significantly higher cavitation number i e lower ship speed than in model scale mccormick 1962 shen et al 2009 hsiao and chahine 2008 consequently scaling procedures are required to correct the performance characteristics measured in the model test the scale effect of the propeller is also one of the important topics for the international towing tank conference ittc the advantages of computational fluid dynamics cfd methods for predicting scale effects have led mass research on the scale effect on distinguished type propellers scale effects have been studied for open propellers in stanier 1998 funeno 2002 li et al 2006 and koushan and krasilnikov 2008 scale effects on podded propellers are presented in lobachev and chitcherin 2001 sanchez caja et al 2003 and chicherin et al 2004 scale effects on ducted propellers are investigated by abdel maksoud and heinke 2002 krasilnikov et al 2007 and mertes and heinke 2008 effort to reach a deeper understanding of scale effects on propeller performance characteristics has been made recently müller et al 2009 developed an extrapolation method that considers both the main parameters of the propeller geometry and the radial distribution of the force differences between full scale and model scale jung kyu et al 2014 investigated the scale effects on performance of a tractor type podded propeller he found that the pod housing drag under the condition of propeller in operation is a key factor of the scale effect on the performance between model and full scale podded propellers bhattacharyya et al 2015 2016a 2016b systematically investigated the scaling approach and scale effects of ducted propellers he pointed out that duct thrust and propeller torque have the most prominent scale effects krasilnikov et al 2007 attempted to study the influence of blade skew loading and area ratio on scaling through the analysis of flow patterns around the blades it is noted that the above research concerning the scale effect of the propeller mainly focuses on the correction of the thrust and torque measured in a model propeller few studies have reported on the scale effect of propeller wake field however previous studies showed that the physical nature and evolution mechanism of the propeller wake are directly related to the hydrodynamic performance vibration radiated noise and structural issues of modern ships and help to provide a more accurate and comprehensive prediction of propeller performance recently with further research and improved computational ability the investigation of the viscous flow field associated with propellers has attracted considerable attention in the research field of ship dynamics and propulsion felli et al 2011 chase and carrica 2013 muscari et al 2017 wang et al 2018 a great number of experimental and numerical studies have explored the viscous flow field of propellers under various operating conditions felli et al 2006 2011 and 2018 systematically carried out experimental studies on propeller wake felli et al 2006 experimentally analyzed the wake evolution of a propeller from pressure and velocity phase measurements they studied the effect of the spiral to spiral distance and blade number on the evolution and instability of the hub vortex and tip vortex using a time resolved visualization device and a velocity measurement device felli et al 2011 felli and falchi 2018 performed an experimental particle image velocimetry piv analysis of the propeller wake field under oblique inflow conditions using a multi camera configuration this work extended the knowledge of propeller wake dynamics and revealed the evolution instability and breakdown mechanisms of propeller wake vortices under non axisymmetric inflow conditions propeller wake field has also been numerically studied using various methods including reynolds averaged navier stokes rans large eddy simulation les and detached eddy simulation des methods muscari et al 2013 demonstrated that rans provides better predictions of macroscale quantities such as thrust and torque however when the unsteady fluctuation of the flow or instability processes in the wake are of interest ranse modeling proves to be too dissipative as it smoothens out most of the finest flow features on the contrary des can track the vorticity field for a longer distance and successfully predict the onset of instabilities in the wake jang and mahesh 2013 analyzed the flow around a reverse rotating propeller in a uniform free stream using the les method rotation of the propeller in the reverse direction causes the interaction between the free stream and the reverse flow to produce a vortex ring in the vicinity of the propeller disk kumar and mahesh 2017 studied the wake of a five bladed marine propeller under designed operating conditions they examined the mechanisms of wake instability by analyzing the phase averaged and azimuthal averaged flow fields and identified a mutual induction mechanism of instability based on the abovementioned literature it is necessary to carry out further research to assess the scale effect of the viscous flow field of a propeller in this study the flow field of a potsdam propeller test case pptc marine propeller at full and model scale is analyzed using the des method the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents details of the numerical simulations section 3 discusses the level of uncertainty associated with the mesh used in the numerical simulations and section 4 discusses the scale effect of wake vortex structures and the power spectral density psd analysis of the kinetic energy ke finally concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 simulation details 2 1 governing equations for incompressible flow the rans equation can be expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t x j u i u j p x i τ i j x j s i where u i and u j i j 1 2 3 represent the time averaged velocity components p is the time averaged pressure and s i is the general source term of the momentum equation the reynolds stress tensor τ i j is defined as 3 τ i j v t re u i x j u j x i 2 3 u i x i δ i j where the turbulent viscosity v t can be expressed in terms of an intermediate variable v as v t v f v 1 χ here χ v v and f v 1 χ 3 χ 3 c v 1 3 is a dumping function the intermediate variable v can be calculated using the following dimensionless transport equation based on the spalart allmaras turbulent model spalart and allmaras 1994 4 v t u j v x j c b 1 s v 1 re σ x i 1 v v x i c b 2 v x i 2 c w 1 f w re v y 2 where s s 1 re v k 2 y 2 f v 2 and f v 2 1 χ 1 χ f v 1 the parameter f w is given by f w g 1 c w 3 6 g 6 c w 3 6 1 6 where g r c w 2 r 6 r and r 1 re v s k 2 y 2 the constants used in the above equation are c v 1 7 1 c b 1 0 1355 σ 2 3 c b 2 0 622 k 0 41 c w 1 c b 1 k 2 1 c b 2 σ c w 2 0 3 and c w 3 2 respectively when employing the spalart allmaras model the production and destruction of turbulent viscosity at each point in the computational domain is determined by the distance to the nearest wall i e the parameter y in eq 4 spalart 1997 stated that the des can be modified by replacing y with a new length scale d defined by 5 d min d c d e s δ based on the above equation the length scale used for solving the near wall field in the spalart allmaras model is the new wall distance d in this case the model is functioning in a rans like mode at locations far away from the wall the length scale is converted to an les like filter width that is related to the dimension of the mesh δ by a constant c d e s different expressions of δ have been proposed in the literature in this work the most primitive expression is adopted nitkin et al 2000 6 δ max δ x δ y δ z 2 2 numerical models the siding mesh method was used to simulate propeller rotation the three dimensional viscous flow field is solved using the finite volume method based on the segregated flow solver in the star ccm computational fluid dynamics code in des the coupling of the pressure and velocity is solved using the simple algorithm second order upwind center difference and second order implicit time discrete schemes are used to determine the convection diffusion and time terms respectively in addition when performing unsteady des the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition is used to balance the time and spatial scales during the calculation the cfl number is defined by 7 c f l δ t u δ min where u is the magnitude of the local velocity and δ min min δ x δ y δ z according to the minimal spacing in the mesh the time step used in the des simulation must satisfy the requirement that cfl 1 0 2 3 test case the pptc propeller published by sva potsdam held at the smp 11 conference in hamburg is employed in this study the geometric model and reference coordinate system are shown in fig 1 the geometric characteristics are summarized in table 1 model scale λ 12 and full scale λ 1 propellers are simulated in this study together with advance coefficients of j 1 0 and j 0 6 where the advance coefficient is defined by j u n d these two coefficients correspond to light and heavy loading conditions respectively the different advance coefficients are obtained by changing the freestream velocity u with a fixed rotation speed n based on the discretization of the final mesh the time steps are set as δ t m 1 85 e 4 and δ t f 6 42 e 4 which correspond to the time taken for the propeller to rotate by 1 respectively for convenience of description and comparison propeller working conditions are defined in table 2 2 4 mesh details the computational domain is a cylinder with a diameter of 8r that extends 4r and 16r upstream and downstream from the propeller respectively according to kumar and mahesh 2017 the size effect of the computational domain on the evolution of the propeller wake is negligible in this study an unstructured trimmed mesh is used in the simulations multiple control volumes are employed to increase the mesh density in the tip vortex and hub vortex regions all trimmed meshes were generated using the star ccm software to minimize the influence of the difference of grid the grid topologies for the model and full scale propellers were the same except for the absolute near wall spacing which was calculated by the wall function and y values to satisfy the requirements of the des algorithm y is always less than 1 as suggested by gaggero et al 2014 the number of prism boundary layers is set to 20 the distribution of the control volume and the details of the local mesh are shown in fig 2 for the mesh convergence analysis two sets of meshes are considered for model and full scale as shown in table 3 here m represents one million 3 mesh verification to assess the numerical uncertainty in our simulation model two sets of meshes are developed a constant value of δ t δ min is used to ensure that the cfl number remains constant based on the work of muscari et al 2013 the two grid assessment procedure proposed by roache 1997 is used to perform uncertainty analysis the refinement ratio of the mesh must be determined before the mesh convergence study according to baek et al 2015 and gong et al 2018 the refinement ratio of the mesh should be defined by 8 r n f i n e n c o a r s e 1 d where n is the total number of cells and d is the dimension of the problem explored in the simulation in this study we consider a three dimensional problem d 3 the refinement ratio of both meshes used in this study is approximately 1 2 the error of the fine mesh is defined by 9 e f 2 f 1 1 r p where f 1 and f 2 correspond to the calculation results of the fine mesh and the medium mesh respectively and p is the formal order of accuracy p 2 the uncertainty is estimated by 10 u n f s e where f s is a safety factor assumed to be 3 the mesh convergence analysis in the present numerical simulation is based on the thrust and torque of the propeller the results are summarized in tables 4 and 5 note that the results obtained using the medium mesh are very close to those obtained using the fine mesh this suggests that the simulation results are reliable muscari et al 2017 in addition the uncertainty in the propeller load is less than 2 in all cases fig 3 shows the computation results of the open water characteristics as shown in this figure the calculation results agree with the experimental measurement based on the current number of cells and computational resources the medium mesh is fully capable of performing the simulation task considered in this study therefore all computational results are obtained using the medium mesh 4 results and discussions 4 1 scale effects on open water performance characteristics the thrust and torque of the propeller were calculated for completeness and validation although the main objective of this study is to evaluate the scale effect on the propeller wake dynamics the validation of propeller loading can be considered as the sign of good accuracy for the wake computation to some extent to study the scale effect on open water performance characteristics the relative differences between the model scale and full scale values of thrust and torque coefficients are computed as follows bhattacharyya a et al 2016a b 11 δ k t k t f u l l k t m o d e l k t m o d e l 100 12 δ k q k q f u l l k q m o d e l k q m o d e l 100 k t and 10k q are shown in fig 4 along with the relative differences between their model scale and full scale values it can be observed that with the increase of the j δ k t and δ k q increase gradually in addition k t increases at full scale at all advance coefficients which is mainly ascribed to the increase of lift and reduction of drag of the blade sections at higher reynolds numbers re this increase is rather small and the maximum relative difference between the model scale and full scale values of thrust is 1 12 on the contrary for the propeller torque coefficient 10k q fig 4 b one observes a decrease for full scale and the amplitude of δ k q is larger than that of δ k t under equivalent loading conditions in other words the influence of scale effect on torque is greater than that on thrust this result is explained as follows on the one hand research results of a wing test fiddes et al 1985 show that re has little effect on the lift coefficient while re has great influence on the drag coefficient caused by viscous force on the other hand the tangential component of the friction drag is usually larger than its axial component and consequently reduction of the drag has a larger effect on the torque than on the thrust the aforementioned thrust and torque variations with scale are in good agreement with the results presented in earlier referred works by jung kyu c et al 2014 sánchez caja a et al 2014 and peters a et al 2018 the re also has a strong influence on flow regime on the blade surface in general the centrifugal acceleration on a fluid element is independent of the flow regime therefore the lower shear stress in a laminar boundary layer causes the flow to be radially directed for a turbulent boundary layer the shear stress increases and the streamlines become more circumferentially directed j baltazar et al 2018 fig 5 visualizes the distribution of limiting streamlines and skin friction coefficient cf distribution on the pressure and suction sides of the blade for both advance ratios under light loading condition fig 5 a and c it is shown that compared to full scale propeller the model has a more radially extended separation region at the trailing edge while the distribution of limiting streamlines at the leading edge are similar for the high loading condition fig 5 b and d an extensive leading edge separation region is present on the propeller suction side with a smaller leading edge separation region at higher re these phenomena can be explained by the discussion from kuiper 1981 his investigation indicated that as for the lower radii near the trailing edge a laminar separation area is generated due to lower velocities and thicker root sections for the upper radii a laminar leading edge separation due to a strong adverse pressure gradient is present the average spanwise circulation plays a great role in the wake field characteristics of the propeller according to the studies of sánchez caja a et al 2014 and kumar et al 2017 the average spanwise circulation on each blade can be computed from the circumferentially averaged tangential velocity similar to jessup et al 2004 as follows 13 g r r u θ r 2 π r v z where z is the number of blades it is noted that the average spanwise circulation is made non dimensional with 2πrv where r is the propeller radius and v is the inflow velocity the radial distribution of average spanwise circulation for the model and full scale propeller are computed at 0 23r downstream of the propeller using 13 as shown in fig 6 the following features can be observed 1 all curves exhibit the same variation pattern in which the average circulation for the propeller blades reaches a maximum at approximately 0 75r followed by a decrease to the minimum at the tip which indicates the blade is gently loaded at the tip this has an effect on the strength of the tip vortices generated by the propeller in general a higher circulation near the tip would generate a stronger and larger tip vortex kumar et al 2017 2 the values at the higher loading condition are notably larger than those at the lighter loading condition at all range of propeller radius the maximum value at j 0 6 is approximately 0 1 for both the model and full scale propellers while the maximum value at j 1 0 is only approximately 0 04 3 in terms of scale effect it is noted that the values of g r at full scale are larger than those at model scale at a range of inner radii 0 3 r r 0 6 especially under light loading condition this suggests that this propeller at light loading condition is expected to have a stronger blade trailing edge wake at full scale when compared to model scale as for the spanwise circulation near the tip it shows almost the same values with a slight bigger one for the model scale the different radial distribution of spanwise circulation comes from the diversity of flow regime on the blade surface which has been discussed above 4 2 instantaneous wake field characteristics in addition to the blade boundary layer flow the re significantly affects the velocity distribution of the wake flow especially around the vortex core fig 7 compares the axial velocity component between model and full scale in longitudinal plane x z plane the strong flow acceleration near the tip due to the rotation of the propeller and the presence of the tip vortex are observed it is also observed that the wake field is dependent on the loading condition and scale when increasing the blade loading condition reducing j it resulted in a reduction on the distance between two consecutive tip vortices followed by a stronger velocity perturbation induced by the propeller and a smaller pitch of the wake this is consistent with the experimental results by di felice et al 2004 fig 8 presents the radial distribution of axial velocity and tangential velocity components along the black dotted lines in fig 7 the variation of the velocity distribution around the tip vortex is evident between the model and full scale higher velocity gradient is observed around the tip vortex for full scale this is ascribed to be the larger shear stress due to the thinner boundary layer in full scale the distribution of vorticity in the longitudinal plane at different advance coefficients and different scales is compared in fig 9 additionally fig 10 shows the mesh density in the red solid rectangle region in fig 9 a it is observed that the mesh resolution is sufficient to capture the core of two adjacent tip vortices as well as the small scale vortices the instantaneous wake fields are analyzed after the simulations reaching numerical convergence and achieving a statistically steady state regime that is after the propeller rotates 30 cycles for the convenience of comparative analysis the standardized physical quantities are described as follows the x and z axes are defined as x r and z r respectively the axial vorticity is standardized as ω x v o r t i c i t y i u x d where vorticity i is the axial vorticity s 1 u x is the local axial velocity m s and d is the propeller diameter m it should be noted that the vorticity contour levels of all conditions are the same in fig 9 ω x 5 5 the main features are as follows 1 both models at different loading conditions evidently display a tip vortex region 0 8 r r 1 1 a blade shed vortex region 0 3 r r 0 8 and a hub vortex region 0 r r 0 3 2 in terms of loading conditions see fig 9a b c d the wake fields of the light loading condition j 1 0 exhibit a more organized distribution of vorticities in the tip vortex region when compared to the high loading condition j 0 6 furthermore the vortex paring process denoted by the dashed circles and vortex distortion denoted by the solid circles moves more downstream as j increases more specifically as for the model scale the vortex pairing occurs at x 8r for j 1 0 while it emerges at x 2r for j 0 6 which corresponds to the experimental visualization photograph described in felli et al 2011 similar change rules are found at full scale it follows that by reducing j increasing propeller loading the wake becomes less stable owing to the instability of the wake vortex this phenomenon is obviously presented by the vortical structure shown in fig 11 and it will be analyzed in detail in the following section 3 in terms of scale effects see fig 9a c b d the vortex paring process and vortex distortion move downstream more as re increases regardless of the blade loading conditions as shown in fig 8 the full scale case experiences larger velocity and larger velocity gradient due to the larger shear stress which will cause a stronger periodic wake field in full scale case another noticeable difference is that under the light loading condition the full scale propeller exhibits more obvious blade shed vortex than the model scale one it follows that a full scale blade shed vortex remains independence up to x 7r and then merges with the hub vortex denoted by the solid rectangle at approximately x 8r on the contrary the blade shed vortex is merged by the hub vortex at approximately x 5 5r for the model scale 4 3 vortical structures in order to have a better understanding of the evolution mechanism of the wake vortex of full and model scale propellers under different loads the q criterion hunt et al 1988 is used to help visualize the spatial structure of vortices in the near wake field q is defined as follows 14 q 1 2 u x 2 v y 2 w z 2 u y v x u z w x v z w y taking case 2 as an example here we will briefly introduce the instability transitions of the vorticity structure in the wake of the propeller a general overview of vortical structure is shown in fig 11 the surface shown in this figure corresponds to q 3000s 2 in particular the tip vortices deform from the helical path and tend to interact each other to form a group while the hub vortex undergoes a sudden deformation from straight to a spiralling geometry as shown in the above figure after a slight initial reduction of the radial position of the vortex tubes which corresponds to the wake contraction stage we define this as the first stage caused by the acceleration of the flow behind the propeller the helices formed by the tip vortices remain located on a cylinder of almost constant radius to the downstream without any instabilities and they conserve their geometric characteristics fixed pitch and spiral to spiral distance this is the second stage the inception of the tip vortex instability third stage is estimated through a statistical approach considering the change of radius of the helical geometries the tip vortex perturbation fourth stage and pairing process fifth stage are clearly presented in fig 11 considering the positions where the hub vortices start to deviate from the straight geometries the onset of hub vortex instability is defined sixth stage with the further transition of vortices the secondary vortex gradually emerges seventh stage and the mutual interaction of different vortices makes the wake vortex of the propeller less stable and more chaotic similar transition processes were visualized by experimental findings in felli et al 2011 fig 12 shows the transition to instability of wake vortices under different conditions the effect of the blade loading conditions is shown in fig 12a b c d while the effect of scales is compared in fig 12a c b d it is noted that under the light loading conditions see fig 12a c only the first 4 stages are exhibited for both model and full scale simulations the analysis of the results achieved at different loading conditions and scales shows a distinct diverse evolution process in the wake vortices more specifically 1 with respect to the blade loading conditions it shows that inception of the tip vortex instability third stage moves downstream more when increasing j this is probably ascribed to the increase in the loading j 0 6 leading to an increase in the strength of the tip vortices which promotes self and mutual induction between adjacent tip vortices this phenomenon is consistent with the finding in fig 9 in fact according to okulov 2004 the transition to instability shows clear dependence on the spiral to spiral distance more specifically the blade loading condition has an effect on the hydrodynamic pitch of the wake and thus on the spiral to spiral distance indirectly in particular the smaller the blade loading condition the wider the spiral to spiral distance and the transition to instability position moves more downstream 2 when it comes to the scale effect some tiny delays are found during the transition to the instability of wake vortices for the full scale propeller these delays are more obvious at the high loading condition j 0 6 and they can be seen from the third to sixth stages in fig 12 b and d these delays suggest that the blade loading of full scale should be smaller than that of model scale when considering the high loading conditions however this seems to be contrasting with the results of table 3 that the thrust coefficient of full scale is slightly larger than that of the model scale in fact if we inspect the data in fig 6 the deeper reason for the delay is revealed as discussed in section 4 1 the average spanwise circulation values at the tip of the model scale are slightly larger than those of the full scale for both j 0 6 and j 1 0 it is concluded that the average spanwise circulation at the tip affects the strength of the tip vortices generated by the propeller more accurately due to the smaller average spanwise circulation at the tip rather than at the blade loading there is a delay of the transition to instability position at different conditions 4 4 psd analysis of kinetic energy spectra the propeller wake can also be explored by analyzing the energy transfer process felli et al 2011 di mascio et al 2014 specifically this energy transfer process involves psd analysis of ke where ke is defined as k e 0 5 u 2 v 2 w 2 v 2 it is noted that ke is made non dimensional with v 2 where v is the inflow velocity the change in ke at different locations is determined by setting up a series of probe points in the wake field a sketch of the arrangement of the probes in the wake is shown in fig 13 to ensure that the probe points are positioned on the trajectory of the tip vortex the radial locations of the probe points are set as y r 0 9 and the axial locations of these points with non uniform spacing downstream of the propeller are set as x r 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 and 6 0 as recommended by di mascio et al 2014 for convenience of description the probe points are divided into three groups near field p1 p2 p3 middle field p4 p5 p6 and far field p7 p8 fig 14 shows box charts of ke fluctuations with two different advance coefficients j 1 0 and j 0 6 in model and full scale these charts demonstrate the fluctuation and average value of ke at different probe points and the illustration of the box chart can be seen in fig 15 the effect of the loading conditions and scale effects on the spectrum characteristics of wake are as follows 1 fig 14 a and c shows that under the light loading conditions j 1 0 the average ke levels are higher in p 1 than in p 2 and p 3 in the near field for both model and full scale the higher value in p 1 is caused by the acceleration of the flow behind the propeller and this effect gradually reduces with an increase in the distance between the probe points and the propeller it follows that compared with p 1 the fluctuation and average value of other probe points in near field and middle field experience dramatic decreases this can probably be ascribed to the fact that after an acceleration of the flow by the propeller the wake of the propeller and the helices formed by the tip vortices remain stable as shown in fig 8 a and c for the far field p 7 and p 8 there appears to be a slight increase in the fluctuation and average which should be caused by the inception of tip vortex destabilization 2 with respect to the case of j 0 6 fig 14 b and d the ke values experience a similar trend to the case of j 1 0 in the near field whereas they show completely different regulation in the middle and far fields it is noted that the fluctuation and the average of ke gradually increase from p 4 furthermore there exist outliers on some probe points in the middle and far fields this is probably to be ascribed to the early onset of instability of tip vortices in the heavy loading conditions as shown in fig 12 b and d which results in the increase of the ke value as well as the appearance of outliers 3 in terms of scale effect it is clearly shown that the ke fluctuation of full scale is generally larger than that of model scale to facilitate analysis of the scale effect of ke the average values of ke k e at model and full scale and their difference are listed in table 5 wherein the subscripts m f represent the model full scale respectively and δ k e represents the difference between model and full scale which is defined by eq 15 15 δ k e k e f k e m k e f k e m 2 the data in table 6 show that the k e m is generally smaller than the k e f at all probing points this is related to the different boundary layer flow the influence of the boundary layer of the blade on viscous wake can be represented by a defect in the velocity as shown in fig 16 smaller velocity defect is observed in full scale due to the thinner boundary layer it follows that higher value of k e is obtained in full scale additionally it is noticeable that there is a large decrease of k e passing from p1 to p2 at higher loading condition which is also observed from the numerical calculation by di mascio et al 2014 and gong et al 2018 fig 17 shows the variation of ke during a cycle of rotation for case 2 it is pictured that the induced velocities are strong closely behind the propeller further downstream these induced velocities tend to disappear quickly according to the experimental investigation by di felice et al 2004 it is indicated that the longitudinal decay of the tip vortex vorticity is higher at the initial phase where tip vortex formation is still in progress especially in lower j in fact after the separation from the blade the tip vortex starts an intense and complex phase of roll up of the blade wake vortical filaments shed from the trailing edge as shown in fig 18 when increasing the blade loading the wake of the actual blade starts to be rolled by the tip vortex released by the previous blade due to the effect of the large difference between the hydrodynamic pitch of the blade wake and of the tip vortices this blade to blade interaction is shifted more downstream at higher j value due to the higher pitch of the wake with respect to the tip vortex figs 19 and 20 show the distributions of the normalized power spectrum of ke at the same streamwise positions for model and full scale propellers respectively for the convenience of comparison and analysis some definitions and explanation are as follows blade passing frequency bpf n z i e bpf 75 hz for the model scale propeller and bpf 21 65 hz for the full scale propeller and axial passing frequency apf n 2 the wavenumber k is standardized based on the bpf i e the bpf corresponds to k 1 while the apf corresponds to k 0 2 by comparing all four cases several common characteristics can be concluded from the streamwise evolution of the psd of ke 1 the main peaks appear at the bpf and apf as well as their integral multiples with the peak being the largest at the bpf or apf as expected because of the small distance from the propeller plane 2 the peaks gradually attenuate afterwards and the farther the distance between the probe point and the propeller the faster the attenuation 3 the streamwise evolution of the psd of ke signals shows a mechanism of energy relocation where energy transfers from the blade to the shaft harmonic felli et al 2006 4 in the case of the high loading condition in the middle and far field most of the peaks have vanished or there exist some peaks associated with non integer values of k and whole curves have shifted to higher values these phenomena are caused by the pairing process between neighboring tip vortices or the growth of a secondary vortex and its interaction with the main vortical structure according to the research of muscari et al 2013 and di mascio et al 2014 this cause effect relation can also be validated if we come back to inspect fig 9 b d and fig 12 b d in order to describe the effect of loading condition in detail the psd of ke at probe points p 3 p 5 and p 7 as shown in fig 21 which represents the near medium and far field respectively are compared fig 22 shows the spectra at p 3 p 5 and p 7 under the two loading conditions as shown in the figure the peaks in bpf and its multiples are almost same at different positions with respect to the peaks in apf and its multiples they show distinct differences from the bpf more specifically the difference of peaks in apf and its multiples between light and high loading is quite small in the near field however along with the probe points moving downstream the peaks under the high loading condition increase gradually which enlarges the difference of peaks in apf and its multiples under the two loading conditions this can be attributed to the instability of the wake field and the wake vortex morphology as shown in fig 21 for both light and high loading conditions p 3 is located in a stable wake field when it comes to p 5 and p 7 the advance onset of wake field instability under high loading condition makes p 5 and p 7 lie in a more chaotic wake field which will induce an increase in the peaks in fact the fluctuations of the wake signals at a point depend on two aspects 1 the high levels of turbulence in the tip vortex and 2 the fluctuating positions of the tip vortex felli et al 2011 in the near wake the former contribution is predominant because the tip vortex passage is regular and the oscillations are small the latter contribution becomes more predominant further downstream as a consequence of the strong distortions that the tip vortices undergo in the transition and the far wake see fig 21 a another noticeable feature is that the speed of energy relocation under the heavy loading condition is faster than that of the light loading condition for both model and full scale the peak of bpf is larger than that of apf at p 3 for both loading conditions if we inspect the data at p 5 it is found that the peak of bpf is still larger than that of apf for the light loading condition but the result is opposite for the heavy loading condition to better explore the scale effect of the ke spectrum psd spectra for model and full scale propellers at p 3 p 5 and p 7 are compared in fig 23 it is interesting to note that the whole curves of full scale and the peaks of full scale associated with the abf bpf and their harmonics k 0 4 0 6 and k 1 2 are generally larger than the model scale equivalents independently of the propeller loading conditions more specifically fig 23 shows significant higher peaks of ke in the full scale case this can be related to the distribution of velocity around the tip vortex as shown in figs 7 and 8 the full scale case experiences larger velocity and larger velocity gradient due to the larger shear stress as mentioned in section 4 2 this will cause a stronger periodic wake field in full scale case which is illustrated by the growth of axial vorticity showing in fig 12 in fact figs 9 and 12 indicate that the propeller wake experiences an increasing instability as going downstream especially under high loading condition when increasing the blade loading the wake of the actual blade starts to be rolled by the tip vortex released by the previous blade due to the effect of the large difference between the hydrodynamic pitch of the blade wake and of the tip vortices another important physical phenomenon which is active in the propeller wake is spiral roll up of the blade trailing edge vortex sheet as shown in fig 18 this phenomenon is responsible for detaching the tip vortices from the blade trailing edge wake after complete roll up and formation of smaller fragments of the trailing edge wake which eventually dissipate to form the far wake as described by joukowski 1912 consisting of only tip and hub vortices besides the higher peaks full scale ke spectra are also characterized by higher broadband levels this is ascribed to be the difference of the boundary layer between the model and full scale case showing in fig 16 smaller velocity defect is observed in full scale due to the thinner boundary layer the larger ke in the wake of the full scale propeller is indeed an interesting aspect which could cause higher noise however the problem of propeller noise scaling is very complex and involves many other aspects e g hull wake nuclei content bubble dynamics cavitation inception etc this will warrant a future works 5 conclusions in this study the scale effect of propeller wake under open water conditions has been analyzed by numerical methods based on des particularly the open water performance is analyzed for the sake of validation and a detailed analysis of instantaneous flow field vortical structure and ke spectra under different advance coefficients are explored for the scale effect of the propeller wake furthermore the study revealed the relation between the blade loading and the wake vortical structure of the propeller the results presented in this paper lead us to the following conclusions 1 the average spanwise circulation reaches the maximum at approximately 0 75r and the values of average spanwise circulation at the higher loading condition are considerably larger than those at the lighter loading condition at all ranges of propeller radius scale effect on the average spanwise circulation varies with the loading conditions specifically the values of g r at full scale are larger than those at model scale at a range of inner radii 0 3 r r 0 6 especially under light loading condition as for the spanwise circulation near the tip they show almost same values with a slight bigger one for the model scale 2 under the light loading condition the full scale propeller exhibits stronger blade shed vortex than the model scale it follows that the blade shed vortex of the full scale keeps independence up to x 7r and then it merges with the hub vortex at approximately x 8r on the contrary the blade shed vortex is merged by the hub vortex at approximately x 5 5r for the model scale 3 the vortical structure visualizations allowed us to clarify the relationship between the load and the wake of the propeller besides the average spanwise circulation at the tip the development of the tip vortex and vortex roll up also have an effect on the strength of the tip vortices generated by the propeller further the strength of the tip vortices plays a critical role in the onset of the instability of wake 4 the influence of scale effect on k e can differ significantly under the light and high loading conditions with respect to the high loading condition k e of full scale is at least 15 larger than that of model scale while in the case of the light loading condition the maximum average difference is merely approximately 5 the psd analysis of ke demonstrates that the total values of full scale are generally larger than those of model scale which could cause higher noise for a full scale propeller we did not consider the effect of the wake field of the ship in this study subsequent research could be based on these findings and will focus on the effect of wake field on wake dynamics of the propeller declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

as the initial water entry velocity and the mass density ρ of the cylinder relative to the water are systematically studied the whole dropping process of horizontal cylinders with different relative mass density is simulated simulations are also conducted for studying a positively buoyant cylinder ρ 1 with various initial water entry velocity the relative mass density and initial water entry velocity are found to have significant influence on the motion behavior including in plane and out of plane motions hydrodynamic pressure and forces including viscous force and pressure force of the freely falling horizontal cylinder keywords freely falling cylinder relative mass density initial water entry velocity motion hydrodynamic forces 1 introduction objects freely falling in steady liquid or gas are common situations encountered in various engineering and science fields a brief list of those situations includes sedimentology chemical processing aerospace engineering and meteorology this topic is also important in offshore engineering many offshore equipment and structures such as drilling pipes submerged containers and underwater vehicles are cylinders with the circular section or close to circular section during offshore operations these structures are either accidentally or intentionally dropped into the free water surface and then they are freely falling a cylinder freely falling from air into calm water has been investigated by many researchers in the past few years the whole dropping process of the freely falling body into water is mainly divided into two stages the water impact and entry of the cylinder and the sinking of the submerged cylinder wei et al 2010 most research focus only on one of them the water entry means the process of cylinders entering the water from the air and impacting the water surface early investigations on the water entry process of cylinders mainly concentrated on two ways first different numerical models to solve a simplified two dimensional 2d problem wang and guedes soares 2012 hafsia et al 2009 basic et al 2014 li and anvar 2014 wang et al 2014 second a series of water entry experiments by lin and shieh 1997 colicchio et al 2009 chu et al 2015 wei and hu 2015 derakhshanian et al 2018 with the calculating capability of computers increasing significantly numerical models to solve 3d water entry problems were also developed recently wang and guedes soares 2014 studied the water entry of hemispheres and cones via an ale algorithm jiang et al 2016 introduced a numerical simulation procedure via a finite volume method based commercial software ansys fluent to investigate the transient behavior of super cavitating axial flow past a cylindrical projectile through multiple phase media ma et al 2018 utilized finite volume method based open source codes openfoam to simulate large amplitude motions for structures impacting water waves derakhshanian et al 2018 numerically studied the water entry problems of vertical and inclined cylinders and found that the numerical algorithm in the finite element analysis software abaqus ale is able to be reliably applied to solve the fluid structure interaction problem during water entry and accurately determine the impact forces and moments even under very large angle and water entry velocity conditions wen and qiu 2018 developed a cip based finite difference method to solve 3d water entry problems involving breaking free surfaces and air bubbles by implementing a parallel algorithm and an interface capturing scheme the cip based method shows good calculating performance in terms of accuracy and speed up however the authors pointed out that further improvements are required to simulate the later phase of sinking process for the inclined cylinder considering the sinking process generally involves complicated rotational and translational motions sun et al 2018 presented a meshless method combined apr and sph method for water entry of 2d and 3d cylinder the good agreements between the simulated results and the experimental results indicate the capability of the sph model into accurately solving the fluid structure interaction problems the object studied in the problem of sinking in the water generally indicates a free falling one initially immersed into the water the freely sinking objects such as simple shape objects spheres jenny et al 2002 liu et al 2017 cylinders will be discussed in detail and very complicated objects torpedoes wei et al 2010 submersible crafts xu et al 2016 usually exhibit diverse dynamic patterns but the complicated mechanisms behind these motions are not fully understood sinking experiments for cylinders were conducted by aanesland 1987 horowitz and williamson 2016 and chow and adams 2011 similar numerical methods used for studying water entry problem can be used here to elucidate the characteristics of falling and the underlying mechanisms of a rigid cylinder in a surrounding fluid namkoong et al 2008 numerically investigated the 2d motion of a submerged circular cylinder freely settling or rising in an infinite fluid at low reynolds number re 188 gomez and richmond 2016 applied a cfd method to resolve the characteristics of drag and secondary motions for large sized cylinders falling in a quiescent fluid at moderate reynolds numbers a good agreement can be found through the comparisons between the simulated results and corresponding published laboratory experimental data in terms of oscillation period the drag coefficient and maximum angular displacement however there are very few studies on the whole dropping process including both the water entry and sinking process of the cylinder freely falling into water most of the existing numerical models are based on combined potential flow theory and morison equation kim et al 2002 chu et al 2002 2005 chu and fan 2006 mann et al 2007 xiang et al 2017 xiang and guedes soares 2019 the advantages of these models are fast prediction and analysis but real fluid effects such as flow separation and vortex shedding which were not studied in detail can result in possible errors when calculating the resistance to the motion in the present paper an openfoam based cfd method will be used for simulation of the whole dropping process by introducing a turbulence model that can consider associated turbulent flow effects such as flow separations factors such as the initial water entry velocity and the relative cylinder to water mass density are investigated on their influence on the motion behavior including in plane and out of plane motions and hydrodynamic forces a negatively buoyant cylinder is considered in the convergence and validation study the findings show good agreement between the simulations and corresponding published data of laboratory experiments finally the whole dropping process of the horizontal cylinder with different relative mass density is simulated a positively buoyant cylinder is utilized for studying the effect of initial water entry velocity 2 mathematical formulation and numerical model the numerical model built for the simulations of freely falling consists of multiple solvers in openfoam 2 4 0 1 a typical incompressible pressure based two phase flow solver interdymfoam 2 a turbulence model k ω sst 3 a 6 dof rigid body motion solver 2 1 volume of fluid method vof the interdymfoam solver can be well applied for solving two incompressible isothermal immiscible fluid flows via a vof volume of fluid phase fraction based interface capturing method with the capability of mesh motion mesh deformation and adaptive re meshing this vof method can be used for the flow through two phase media such as water and air the governing equations include continuity and navier stokes n s equations for the incompressible two phases respectively the continuity equation and the n s equations address the physics of mass and momentum balance respectively for the two phase flow e g water and air with constant densities of both fluids the mass conservation equation is considered only for the water phase fraction 1 γ t u γ u r γ 1 γ 0 where u is the mixture velocity field shared by water and air in the entire fluid domain u r represents the vector of relative velocity which is able to construct a sharp free surface contour the water phase fraction function γ is defined with values varying between 0 and 1 to capture the contour of free surface which is represented by 2 γ volume w volume w volume a γ 0 1 with the value of 0 corresponding to a single phase region with only air and the value of 1 corresponding to with only water accordingly other gradients of the phase fraction represent the interface region accommodating both water and air the momentum conservation equation for the flow is expressed as 3 ρ u t ρ u u μ u u γ p d g x ρ σ κ γ 4 ρ ρ w γ ρ a 1 γ 5 μ μ w γ μ a 1 γ 6 p d p ρ g x where x is the position vector ρ is the mass density of the mixture of water and air μ is the dynamic viscosity of the mixture of water and air ρ w and ρ a are mass densities of water and air respectively μ w and μ a are dynamic viscosity of water and air respectively p d is the dynamic pressure the body force terms including the pressure gradient term and the gravity term are considered and represented by the first two terms on the right hand side of the eq 3 2 2 turbulence model in present study the initial water entry velocity of the cylinder will vary from 0 5 to 2 0 m s corresponding to moderate reynolds numbers 10000 re 40000 thus a turbulence model is adopted the k ω shear stress transport sst two equation model is applied for turbulence closure where k and ω are the turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence specific dissipation rate the k ω sst model can be used as flow application without extra damping functions and is able to capture flow separation 2 3 6 dof motion solver the 6 dof motion solver deals with all the 6 degree of freedom motions of the freely falling cylinders in translational and rotational modes at each time step firstly the two solvers mentioned above compute the forces induced by the pressure shear and gravity forces acting on the cylinder surface and consequently the pressure and shear moments acting on the body the calculated resultant forces and moments are then transferred into f and n in eq 7 and eq 8 respectively the governing equations of the 6 dof motion solver fig 1 shows the dropping process of the cylinder expressed by two coordinate systems the global coordinate system oxyz and the local coordinate system oxyz eq 7 describes the translational motions of the center of mass of the cylinder in oxyz while eq 8 expresses the rotational motions of the cylinder in the oxyz with its origin in the prescribed mass center as shown in eq 8 where m is the tensor of moment of inertia and m is the body mass which were prescribed in the simulations the translational v and angular ω can be computed through this 6 dof motion solver specifically all the related kinetic parameters including the position of the cylinder s mass center the orientation angles and the translational and angular velocities were solved and obtained at this time the body location and angular position can be advanced to the next state here a maximum of four iterations were set to advance the cylinder to the new state once the cylinder is located in a new state the body of the cylinder will in turn act on the nearby fluid domain this results in the 6 dof motion solver completely interacting with the calculation of flow characteristics 3 model and mesh set up the motion of a horizontal cylinder with a diameter of d freely falling into the water under the action of gravitational and hydrodynamic forces are considered the simulated cylinder and water tank simply have the same geometry and size as used in lyu et al 2014 the cylinder is of diameter d 20 mm and length l 100 mm and the water tank is a 0 45 m 0 45 m 1 m box the entire fluid domain for computations is the space that the box encloses the cylinder and discretized into hexahedral elements by using blockmesh the box is represented by sets of structured cells as the background mesh then snappyhexmesh is employed for creating the cylinder in the box and discretizing the region enclosing the cylinder with two additional refinement layers applied near the cylinder surface as shown in fig 2 the surface mesh for the cylinder is shown in fig 3 3 1 dynamic mesh method and boundary condition definitions the simulations utilized the dynamic mesh method including both mesh moving and deforming strategies the 6 dof solver embedded in openfoam were used to control the falling movement of the cylinder dynamic mesh allows the entire mesh to translate and rotate with the motion of the cylinder in the dynamic mesh simulations it is possible to set only a small part of fluid domain in which the finite volume nodes can move with the cylinder to reduce the remeshing work and calculations the motion of each moving node is assumed to be governed by laplace s equation the deformed meshes for a certain moment during the cylinder fall are displayed in fig 4 the finite volume nodes in the rest of fluid domain and all the boundaries are set to be fixed the top boundary for velocity is set to be a mixed condition pressure inlet outlet velocity including a zero gradient condition for flow out of the domain and a velocity based on the flux in the patch normal direction for flow into the domain a pressure outlet condition was specified total pressure at the top boundary to set the static pressure from a uniform total pressure the four vertical sides and the bottom are defined as solid wall boundaries so the velocity at each is set to a fixed value of 0 representing a no slip and impermeable boundary condition and the pressure is set to be the zero normal gradient boundary condition the surface of the cylinder is defined as a moving wall with a certain body velocity 4 convergence and validation study convergence studies including investigating the influences of the spatial and temporal discretization on the simulated data are conducted for the negatively buoyant cylinder with relative mass density ρ ρ c ρ w 1 26 three typical simulations with different meshes and time steps are performed the simulated results are compared with the experimental data of lyu et al 2014 and calculated data through a semi empirical and analytical model proposed by xiang et al 2017 as shown in table 1 where nt is the number of total elements δt is the time step and y1 y2 y3 and y4 are the vertical displacement at 20 40 60 and 80 ms after water entry as shown in table 1 differences between the results from the three simulations with different grids and time steps are very small especially between medium mesh and fine mesh simulations moreover the results of vertical displacement in openfoam show more favorable agreement with the published data of laboratory experiment by lyu et al 2014 compared with the semi empirical and analytical model developed by xiang et al 2017 fig 5 shows the comparison between simulations and experiments of the vertical displacement time series from t 0 ms to t 80 ms it is noted that in this paper the water entry process begins from the cylinder touching the water surface to the cylinder moving just below the waterline namely the cylinder travels vertically for its whole diameter this definition is consistent with lyu et al 2014 the process after water entry is called the sinking process to keep consistent with lyu et al 2014 here in fig 5 t 0 ms is the moment when the water entry process ends and sinking process starts but in the following parts t 0 ms will represent the initial moment when the cylinder touches the water surface the fairly good agreement of continuous displacement time curves between fine mesh simulations and experiment again indicate a good convergence for the spatial and temporal resolutions fig 6 compares the time series of the total vertical hydrodynamic force ft time series of the freely falling cylinder using fine mesh with coarse mesh analytical results by mlm and gwm korobkin 2004 the trend of the curve using fine mesh will match the analytical results much better although the simulated peak value is much smaller than the peak value predicted by mlm and gwm this discrepancy is reasonable and expected firstly mlm and gwm are potential flow methods where the viscosity effect flow separation and vortex shedding are ignored but in the present cfd simulations all the above can be captured secondly the cylinder in mlm and gwm is a 2d model while in cfd simulations it is a 3d model with finite length thus three dimensional effects exist in the present study the slamming force of a 2d cylinder is generally much larger than in a 3d cylinder due to the three dimensional geometry the water will escape from the center of the cylinder to both sides of the cylinder resulting in much smaller pressure and force acting on the cylinder to maintain accurate simulations of the flow domain and the motions of the cylinder the fine mesh simulation with 1013 k elements and a time step of 0 000025s were applied in the section 5 case study the total hydrodynamic force ft comprises the summation of viscous force and pressure force as shown by 9 f t f v f p the f v is viscous force which represents the tangential viscous contributions 10 f v i s f i μ r d e v the f p is pressure force which is induced by the normal pressure 11 f p i s f i ρ i p i p r e f where ρ is the density of the water s f i the face area vector p the pressure μ the dynamic viscosity and r d e v the deviatoric stress tensor in fig 6 the total hydrodynamic force ft is always positive in the early entry stage there is a positive peak value during this period after the peak value the total force decreases fast and becomes negative until it comes to the lowest negative value and then goes up again the same phenomena are also observed by tassin et al 2013 for the water entry of a wedge and a parabola this can be explained by the pressure force since the pressure force is dominant compared with the viscous force the pressure force is mainly composed by two terms added mass force and slamming force as expressed by 12 f t ρ π 2 v t c 2 t ρ π v t c t c t the former is added mass force proportional to acceleration and the square of wetted area the sign of its value is opposite to the sign of the acceleration the latter is a slamming force which is always positive and is proportional to velocity and changing rate of wet area at the early entry stage the wetted area is almost zero the added mass force is very small while the velocity is large slamming force is dominant so the sign of pressure force is positive later with the wetted area increasing the added mass force increases while the slamming force decreases with the decrease of velocity namely the acceleration value is positive so the added mass force is dominant and the sign of the pressure force becomes negative because the sign of the acceleration value is positive for further validations the laminar model and the turbulent model are both applied for simulating the dropping process of the same horizontal cylinder the turbulence model shows much better agreement with the experimental data than the laminar model as shown in fig 7 the vertical motion of the cylinder predicted via the laminar model travels much faster than the turbulence model and experimental data this may be because the laminar model cannot consider correctly the flow separation at the cylinder and the vortex shedding behind the cylinder and thus underestimates the motion resistance during dropping fig 8 shows the comparison of water surface elevation using the laminar model and the turbulent model at t 4 ms t 44 ms and t 84 ms it is noted that here in fig 6 and in the following parts t 0 ms represents the moment the cylinder just touches the water surface it can be seen that at the beginning of the water entry stage although the water surface contour difference of using laminar and turbulent model are very small and hard to be recognized it is still possible to find some subtle difference at t 4 ms as shown by the black curve which represents the separation curve the water flow separation from the cylinder is much more apparent in the turbulent case than in the laminar case with the cylinder entering deep at t 84 ms the water surface contour difference induced by laminar and turbulence model becomes very large the water flow separation and cavity effects become hard to recognize in the laminar model but the turbulent model predicts a sharp separation boundary and a cavity 5 case study the numerical investigation of a freely falling cylinder concentrates on two main parameters initial water entry velocity and relative mass density ρ the obtained results which include in plane motions out of plane motions and vertical hydrodynamic forces are presented and discussed 5 1 falling cylinders with various relative mass density the relative mass density determines the submerged cylinder to be negatively buoyant or positively buoyant or neutrally buoyant through the balance force between the buoyancy force and gravity under static state for a freely falling cylinder the underwater motions can also be greatly influenced by the relative mass density because of the cylinder s different reactions to dynamic forces the cylinder with lower relative mass density may be much easier to be influenced by the disturbance caused by the water flow in the simulations the horizontal cylinder falls freely into the water with initial velocity vs 1 0 m s 5 1 1 in plane displacement in plane motions of the cylinder refer to motions in the vertical y and horizontal x directions the horizontal motion is so small compared with the vertical motion that it can be neglected here fig 9 shows the vertical displacement time curve during t 0 80 ms for the freely falling horizontal cylinder with various relative mass density ρ 0 8 0 9 1 0 and 1 2 it is observed that in all cases the vertical velocity at the ending moment of the dropping process t 80 ms obviously decreased compared with the initial water entry velocity at t 0 ms with the increase of ρ it is found that the cylinder travels much faster in the vertical direction hence the cylinder can go deeper during the same period of 80 ms also it is found that the curvature and slope of the displacement time curve changes less and the curve gradually becomes close to straight this means the decrease of the vertical velocity of the cylinder during the dropping process with large relative density is less than with small relative density 5 1 2 out of plane displacement out of plane motions of a freely falling cylinder in the water refer to motions in lateral direction here is z direction out of plane motions of a freely falling horizontal cylinder in the water has been found by either numerical modelling gomez and richmond 2016 or experiment horowitz and williamson 2016 they focused on studying the large periodical oscillations occurring only after the relative mass density ρ is lower than a critical value such as 0 54 in horowitz and williamson 2016 the present simulations are concentrated on how the cylinder travels if ρ is much larger than that critical value fig 10 shows the y z plane trajectories of the cylinder traveling during t 0 80 ms with various relative mass densities ρ 0 8 0 9 1 0 and 1 2 with ρ decreasing from 1 2 to 0 8 the lateral displacement of cylinder increases for the same submergence depth this may be because the cylinder with lower ρ may be much easier moved by the asymmetric shedding vortex this phenomena is also observed by horowitz and williamson 2016 as by reducing the mass of the cylinder the lateral motion of the cylinder starts to become larger initially the cylinder will not oscillate in the transverse direction because the lateral force is developing but may be still not unbalanced enough to produce lateral displacement similar to the way of vortex formation around a fixed cylinder only develops after an initial warm up but with the cylinder moving for longer time the cylinder will oscillate significantly in the present paper the simulated sinking process is so fast that the whole simulations are located in the initial warm up stage and may not be able to observe this kind of oscillations table 2 compares the simulated transverse displacement z d with namkoong et al 2008 s numerical results for a 2d cylinder with the similar relative density ratio it is found that the magnitudes of the two simulated transverse displacement values z d are both at 10 3 which is very small compared with vertical displacement y d therefore in numerical simulations the simulated transverse displacement may be easily influenced by numerical errors or noise resulting in inaccurate predictions in the following parts no further details on the transverse motions will be provided 5 1 3 velocity time series fig 11 compares the openfoam predicted vertical velocities of the cylinder with different relative mass density ratios the predicted curves from the 4 cases have similar trends during the water entry process the velocity decreased very fast initially and slower later during the sinking process when the cylinder becomes fully immersed the velocity of the cylinder firstly keeps decreasing till the moment that the velocity of the cylinder starts to converge to a stable state during the whole dropping process the vertical velocity reduction of the freely falling cylinder increased with its mass density decreasing because larger gravity force helps to reduce the decrease of the vertical velocity of the cylinder 5 1 4 acceleration time series the vertical acceleration time curves are shown in fig 12 evidently the curves for cases with different relative mass density ratio have similar trend there is a sharp positive peak value at the initial stage of the water entry this is because before the water reaches the separation point due to the rapid increase of wetted area according to eq 12 the added mass force and slamming force both increased significantly thus the acceleration increased after that the acceleration drops down to a negative value because when the water reaches a certain point where the separation begins the water breaks up into spray as the jet or spray starts to detach from the surface of the cylinder the surrounding water around the cylinder decreases the rate of change of the added mass reduces and this leads to the strong drop in the slamming force which corresponds to the significant drop in the acceleration while the cylinder keeps penetrating there is open cavity existing on the top of the cylinder during this stage the pressure force and accelerations change slowly at a certain moment during the sinking process the acceleration starts to oscillate this happens when the cavity becomes closed the air and droplets in the cavity start to act on the surface of the cylinder due to the compressibility of the air the cavity pressure on the cylinder will be dynamic and oscillating thus the force and acceleration is also under some kind of oscillations in both water entry and sinking process a heavier cylinder tends to experience smaller accelerations and earlier stage change but all cylinders have the same trends 5 1 5 pressure time series the center of the keel of the cylinder is generally the point experiencing the largest hydrodynamic pressures along the cylinder so it is taken into consideration the predicted hydrodynamic pressures at the center of the keel of the cylinder are compared in fig 13 it is observed that the peak values of the hydrodynamic pressures on the bottom of the cylinder occurs at the initial stage of the water entry process after the body touches the water surface after the peak value the pressure drops down fast all the way till the moment that the pressure starts to increase during the sinking process the pressure of the cylinder with larger relative density ratio is generally larger than the cylinder with a smaller relative density ratio during both water entry and sinking process 5 1 6 vertical hydrodynamic forces fig 14 a b and 14c record the viscous force fv pressure force fp and total force ft respectively one can see that the difference of viscous forces due to using different ρ are very small during the water entry process however at a certain time step during the sinking process there is a jump for the difference of the viscous force curves which makes it easy to distinguish each curve at this time the viscous force of a heavier cylinder seems to be slightly larger than the lighter ones for the pressure force with ρ increasing the force time curve moves up giving rise to a higher positive peak value and negative trough value the total force follows the trend of the pressure force 5 2 falling cylinders with various initial water entry velocity in this section the effects of the initial water entry velocity on the motion pressure and forces of the cylinder are studied a positively buoyant horizontal circular cylinder with ρ 0 8 is applied to study the effect of initial water entry velocity 5 2 1 in plane displacement fig 15 shows the vertical displacement time curve during t 0 80 ms for the freely falling horizontal cylinder with various initial entry velocity vs 1 0 m s 1 5 m s 2 0 m s it can be seen that during the whole dropping process the vertical velocity decreases with time with initial entry velocity increasing the cylinder travels much faster in the vertical direction hence the cylinder goes deeper at the end moment t 80 ms 5 2 2 velocity time series fig 16 compares the simulated vertical velocity time series of the cylinder with different initial entry velocity it is noted that the real touch speed at t 0 such as 1 98 m s may be less than the intended speed vs 2 m s because in cfd simulations the flow domain is discretized into small elements when the water line is through one element the cylinder will firstly touch the top side of the element instead of the real water line thus the velocity of the cylinder will be slightly slowed before it reaches the water line this effect can be only reduced by using smaller element but cannot be avoided however the difference is so small that it can be ignored the predicted curves from the 3 cases have similar trends table 3 shows the comparison of the reduction of the velocity after water entry δ v 1 the reduction of the velocity at the end of the simulated sinking process δ v 2 both vertical velocity reductions δ v 1 and δ v 2 become much more for a cylinder with larger initial entry velocity this may be because a cylinder with larger velocity will make the flow more turbulent and the interaction with water more significant thus make kinetic energy dissipate into the water more and faster v0 is the velocity at t 0 ms v1 is the velocity at the end of water entry process v2 is the velocity at the ending moment t 80 ms and δ v is the reduction percentage of the velocity 5 2 3 acceleration time series the vertical accelerations time curves are shown in fig 17 as expected during the water entry process the cylinder with larger initial entry velocity has larger positive peak value but has smaller negative trough value unlike the effect of mass density the initial velocity also influences the oscillations occurring at the later stage of the sink process with the initial entry increasing the oscillations start earlier and become more frequent this may be because larger flow past velocity causes more active cavity dynamics 5 2 4 pressure time series fig 18 compares the predicted hydrodynamic pressures at the center of the keel of the cylinder with different initial entry velocity it is observed that the pressure of the cylinder with larger initial entry velocity is generally larger than the cylinder with a smaller velocity during both water entry and sinking process 5 2 5 vertical hydrodynamic forces fig 19 shows the time series of viscous force pressure force and total force for the freely falling cylinder with vs 1 0 m s 1 5 m s and 2 0 m s respectively it can be seen that the positive peak becomes higher the negative trough value of viscous force also becomes lower with the increase of vs during the simulations of 80 ms the apparent difference can only be observed during the initial water entry and afterwards it becomes very small for pressure and total forces the positive peak value goes higher with vs increasing and the first negative trough value goes higher as well 6 conclusions an openfoam based cfd method has been used to study the whole dropping process including water entry and sinking process of a freely falling horizontal cylinder the turbulence model k ω sst is applied for calculating the flow resistance and a more accurate simulation can be obtained by taking turbulent flow effect in consideration such as flow separation compared with laminar model a good agreement between the simulations and corresponding experimental data validated the openfoam based cfd method for solving this kind of freely falling problem factors such as the relative cylinder to water mass density ρ and the initial water entry velocity vs are investigated and found to have significant influence on the motion behavior including in plane and out of plane motions hydrodynamic pressure and forces of the freely falling horizontal cylinder the whole dropping process of the horizontal cylinder with different relative mass density is studied in the studied cases vertical velocity of the cylinder during the whole dropping process all decreased compared with the initial water entry velocity with the increase of ρ 1 the decrease of vertical velocity during the whole dropping process becomes less 2 the cylinder moves faster vertically inducing larger vertical displacement but for the same submergence depth the lateral displacement of the cylinder decreases 3 the differences of viscous forces due to using different ρ are very small for pressure force and total force the force time curve moves upper resulting in higher positive peak value and negative trough value a positively buoyant cylinder is utilized for studying the effect of

mass density is simulated simulations are also conducted for studying a positively buoyant cylinder ρ 1 with various initial water entry velocity the relative mass density and initial water entry velocity are found to have significant influence on the motion behavior including in plane and out of plane motions hydrodynamic pressure and forces including viscous force and pressure force of the freely falling horizontal cylinder keywords freely falling cylinder relative mass density initial water entry velocity motion hydrodynamic forces 1 introduction objects freely falling in steady liquid or gas are common situations encountered in various engineering and science fields a brief list of those situations includes sedimentology chemical processing aerospace engineering and meteorology this topic is also important in offshore engineering many offshore equipment and structures such as drilling pipes submerged containers and underwater vehicles are cylinders with the circular section or close to circular section during offshore operations these structures are either accidentally or intentionally dropped into the free water surface and then they are freely falling a cylinder freely falling from air into calm water has been investigated by many researchers in the past few years the whole dropping process of the freely falling body into water is mainly divided into two stages the water impact and entry of the cylinder and the sinking of the submerged cylinder wei et al 2010 most research focus only on one of them the water entry means the process of cylinders entering the water from the air and impacting the water surface early investigations on the water entry process of cylinders mainly concentrated on two ways first different numerical models to solve a simplified two dimensional 2d problem wang and guedes soares 2012 hafsia et al 2009 basic et al 2014 li and anvar 2014 wang et al 2014 second a series of water entry experiments by lin and shieh 1997 colicchio et al 2009 chu et al 2015 wei and hu 2015 derakhshanian et al 2018 with the calculating capability of computers increasing significantly numerical models to solve 3d water entry problems were also developed recently wang and guedes soares 2014 studied the water entry of hemispheres and cones via an ale algorithm jiang et al 2016 introduced a numerical simulation procedure via a finite volume method based commercial software ansys fluent to investigate the transient behavior of super cavitating axial flow past a cylindrical projectile through multiple phase media ma et al 2018 utilized finite volume method based open source codes openfoam to simulate large amplitude motions for structures impacting water waves derakhshanian et al 2018 numerically studied the water entry problems of vertical and inclined cylinders and found that the numerical algorithm in the finite element analysis software abaqus ale is able to be reliably applied to solve the fluid structure interaction problem during water entry and accurately determine the impact forces and moments even under very large angle and water entry velocity conditions wen and qiu 2018 developed a cip based finite difference method to solve 3d water entry problems involving breaking free surfaces and air bubbles by implementing a parallel algorithm and an interface capturing scheme the cip based method shows good calculating performance in terms of accuracy and speed up however the authors pointed out that further improvements are required to simulate the later phase of sinking process for the inclined cylinder considering the sinking process generally involves complicated rotational and translational motions sun et al 2018 presented a meshless method combined apr and sph method for water entry of 2d and 3d cylinder the good agreements between the simulated results and the experimental results indicate the capability of the sph model into accurately solving the fluid structure interaction problems the object studied in the problem of sinking in the water generally indicates a free falling one initially immersed into the water the freely sinking objects such as simple shape objects spheres jenny et al 2002 liu et al 2017 cylinders will be discussed in detail and very complicated objects torpedoes wei et al 2010 submersible crafts xu et al 2016 usually exhibit diverse dynamic patterns but the complicated mechanisms behind these motions are not fully understood sinking experiments for cylinders were conducted by aanesland 1987 horowitz and williamson 2016 and chow and adams 2011 similar numerical methods used for studying water entry problem can be used here to elucidate the characteristics of falling and the underlying mechanisms of a rigid cylinder in a surrounding fluid namkoong et al 2008 numerically investigated the 2d motion of a submerged circular cylinder freely settling or rising in an infinite fluid at low reynolds number re 188 gomez and richmond 2016 applied a cfd method to resolve the characteristics of drag and secondary motions for large sized cylinders falling in a quiescent fluid at moderate reynolds numbers a good agreement can be found through the comparisons between the simulated results and corresponding published laboratory experimental data in terms of oscillation period the drag coefficient and maximum angular displacement however there are very few studies on the whole dropping process including both the water entry and sinking process of the cylinder freely falling into water most of the existing numerical models are based on combined potential flow theory and morison equation kim et al 2002 chu et al 2002 2005 chu and fan 2006 mann et al 2007 xiang et al 2017 xiang and guedes soares 2019 the advantages of these models are fast prediction and analysis but real fluid effects such as flow separation and vortex shedding which were not studied in detail can result in possible errors when calculating the resistance to the motion in the present paper an openfoam based cfd method will be used for simulation of the whole dropping process by introducing a turbulence model that can consider associated turbulent flow effects such as flow separations factors such as the initial water entry velocity and the relative cylinder to water mass density are investigated on their influence on the motion behavior including in plane and out of plane motions and hydrodynamic forces a negatively buoyant cylinder is considered in the convergence and validation study the findings show good agreement between the simulations and corresponding published data of laboratory experiments finally the whole dropping process of the horizontal cylinder with different relative mass density is simulated a positively buoyant cylinder is utilized for studying the effect of initial water entry velocity 2 mathematical formulation and numerical model the numerical model built for the simulations of freely falling consists of multiple solvers in openfoam 2 4 0 1 a typical incompressible pressure based two phase flow solver interdymfoam 2 a turbulence model k ω sst 3 a 6 dof rigid body motion solver 2 1 volume of fluid method vof the interdymfoam solver can be well applied for solving two incompressible isothermal immiscible fluid flows via a vof volume of fluid phase fraction based interface capturing method with the capability of mesh motion mesh deformation and adaptive re meshing this vof method can be used for the flow through two phase media such as water and air the governing equations include continuity and navier stokes n s equations for the incompressible two phases respectively the continuity equation and the n s equations address the physics of mass and momentum balance respectively for the two phase flow e g water and air with constant densities of both fluids the mass conservation equation is considered only for the water phase fraction 1 γ t u γ u r γ 1 γ 0 where u is the mixture velocity field shared by water and air in the entire fluid domain u r represents the vector of relative velocity which is able to construct a sharp free surface contour the water phase fraction function γ is defined with values varying between 0 and 1 to capture the contour of free surface which is represented by 2 γ volume w volume w volume a γ 0 1 with the value of 0 corresponding to a single phase region with only air and the value of 1 corresponding to with only water accordingly other gradients of the phase fraction represent the interface region accommodating both water and air the momentum conservation equation for the flow is expressed as 3 ρ u t ρ u u μ u u γ p d g x ρ σ κ γ 4 ρ ρ w γ ρ a 1 γ 5 μ μ w γ μ a 1 γ 6 p d p ρ g x where x is the position vector ρ is the mass density of the mixture of water and air μ is the dynamic viscosity of the mixture of water and air ρ w and ρ a are mass densities of water and air respectively μ w and μ a are dynamic viscosity of water and air respectively p d is the dynamic pressure the body force terms including the pressure gradient term and the gravity term are considered and represented by the first two terms on the right hand side of the eq 3 2 2 turbulence model in present study the initial water entry velocity of the cylinder will vary from 0 5 to 2 0 m s corresponding to moderate reynolds numbers 10000 re 40000 thus a turbulence model is adopted the k ω shear stress transport sst two equation model is applied for turbulence closure where k and ω are the turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence specific dissipation rate the k ω sst model can be used as flow application without extra damping functions and is able to capture flow separation 2 3 6 dof motion solver the 6 dof motion solver deals with all the 6 degree of freedom motions of the freely falling cylinders in translational and rotational modes at each time step firstly the two solvers mentioned above compute the forces induced by the pressure shear and gravity forces acting on the cylinder surface and consequently the pressure and shear moments acting on the body the calculated resultant forces and moments are then transferred into f and n in eq 7 and eq 8 respectively the governing equations of the 6 dof motion solver fig 1 shows the dropping process of the cylinder expressed by two coordinate systems the global coordinate system oxyz and the local coordinate system oxyz eq 7 describes the translational motions of the center of mass of the cylinder in oxyz while eq 8 expresses the rotational motions of the cylinder in the oxyz with its origin in the prescribed mass center as shown in eq 8 where m is the tensor of moment of inertia and m is the body mass which were prescribed in the simulations the translational v and angular ω can be computed through this 6 dof motion solver specifically all the related kinetic parameters including the position of the cylinder s mass center the orientation angles and the translational and angular velocities were solved and obtained at this time the body location and angular position can be advanced to the next state here a maximum of four iterations were set to advance the cylinder to the new state once the cylinder is located in a new state the body of the cylinder will in turn act on the nearby fluid domain this results in the 6 dof motion solver completely interacting with the calculation of flow characteristics 3 model and mesh set up the motion of a horizontal cylinder with a diameter of d freely falling into the water under the action of gravitational and hydrodynamic forces are considered the simulated cylinder and water tank simply have the same geometry and size as used in lyu et al 2014 the cylinder is of diameter d 20 mm and length l 100 mm and the water tank is a 0 45 m 0 45 m 1 m box the entire fluid domain for computations is the space that the box encloses the cylinder and discretized into hexahedral elements by using blockmesh the box is represented by sets of structured cells as the background mesh then snappyhexmesh is employed for creating the cylinder in the box and discretizing the region enclosing the cylinder with two additional refinement layers applied near the cylinder surface as shown in fig 2 the surface mesh for the cylinder is shown in fig 3 3 1 dynamic mesh method and boundary condition definitions the simulations utilized the dynamic mesh method including both mesh moving and deforming strategies the 6 dof solver embedded in openfoam were used to control the falling movement of the cylinder dynamic mesh allows the entire mesh to translate and rotate with the motion of the cylinder in the dynamic mesh simulations it is possible to set only a small part of fluid domain in which the finite volume nodes can move with the cylinder to reduce the remeshing work and calculations the motion of each moving node is assumed to be governed by laplace s equation the deformed meshes for a certain moment during the cylinder fall are displayed in fig 4 the finite volume nodes in the rest of fluid domain and all the boundaries are set to be fixed the top boundary for velocity is set to be a mixed condition pressure inlet outlet velocity including a zero gradient condition for flow out of the domain and a velocity based on the flux in the patch normal direction for flow into the domain a pressure outlet condition was specified total pressure at the top boundary to set the static pressure from a uniform total pressure the four vertical sides and the bottom are defined as solid wall boundaries so the velocity at each is set to a fixed value of 0 representing a no slip and impermeable boundary condition and the pressure is set to be the zero normal gradient boundary condition the surface of the cylinder is defined as a moving wall with a certain body velocity 4 convergence and validation study convergence studies including investigating the influences of the spatial and temporal discretization on the simulated data are conducted for the negatively buoyant cylinder with relative mass density ρ ρ c ρ w 1 26 three typical simulations with different meshes and time steps are performed the simulated results are compared with the experimental data of lyu et al 2014 and calculated data through a semi empirical and analytical model proposed by xiang et al 2017 as shown in table 1 where nt is the number of total elements δt is the time step and y1 y2 y3 and y4 are the vertical displacement at 20 40 60 and 80 ms after water entry as shown in table 1 differences between the results from the three simulations with different grids and time steps are very small especially between medium mesh and fine mesh simulations moreover the results of vertical displacement in openfoam show more favorable agreement with the published data of laboratory experiment by lyu et al 2014 compared with the semi empirical and analytical model developed by xiang et al 2017 fig 5 shows the comparison between simulations and experiments of the vertical displacement time series from t 0 ms to t 80 ms it is noted that in this paper the water entry process begins from the cylinder touching the water surface to the cylinder moving just below the waterline namely the cylinder travels vertically for its whole diameter this definition is consistent with lyu et al 2014 the process after water entry is called the sinking process to keep consistent with lyu et al 2014 here in fig 5 t 0 ms is the moment when the water entry process ends and sinking process starts but in the following parts t 0 ms will represent the initial moment when the cylinder touches the water surface the fairly good agreement of continuous displacement time curves between fine mesh simulations and experiment again indicate a good convergence for the spatial and temporal resolutions fig 6 compares the time series of the total vertical hydrodynamic force ft time series of the freely falling cylinder using fine mesh with coarse mesh analytical results by mlm and gwm korobkin 2004 the trend of the curve using fine mesh will match the analytical results much better although the simulated peak value is much smaller than the peak value predicted by mlm and gwm this discrepancy is reasonable and expected firstly mlm and gwm are potential flow methods where the viscosity effect flow separation and vortex shedding are ignored but in the present cfd simulations all the above can be captured secondly the cylinder in mlm and gwm is a 2d model while in cfd simulations it is a 3d model with finite length thus three dimensional effects exist in the present study the slamming force of a 2d cylinder is generally much larger than in a 3d cylinder due to the three dimensional geometry the water will escape from the center of the cylinder to both sides of the cylinder resulting in much smaller pressure and force acting on the cylinder to maintain accurate simulations of the flow domain and the motions of the cylinder the fine mesh simulation with 1013 k elements and a time step of 0 000025s were applied in the section 5 case study the total hydrodynamic force ft comprises the summation of viscous force and pressure force as shown by 9 f t f v f p the f v is viscous force which represents the tangential viscous contributions 10 f v i s f i μ r d e v the f p is pressure force which is induced by the normal pressure 11 f p i s f i ρ i p i p r e f where ρ is the density of the water s f i the face area vector p the pressure μ the dynamic viscosity and r d e v the deviatoric stress tensor in fig 6 the total hydrodynamic force ft is always positive in the early entry stage there is a positive peak value during this period after the peak value the total force decreases fast and becomes negative until it comes to the lowest negative value and then goes up again the same phenomena are also observed by tassin et al 2013 for the water entry of a wedge and a parabola this can be explained by the pressure force since the pressure force is dominant compared with the viscous force the pressure force is mainly composed by two terms added mass force and slamming force as expressed by 12 f t ρ π 2 v t c 2 t ρ π v t c t c t the former is added mass force proportional to acceleration and the square of wetted area the sign of its value is opposite to the sign of the acceleration the latter is a slamming force which is always positive and is proportional to velocity and changing rate of wet area at the early entry stage the wetted area is almost zero the added mass force is very small while the velocity is large slamming force is dominant so the sign of pressure force is positive later with the wetted area increasing the added mass force increases while the slamming force decreases with the decrease of velocity namely the acceleration value is positive so the added mass force is dominant and the sign of the pressure force becomes negative because the sign of the acceleration value is positive for further validations the laminar model and the turbulent model are both applied for simulating the dropping process of the same horizontal cylinder the turbulence model shows much better agreement with the experimental data than the laminar model as shown in fig 7 the vertical motion of the cylinder predicted via the laminar model travels much faster than the turbulence model and experimental data this may be because the laminar model cannot consider correctly the flow separation at the cylinder and the vortex shedding behind the cylinder and thus underestimates the motion resistance during dropping fig 8 shows the comparison of water surface elevation using the laminar model and the turbulent model at t 4 ms t 44 ms and t 84 ms it is noted that here in fig 6 and in the following parts t 0 ms represents the moment the cylinder just touches the water surface it can be seen that at the beginning of the water entry stage although the water surface contour difference of using laminar and turbulent model are very small and hard to be recognized it is still possible to find some subtle difference at t 4 ms as shown by the black curve which represents the separation curve the water flow separation from the cylinder is much more apparent in the turbulent case than in the laminar case with the cylinder entering deep at t 84 ms the water surface contour difference induced by laminar and turbulence model becomes very large the water flow separation and cavity effects become hard to recognize in the laminar model but the turbulent model predicts a sharp separation boundary and a cavity 5 case study the numerical investigation of a freely falling cylinder concentrates on two main parameters initial water entry velocity and relative mass density ρ the obtained results which include in plane motions out of plane motions and vertical hydrodynamic forces are presented and discussed 5 1 falling cylinders with various relative mass density the relative mass density determines the submerged cylinder to be negatively buoyant or positively buoyant or neutrally buoyant through the balance force between the buoyancy force and gravity under static state for a freely falling cylinder the underwater motions can also be greatly influenced by the relative mass density because of the cylinder s different reactions to dynamic forces the cylinder with lower relative mass density may be much easier to be influenced by the disturbance caused by the water flow in the simulations the horizontal cylinder falls freely into the water with initial velocity vs 1 0 m s 5 1 1 in plane displacement in plane motions of the cylinder refer to motions in the vertical y and horizontal x directions the horizontal motion is so small compared with the vertical motion that it can be neglected here fig 9 shows the vertical displacement time curve during t 0 80 ms for the freely falling horizontal cylinder with various relative mass density ρ 0 8 0 9 1 0 and 1 2 it is observed that in all cases the vertical velocity at the ending moment of the dropping process t 80 ms obviously decreased compared with the initial water entry velocity at t 0 ms with the increase of ρ it is found that the cylinder travels much faster in the vertical direction hence the cylinder can go deeper during the same period of 80 ms also it is found that the curvature and slope of the displacement time curve changes less and the curve gradually becomes close to straight this means the decrease of the vertical velocity of the cylinder during the dropping process with large relative density is less than with small relative density 5 1 2 out of plane displacement out of plane motions of a freely falling cylinder in the water refer to motions in lateral direction here is z direction out of plane motions of a freely falling horizontal cylinder in the water has been found by either numerical modelling gomez and richmond 2016 or experiment horowitz and williamson 2016 they focused on studying the large periodical oscillations occurring only after the relative mass density ρ is lower than a critical value such as 0 54 in horowitz and williamson 2016 the present simulations are concentrated on how the cylinder travels if ρ is much larger than that critical value fig 10 shows the y z plane trajectories of the cylinder traveling during t 0 80 ms with various relative mass densities ρ 0 8 0 9 1 0 and 1 2 with ρ decreasing from 1 2 to 0 8 the lateral displacement of cylinder increases for the same submergence depth this may be because the cylinder with lower ρ may be much easier moved by the asymmetric shedding vortex this phenomena is also observed by horowitz and williamson 2016 as by reducing the mass of the cylinder the lateral motion of the cylinder starts to become larger initially the cylinder will not oscillate in the transverse direction because the lateral force is developing but may be still not unbalanced enough to produce lateral displacement similar to the way of vortex formation around a fixed cylinder only develops after an initial warm up but with the cylinder moving for longer time the cylinder will oscillate significantly in the present paper the simulated sinking process is so fast that the whole simulations are located in the initial warm up stage and may not be able to observe this kind of oscillations table 2 compares the simulated transverse displacement z d with namkoong et al 2008 s numerical results for a 2d cylinder with the similar relative density ratio it is found that the magnitudes of the two simulated transverse displacement values z d are both at 10 3 which is very small compared with vertical displacement y d therefore in numerical simulations the simulated transverse displacement may be easily influenced by numerical errors or noise resulting in inaccurate predictions in the following parts no further details on the transverse motions will be provided 5 1 3 velocity time series fig 11 compares the openfoam predicted vertical velocities of the cylinder with different relative mass density ratios the predicted curves from the 4 cases have similar trends during the water entry process the velocity decreased very fast initially and slower later during the sinking process when the cylinder becomes fully immersed the velocity of the cylinder firstly keeps decreasing till the moment that the velocity of the cylinder starts to converge to a stable state during the whole dropping process the vertical velocity reduction of the freely falling cylinder increased with its mass density decreasing because larger gravity force helps to reduce the decrease of the vertical velocity of the cylinder 5 1 4 acceleration time series the vertical acceleration time curves are shown in fig 12 evidently the curves for cases with different relative mass density ratio have similar trend there is a sharp positive peak value at the initial stage of the water entry this is because before the water reaches the separation point due to the rapid increase of wetted area according to eq 12 the added mass force and slamming force both increased significantly thus the acceleration increased after that the acceleration drops down to a negative value because when the water reaches a certain point where the separation begins the water breaks up into spray as the jet or spray starts to detach from the surface of the cylinder the surrounding water around the cylinder decreases the rate of change of the added mass reduces and this leads to the strong drop in the slamming force which corresponds to the significant drop in the acceleration while the cylinder keeps penetrating there is open cavity existing on the top of the cylinder during this stage the pressure force and accelerations change slowly at a certain moment during the sinking process the acceleration starts to oscillate this happens when the cavity becomes closed the air and droplets in the cavity start to act on the surface of the cylinder due to the compressibility of the air the cavity pressure on the cylinder will be dynamic and oscillating thus the force and acceleration is also under some kind of oscillations in both water entry and sinking process a heavier cylinder tends to experience smaller accelerations and earlier stage change but all cylinders have the same trends 5 1 5 pressure time series the center of the keel of the cylinder is generally the point experiencing the largest hydrodynamic pressures along the cylinder so it is taken into consideration the predicted hydrodynamic pressures at the center of the keel of the cylinder are compared in fig 13 it is observed that the peak values of the hydrodynamic pressures on the bottom of the cylinder occurs at the initial stage of the water entry process after the body touches the water surface after the peak value the pressure drops down fast all the way till the moment that the pressure starts to increase during the sinking process the pressure of the cylinder with larger relative density ratio is generally larger than the cylinder with a smaller relative density ratio during both water entry and sinking process 5 1 6 vertical hydrodynamic forces fig 14 a b and 14c record the viscous force fv pressure force fp and total force ft respectively one can see that the difference of viscous forces due to using different ρ are very small during the water entry process however at a certain time step during the sinking process there is a jump for the difference of the viscous force curves which makes it easy to distinguish each curve at this time the viscous force of a heavier cylinder seems to be slightly larger than the lighter ones for the pressure force with ρ increasing the force time curve moves up giving rise to a higher positive peak value and negative trough value the total force follows the trend of the pressure force 5 2 falling cylinders with various initial water entry velocity in this section the effects of the initial water entry velocity on the motion pressure and forces of the cylinder are studied a positively buoyant horizontal circular cylinder with ρ 0 8 is applied to study the effect of initial water entry velocity 5 2 1 in plane displacement fig 15 shows the vertical displacement time curve during t 0 80 ms for the freely falling horizontal cylinder with various initial entry velocity vs 1 0 m s 1 5 m s 2 0 m s it can be seen that during the whole dropping process the vertical velocity decreases with time with initial entry velocity increasing the cylinder travels much faster in the vertical direction hence the cylinder goes deeper at the end moment t 80 ms 5 2 2 velocity time series fig 16 compares the simulated vertical velocity time series of the cylinder with different initial entry velocity it is noted that the real touch speed at t 0 such as 1 98 m s may be less than the intended speed vs 2 m s because in cfd simulations the flow domain is discretized into small elements when the water line is through one element the cylinder will firstly touch the top side of the element instead of the real water line thus the velocity of the cylinder will be slightly slowed before it reaches the water line this effect can be only reduced by using smaller element but cannot be avoided however the difference is so small that it can be ignored the predicted curves from the 3 cases have similar trends table 3 shows the comparison of the reduction of the velocity after water entry δ v 1 the reduction of the velocity at the end of the simulated sinking process δ v 2 both vertical velocity reductions δ v 1 and δ v 2 become much more for a cylinder with larger initial entry velocity this may be because a cylinder with larger velocity will make the flow more turbulent and the interaction with water more significant thus make kinetic energy dissipate into the water more and faster v0 is the velocity at t 0 ms v1 is the velocity at the end of water entry process v2 is the velocity at the ending moment t 80 ms and δ v is the reduction percentage of the velocity 5 2 3 acceleration time series the vertical accelerations time curves are shown in fig 17 as expected during the water entry process the cylinder with larger initial entry velocity has larger positive peak value but has smaller negative trough value unlike the effect of mass density the initial velocity also influences the oscillations occurring at the later stage of the sink process with the initial entry increasing the oscillations start earlier and become more frequent this may be because larger flow past velocity causes more active cavity dynamics 5 2 4 pressure time series fig 18 compares the predicted hydrodynamic pressures at the center of the keel of the cylinder with different initial entry velocity it is observed that the pressure of the cylinder with larger initial entry velocity is generally larger than the cylinder with a smaller velocity during both water entry and sinking process 5 2 5 vertical hydrodynamic forces fig 19 shows the time series of viscous force pressure force and total force for the freely falling cylinder with vs 1 0 m s 1 5 m s and 2 0 m s respectively it can be seen that the positive peak becomes higher the negative trough value of viscous force also becomes lower with the increase of vs during the simulations of 80 ms the apparent difference can only be observed during the initial water entry and afterwards it becomes very small for pressure and total forces the positive peak value goes higher with vs increasing and the first negative trough value goes higher as well 6 conclusions an openfoam based cfd method has been used to study the whole dropping process including water entry and sinking process of a freely falling horizontal cylinder the turbulence model k ω sst is applied for calculating the flow resistance and a more accurate simulation can be obtained by taking turbulent flow effect in consideration such as flow separation compared with laminar model a good agreement between the simulations and corresponding experimental data validated the openfoam based cfd method for solving this kind of freely falling problem factors such as the relative cylinder to water mass density ρ and the initial water entry velocity vs are investigated and found to have significant influence on the motion behavior including in plane and out of plane motions hydrodynamic pressure and forces of the freely falling horizontal cylinder the whole dropping process of the horizontal cylinder with different relative mass density is studied in the studied cases vertical velocity of the cylinder during the whole dropping process all decreased compared with the initial water entry velocity with the increase of ρ 1 the decrease of vertical velocity during the whole dropping process becomes less 2 the cylinder moves faster vertically inducing larger vertical displacement but for the same submergence depth the lateral displacement of the cylinder decreases 3 the differences of viscous forces due to using different ρ are very small for pressure force and total force the force time curve moves upper resulting in higher positive peak value and negative trough value a positively buoyant cylinder is utilized for studying the effect of the initial water entry velocity with the initial entry velocity increasing 1 the vertical velocity of the cylinder during the dropping process tend to decrease more 2 the positive peak value of viscous force both goes higher and the negative trough value goes lower for pressure force and total force the force time curve moves upper resulting in higher positive peak value and negative trough

battery and streamline configuration they are superior in gyration and cruising however in order to realize autonomous underwater operation researchers should not only improve robot intelligence precise control and environmental perception but also overcome the disturbances from manipulator and oceanic current zhang et al 2012 to the best of our literature only minority research institutes have been engaged in this field the realization of underwater robotic organism capture missions requires overcoming some novel difficulties since the lights are scattered and absorbed by silt hydrone and particles the images are grayed obscured contrast reduced gianluca antonelli et al 2014 on the other hand the sea cucumbers are soft and smooth organism sea shell absorbs itself on the rock for the protection once scared both of them living close to the rocks with appearances resemble to their circumstance it is difficult for these existing underwater robots to autonomously percept complicated organism habitat and afterward realize rapid and uninjured grasp see fig 2 therefore national natural science foundation of china nsfc launched a group of key projects of underwater vehicle environmental perception and target capture to realize robotic capturing in 2016 the main objectives of these projects are to develop low cost underwater robot capturing platforms on the basis of the following researches ① environmental perception of underwater landscapes plants and currents ② rapid detection recognition and tracking of target organism ③ aliveness and rapid capture of target organism from these researches not only the oceanic organism harvest is expected to be artificialized and mechanized but also the underwater rescue oceanic engineering and submarine exploring are propelled therefore this paper will investigate the challenge and development of underwater robot for autonomous environmental perception and target organism capture this article will review the development of underwater autonomous manipulation robot including i auv and remotely autonomous underwater vehicles and then propose some method for autonomous robotic organism capture it will be organized into five sections following the introduction the state of art analysis will be proposed in section 2 the analysis of autonomous capture process for underwater robot will be investigated in section 3 in section 4 simulations and experiments are performed to verify the proposed methodologies finally conclusions will be made in section 5 2 state of art analysis 2 1 underwater autonomous manipulation robot literature from 1990s researchers began to devote their attentions to underwater dexterous and autonomous operations in amadeus project two 7 dof degree of freedom electrical underwater arms with three hydraulic fingered grippers were developed for dexterous operations see fig 3 with force and tactile sensor on the fingertip of end effectors this project performed coordinated manipulating experiments on rigid object in the water tank casalino g et al 2001 recently some more underwater dual arm vehicle manipulator systems have been invented for remotely autonomous operation under the project of european commission s horizon 2020 framework germany italy switherland and belgium have developed an underwater dual arm remotely autonomous operation system for dexterous manipulation under vision touch and multi sensor system see fig 4 a andreas birk et al 2018 workgroup of stanford university has invented a multisensory humanoid robotic diver ocean one for oceanic discovery see fig 4 b it is equipped with a pair of 7 dof electrical compliant and a torque controlled arms with gentle hands oussama khatib et al 2016 these robots have made a great progress in underwater dexterous operation but it is still partly dependent on the operator guidance with limited observation and operation range different from rovs auvs should be provided with precise dead reckoning navigation and control techniques to realize autonomous cruising and operations although in the projects of union rigaud v et al 1998 and swimmer evans j et al 2001 rovs were studied to increase autonomy and intelligence with manipulators co ordination the operation range of these rovs is limited the development of alive sauvim and girona 500 i auvs symbolizes three milestone progresses for i auv pere ridaoa et al 2015 see fig 5 the 3 5t alive was equipped with two hydraulic docking manipulators and a 7 dof arm its design purpose is autonomous navigation docking and opening a valve for the petroleum industry evans j et al 2001 equipped with ansaldo arm of the amadeus project sauvim 6t was purposed for free floating underwater operation it established autonomous manipulation control architecture based on the visual information processing for the first time realized autonomous target moving and hook securing in the oceanic environment giacomo marani et al 2014 on the basis of trident enrico simetti et al 2014 project girona 500 was developed with a 7 dof manipulator and 3 fingered hand it was purposed for a multisensory based free floating manipulation since girona 500 200 kg is much smaller than the last two coupling disturbances should be considered in the manipulation process researches were focused on vision based dexterous manipulation and vehicle manipulator coordinated motions giuseppe casalino et al 2014 2 2 autonomous environmental perception for underwater operation since the visual range of underwater environment is very limited researchers of project sauvim proposed 3 stages for the target localization and manipulation fig 6 the 375 khz image scan sonars are employed for object searching and directing for the distance of more than 30 m the didson sonar is applied for the target accurate recognition and location for the distance of 2 40 m video cameras are used to perform actual operation task within the manipulator workspace autonomous acoustic sensors play great roles in target searching recognition donghwa lee et al 2012 and tracking szymon krupinski et al 2015 visual recognition localization tracking servo junaed sattar et al 2009 and control are still the foundation for the underwater robot manipulation peter 2013 different from land image processing great areas of complicate background such as sea water silt aquatic plant rock marine life in the image of natural aquiculture area together with lower brightness and current give rise to great difficulties in visual perception jeet banerjee et al 2016 on the object recognition of underwater robot the automatic recognition approaches have been applied by using the image features recognition algorithm armagan elibol et al 2014 generic segmentation process j c garcía et al 2010 colour and shape based identification algorithm feihu sun et al 2014 but for the sea organism the shape and colour features are very genetic to their environment antoni burguera et al 2016 in order to accurately recognize objects under complex environment deep learning algorithms have emerged and developed since 2010 currently the deep learning algorithms can be classified into the end to end algorithms and the region proposal based algorithms the end to end algorithms which including yolo you only look once algorithms redmon j et al 2016 and ssd single shot multibox detector algorithms liu w et al 2016 are advantaged in processing speed the processing speed can reach 45 fps frames per second on the other hand the region proposal based algorithm combines the region proposal method with convolutional neural networks cnns these algorithms such as faster region based convolutional networks faster r cnn ren s et al 2017 and region based fully convolutional networks r fcn dai j et al 2016 can process more accurately the operation target was successfully localized through polygon and ellipse window mario prats et al 2011 based 3d visual matching and template based tracking m prats et al 2012 see fig 7 huang and sheng et al reduced the calibration error by adjusting the placement and posture of the calibration board improved the characteristic describing points of the images by using daisy operator for the sift scale invariant feature transform algorithm consequently increased the servo grasp successful rate huang et al 2016 dario lodi rizzini et al established an integrated stereo vision system for pipe manipulation tasks dario lodi rizzini et al 2017 through calibration contour and colour information based detection pose estimation pipe grasp was realized in the water pool however underwater target localization and recognition strategies are sometimes not very effective due to the dim environment laser marker a peñalver et al 2015 and light illumination are recommended to be used for target detection and pose estimation p j sanz et al 2013 for the successful grasp francisco bonin font et al 2015a b 2 3 underwater vehicle manipulator system modelling and coordinated control literature since the oceanic organism capturing robot will be applied by fisherman its size and cost should be designed for the fishing boat the disturbances of manipulator on the vehicle during coordinating motion are composed of restoring moments and coupling forces the changes of buoyancy and gravity centre during manipulation process lead to restoring moments giacomo marani et al 2010 while the coupling forces are caused by the coupling motions between vehicle and manipulator the modelling and coupling control of underwater vehicle manipulator system uvms are important for precise manipulation the methodologies for coordination control include performance index based optimization ismail z h et al 2009 model based observation and control santhakumar m 2011 task priority control et al gianluca antonelli et al 2003 jonghui han and wan kyun chung et al 2011 established an inertial coordinated system on the basis of uvms modelling a performance index was proposed to selectively optimize the restoring forces so that the control input can compensate the restoring forces and moments jonghui han et al 2014 huang and tang et al systematically analysed dynamic modelling of the uvms on the basis of newton euler dynamics an s surface based adaptive control was proposed for the coordinated control hai huang et al 2017 kyushu institute of technology made robust control for uvms coordination on the basis of dynamic model shinichi sagara et al 2010 based on task priority framework enrico simetti et al applied redundancy dof to reduce restoring moments during the manipulation of girona 500 enrico simetti et al 2014 they further applied task priority in the free floating manipulation control by taking higher precision as higher priority criterion lower priority for camera occlusion centring distance and height task to guarantee manipulation in sight ninad manerikar et al 2015 moreover coordination control and manipulation method of dual arm underwater vehicle manipulator system dauvms has been considered in the simulations hamed farivarnejad et al 2014 in compare with uvms dauvms is a more redundant system and expected to maintain body stability realize cooperative manipulation and regulate task priorities for underwater operations e simetti and casalino 2015 task priority in references has involved trajectory plan in the coordinated control in fact the coordinated motion trajectories of vehicle and manipulator should be optimized so that the uvms can preserve enough control forces against the current disturbance in the field operations 2 4 robotic hand for uninjured grasp the robotic uninjured grasp has attracted great attentions world widely due to great prospective of surgical operation and underwater rescue traditionally gentle grasp is realized through feedback control of mems based multi dimensional force sensor on the tip of rigid finger such hands include nasa hand diftler m a et al 2003 gifu hand dlr hand thomas wimböck et al 2007 hit dlr hand h liu a et al 2007 from these researches multi dimensional force sensors based multi dof underwater hand have been developed such as the three finger hand and multi dimensional force sensor of girona 500 g palli et al 2015 see fig 8 a 3 fingers 9 dof dexterous hand with sealed tip force sensor of harbin engineering university wang 2006 a 3 fingers 6 dof dexterous hand with sealed tip force sensor by liang and zhang et al 2010 however the sealed structure for multi dimensional force sensors is complicated the working depth and sensor accuracy are in conflict in the consideration with hand weight and decoupled accuracy ronghuai qi et al 2014 the maximum working depth is usually about less than 100 m depth in the last decade soft and continuum robot has attracted great attentions of researchers yap et al 2015 air muscles have been applied for gentle grasp due to its low weight and inherently compliant behaviour such as shadow hand robert bogue et al 2012 zjut hand wang et al 2014 on the basis of air muscle concept the amadeus underwater hand was designed with three parallel arranged bellows the hand bend and extension are realized through pressure change in each bellow david m lane et al 1999 however air muscles still have some disadvantages such as slow response speed expensive to model etc g chena et al 2008 nicholas farrow and correll 2015 and mohammadreza memarian et al 2015 have made researches on soft pneumatic continuum fingers by using elastic polymer as soft finger material its bending and extension are realized by inflating into the air chamber thus it can grasp quickly the model of the finger can be fabricated through 3d printers at low cost soft pneumatic continuum fingers may possess more prospective for uninjured submarine organism grasp at low cost but their actuation requires the number of air pipes correspondence with the number of dofs which not only greatly effects both manipulation motions and working depth 3 autonomous capture process analysis for underwater robot 3 1 mechanics design and electronic control system in order to realize autonomous robotic capture two major methods have been applied including robotic absorption capture and robotic grasp capture the robotic formality is often designed with open framed structure see fig 9 in order to install sensors sea organism container pump or manipulator the robot is usually less than 1 m 0 8 m 0 8 m at overall dimensions and weight less than 100 kg to adapt for fishing boat deployment and recovery the depth rating is usually less than 100 m for offshore capture the robot is usually equipped with flotation foam at upper layer 2 vertical thrusters and 4 horizontal thrusters the sensors including a depth meter altimeter magnetic compass and cameras the electronic control architecture in the robot capsule including a surface computer and embedded pc104 see fig 10 the former is responsible with environmental perception while the latter is responsible with the planning and control of capture motions the power of the robot is supplied by a dc source through an umbilical cable located between the surface and the robot the robot could be equipped with a magnetic compass and doppler velocity log dvl speed sensor for position estimation moreover dvl can provide height information which can provide necessary information for target capture although the autonomous capture process is different between absorption and grasp types the environmental perception guidance process from underwater sonar and cameras is similar 3 2 target recognition and capture architecture in the consideration with the limited submarine visual range the environmental and organism target perception can be realized through different detective methodology or instruments corresponding to long medium and short range perception see fig 11 in other words mechanical scan sonar can be employed to discover the rock environment of sea cucumber inhabitant in the 5 20 m long rang cameras can be applied to further ascertain organism inhabitant from the obscure images in the 2 5 m middle range precision recognition and distant measurement can be realized through cameras at 1 2 m short range illumination and laser marker are recommended for the visual tracking and servo in order to realize organism recognition region based fully convolutional networks r fcn has been applied to detect the organism huang et al 2019 the offshore aquatic recognition samples are provided from zhangzidao group corporation and da lian institute of technology k2 c 1 layers position sensitive score maps are generated by the feature maps through convolutional computation in order to classify regional of interests rois through rois pooling k2 position sensitive score generation r fcn training the recognition can be realized after target recognition and localization the autonomous absorption process in fig 12 can be realized through the following control with the target position and angle in the camera relative to the pipe on the other hand target grasp process will be more complicated because it should include motion planning manipulation control to realize the vehicle and multiple dofs manipulator coordination 3 3 task priority redundancy resolution approach for grasp capture motion planning during the manipulation process restoring forces are important interaction forces resulted from the change of gravity centre and buoyancy centre according to the ref hai huang et al 2017 restoring forces can be expressed as 1 g q f v g v f v b v i 1 n f v g i f v b i r v g v f v g v r v b v f 0 b v i 1 n r v g i f v g i r v b i f v b i where f v g i r n v t f n g i and f v b i r n v t f n b i represents the restoring force of the ith link relative to underwater vehicle 2 f n g v 0 0 m v g t f n b v 0 0 b v t f v g v r n v t f n g v f v b v r n v t f n b v denotes the restoring force of underwater vehicle r v g v and r v b v are the underwater vehicle cb and cg positions vectors relative to underwater vehicle geometric centre respectively r v g i and r v b i are the ith link cb and cg positions vectors relative to the underwater vehicle geometric centre respectively for the redundancy dof system of uvms the redundancy resolution method can determine the uvms s position velocity and acceleration during the task uvms trajectory planning is one of the most important difference between absorption capture and grasp capture the redundancy resolution method is an important part of trajectory planning widely used redundancy resolution methods such as least squares solution method chan t et al 1993 gradient projection method gpm shen y et al 2005 task priority method can not fully satisfy the actual needs of uvms s path planning thus a task priority redundancy resolution antonelli g et al 1998 on acceleration level which is capable of smoothing velocities and optimizing restoring moments is proposed in this section in order to realize continuance and stable organism capture motion the task priority based approach has been developed to optimize restoring moments the task priority kinematics equation can be expressed as 3 x p j p q where vector x p is the priority task vector includes the end effector velocity x e vehicle displacement and rotation velocity vector j p is the jacobian matrix corresponds to x p by taking the derivative of eq 3 with respect to time the kinematic equation in acceleration level can be expressed as 4 x p j p q j p q by using gradient projection method the acceleration level inverse kinematic of eq 1 can be expressed as 5 q j p w x p i j p w j p φ where j p w w 1 j p t j p w 1 j p t φ is a vector of arbitrary value i j p w j p is the null space factor of j p w and w is the weight coefficient matrix x p x p j p q in order to reduce the influence of restoring moment a positive definite scalar potential function is defined as 6 p q g q t w u g q g q is the restoring moment w u is a positive defining weight matrix the negative gradient of the function p q is the reduction direction of the restoring torque in the system the gradient is expressed as 7 p q p q q g q t w u g q q by taking the gradient p q as arbitrary vector 8 φ κ p q t where κ is gain coefficient due to the existence of numerical floating the acceleration variable x p should be written as the close loop form 9 x x p k v x d e s x p where x d e s is the desired value of task velocity and k v is a constant therefore the acceleration level task priority redundancy resolution approach for restoring moments optimization is represented in the following form 10 q j p w x i j p w j p κ p q t 4 simulation and experiments 4 1 simulations on task priority redundancy resolution motion planning approach two numerical cases are carried out to verify the validity of the motion planning approach in this section the first one uses inertia weight resolution on velocity level whose weight matrix w is chosen as inertia matrix m the second example uses the restoring moment optimized resolution on the acceleration level in contrast to the former case the effectiveness of the approach can be verified the moving trail of velocity level inertia weight approach is shown in fig 13 g the advantage of this approach is that the minimum instantaneous kinetic energy is guaranteed during the travel by using inertia matrix m because the vehicle mass is much greater than manipulator s range of movement of vehicle is strongly restricted we can find that the desired trajectory is almost completed by the movement of manipulator and the acceleration of the vehicle is almost 0 in the first 4 s then the desired trajectory surpasses the range of motion of the manipulator gradually the vehicle must take its own displacement to ensure the end effector to reach its desired position as we see in fig 13 a and fig 13 d it is worth noting that in fig 13 b and fig 13 d the rotation velocity and acceleration are maintained at a very small value meanwhile as shown in fig 13 g we can visually find that pitch angle and roll angle of the vehicle remain stable the effectiveness of the task priority approach is verified in this case however there are obvious sudden changes in the vehicle and manipulator s acceleration which is very unfavourable for the control system this problem can be solved by solving the redundancy in the acceleration level in case of restoring moment optimized approach its simulation results are shown in fig 14 seen from fig 14 g and fig 14 g intuitively in case of restoring moment optimized approach the vehicle movement is significantly decreased as well as in the range of motion of the manipulator s movement it can be seen that restoring moments on the joints vehicle yaw angle and vehicle pitch angle reflect the same trend and there is no significant difference in the numerical value it is worth noting that the maximum amplitude of the pitch angle in the case of acceleration level task priority redundancy resolution approach moments on the vehicle roll angle decreases constantly and finally tends to 0 obviously the results obtained by the proposed approach reduced the effect of restoring moments in the comparison with fig 14 a with fig 14 a the amplitude of the motion is further reduced this is because that the reduction of the restoring moments decreases the work which is used to overcome the restoring moments so that it can accomplish the scheduled task while lower velocity is reached 4 2 experiments on target capture methods on the basis of the mechanical design of an absorptive type underwater robot see the left of fig 10 the target autonomous absorptive experiment has been made in zhangzidao island in china at first the robot searched the sea organism target during searching process the visual detection process was undergoing then the shell fish target has been recognized through the method of region based fully convolutional networks afterward the target is locked and the location of the target would be located in the camera relative to the pipe the autonomous control method would coordinate with target following process in the pictures of fig 15 through the feedback information of the target relative position and angle to the pipe the robot would autonomously control the motion in order that the pipe could close and cover the target when the target was covered by the pipe the robot will absorb the shell fish through the absorptive pipe see fig 15 in fig 16 the target grasp experiment was made in a tank of 50 m in length 30 m in width and 10 m in depth the robot mechanics can be seen in fig 10 it is an open frame underwater vehicle with a three dofs manipulator each joint with its own angular feedback is correspondent to one dof similar with absorption process at first the robot would at first search and detect the sea organism target at the time the target was recognized the robot will measure the distance between target and the robot through binocular vision and plan the manipulation trajectory in the target coordinate during the manipulation process the robot at first recognized the shellfish target at the height of 0 7 m and then the trajectory velocity and acceleration are continuously planed on the basis of distance feedback and vehicle positions with the method of 3 3 until the uvms could dive down and captured the target see fig 16 5 discussions and conclusion remarks offshore organism robotic capture requires robots to realize gentle and agile grasp through autonomous environmental perception vehicle manipulator coordinated control and uninjured grasp although researchers have developed some effective methodologies on these areas difficulties and challenges still remain at first limited visual range of the offshore causes target unseen in the long range obscure in the medium range with complicated background low contrast and geometric deformation of the image secondly during target capturing process the vehicles will confront with the disturbance from oceanic current coupling forces and restoring forces from manipulators not only the trajectory plan for uvms coordinated motion is necessary but the anti disturbance and precise control are important for the vehicle thirdly this article has made analysis and comparison between robotic autonomous absorption capture and grasp capture in the visual searching and detection process these two methods share the same procedure for the capture motion and control the absorption capture process is simpler while the grasp capture process is more complicated but does less harm to the seabed if great quantities will be applied in the future on the basis of literature comparison and analysis this article has proposed the control architecture for the remotely autonomous robot with organism absorb or grasp functions the proposed acceleration level task priority redundancy resolution approach can optimize restoring moments and generate grasp trajectory for motion planning the model based adaptive control approach can coordinate the motions between vehicle and manipulator for target capture experiments of the organism autonomous grasp and absorption have both been proposed it will further improve the robot autonomy and the efficiency for organism capture declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

process have both been purposed keywords underwater vehicle environmental autonomous perception underwater vehicle manipulator system target capture 1 introduction the worldwide demands for high protein seafood marine drugs healthy products such as seashell and sea cucumber are growing rapidly according to the statistics form pacific sea urchin and cucumber harvest association chinese annual imports of high protein seafood currently amount to tens of billions dollars and are increasing by 10 annually geoff krause 2014 in comparisons excessive artificial breeding could bring about serious impacts on the environment but natural produced organism is superior currently offshore natural organisms such as sea cucumber seashell urchin etc are mostly captured by divers however diver fishing is not only limited by duration time in relative deep water only a few hours of duration at the 20 m depth but suffers from hypothermia disease and life hazards robotic capturing on the contrary will not only reduce the fishing cost but also improve the operation safety some remotely operated vehicles rovs have been developed for example the submarine harvesting rov of norway see fig 1 which could capture large number of sea urchin through pilot controlled underwater vacuum absorption sten ivar siikavuopio 2010 but the vacuum absorption could cause submarine vegetation environmental damage and

visual matching and template based tracking m prats et al 2012 see fig 7 huang and sheng et al reduced the calibration error by adjusting the placement and posture of the calibration board improved the characteristic describing points of the images by using daisy operator for the sift scale invariant feature transform algorithm consequently increased the servo grasp successful rate huang et al 2016 dario lodi rizzini et al established an integrated stereo vision system for pipe manipulation tasks dario lodi rizzini et al 2017 through calibration contour and colour information based detection pose estimation pipe grasp was realized in the water pool however underwater target localization and recognition strategies are sometimes not very effective due to the dim environment laser marker a peñalver et al 2015 and light illumination are recommended to be used for target detection and pose estimation p j sanz et al 2013 for the successful grasp francisco bonin font et al 2015a b 2 3 underwater vehicle manipulator system modelling and coordinated control literature since the oceanic organism capturing robot will be applied by fisherman its size and cost should be designed for the fishing boat the disturbances of manipulator on the vehicle during coordinating motion are composed of restoring moments and coupling forces the changes of buoyancy and gravity centre during manipulation process lead to restoring moments giacomo marani et al 2010 while the coupling forces are caused by the coupling motions between vehicle and manipulator the modelling and coupling control of underwater vehicle manipulator system uvms are important for precise manipulation the methodologies for coordination control include performance index based optimization ismail z h et al 2009 model based observation and control santhakumar m 2011 task priority control et al gianluca antonelli et al 2003 jonghui han and wan kyun chung et al 2011 established an inertial coordinated system on the basis of uvms modelling a performance index was proposed to selectively optimize the restoring forces so that the control input can compensate the restoring forces and moments jonghui han et al 2014 huang and tang et al systematically analysed dynamic modelling of the uvms on the basis of newton euler dynamics an s surface based adaptive control was proposed for the coordinated control hai huang et al 2017 kyushu institute of technology made robust control for uvms coordination on the basis of dynamic model shinichi sagara et al 2010 based on task priority framework enrico simetti et al applied redundancy dof to reduce restoring moments during the manipulation of girona 500 enrico simetti et al 2014 they further applied task priority in the free floating manipulation control by taking higher precision as higher priority criterion lower priority for camera occlusion centring distance and height task to guarantee manipulation in sight ninad manerikar et al 2015 moreover coordination control and manipulation method of dual arm underwater vehicle manipulator system dauvms has been considered in the simulations hamed farivarnejad et al 2014 in compare with uvms dauvms is a more redundant system and expected to maintain body stability realize cooperative manipulation and regulate task priorities for underwater operations e simetti and casalino 2015 task priority in references has involved trajectory plan in the coordinated control in fact the coordinated motion trajectories of vehicle and manipulator should be optimized so that the uvms can preserve enough control forces against the current disturbance in the field operations 2 4 robotic hand for uninjured grasp the robotic uninjured grasp has attracted great attentions world widely due to great prospective of surgical operation and underwater rescue traditionally gentle grasp is realized through feedback control of mems based multi dimensional force sensor on the tip of rigid finger such hands include nasa hand diftler m a et al 2003 gifu hand dlr hand thomas wimböck et al 2007 hit dlr hand h liu a et al 2007 from these researches multi dimensional force sensors based multi dof underwater hand have been developed such as the three finger hand and multi dimensional force sensor of girona 500 g palli et al 2015 see fig 8 a 3 fingers 9 dof dexterous hand with sealed tip force sensor of harbin engineering university wang 2006 a 3 fingers 6 dof dexterous hand with sealed tip force sensor by liang and zhang et al 2010 however the sealed structure for multi dimensional force sensors is complicated the working depth and sensor accuracy are in conflict in the consideration with hand weight and decoupled accuracy ronghuai qi et al 2014 the maximum working depth is usually about less than 100 m depth in the last decade soft and continuum robot has attracted great attentions of researchers yap et al 2015 air muscles have been applied for gentle grasp due to its low weight and inherently compliant behaviour such as shadow hand robert bogue et al 2012 zjut hand wang et al 2014 on the basis of air muscle concept the amadeus underwater hand was designed with three parallel arranged bellows the hand bend and extension are realized through pressure change in each bellow david m lane et al 1999 however air muscles still have some disadvantages such as slow response speed expensive to model etc g chena et al 2008 nicholas farrow and correll 2015 and mohammadreza memarian et al 2015 have made researches on soft pneumatic continuum fingers by using elastic polymer as soft finger material its bending and extension are realized by inflating into the air chamber thus it can grasp quickly the model of the finger can be fabricated through 3d printers at low cost soft pneumatic continuum fingers may possess more prospective for uninjured submarine organism grasp at low cost but their actuation requires the number of air pipes correspondence with the number of dofs which not only greatly effects both manipulation motions and working depth 3 autonomous capture process analysis for underwater robot 3 1 mechanics design and electronic control system in order to realize autonomous robotic capture two major methods have been applied including robotic absorption capture and robotic grasp capture the robotic formality is often designed with open framed structure see fig 9 in order to install sensors sea organism container pump or manipulator the robot is usually less than 1 m 0 8 m 0 8 m at overall dimensions and weight less than 100 kg to adapt for fishing boat deployment and recovery the depth rating is usually less than 100 m for offshore capture the robot is usually equipped with flotation foam at upper layer 2 vertical thrusters and 4 horizontal thrusters the sensors including a depth meter altimeter magnetic compass and cameras the electronic control architecture in the robot capsule including a surface computer and embedded pc104 see fig 10 the former is responsible with environmental perception while the latter is responsible with the planning and control of capture motions the power of the robot is supplied by a dc source through an umbilical cable located between the surface and the robot the robot could be equipped with a magnetic compass and doppler velocity log dvl speed sensor for position estimation moreover dvl can provide height information which can provide necessary information for target capture although the autonomous capture process is different between absorption and grasp types the environmental perception guidance process from underwater sonar and cameras is similar 3 2 target recognition and capture architecture in the consideration with the limited submarine visual range the environmental and organism target perception can be realized through different detective methodology or instruments corresponding to long medium and short range perception see fig 11 in other words mechanical scan sonar can be employed to discover the rock environment of sea cucumber inhabitant in the 5 20 m long rang cameras can be applied to further ascertain organism inhabitant from the obscure images in the 2 5 m middle range precision recognition and distant measurement can be realized through cameras at 1 2 m short range illumination and laser marker are recommended for the visual tracking and servo in order to realize organism recognition region based fully convolutional networks r fcn has been applied to detect the organism huang et al 2019 the offshore aquatic recognition samples are provided from zhangzidao group corporation and da lian institute of technology k2 c 1 layers position sensitive score maps are generated by the feature maps through convolutional computation in order to classify regional of interests rois through rois pooling k2 position sensitive score generation r fcn training the recognition can be realized after target recognition and localization the autonomous absorption process in fig 12 can be realized through the following control with the target position and angle in the camera relative to the pipe on the other hand target grasp process will be more complicated because it should include motion planning manipulation control to realize the vehicle and multiple dofs manipulator coordination 3 3 task priority redundancy resolution approach for grasp capture motion planning during the manipulation process restoring forces are important interaction forces resulted from the change of gravity centre and buoyancy centre according to the ref hai huang et al 2017 restoring forces can be expressed as 1 g q f v g v f v b v i 1 n f v g i f v b i r v g v f v g v r v b v f 0 b v i 1 n r v g i f v g i r v b i f v b i where f v g i r n v t f n g i and f v b i r n v t f n b i represents the restoring force of the ith link relative to underwater vehicle 2 f n g v 0 0 m v g t f n b v 0 0 b v t f v g v r n v t f n g v f v b v r n v t f n b v denotes the restoring force of underwater vehicle r v g v and r v b v are the underwater vehicle cb and cg positions vectors relative to underwater vehicle geometric centre respectively r v g i and r v b i are the ith link cb and cg positions vectors relative to the underwater vehicle geometric centre respectively for the redundancy dof system of uvms the redundancy resolution method can determine the uvms s position velocity and acceleration during the task uvms trajectory planning is one of the most important difference between absorption capture and grasp capture the redundancy resolution method is an important part of trajectory planning widely used redundancy resolution methods such as least squares solution method chan t et al 1993 gradient projection method gpm shen y et al 2005 task priority method can not fully satisfy the actual needs of uvms s path planning thus a task priority redundancy resolution antonelli g et al 1998 on acceleration level which is capable of smoothing velocities and optimizing restoring moments is proposed in this section in order to realize continuance and stable organism capture motion the task priority based approach has been developed to optimize restoring moments the task priority kinematics equation can be expressed as 3 x p j p q where vector x p is the priority task vector includes the end effector velocity x e vehicle displacement and rotation velocity vector j p is the jacobian matrix corresponds to x p by taking the derivative of eq 3 with respect to time the kinematic equation in acceleration level can be expressed as 4 x p j p q j p q by using gradient projection method the acceleration level inverse kinematic of eq 1 can be expressed as 5 q j p w x p i j p w j p φ where j p w w 1 j p t j p w 1 j p t φ is a vector of arbitrary value i j p w j p is the null space factor of j p w and w is the weight coefficient matrix x p x p j p q in order to reduce the influence of restoring moment a positive definite scalar potential function is defined as 6 p q g q t w u g q g q is the restoring moment w u is a positive defining weight matrix the negative gradient of the function p q is the reduction direction of the restoring torque in the system the gradient is expressed as 7 p q p q q g q t w u g q q by taking the gradient p q as arbitrary vector 8 φ κ p q t where κ is gain coefficient due to the existence of numerical floating the acceleration variable x p should be written as the close loop form 9 x x p k v x d e s x p where x d e s is the desired value of task velocity and k v is a constant therefore the acceleration level task priority redundancy resolution approach for restoring moments optimization is represented in the following form 10 q j p w x i j p w j p κ p q t 4 simulation and experiments 4 1 simulations on task priority redundancy resolution motion planning approach two numerical cases are carried out to verify the validity of the motion planning approach in this section the first one uses inertia weight resolution on velocity level whose weight matrix w is chosen as inertia matrix m the second example uses the restoring moment optimized resolution on the acceleration level in contrast to the former case the effectiveness of the approach can be verified the moving trail of velocity level inertia weight approach is shown in fig 13 g the advantage of this approach is that the minimum instantaneous kinetic energy is guaranteed during the travel by using inertia matrix m because the vehicle mass is much greater than manipulator s range of movement of vehicle is strongly restricted we can find that the desired trajectory is almost completed by the movement of manipulator and the acceleration of the vehicle is almost 0 in the first 4 s then the desired trajectory surpasses the range of motion of the manipulator gradually the vehicle must take its own displacement to ensure the end effector to reach its desired position as we see in fig 13 a and fig 13 d it is worth noting that in fig 13 b and fig 13 d the rotation velocity and acceleration are maintained at a very small value meanwhile as shown in fig 13 g we can visually find that pitch angle and roll angle of the vehicle remain stable the effectiveness of the task priority approach is verified in this case however there are obvious sudden changes in the vehicle and manipulator s acceleration which is very unfavourable for the control system this problem can be solved by solving the redundancy in the acceleration level in case of restoring moment optimized approach its simulation results are shown in fig 14 seen from fig 14 g and fig 14 g intuitively in case of restoring moment optimized approach the vehicle movement is significantly decreased as well as in the range of motion of the manipulator s movement it can be seen that restoring moments on the joints vehicle yaw angle and vehicle pitch angle reflect the same trend and there is no significant difference in the numerical value it is worth noting that the maximum amplitude of the pitch angle in the case of acceleration level task priority redundancy resolution approach moments on the vehicle roll angle decreases constantly and finally tends to 0 obviously the results obtained by the proposed approach reduced the effect of restoring moments in the comparison with fig 14 a with fig 14 a the amplitude of the motion is further reduced this is because that the reduction of the restoring moments decreases the work which is used to overcome the restoring moments so that it can accomplish the scheduled task while lower velocity is reached 4 2 experiments on target capture methods on the basis of the mechanical design of an absorptive type underwater robot see the left of fig 10 the target autonomous absorptive experiment has been made in zhangzidao island in china at first the robot searched the sea organism target during searching process the visual detection process was undergoing then the shell fish target has been recognized through the method of region based fully convolutional networks afterward the target is locked and the location of the target would be located in the camera relative to the pipe the autonomous control method would coordinate with target following process in the pictures of fig 15 through the feedback information of the target relative position and angle to the pipe the robot would autonomously control the motion in order that the pipe could close and cover the target when the target was covered by the pipe the robot will absorb the shell fish through the absorptive pipe see fig 15 in fig 16 the target grasp experiment was made in a tank of 50 m in length 30 m in width and 10 m in depth the robot mechanics can be seen in fig 10 it is an open frame underwater vehicle with a three dofs manipulator each joint with its own angular feedback is correspondent to one dof similar with absorption process at first the robot would at first search and detect the sea organism target at the time the target was recognized the robot will measure the distance between target and the robot through binocular vision and plan the manipulation trajectory in the target coordinate during the manipulation process the robot at first recognized the shellfish target at the height of 0 7 m and then the trajectory velocity and acceleration are continuously planed on the basis of distance feedback and vehicle positions with the method of 3 3 until the uvms could dive down and captured the target see fig 16 5 discussions and conclusion remarks offshore organism robotic capture requires robots to realize gentle and agile grasp through autonomous environmental perception vehicle manipulator coordinated control and uninjured grasp although researchers have developed some effective methodologies on these areas difficulties and challenges still remain at first limited visual range of the offshore causes target unseen in the long range obscure in the medium range with complicated background low contrast and geometric deformation of the image secondly during target capturing process the vehicles will confront with the disturbance from oceanic current coupling forces and restoring forces from manipulators not only the trajectory plan for uvms coordinated motion is necessary but the anti disturbance and precise control are important for the vehicle thirdly this article has made analysis and comparison between robotic autonomous absorption capture and grasp capture in the visual searching and detection process these two methods share the same procedure for the capture motion and control the absorption capture process is simpler while the grasp capture process is more complicated but does less harm to the seabed if great quantities will be applied in the future on the basis of literature comparison and analysis this article has proposed the control architecture for the remotely autonomous robot with organism absorb or grasp functions the proposed acceleration level task priority redundancy resolution approach can optimize restoring moments and generate grasp trajectory for motion planning the model based adaptive control approach can coordinate the motions between vehicle and manipulator for target capture experiments of the organism autonomous grasp and absorption have both been proposed it will further improve the robot autonomy and the efficiency for organism capture declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
