10515,it is still a long term challenge to improve crop production and economic benefits in arid area of northwest china the objective of this study was therefore to propose a new and promising cotton mung bean intercropping cmbi system to cope with the challenge based on the traditional monocropping cotton mc system a two year field experiment was conducted to evaluate crop production and economic benefits between the cmbi and mc systems by analyzing the total land output tlo aboveground dry matter nitrogen uptake water use efficiency wue nitrogen use efficiency nue partial factor productivity pfp of nitrogen and economic benefits experiment treatments consisted of two cropping systems mc and cmbi systems and a combination of the cmbi system with different n fertilizer rates 160 n160 315

results indicated that no significant differences in growth parameters ph plant height sd stem diameter and lai leaf area index of cotton were found between the mc and cmbi systems in 2016 and 2017 compared with the mc system however the cmbi system significantly increased tlo aboveground dry matter total n uptake wue nue pfp for nitrogen and economic benefits in 2016 and 2017 the result suggested the cmbi system had greater production advantages and economic benefits than the mc system in addition compared to the n160 treatment other n treatments n315 n390 and n475 in the cmbi system significantly enhanced crop growth tlo total aboveground dry matter total n uptake wue and economic benefits however pfp for nitrogen and nue significantly decreased with the increase of application n rates according to analyzing the production functions of different application n treatments we found that 390 kg ha 1 in the cmbi system might be recommended as an appropriate application n rate to improve crop production and economic benefits in the arid area of northwest china keywords cotton mung bean intercropping water use efficiency nitrogen uptake efficiency economic benefits crop growth 1 introduction today global population is continuously increasing and research reports that the population will exceed 9 billion in 2050 gerland et al 2014 which will result in severe food security problem under the pressure of population increase how to ensure food security will be an imperative problem especially in china with a population of 1 4 billion gu et al 2019 reported that developing dryland agriculture was a promising direction to improve crop production in the future of china xinjiang was one of the main representative areas of dryland agricultural production in china in recent years film mulching drip irrigation technology combining the advantages of film mulching and drip irrigation has become unique mechanized agricultural measure for developing dryland agriculture in xinjiang dai and dong 2014 ning et al 2015 the film mulching drip irrigation technology included film mulching strips with 110 cm width and bare soil strips with 30 cm width tan et al 2017 liang et al 2019 however only single crop such as cotton gossypium hirsutum l was planted in the film mulching strips li et al 2016 tan et al 2017 chen et al 2018 no crops were planted in the bare soil strips fig 3a therefore it could be very difficult to improve the potential of crop production due to the single cotton cropping pattern and low resources use efficiency intercropping was an efficient agronomic measure of simultaneously cultivating two or more crop species in the same area of field which could efficiently utilize light water nutrient heat land and other natural resources andrews and kassam 1976 some researches indicated that intercropping could improve crop yields utilization of resources and land utilization efficiency sainju et al 2010 lithourgidis et al 2011 fan et al 2012 hu et al 2016 recently intercropping pattern has attracted extensive attention from many researchers for example cotton wheat and cotton peanut intercropping could significantly improve crop yield and economic returns shah et al 2016 chi et al 2019 compared to monocropping cotton moreover other researches also indicated that the potato bean intercropping zhang et al 2016 maize cowpea intercropping millet soybean intercropping mustard pea intercropping wheat pea intercropping and ginger soybean intercropping chapagain et al 2018 also achieved higher productivity and economic returns than the monocropping system an effective intercrop combination was one that provided higher total yield and utilized resources more efficiently than the monocropping system inal et al 2007 in order to select an effective intercrop combination we should take interspecific interactions between main crops and intercropping crops into account in intercropping system interspecific interactions including competition and facilitation played a very important role in enhancing resources use efficiency hu et al 2016 interspecific competition enhanced the yield of the main crops but restricted the growth of the intercropping crops during the co growth period xiao et al 2004 li et al 2011 gitari et al 2017 fortunately interspecific facilitation could promote the growth of both companion crops in the intercropping system hu et al 2016 zhang and li 2003 research indicated that legumes could facilitate growth of non legume crops though nutrient sharing li et al 1999 this was due to legumes could not only fix atmospheric n for their own utilization hauggaard nielsen et al 2009 sitienei et al 2017 but also the fixed n by legumes could be used as a source of nitrogen for other crops hu et al 2017 hauggaard nielsen et al 2001 nitrogen was an essential nutrient to promote crop growth and increase crop yield dong et al 2012 chen et al 2016 especially in intercropping system a large amount of nitrogen might be applied by the farmers in the field to achieve high crop yield which would result in negative environmental impacts however intercropping system with legumes could reduce the need for inorganic nitrogen fertilizer inputs while enhancing crop yield compared with monocropping systems dhima et al 2007 li et al 2009 liu et al 2018 thus non legume cash crops legumes intercropping might be an effective intercrop combination for improving crop production and nutrient uptake and use efficiency hauggaard nielsen et al 2009 sitienei et al 2017 recently with the adjustment of china s agricultural structure more and more minor grain crops have received more and more attention such as mung bean vigna radiata l gong et al 2020 mung bean could be traditionally severed as a functional food crop species which provided additional benefits through its symbiosis with n fixing bacteria yao et al 2019 therefore we tried to propose a new cotton mung bean intercropping system cmbi based on the monocropping cotton mc system to improve crop production and economic benefits in the arid area of northwest china however to the best of our knowledge little field experimental studies explored effects of the cmbi system on agriculture production and economic benefits in the arid area of northwest china therefore we hypothesized that adopting the new cmbi system could improve tlo wue total n uptake nue and economic benefits crop yields and economic benefits in the cmbi system should be paid particular attention to convince farmers to accept the intercropping mode additionally tlo aboveground dry matter nitrogen uptake water use efficiency wue nitrogen uptake efficiency nue and economic benefits should be quantified to evaluate yield increasing effect of intercropping mung bean in bare soil strip the main objectives of this study were therefore to 1 quantify tlo aboveground dry matter nitrogen uptake wue nue and economic benefits in the cmbi and monocropping cotton mc systems and further evaluating yield advantages and economic benefits in the cmbi system 2 analyze the influences of different application nitrogen rates on tlo total aboveground dry matter total n uptake pfp for nitrogen wue nue and economic benefits in the cmbi system and thus further determining the optimal amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied in the cmbi system 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experimental site in 2016 and 2017 field experiment was conducted at the bazhou irrigation experiment station 41 36 n 86 12 e 901 m a s l in korla city xinjiang province northwest china fig 1 the experimental site had a continental desert climate strong evaporation approximately 2788 mm sufficient sunshine about 3036 h tan et al 2017 liang et al 2019 moreover the precipitation was mainly concentrated between march and october in 2016 and 2017 the precipitation was 145 mm in 2016 and 87 2 mm in 2017 fig 2 respectively daily average temperature was 22 4 and 22 in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons between april and october in 2016 and 2017 fig 2 respectively the physical and chemical properties of soil in the experimental site were showed in table 1 2 2 experimental design and cropping system in the experimental sites the local cropping system was mainly based on monocropping cotton mc system combining with film mulching drip irrigation technology fig 3a experiment treatments consisted of two cropping systems monocropping cotton mc and cotton mung bean intercropping cmbi and a combination of the cmbi system with different n fertilizer rates 160 n160 315 n315 390 n390 and 475 n475 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 160 n160 315 n315 and 390 n390 kg ha 1 in 2017 respectively all treatments were designed using a randomized complete block with three replications the mc and cmbi systems had same irrigation and fertilization schedule where application nitrogen amount was 315 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 this was due to application nitrogen amount of 315 kg ha 1 was determined by the experience of local farmers the mc system includes bare soil strip and film mulching strip the former was considered as an idle zone and the latter was used for arranging drip lines and planting cotton two drip lines beneath each plastic mulch and each plastic mulch contains four rows of cotton plants fig 3a the film mulching strip in the mc system was used to plant four rows of cotton plants and cotton plants along each row were spaced 10 cm apart the narrow row and wide row were defined on the basis of cotton location chen et al 2018 the width of plastic mulch bare soil strip wide row and narrow row was 110 30 40 and 20 cm respectively tan et al 2017 the difference between the cmbi and the mc system was that bare soil strip was used for intercropping mung beans and arranging a drip line fig 3b in cmbi system therefore a row mung bean was planted at a density of 20 plants m 2 gong et al 2020 in the bare soil strip where arranged a drip line fig 3b and film mulching strip was the same as that of the mc system example picture of the cmbi system in the field was showed in fig 3c cotton and mung bean were sowed at 25 april 2016 and 16 april 2017 respectively the other management practices including plant pruning weed and insect control were carried out through local farmer s experience no basal fertilizer was applied in all plots before sowing the area of each plot was 7 m 7 m each plot was separated by 1 4 m to avoid the impact of the lateral movement of nitrogen fertilizer and soil water fertilizer and irrigation water were applied in each plot through the irrigation and fertilization schedule in the 2016 and 2017 entire cotton growing season table 2 the irrigation schedule was determined by the local farmer s experience the amount of irrigation was the same in all plots the total amount of irrigation was 450 mm in 2016 and 412 5 mm in 2017 respectively 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 plant height ph stem diameter sd and leaf area index lai during seedling stage squaring and flowering stages and bolls stage of 2016 and 2017 three representative cotton plants and three representative mung bean plants were randomly selected from each plot to measure plant height ph stem diameter sd and leaf area leaf area index lai was the total leaf area divided by the occupied land area watson 1947 2 3 2 aboveground dry matter nitrogen uptake seed cotton yield and harvest index hi at harvest stage three representative cotton plants and three representative mung bean plants were collected from each plot and then aboveground part of cotton and mung bean were separated placed into an oven at 75 dried to constant weight aboveground dry matter of cotton and mung bean was determined by gravimetry additionally aboveground dry matter of cotton and mung bean plant were milled through a mill and then screened through a 0 5 mm sieve for analysis of plant nitrogen content nitrogen content of cotton and mung bean plant in aboveground dry matter was determined by the kjeldahl method details of the kjeldahl method could be found elsewhere bremner 1996 seed cotton and mung bean were manually harvested from area of 6 67 m2 for each plot to determine yield of mung bean and cotton respectively the harvest index hi was defined as crop yield divided by aboveground dry matter wang et al 2018 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 total land output tlo in cmbi system total land output tlo jolliffe and wanjau 1999 was used to evaluate intercropping productivity as follows 1 t l o y c y m where tlo is total land output kg ha 1 yc

groundwater recharge mm d is deep seepage mm r is runoff mm the level of groundwater in the experimental site was below 7 5 m moreover rainfall is rare and no un planned irrigation was used during the experiment therefore g d and r was neglected 2 4 4 partial factor productivity pfp partial factor productivity pfp reflected an average productivity which was calculated by crop yield divided by amount of applied fertilizers the pfp for n was calculated as follows li et al 2018 6 p f p n y f n where pfpn is partial factor productivity kg kg 1 fn is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied in

potassium sulphate k2o 52 was 0 33 0 41 and 0 27 kg 1 respectively the input of cotton seed mung bean seed labor cost pesticide plastic film and farm machinery was determined according to the current market prices in 2016 and 2017 exchange rate was 1 6 67 the economic benefits was calculated as follows 7 e c o n o m i c b e n e f i t s t o t a l o u t p u t v a l u e t o t a l i n p u t v a l u e 2 6 statistical analysis all data are showed as the mean value of three replicates spss statistics 17 0 software was used to conduct analysis of variance anova the amount of application nitrogen among different application n treatments was different at each growing stage of 2016 and 2017 therefore the data in 2016 and 2017 were analyzed separately the significant differences between the treatments were carried out through least significant differences lsd at p 0 05 level graphics are created by the microsoft visio 2003 the excel 2016 and arcgis 10 5 3 results 3 1 effects of cmbi and mc systems on aboveground dry matter hi tlo total n uptake wue nue pfp for nitrogen and economic benefits there were no significant differences in growth parameters ph sd and lai of cotton between mc and cmbi systems in 2016 and 2017 table 3 seed cotton yield and hi in the cmbi system were greater than that in the mc system in 2016 and 2017 table 3 the tlo in the cmbi system was 16 6 in 2016 and 19 8 in 2017 significantly p 0 05 higher than that in the mc system respectively table 3 compared with the mc system total n uptake nue wue and pfp for nitrogen in the cmbi system significantly p 0 05 increased by 27 9 45 3 27 9 45 3 17 0 36 3 and 16 5 19 9 in 2016 and 2017 fig 4 respectively furthermore total economic input in the mc system was significantly p 0 05 lower than that the cmbi system table s1 but economic benefits in the cmbi system improved by 31 7 in 2016 and 51 9 in 2017 compared with the mc system respectively table 4 therefore the cmbi system showed greater production advantages and economic benefits than the mc system 3 2 effects of application n rates on crop growth hi tlo n uptake wue nue pfp for nitrogen and economic benefits in the cmbi system in the cmbi system there were significant p 0 05 differences in lai of cotton table 5 and ph and lai of mung bean table 6 among different application nitrogen treatments in the seedling stage of 2016 moreover ph sd and lai of cotton table 5 and mung bean table 6 in other application nitrogen treatments n315 n390 and n475 were significantly p 0 05 higher than those in the n160 treatment at the squaring flowering and bolls stage of 2016 and 2017 significant p 0 05 differences in hi of cotton were only found among different application nitrogen treatments in 2016 but the differences disappeared in 2017 table 7 moreover no significant differences in hi of mung bean were found among different application nitrogen treatments in 2016 and 2017 table 7 compared with the n160 treatment other application nitrogen treatments n315 n390 and n475 significantly p 0 05 enhanced aboveground dry matter of cotton 21 5 57 3 table 7 aboveground dry matter of mung bean 46 0 71 8 table 7 tlo 28 8 79 6

addition although the n160 treatment could significantly p 0 05 decrease total economic input table s2 in the cmbi system the highest economic benefits were obtained with the n390 in 2016 and n315 in 2017 respectively table 8 the economic benefits in the n390 treatment of 2016 and n315 treatment of 2017 were 232 2 and 117 4 higher than that of the n160 respectively table 8 4 discussions 4 1 a promising agronomic strategy cotton mung bean intercropping cmbi system greater land productivity and higher yield were possible when non legume cash crops were intercropped with legumes betencourt et al 2012 latati et al 2014 chapagain and riseman 2014 2015 jahanzad et al 2015 chapagain et al 2018 in the present study we tried to propose a new cmbi system based on the traditional mc system in the arid regions of northwest china we hypothesized that the new cmbi system had greater potential ability to improve crop production wue total n uptake nue and economic benefits than the mc system our data presented in tables 3 4 and figs 4 5 supported these hypotheses for example the cmbi system significantly p 0 05 increased tlo by 16 6 19 8 nue by 27 9 45 3 wue by 17 0 36 3 pfp for nitrogen by 16 5 19 9 and economic benefits by 31 7 51 9 compared with the mc system in 2016 and 2017 tables 3 4 and fig 4 gong et al 2020 also demonstrated higher wue and crop yield when proso millet panicum miliaceum l and mung bean were intercropped in the arid regions of northwest china qian et al 2018 also demonstrated higher economic returns when oat avena sativa l and mung bean were intercropped in the semi arid regions of northeast china similarly studies from other regions have shown that intercropping system with legumes had higher crop yields and economic benefits than monocropping system for example jahanzad et al 2015 showed that higher crop yield was obtained in the millet soybean intercropping system chapagain and riseman 2014 and 2015 also reported that higher tlo 4 4 t ha 1 and 5 9 t ha 1 could be achieved when wheat and barley were intercropped with beans and peas respectively moreover chapagain et al 2018 also reported that higher tlo 21 8 t ha 1 was achieved in year round intercrop system i e ginger maize soybean in the present study it was noteworthy that there was plant population per square meter in the cmbi system was higher than the mc system this was due to mung bean was sowed in the bare soil strip in the cmbi system which could contribute to the greater tlo per square meter in the cmbi plots than the mc system moreover economic benefits in the cmbi system significantly increased by 31 7 in 2016 and 51 9 in 2017 compared with the mc system respectively table 4 these findings clearly demonstrated that the cmbi system efficiently showed greater yield advantages i e tlo and potential economic benefits than the traditional mc system this result implied that the new cmbi system might be a promising agronomic strategy for improving crop production and farmers economic benefits in the arid region of northwest of china in the intercropping system facilitation was an important process that one crop promoted the growth of another crop hu et al 2016 zhang and li 2003 in our study seed cotton yield in the cmbi system increased by 6 2 7 2 compared with the mc system this result implied that intercropping mung bean could promote the increase of seed cotton yield in the cmbi system in 2016 and 2017 same fertilizer and irrigation amount were applied in the cmbi and mc systems however the tlo total n uptake nue and wue were greater in the cmbi system than those in the mc system table 3 and fig 4 this result implied that the cmbi system showed higher yield advantages and resources use efficiency than the mc system this was attributed to interspecific interactions between companion crops which played a very important role in enhancing resources use efficiency of intercropping system hu et al 2016 especially root interactions in the intercropping system with legumes occurred more often in the adjacent row between main crops and legume crops gregory and reddy 1982 this was due to roots of legume crops could not only absorb nutrients and water but also synthesize and transform some substances to the other crop tissues landhäusser et al 2006 for example in the non legume cash crops legumes intercropping system non legume cash crops mainly relied on competition of their roots to acquire soil inorganic n jensen 1996 corre hellou and crozat 2005 however legumes could not only had the ability of n2 fixation for their own utilization hauggaard nielsen et al 2009 sitienei et al 2017 but also the fixed nitrogen by legumes could also be assimilated by non legume cash crops through their root expansion hauggaard nielsen et al 2001 in addition some studies also showed that the roots of legumes could produce exudates that had the ability to solubilize p through competing with phosphate ions for exchange sites and thus further promoting the absorption of p by non legume crops in the intercropping system with legumes hinsinger et al 2011 wang et al 2015 giles et al 2017 therefore exploring the relationships between root growth and soil water and nutrients were fundamentally needed in revealing underlying mechanisms of improving water fertilizer utilization efficiency in the intercropping system however the relationships in the cmbi system were not addressed in this study in further researches therefore we should mainly focus on the following several aspects 1 monitoring the vertical and horizontal distributions of crop roots in the mc and cmbi systems during the different crop growing stages 2 analyzing competition between cotton and mung bean for soil water and nutrients n and p and 3 quantifying relationships between root distribution and wue and nue in the cmbi system 4 2 effects of nitrogen fertilizer on the cmbi system and optimization of nitrogen application rate in this study application n rates n315 n390 and n475 treatments significantly improved crop growth tlo n uptake and wue in the cmbi system compared with the n160 treatment tables 5 7 this was due to adequate nitrogen fertilizer could accelerate crop growth expand leaf area and increase aboveground dry matter accumulation and crop yield rossini et al 2011 in this study however the highest tlo cotton n uptake mung bean n uptake and wue were obtained with n390 in 2016 and with n315 in 2017 respectively this may be attributed to the following two possibilities on the one hand this might be attributed to the different sowing time this was due to the sowing data in 2017 was 9 days earlier than that in 2016 table 2 khan et al 2017a 2017b demonstrated sowing time could significantly influenced crop yield and nutrient uptake on the other hand another possible explanation might be related to different meteorological factors such as precipitation during the growing season of 2016 and 2017 for example precipitation of 135 8 mm in the growing stage of 2016 was significantly higher than 57 1 mm in the growing stage of 2017 fig 2 qian et al 2018 also reported unstable precipitation during the growing stage threatened yield stability in the consecutive years in semi arid regions in addition in this study different application nitrogen rates only had a significant effect on the hi of cotton in 2016 but had no significant effects on the hi of cotton in 2017 and hi of mung bean in 2016 and 2017 zhang et al 2012 reported that different application nitrogen rates had a significant effect on hi of cotton however wang et al 2018 reported that there was no significant effect of different application nitrogen rates on hi of cotton these results might be attributed to vegetative growth status of cotton among different application nitrogen rates during the boll setting stage as previously reported dong et al 2010 in intercropping system high application nitrogen rates could result in counterproductive influence on crop yield due to excessive nitrogen fertilizer could hinder crop growth and increase of yields kirda et al 2005 rathke et al 2006 hu et al 2013 the present study also showed similar results that tlo seed cotton yield and economic benefits in the n475 treatment were significantly lower than those in the n390 treatment table 7 which implied that application n rate of 475 kg ha 1 might be overused in the cmbi system this result indicated that appropriate application n rate might play an important role in improving tlo aboveground dry matter nitrogen uptake wue and nue in the cmbi system the optimal application nitrogen rate should be usually proposed to take these components into account therefore the relationships between different application n rates and tlo total aboveground dry matter total n uptake and wue were fitted by quadratic functions respectively fig 6 a d the determinate coefficients of the four quadratic functions were 0 63 0 77 0 77 and 0 73 for tlo total aboveground dry matter total n uptake and wue fig 6a d respectively moreover the relationships between application n rates and nue and pfp for nitrogen were fitted by the linear equations fig 6e f the determinate coefficients of the two linear equations were 0 94 and 0 80 for nue and pfp for nitrogen fig 6e f respectively according to analyzing the four quadratic functions we found that the highest tlo fig 6a highest total aboveground dry matter fig 6b highest total n uptake fig 6c and highest wue fig 6d were obtained at application n rates of 475 447 411 and 390 kg ha 1 respectively however according to analyzing the two linear equations we found that application n rates of 475 447 and 411 kg ha 1 could significantly decrease nue fig 6e and pfp for nitrogen fig 6f compared with the application n rates of 390 kg ha 1 this was due to nue fig 6e and pfp for nitrogen fig 6f significantly decreased with the increasing of application n rates therefore this result implied that application n rate of 390 kg ha 1 might be likely to be an appropriate nitrogen fertilizer application rate in the cmbi system this may be attributed to the following two reasons on the one hand legumes such as mung bean mainly relied on symbiotic n2 fixation in the non legume cash crop legume intercropping system crozat et al 1994 but high rate of application nitrogen could inhibit the ability of n2 fixation for legumes hu et al 2016 and thus further resulting in low nue and pfp for nitrogen chen et al 2014 on the other hand the application n rate of 390 kg ha 1 achieved the highest wue and higher nue compared with the other application n rates 475 447 and 411 kg ha 1 the high wue and nue played an important role in agriculture production in arid areas of northwest china however the highest tlo and total aboveground dry matter were not obtained in the application n rate of 390 kg ha 1 therefore more years of experiments should be carried out to determine the optimal nitrogen fertilizer application amount in the further study 5 conclusions in conclusion the new cmbi system was a promising agronomic strategy to improve crop production and economic benefits in xinjiang of china compared to the traditional mc system the cmbi system resulted in higher tlo 16 6 19 8 total n uptake 27 9 45 3 wue 17 0 36 3 and economic benefits 31 7 51 9 respectively compared to the mc system tables 3 4 and fig 4 therefore the cmbi system showed greater production advantages and economic benefits than the mc system in the cmbi system compared to the n160 treatment high application n rates n315 n390 and n475 treatments significantly enhanced crop growth tlo total aboveground dry matter n uptake wue and economic benefits however compared with the n390 treatment the n475 treatment significantly decreased cotton n uptake fig 5a mung bean n uptake fig 5c wue fig 5e tlo table 7 aboveground dry matter and yield of cotton table 7 and economic benefits table 8 in 2016 moreover nue and pfp for nitrogen significantly decreased with the increase of application n rates in the cmbi system therefore tlo total aboveground dry matter total n uptake wue nue and pfp for nitrogen were analyzed through the nitrogen fertilizer production functions fig 6 for different application n treatments during both years we found that 390 kg ha 1 might be recommended as an appropriate application n rates to improve agriculture production and economic benefits in xinjiang however the highest tlo and total aboveground dry matter were not obtained in the application n rate of 390 kg ha 1 therefore more years of experiments should be carried out to determine the optimal nitrogen fertilizer application amount in the further study declaration of competing interest the

10515,it is still a long term challenge to improve crop production and economic benefits in arid area of northwest china the objective of this study was therefore to propose a new and promising cotton

results indicated that no significant differences in growth parameters ph plant height sd stem diameter and lai leaf area index of cotton were found between the mc and cmbi systems in 2016 and 2017

significantly enhanced crop growth tlo total aboveground dry matter total n uptake wue and economic benefits however pfp for nitrogen and nue significantly decreased with the increase of application n rates according to analyzing the production functions of different application n treatments we found that 390 kg ha 1 in the cmbi system might be recommended as an appropriate application n rate to improve crop production and economic benefits in the arid area of northwest china keywords cotton mung bean intercropping water use efficiency nitrogen uptake efficiency economic benefits crop growth 1 introduction today global population is continuously increasing and research reports that the population will exceed 9 billion in 2050 gerland et al 2014 which will result in severe food security problem under the pressure of population increase how to ensure food security will be an imperative problem especially in china with a population of 1 4 billion gu et al 2019 reported that developing dryland agriculture was a promising direction to improve crop production in the future of china xinjiang was one of the main representative areas of dryland agricultural production in china in recent years film mulching drip irrigation technology combining the advantages of film mulching and drip irrigation has become unique mechanized agricultural measure for developing dryland agriculture in xinjiang dai and dong 2014 ning et al 2015 the film mulching drip irrigation technology included film mulching strips with 110 cm width and bare soil strips with 30 cm width tan et al 2017 liang et al 2019 however only single crop such as cotton gossypium hirsutum l was planted in the film mulching strips li et al 2016 tan et al 2017 chen et al 2018 no crops were planted in the bare soil strips fig 3a therefore it could be very difficult to improve the potential of crop production due to the single cotton cropping pattern and low resources use efficiency intercropping was an efficient agronomic measure of simultaneously cultivating two or more crop species in the same area of field which could efficiently utilize light water nutrient heat land and other natural resources andrews and kassam 1976 some researches indicated that intercropping could improve crop yields utilization of resources and land utilization efficiency sainju et al 2010 lithourgidis et al 2011 fan et al 2012 hu et al 2016 recently intercropping pattern has attracted extensive attention from many researchers for example cotton wheat and cotton peanut intercropping could significantly improve crop yield and economic returns shah et al 2016 chi et al 2019 compared to monocropping cotton moreover other researches also indicated that the potato bean intercropping zhang et al 2016 maize cowpea intercropping millet soybean intercropping mustard pea intercropping wheat pea intercropping and ginger soybean intercropping chapagain et al 2018 also achieved higher productivity and economic returns than the monocropping system an effective intercrop combination was one that provided higher total yield and utilized resources more efficiently than the monocropping system inal et al 2007 in order to select an effective intercrop combination we should take interspecific interactions between main crops and intercropping crops into account in intercropping system interspecific interactions including competition and facilitation played a very important role in enhancing resources use efficiency hu et al 2016 interspecific competition enhanced the yield of the main crops but restricted the growth of the intercropping crops during the co growth period xiao et al 2004 li et al 2011 gitari et al 2017 fortunately interspecific facilitation could promote the growth of both companion crops in the intercropping system hu et al 2016 zhang and li 2003 research indicated that legumes could facilitate growth of non legume crops though nutrient sharing li et al 1999 this was due to legumes could not only fix atmospheric n for their own utilization hauggaard nielsen et al 2009 sitienei et al 2017 but also the fixed n by legumes could be used as a source of nitrogen for other crops hu et al 2017 hauggaard nielsen et al 2001 nitrogen was an essential nutrient to promote crop growth and increase crop yield dong et al 2012 chen et al 2016 especially in intercropping system a large amount of nitrogen might be applied by the farmers in the field to achieve high crop yield which would result in negative environmental impacts however intercropping system with legumes could reduce the need for inorganic nitrogen fertilizer inputs while enhancing crop yield compared with monocropping systems dhima et al 2007 li et al 2009 liu et al 2018 thus non legume cash crops legumes intercropping might be an effective intercrop combination for improving crop production and nutrient uptake and use efficiency hauggaard nielsen et al 2009 sitienei et al 2017 recently with the adjustment of china s agricultural structure more and more minor grain crops have received more and more attention such as mung bean vigna radiata l gong et al 2020 mung bean could be traditionally severed as a functional food crop species which provided additional benefits through its symbiosis with n fixing bacteria yao et al 2019 therefore we tried to propose a new cotton mung bean intercropping system cmbi based on the monocropping cotton mc system to improve crop production and economic benefits in the arid area of northwest china however to the best of our knowledge little field experimental studies explored effects of the cmbi system on agriculture production and economic benefits in the arid area of northwest china therefore we hypothesized that adopting the new cmbi system could improve tlo wue total n uptake nue and economic benefits crop yields and economic benefits in the cmbi system should be paid particular attention to convince farmers to accept the intercropping mode additionally tlo aboveground dry matter nitrogen uptake water use efficiency wue nitrogen uptake efficiency nue and economic benefits should be quantified to evaluate yield increasing effect of intercropping mung bean in bare soil strip the main objectives of this study were therefore to 1 quantify tlo aboveground dry matter nitrogen uptake wue nue and economic benefits in the cmbi and monocropping cotton mc systems and further evaluating yield advantages and economic benefits in the cmbi system 2 analyze the influences of different application nitrogen rates on tlo total aboveground dry matter total n uptake pfp for nitrogen wue nue and economic benefits in the cmbi system and thus further determining the optimal amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied in the cmbi system 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experimental site in 2016 and 2017 field experiment was conducted at the bazhou irrigation experiment station 41 36 n 86 12 e 901 m a s l in korla city xinjiang province northwest china fig 1 the experimental site had a continental desert climate strong evaporation approximately 2788 mm sufficient sunshine about 3036 h tan et al 2017 liang et al 2019 moreover the precipitation was mainly concentrated between march and october in 2016 and 2017 the precipitation was 145 mm in 2016 and 87 2 mm in 2017 fig 2 respectively daily average temperature was 22 4 and 22 in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons between april and october in 2016 and 2017 fig 2 respectively the physical and chemical properties of soil in the experimental site were showed in table 1 2 2 experimental design and cropping system in the experimental sites the local cropping system was mainly based on monocropping cotton mc system combining with film mulching drip irrigation technology fig 3a experiment treatments consisted of two cropping systems monocropping cotton mc and cotton mung bean intercropping cmbi and a combination of the cmbi system with different n fertilizer rates 160 n160 315 n315 390 n390 and 475 n475 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 160 n160 315 n315 and 390 n390 kg ha 1 in 2017 respectively all treatments were designed using a randomized complete block with three replications the mc and cmbi systems had same irrigation and fertilization schedule where application nitrogen amount was 315 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 this was due to application nitrogen amount of 315 kg ha 1 was determined by the experience of local farmers the mc system includes bare soil strip and film mulching strip the former was considered as an idle zone and the latter was used for arranging drip lines and planting cotton two drip lines beneath each plastic mulch and each plastic mulch contains four rows of cotton plants fig 3a the film mulching strip in the mc system was used to plant four rows of cotton plants and cotton plants along each row were spaced 10 cm apart the narrow row and wide row were defined on the basis of cotton location chen et al 2018 the width of plastic mulch bare soil strip wide row and narrow row was 110 30 40 and 20 cm respectively tan et al 2017 the difference between the cmbi and the mc system was that bare soil strip was used for intercropping mung beans and arranging a drip line fig 3b in cmbi system therefore a row mung bean was planted at a density of 20 plants m 2 gong et al 2020 in the bare soil strip where arranged a drip line fig 3b and film mulching strip was the same as that of the mc system example picture of the cmbi system in the field was showed in fig 3c cotton and mung bean were sowed at 25 april 2016 and 16 april 2017 respectively the other management practices including plant pruning weed and insect control were carried out through local farmer s experience no basal fertilizer was applied in all plots before sowing the area of each plot was 7 m 7 m each plot was separated by 1 4 m to avoid the impact of the lateral movement of nitrogen fertilizer and soil water fertilizer and irrigation water were applied in each plot through the irrigation and fertilization schedule in the 2016 and 2017 entire cotton growing season table 2 the irrigation schedule was determined by the local farmer s experience the amount of irrigation was the same in all plots the total amount of irrigation was 450 mm in 2016 and 412 5 mm in 2017 respectively 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 plant height ph stem diameter sd and leaf area index lai during seedling stage squaring and flowering stages and bolls stage of 2016 and 2017 three representative cotton plants and three representative mung bean plants were randomly selected from each plot to measure plant height ph stem diameter sd and leaf area leaf area index lai was the total leaf area divided by the occupied land area watson 1947 2 3 2 aboveground dry matter nitrogen uptake seed cotton yield and harvest index hi at harvest stage three representative cotton plants and three representative mung bean plants were collected from each plot and then aboveground part of cotton and mung bean were separated placed into an oven at 75 dried to constant weight aboveground dry matter of cotton and mung bean was determined by gravimetry additionally aboveground dry matter of cotton and mung bean plant were milled through a mill and then screened through a 0 5 mm sieve for analysis of plant nitrogen content nitrogen content of cotton and mung bean plant in aboveground dry matter was determined by the kjeldahl method details of the kjeldahl method could be found elsewhere bremner 1996 seed cotton and mung bean were manually harvested from area of 6 67 m2 for each plot to determine yield of mung bean and cotton respectively the harvest index hi was defined as crop yield divided by aboveground dry matter wang et al 2018 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 total land output tlo in cmbi system total land output tlo jolliffe and wanjau 1999 was used to evaluate intercropping productivity as follows 1 t l o y c y m where tlo is total land output kg ha 1 yc

groundwater recharge mm d is deep seepage mm r is runoff mm the level of groundwater in the experimental site was below 7 5 m moreover rainfall is rare and no un planned irrigation was used during the experiment therefore g d and r was neglected 2 4 4 partial factor productivity pfp partial factor productivity pfp reflected an average productivity which was calculated by crop yield divided by amount of applied fertilizers the pfp for n was calculated as follows li et al 2018 6 p f p n y f n where pfpn is partial factor productivity kg kg 1 fn is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied in

different application n treatments was different at each growing stage of 2016 and 2017 therefore the data in 2016 and 2017 were analyzed separately the significant differences between the treatments were carried out through least significant differences lsd at p 0 05 level graphics are created by the microsoft visio 2003 the excel 2016 and arcgis 10 5 3 results 3 1 effects of cmbi and mc systems

2017 significantly p 0 05 higher than that in the mc system respectively table 3 compared with the mc system total n uptake nue wue and pfp for nitrogen in the cmbi system significantly p 0 05 increased by 27 9 45 3 27 9 45 3 17 0 36 3 and 16 5 19 9 in 2016 and 2017 fig 4 respectively furthermore total economic input in the mc system was significantly p 0 05 lower than that the cmbi system table s1 but economic benefits in the cmbi system improved by 31 7 in 2016 and 51 9 in 2017 compared with the mc system respectively table 4 therefore the cmbi system showed greater production

flowering and bolls stage of 2016 and 2017 significant p 0 05 differences in hi of cotton were only found among different application nitrogen treatments in 2016 but the differences disappeared in 2017 table 7 moreover no significant differences in hi of mung bean were found among different application nitrogen treatments in 2016 and 2017 table 7 compared with the n160 treatment other application nitrogen treatments n315 n390 and n475 significantly p 0 05 enhanced aboveground dry matter of cotton 21 5 57 3 table 7 aboveground dry matter of mung bean 46 0 71 8 table 7 tlo 28 8 79 6

addition although the n160 treatment could significantly p 0 05 decrease total economic input table s2 in the cmbi system the highest economic benefits were obtained with the n390 in 2016 and n315 in 2017 respectively table 8 the economic benefits in the n390 treatment of 2016 and n315 treatment of 2017 were 232 2 and 117 4 higher than that of the n160 respectively table 8 4 discussions 4 1 a promising agronomic strategy cotton mung bean intercropping cmbi system greater land productivity and higher yield were possible when non legume cash crops were intercropped with legumes betencourt et al 2012 latati et al 2014 chapagain and riseman 2014 2015 jahanzad et al 2015 chapagain et al 2018 in the present study we tried to propose a new cmbi system based on the traditional mc system in the arid regions of northwest china we hypothesized that the new cmbi system had greater potential ability to improve crop production wue total n uptake nue and economic benefits than the mc system our data presented in tables 3 4 and figs 4 5 supported these hypotheses for example the cmbi system significantly p 0 05 increased tlo by 16 6 19 8 nue by 27 9 45 3 wue by 17 0 36 3 pfp for nitrogen by 16 5 19 9 and economic benefits by 31 7 51 9 compared with the mc system in 2016 and 2017 tables 3 4 and fig 4 gong et al 2020 also demonstrated higher wue and crop yield when proso millet panicum miliaceum l and mung bean were intercropped in the arid regions of northwest china qian et al 2018 also demonstrated higher economic returns when oat avena sativa l and mung bean were intercropped in the semi arid regions of northeast china similarly studies from other regions have shown that intercropping system with legumes had higher crop yields and economic benefits than monocropping system for example jahanzad et al 2015 showed that higher crop yield was obtained in the millet soybean intercropping system chapagain and riseman 2014 and 2015 also reported that higher tlo 4 4 t ha 1 and 5 9 t ha 1 could be achieved when wheat and barley were intercropped with beans and peas respectively moreover chapagain et al 2018 also reported that higher tlo 21 8 t ha 1 was achieved in year round intercrop system i e ginger maize soybean in the present study it was noteworthy that there was plant population per square meter in the cmbi system was higher than the mc system this was due to mung bean was sowed in the bare soil strip in the cmbi system which could contribute to the greater tlo per square meter in the cmbi plots than the mc system moreover economic benefits in the cmbi system significantly increased by 31 7 in 2016 and 51 9 in 2017 compared with the mc system respectively table 4 these findings clearly demonstrated that the cmbi system efficiently showed greater yield advantages i e tlo and potential economic benefits than the traditional mc system this result implied that the new cmbi system might be a promising agronomic strategy for improving crop production and farmers economic benefits in the arid region of northwest of china in the intercropping system facilitation was an important process that one crop promoted the growth of another crop hu et al 2016 zhang and li 2003 in our study seed cotton yield in the cmbi system increased by 6 2 7 2 compared with the mc system this result implied that intercropping mung bean could promote the increase of seed cotton yield in the cmbi system in 2016 and 2017 same fertilizer and irrigation amount were applied in the cmbi and mc systems however the tlo total n uptake nue and wue were greater in the cmbi system than those in the mc system table 3 and fig 4 this result implied that the cmbi system showed higher yield advantages and resources use efficiency than the mc system this was attributed to interspecific interactions between companion crops which played a very important role in enhancing resources use efficiency of intercropping system hu et al 2016 especially root interactions in the intercropping system with legumes occurred more often in the adjacent row between main crops and legume crops gregory and reddy 1982 this was due to roots of legume crops could not only absorb nutrients and water but also synthesize and transform some substances to the other crop tissues landhäusser et al 2006 for example in the non legume cash crops legumes intercropping system non legume cash crops mainly relied on competition of their roots to acquire soil inorganic n jensen 1996 corre hellou and crozat 2005 however legumes could not only had the ability of n2 fixation for their own utilization hauggaard nielsen et al 2009 sitienei et al 2017 but also the fixed nitrogen by legumes could also be assimilated by non legume cash crops through their root expansion hauggaard nielsen et al 2001 in addition some studies also showed that the roots of legumes could produce exudates that had the ability to solubilize p through competing with phosphate ions for exchange sites and thus further promoting the absorption of p by non legume crops in the intercropping system with legumes hinsinger et al 2011 wang et al 2015 giles et al 2017 therefore exploring the relationships between root growth and soil water and nutrients were fundamentally needed in revealing underlying mechanisms of improving water fertilizer utilization efficiency in the intercropping system however the relationships in the cmbi system were not addressed in this study in further researches therefore we should mainly focus on the following several aspects 1 monitoring the vertical and horizontal distributions of crop roots in the mc and cmbi systems during the different crop growing stages 2 analyzing competition between cotton and mung bean for soil water and nutrients n and p and 3 quantifying relationships between root distribution and wue and nue in the cmbi system 4 2 effects of nitrogen fertilizer on the cmbi system and optimization of nitrogen application rate in this study application n rates n315 n390 and n475 treatments significantly improved crop growth tlo n uptake and wue in the cmbi system compared with the n160 treatment tables 5 7 this was due to adequate nitrogen fertilizer could accelerate crop growth expand leaf area and increase aboveground dry matter accumulation and crop yield rossini et al 2011 in this study however the highest tlo cotton n uptake mung bean n uptake and wue were obtained with n390 in 2016 and with n315 in 2017 respectively this may be attributed to the following two possibilities on the one hand this might be attributed to the different sowing time this was due to the sowing data in 2017 was 9 days earlier than that in 2016 table 2 khan et al 2017a 2017b demonstrated sowing time could significantly influenced crop yield and nutrient uptake on the other hand another possible explanation might be related to different meteorological factors such as precipitation during the growing season of 2016 and 2017 for example precipitation of 135 8 mm in the growing stage of 2016 was significantly higher than 57 1 mm in the growing stage of 2017 fig 2 qian et al 2018 also reported unstable precipitation during the growing stage threatened yield stability in the consecutive years in semi arid regions in addition in this study different application nitrogen rates only had a significant effect on the hi of cotton in 2016 but had no significant effects on the hi of cotton in 2017 and hi of mung bean in 2016 and 2017 zhang et al 2012 reported that different application nitrogen rates had a significant effect on hi of cotton however wang et al 2018 reported that there was no significant effect of different application nitrogen rates on hi of cotton these results might be attributed to vegetative growth status of cotton among different application nitrogen rates during the boll setting stage as previously reported dong et al 2010 in intercropping system high application nitrogen rates could result in counterproductive influence on crop yield due to excessive nitrogen fertilizer could hinder crop growth and increase of yields kirda et al 2005 rathke et al 2006 hu et al 2013 the present study also showed similar results that tlo seed cotton yield and economic benefits in the n475 treatment were significantly lower than those in the n390 treatment table 7 which implied that application n rate of 475 kg ha 1 might be overused in the cmbi system this result indicated that appropriate application n rate might play an important role in improving tlo aboveground dry matter nitrogen uptake wue and nue in the cmbi system the optimal application nitrogen rate should be usually proposed to take these components into account therefore the relationships between different application n rates and tlo total aboveground dry matter total n uptake and wue were fitted by quadratic functions respectively fig 6 a d the determinate coefficients of the four quadratic functions were 0 63 0 77 0 77 and 0 73 for tlo total aboveground dry matter total n uptake and wue fig 6a d respectively moreover the relationships between application n rates and nue and pfp for nitrogen were fitted by the linear equations fig 6e f the determinate coefficients of the two linear equations were 0 94 and 0 80 for nue and pfp for nitrogen fig 6e f respectively according to analyzing the four quadratic functions we found that the highest tlo fig 6a highest total aboveground dry matter fig 6b highest total n uptake fig 6c and highest wue fig 6d were obtained at application n rates of 475 447 411 and 390 kg ha 1 respectively however according to analyzing the two linear equations we found that application n rates of 475 447 and 411 kg ha 1 could significantly decrease nue fig 6e and pfp for nitrogen fig 6f compared with the application n rates of 390 kg ha 1 this was due to nue fig 6e and pfp for nitrogen fig 6f significantly decreased with the increasing of application n rates therefore this result implied that application n rate of 390 kg ha 1 might be likely to be an appropriate nitrogen fertilizer application rate in the cmbi system this may be attributed to the following two reasons on the one hand legumes such as mung bean mainly relied on symbiotic n2 fixation in the non legume cash crop legume intercropping system crozat et al 1994 but high rate of application nitrogen could inhibit the ability of n2 fixation for legumes hu et al 2016 and thus further resulting in low nue and pfp for nitrogen chen et al 2014 on the other hand the application n rate of 390 kg ha 1 achieved the highest wue and higher nue compared with the other application n rates 475 447 and 411 kg ha 1 the high wue and nue played an important role in agriculture production in arid areas of northwest china however the highest tlo and total aboveground dry matter were not obtained in the application n rate of 390 kg ha 1 therefore more years of experiments should be carried out to determine the optimal nitrogen fertilizer application amount in the further study 5 conclusions in conclusion the new cmbi system was a promising agronomic strategy to improve crop production and economic benefits in xinjiang of china compared to the traditional mc system the cmbi system resulted in higher tlo 16 6 19 8 total n uptake 27 9 45 3 wue 17 0 36 3 and economic benefits 31 7 51 9 respectively compared to the mc system tables 3 4 and fig 4 therefore the cmbi system showed greater production advantages and economic benefits than the mc system in the cmbi system compared to the n160 treatment high application n rates n315 n390 and n475 treatments significantly enhanced crop growth tlo total aboveground dry matter n uptake wue and economic benefits however compared with the n390 treatment the

10516,irrigation water regulations use escherichia coli as an indicator of fecal contamination however it is well documented that bacterial indicators may not be ideal for predicting viral pathogen presence viral pathogens survive relatively long periods in water are resistant to treatment processes and cause a large number of illnesses annually therefore this study explored the application of quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra to understand adenovirus and enterovirus concentration limits in irrigation water to achieve an acceptable annual risk estimate of 1 infection per 10 000 exposures a two step approach was used to define target viral concentrations 1 a risk model describing infection from consuming irrigated leafy greens and 2 optimization of the risk model using monte carlo simulation to define viral concentrations with an output risk value of 1 10 4 our qmra estimates target concentrations for adenoviruses and enteroviruses would be 6 9 10 3 and 1 5 genome copies 100 ml irrigation water respectively improving the accuracy of the risk model will require a more robust survey of enteric viruses in irrigation waters and dose response models specific for adenoviruses and enteroviruses present throughout the farm to fork continuum this research contributes to the important step of adapting irrigation water monitoring practices to more accurately represent viral pathogens role in foodborne outbreaks keywords quantitative microbial risk assessment produce safety leafy greens irrigation water adenovirus enterovirus food safety 1 introduction in the united states there are 9 8 million cases of foodborne illness annually accounting for 1351 deaths and 55 961 hospitalizations parker et al 2012 many foodborne illnesses occur from consumption of fresh produce center for emerging et al 2017 chatziprodromidou et al 2018 maunula and von bonsdorff 2016 according to a 2015 study fresh produce was estimated to have caused 684 separate outbreaks and 26 735 individual illnesses between 1998 and 2007 uyttendaele et al 2015 additionally viruses accounted for 68 of foodborne outbreaks in the united states between 2009 and 2013 brown et al 2017 enteric pathogenic microorganisms transmitted via the fecal oral route are of primary concern as causative agents in foodborne disease outbreaks associated with microbial contamination of food crops and their ability to cause gastroenteritis and hepatitis bosch et al 2016 2006 however a lack of monitoring for viral presence in irrigaiton water prevents a comprehensive understanding of its impact on public health hedberg and osterholm 1993 irrigation waters have been implicated as a source of fresh food crop contamination allende and monaghan 2015 pianietti et al 2004 steele and odumeru 2004 stine et al 2005 current irrigation water regulations use escherichia coli as an indicator of fecal contamination however a bacterial indicator like e coli may not accurately represent the spectrum of pathogens present in feces e coli regrowth in the environment is possible zaleski et al 2005 potentially allowing these bacteria to exist at relatively higher concentrations than other pathogens additionally bacterial pathogens such as fecal coliforms can live up to 30 days in water and sewage and up to 15 days on the surface of produce steele and odumeru 2004 comparatively enteroviruses can persist on produce surfaces for the same 15 days but can survive in water up to 50 days steele and odumeru 2004 because viruses can persist longer than bacteria in the environment the survival of e coli as an indicator does not necessarily align with that of a viral pathogen baggi et al 2001 hamza et al 2011 corsi et al 2016 many studies have investigated bacterial contamination in irrigation water but far fewer studies have looked at viral contamination in agriculture water and produce predmore and li 2011 furthermore limited correlation has been found between fecal indicator bacteria bacterial pathogens and viruses contreras coll et al 2002 viral pathogens are of particular concern because they survive long periods in water are resistant to treatment processes and cause a large number of illness cases annually hata et al 2011 in addition viruses typically have a low infectious dose often lower than bacterial pathogens ikner et al 2011 identifying viral pathogens in irrigation waters is crucial and it is important that an indicator organism truly represents the presence or absence of harmful viral species viral indicator species may offer a solution to the shortcomings of currently used indicator species viral pathogens are of particular interest because they survive relatively long periods in water are resistant to treatment processes and cause a large number of illnesses annually hata et al 2011 for example norovirus is the leading cause of gastrointestinal illness in the u s causing 19 21 million illnesses annually the pathogen can be spread many ways including through contaminated fruits and vegetables norovirus 2019 as such it is important to consider the possibility of irrigation water regulations based on the presence of viral species many factors must be considered when selecting effective indicator species yates 2007 it is critical to understand at what levels a viral species would need to be detectable in order to monitor those species effectively to prevent disease quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is an extremely useful tool to achieve this goal previous risk assessments of fresh produce consumption have considered variables such as per capita consumption of produce produce type and associated variables such as water volume clinging to produce surface etc environmental microbial die off rates length of time between the last irrigation event and harvest and irrigation type hamilton et al 2006 petterson et al 2001 stine et al 2005 risk models can be developed based on such exposure factors and target safety goals e g 1 illness in 10 000 exposures and can define pathogenic concentration safety thresholds understanding viral concentrations associated with acceptable risk levels is critical to the foundation of knowledge needed to begin developing regulatory viral concentrations in irrigation water therefore this study aimed to develop and utilize qmra to estimate potential concentration limits for two viral foodborne pathogens adenoviruses adv and enteroviruses evs which would be needed in irrigation water to achieve target risk levels 2 methods a two step approach was used to define a target viral concentration to meet acceptable infection risk levels first a model was developed to describe the risk of infection posed by consuming irrigated leafy greens second this risk model was optimized using r software and allowed to run using a monte carlo technique until a viral concentration was identified with an output risk value of 1 10 4 r core team 2017 this approach was applied to adv and evs in irrigation water used to grow leafy greens viruses primarily norovirus and hepatitis a are a major cause of foodborne infections however very little information exists about the role of enteric viruses and adenoviruses in produce safety despite similar health ailments enteric viruses were included in this study because of their low infectious dose and ability to persist in the environment for long periods of time barker et al 2013 rodríguez lázaro et al 2012 teunis et al 2008 human adenoviruses adv were included in this study due to their ability to cause gastroenteritis jiang 2006 similar to the more commonly considered viruses in food safety suggesting they may be used as a viral fecal indicator ecdc and efsa 2015 2 1 dose model development the model assumes a once per day potential viral dose based on the average consumption of lettuce by an adult on a single day stine et al 2005 the model assumes a single irrigation event with contaminated water as the only input of virus to the produce surface it was also assumed that all viruses detected in the samples were potentially infectious which likely overestimates the viral concentrations an equation previously described by hamilton et al 2006 was used to define the daily dose of viral particles consumed by an individual λ via lettuce eq 1 the equation was modified by removing the variable representing lettuce consumption based on body weight per person per day and replacing it with a simpler variable of lettuce consumption per person per day based on a previous study that provided an annual consumption mass which was divided by 365 days in the year stine et al 2005 the volume of irrigation water that clings to one gram of lettuce was derived from previous reported experiments where lettuce was dipped into water and the volume of water clinging to the surface was measured hamilton et al 2006 shuval et al 1997 a rinse factor was also included based on previous research bouwknegt et al 2015 estimated microbial concentration stopped at the point of harvest and one rinse viral decay or loss following harvest and rinse are not considered so as to produce the most conservative estimate of risk for this risk assessment we assumed that the viral concentration on the plant immediately prior to harvest reached the consumer to ensure a conservative estimate of risk the equation used for the estimate of dose is shown below in eq 1 eq 1 dose definition equation 1 λ m c i w v p r o d e k t 10 f r i n s e where m is the mass of lettuce consumption per person per day g person per day ciw is the concentration of the target virus in the irrigation water genome copies ml vprod is the volume of irrigation water that clings to the produce surface ml g k is the general kinetic virus decay constant t is the time between the last irrigation event and harvest days frinse is the microbial log10 removal during rinsing log10 viral particles removed rinse the value and distribution of each parameter in this model is summarized in table 1 2 2 risk model dose response assessment r statistical software was used for risk modeling the daily risk of infection was described using previously defined exponential models for both viral targets cliver 1981 heerden et al 2005 where r represents a virus specific fit parameter that has been utilized previously to represent the ingestion exposure pathway and the likelihood of a the viral particle reaching the correct location and causing infection heerden et al 2005 the parameters of the risk model are summarized in table 2 the equation used to estimate the daily risk is shown below in eq 2 eq 2 daily risk model 2 p i n f e c t i o n d a i l y 1 e r λ the daily risk model was then incorporated into an annual model heerden et al 2005 assuming an exposure event every day of the year as shown in eq 3 eq 3 annual risk model 3 p i n f e c t i o n a n n u a l 1 1 p i n f e c t i o n d a i l y 365 2 3 target virus concentration calculations the model was optimized to find the largest virus concentration that can be present and also achieve the acceptable risk threshold of 1 infection per 10 000 exposures 1 10 4 the risk model was allowed to run with all variables held constant except p infection annual and ciw the variable ciw was allowed to fluctuate at random until a concentration was input which produced a p infection annual equal to 1 10 4 this resulted in the viral concentration value per milliliter of irrigation water that when input into the model would determine the acceptable risk threshold of 1 infection per 10 000 exposures 10 4 this value was then multiplied by 100 to report results as microorganisms per 100 ml the same format as current regulations 3 results and discussion this study aimed to develop and utilize qmra to estimate potential concentration limits for adenoviruses adv and enteroviruses evs in irrigation water needed to achieve targeted risk levels the original scope of this project included the collection and quantification of adv and evs in irrigation water using a novel approach this method failed to detect the target viruses and therefore a reverse qmra approach was used to define acceptable concentrations of adv and evs our risk models found that in order to achieve an annual risk target of 1 infection per 10 000 exposures adv concentrations in irrigation water would need to be less than or equal to 6 9 10 5 genome copies ml and evs concentrations would need to be less than or equal to 1 5 10 2 genome copies ml of irrigation water this translates to target concentrations of 6 9 10 3 and 1 5 genome copies 100 ml irrigation water for adv and evs respectively untreated surface and groundwater sources used for irrigation purposes can serve as a transport mechanism for foodborne pathogens including enteric viruses lópez gálvez et al 2016a enteric viruses have been found in irrigation waters de giglio et al 2017 gerba and choi 2006 kokkinos et al 2017 and under such circumstances can cause human infection li et al 2015 these studies reported presence or absence of enteric viruses and mostly focused on norovirus and hepatitis a one study detected but again did not quantify enteroviruses and adenoviruses in groundwater used for irrigation cheong et al 2009 despite the lack of quantifiable adv and evs concentrations data in irrigation water it has been reported that low concentrations of viruses in irrigation water can result in significant infection risks that exceed the annual risk target of 1 infection per 10 000 exposures petterson and ashbolt 2001 stine et al 2005 the lack of quantitative studies surrounding enteric viruses in irrigation waters limits the inter study comparability especially when attempting to assess health risk many studies have focused on the bacterial contamination of irrigation water and their role in human health risks pachepsky et al 2011 however viral contamination of irrigation water remains an understudied realm of fresh produce safety despite suggestions of their risks hamilton et al 2006 petterson and ashbolt 2001 viruses account for more than two thirds of foodborne outbreaks in the united states brown et al 2017 additional monitoring for enteric viruses is needed to improve produce safely beyond the need for a better understanding of viral concentrations in irrigation water is the need for complete assessments of viruses in the farm to fork continuum more fully understanding quantified viral retention loss or inactivation that occurs post harvest until the product reaches the consumer would improve the accuracy of models and the estimation of target viral concentrations virus monitoring in irrigation is limited by a number of factors including detection methods and low persistent concentrations the viruses examined in the current study were both non enveloped and included one dna virus adv and one rna virus ev as it stands the more conservative option would be to select the lower target concentration determined by this study 6 9 10 3 genome copies per 100 ml irrigation water based on the adv estimate in comparison another study found adv concentrations of 41 gene copies per 100 ml would exceed recreational health standards 36 gastrointestinal illnesses per 1000 swimmers ahmed et al 2018 our model suggests a much lower safety threshold is required for fresh produce likely a result of model uncertainties surrounding adv persistence and ingestion rates via this exposure mechanism it would be beneficial to investigate adv alongside other viral species with unique morphological characteristics to determine if this conservative estimate would encompass a wider variety of viral species and to reduce model uncertainty future studies should investigate viral indicators in irrigation waters as has been the case in recreational waters love et al 2014 palmateer et al 1991 or use a suite of viruses kokkinos et al 2017 viral detection methods in irrigation water also present a barrier for increased understanding of virus associated health risks much more information is needed before an accurate target viral concentration can be defined for irrigation water safety assays for viral detection in water have improved in recent years however a divide often exists between assays with improved limits of detection and the ability to identify the viability of detected viruses both factors are of critical importance to defining monitoring for or enforcing regulations for viruses in irrigation waters one study reported limits of detection for enteric viruses including norovirus at about 3 102 genome copies per 100 ml using molecular techniques lópez gálvez et al 2016b another study utilized an integrated approach and was able to detect an enteric virus hepatitis a in concentrations as low as one infectious organism per assay yeh et al 2008 however the results of the current project suggest that a target concentration for viruses in irrigation water could be less than one organism per 100 ml of irrigation water cumulatively this suggests that much higher sensitivity will be required to truly understand the risk viruses pose when in irrigation water epidemiological studies may be required to accurately characterize risks from viruses in irrigation waters neither dose response curve used in the current project was based on a human model the evs dose response model was based on oral exposure however a single dose response curve and associated parameters are typically applied to predict the risk associated with adv those parameters are used as representatives of all infection types including gastrointestinal heerden et al 2005 when considering adv risk prediction results it is important to note that adv is a common cause of many infection types e g urinary tract gastrointestinal respiratory and eye heerden et al 2005 using generalized parameters for all infection types reduces the accuracy of risk models to predict a specific infection type and may have impacted the risk outcome building specific dose response models with more accurate parameter inputs such as infection type and exposure would allow for improved risk prediction this research contributes an important step of adapting irrigation water monitoring practices to more accurately represent viral pathogens which are important contributors to the annual foodborne disease burden worldwide potential target concentrations for viral pathogens in irrigation waters were identified as research and methods improve this estimate can be further refined each research development contributes to the goal of more effectively monitoring irrigation

10517,distributed crop models were considered a useful tool for allocating rational water resources however how to upscale the crop model into the regional scale is a key issue because the associated crop parameters tend to have spatial heterogeneity according to their feedback to the environment the remote sensing may provide a possible method for generating the spatial distribution of crop parameters thereby improving the upscaling approach on this basis this study aims to achieve the spatial distribution of crop parameters and establish the distributed aquacrop rs model by means of remote sensing the results showed that the distribution of two crop parameters namely the maximum canopy coverage ccx and the relative biomass brel was significantly heterogeneous with the spatial variability coefficient of 8 and 8 5 for ccx in 2012 and 2013 respectively and that of 6 3 and 4 6 for brel compared with the aquacrop gis model without introducing the spatial parameters the simulation accuracy of aquacrop rs model was improved by 20 in regional crop water consumption and by 26 36 in regional yield the new upscaling approach could be an effective and promising method of crop model upscaling keywords aquacrop model aquacrop rs model maximum canopy coverage relative biomass remote sensing 1 introduction the heihe river basin hrb which is located in northwest china is the second largest inland river basin in china the middle oasis of the hrb between yingluo gorge and zhengyi gorge is an important agricultural production base in gansu province li et al 2001 in the basin the crop water requirement is mainly supplied by irrigation kang et al 2004 however the water resources of the oasis are unevenly distributed because of the lack of reasonable measures for irrigation and irrigation distribution increasing the water utilization level in the middle reaches of the heihe river is of considerable significance to understand the spatiotemporal distribution of the crop demand for water in the oasis thus ensuring the accurate estimation of the water consumption yield and water use efficiency based on the spatial distribution of crops crop growth models are considered as very useful methods of estimating crop water consumption yield and water use efficiency at present the most commonly used crop growth models are dssat jones et al 2003 epic williams et al 1989 wofost diepen et al 1989 although these models can precisely simulate the growth status and water consumption of the crops at the field scale the widespread application of such models is limited to a large extent because of their complexity high requirements on the adjustment of the model parameters and preparation of the input data for the end users of the models vanuytrecht et al 2014a to solve this problem the food and agriculture organization fao developed the water driven aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 the aquacrop model requires relatively few input parameters and the input data are intuitive clear and easy to obtain the aquacrop model can also be applied to a variety of crops geerts et al 2009 mabhaudhi et al 2014 bello and walker 2017 leading to its rapid development and application worldwide many experiments and results have been reported using the aquacrop model in various applications heng et al 2009 tsegay et al 2012 iqbal et al 2014 including optimizing irrigation strategies andarzian et al 2011 and management measures abrha et al 2012 zinyengere et al 2011 shrestha et al 2013 and predicting the impact of climate change on cereal production vanuytrecht et al 2014b research on this model has been relatively mature in the fields of water consumption and crop yield meanwhile several scholars have applied the aquacrop model to the regional scale iqbal et al 2014 conducted a field experiment in luancheng and their model was calibrated and validated with the field data then their calibrated model was again verified in shijiazhuang to obtain the results of the two areas to reflect the agricultural production in the north china plain similar to the method employed by paredes et al 2015 however when large spatial variations exist among crops and their growth environment directly applying the results of the model at the field scale to the regional scale would lead to numerous errors mo et al 2005 the fao developed the software of aquadata and aquagis lorite et al 2013 which achieved the division of the spatial differentiation of the inputs and outputs to improve the effectiveness of the aquacrop model at the regional scale lorite et al 2013 used this software to simulate the impact of climate change over the past and next 30 years on wheat production in andalusia southern spain which significantly improved the efficiency of regional simulation however upscaling the spatial scale of the model is not simply applying the field model to the regional scale the spatial heterogeneity of the crop growth environment leads to the spatial variability of the crop parameters of the model to the environment therefore considering the spatial variation of the model parameters when applying the aquacrop model to the regional scale is necessary a large number of studies geerts et al 2009 vanuytrecht et al 2014c showed that two crop parameters i e maximum canopy coverage ccx and relative biomass brel have a significant effect on the simulation results however these two factors have not been considered sufficiently in the present regional studies li et al 2016 and the description of the spatial heterogeneity of the underlying surface has not been provided adequately in detail with the development of remote sensing the spatial and refined representations of regional parameters have been achieved xing and zhang 2003 which can provide the spatially continuous input data such as the green canopy coverage and normalized difference vegetation index for the regional application of the model this technology effectively addresses the problem of spatially discrete data and improves the accuracy of the model in the regional application dorigo et al 2007 coupling of remote sensing with crop growth models is a hotspot in current research scholars have initialized the model parameters to increase the simulation accuracy by inversion for example battude et al 2016 2017 coupled the simple algorithm for yield safy to a water balance model based on the high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data and modeled water needs and total irrigation depths of maize in the south west of france in order to solve the problem of upscaling the aquacrop model into regional scale this study selected yingke irrigation district yid a typical irrigation district in the middle oasis of the heihe river as the study area and seed maize as the research subject based on the calibration and validation of the basic crop parameters of the model the spatial inversion methods for the key crop parameters of ccx and brel were explored using remote sensing data i e mod13q1 250 m 16days and mod17a2h 500 m 8days and the spatiotemporal variation of the two parameters was analyzed on this basis a distributed aquacrop rs model based on the spatially heterogeneous parameters was built with the help of aquacrop gis to improve the regional simulation accuracy and to realize the refined simulation of the yield and water use efficiency of seed maize in yid 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in yid a typical irrigation district in the middle oasis of hrb which is located in ganzhou district zhangye city with the geographic position of 38 50 n 38 58 n 100 17 e 100 34 e see fig 1 with annual average temperature of 6 5 8 5 c multiyear average precipitation of approximately 133 mm and annual evapotranspiration of reference crops et 0 of approximately 1200 mm the groundwater depth in yid is relatively deep ranging from 40 m in the southwest to approximately 5 m in the northeast the yid covers an area of 192 km2 of which the irrigated area accounts for 68 the landuse of yid is shown in fig 2 which was provided by the key project of the chinese national natural science fund no 91125017 the main crops in the irrigated area are the seed maize field maize wheat vegetables and other crops of which the seed maize is the most important crop in the region with an acreage accounting for approximately 50 the distribution of seed maize will be derived from the landuse with the tool of arcgis in addition to the vegetables that can be grown twice a year the other crops are harvested once a year the irrigation method in yid is rotational irrigation and according to the statistics of the irrigation management division of yid the average irrigation times for seed maize in 2012 was 4 and the irrigation quota was between 507 mm and 819 mm 2 2 acquisition of the data field experiments were conducted from april 2012 to september 2013 this study takes seed maize as the research object and 24 observation points in the field see fig 1 were monitored the observation index includes the lai biomass soil water content swc and yield the soil in the experimental field is mainly silty loam with hydraulic parameters of saturation of 0 42 mm mm field capacity of 0 33 mm mm permanent wilting point of 0 08 mm mm and saturated hydraulic conductivity of 140 mm day the soil in the irrigated area is mainly silty loam and some parts are clay loam the regional soil hydraulic parameters were estimated with the rosetta software jiang et al 2015 based on soil particle size composition data from the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences meteorological data are derived from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn and considering the area and location of the study region the data from zhangye weather station are used for yid 2 3 spatial upscaling approach of the aquacrop model based on remote sensing 2 3 1 aquacrop model the aquacrop model was developed on the basis of the relationship between yield and water steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 described the mechanism of this model and the response of crops to water in detail this model is simple yet stable with a user friendly interface and has extensive application objects and fields the aquacrop model uses canopy coverage cc the percentage of the canopy shadow area to the surface area in direct sunlight instead of the leaf area index lai to express the growth process of the canopy the development of the canopy directly affects the evapotranspiration of crops and accumulation of biomass the feedback of crops to soil fertility in this model is denoted by the parameters ccx and brel where ccx is the maximum value that the canopy can reach under certain fertility stresses and brel refers to the relative biomass attainable at the start of flowering in the presence of fertility stress adams et al 1976 villalobos and fereres 1990 more descriptions and equations of the aquacrop model can be found in the aquacrop user manual the input data required for the model include the meteorological data i e temperature rainfall radiation and humidity crop parameters i e conservative and cultivar specific parameters soil parameters irrigation management parameters i e soil fertility stress and surface coverage and initial soil water content the inputs for the aquacrop model when applied to the field scale can be obtained from the field experiments however when applying the model to the regional scale the inputs mentioned previously need spatial inversion through remote sensing to ensure spatial heterogeneity in the previous research the spatial heterogeneity of the crop parameters ccx and brel and the management parameters of soil fertility stress preliminarily defined as 100 1 brel in the reference manual of aquacrop were directly neglected during the regional application of the aquacrop model the values of ccx and brel were also considered uniform along the entire study region 2 3 2 remote sensing inversion of the spatial parameters 2 3 2 1 spatial inversion of the maximum canopy coverage ccx the maximum canopy coverage ccx refers to the maximum value that the canopy can reach in the optimal environment this index reflects the growth status of the crop and affects the development and aging processes of crop canopy which in turn influences the evapotranspiration and yield directly given the influence of water fertilizer supply and human activities the spatiotemporal distribution of green canopy is different moreover ccx also exhibits spatial difference however in the presence of fertility stress ccx is usually lower than ccx this study inverted the green canopy cover using the modis ndvi product mod13q1 250 m 16days https lpdaac usgs gov in 2012 the theory of the retrieval technique was discussed in detail by viña and gitelson 2005 the data processing methods are as follows i reprojecting all of the images into the universal transverse mercator utm using the modis reprojection tool ii masking the images with the image of seed maize to obtain the spatial distribution of ndvi for the crop and iii calculating eqs 1 3 for each image using the arcgis raster calculator and obtaining the spatial distribution of canopy coverage for each growth stage 1 w d r v i α 1 n d v i α 1 α 1 n d v i α 1 2 l a i l a i max w d r v i w d r v i min w d r v i max w d r v i min 3 c c 1 005 1 exp 0 6 l a i 1 2 where wdrvi is the wide dynamic range vegetation index gitelson et al 2007 lai max is the maximum leaf area index of seed maize which is set as 5 lei et al 2013 and α is an empirical value of 0 2 finally the maximum value composite mvc holben 1986 was adopted to extract the maximum canopy coverage as follows 4 c c x m a x c c 1 c c i 1 c c i c c i 1 c c n where ccx is the actual maximum canopy coverage n is the number of images for the selected duration and cci is the canopy coverage of image no i during the growth period 2 3 2 2 spatial inversion of the relative biomass brel the relative biomass refers to the ratio between the actual biomass under fertility stress and the latent biomass at the start of flowering expressed as follows 5 b r e l b b 0 where b is the accumulated biomass at the start of flowering under fertility stress kg ha and b 0 is the latent accumulated biomass at the same time kg ha in the aquacrop model the relative biomass brel is used to evaluate the energy storage during the vegetative growth stage brel influences the harvest index hi as shown in eq 6 if brel is less than 1 when the crop enters the flowering period then hi0 will adjust according to the magnitude of brel 6 r ange b r e l ln δ h i a n t e 5 62 1 where δhiante is the allowable increase in hi 0 as the result of water stress before flowering and range brel is the range of the biomass during which hi 0 can be adjusted brel can also reflect the level of soil fertility stress indirectly as shown in eq 7 the soil fertility stress affects ccx that can reach during the middle of the growth stage and the change of the canopy coverage in the late growth stage via the stress coefficient of maximum canopy coverage ksccx and the decline coefficient of canopy cover fcdecline respectively as shown in eq 8 and eq 9 meanwhile the canopy growth coefficient and the water productivity normalized for et 0 and co2 wp decrease separately through the stress coefficients of canopy expansion ksexp f and water productivity kswp as shown in eq 10 and eq 11 7 s t r e s s 100 1 b r e l where stress is the level of soil fertility stress 8 c c x adj k s c c x c c x 9 c c adj c c x a d j f c d e c l i n e t t f u l l c a n o p y 2 t s e n t f u l l c a n o p y where c c x is the maximum canopy coverage in the absence of fertility stress t is the time after full canopy is reached t f u l l c a n o p y is the time when the canopy reaches maximum t s e n is the time when the canopy begins to senesce 10 c g c adj k s exp f c g c 11 w p adj k s w p w p where cgc is the canopy growth coefficient in the absence of soil fertility stress statistics show that water supply is sufficient during the crop growing period in the region so water stress is neglected however the distribution of soil fertility stress is spatially irregular due to the influence of soil texture and regional management therefore ccx and brel are used to conduct the spatial correction for fertility stress coefficient of distributed model so as to improve the regional simulation accuracy this study inverted the relative biomass of seed maize by means of psnnet with mod17a2 500 m 8days of 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 with the following principle 12 b r e l b b 0 p s n n e t p s n n e t max where brel is the actual relative biomass b is the actual biomass psnnet is the cumulative net photosynthesis of 2012 and psnnet max is the maximum cumulative net photosynthesis from 2009 to 2015 all at the start of flowering the specific inversion methods are similar to those for the maximum canopy coverage i the modis reprojection tool is used to reproject the remote sensing images into the utm ii the distribution map of seed maize in yid is used to conduct the mask treatment of the remote sensing images by arcgis to extract the spatial distribution of psnnet iii the arcgis raster calculator is used to overlay the spatial distribution of psnnet for each year as shown in eq 13 to obtain the distribution of the net photosynthesis for seed maize accumulated at the start of flowering 13 p s n n e t s u m p s n n e t 1 p s n n e t i 1 p s n n e t i p s n n e t i 1 p s n n e t n where psnnet is the cumulative net photosynthesis from the selected year n is the number of images for the selected duration and psnnet i is the net photosynthesis of image no i for the selected duration the maximum value composites mvc is used to extract the maximum cumulative net photosynthesis as shown in eq 14 finally brel is calculated according to the inversion principle expressed in eq 12 14 p s n n e t max m a x p s n n e t 1 p s n n e t j 1 p s n n e t j p s n n e t j 1 p s n n e t n where p s n n e t m a x is the maximum value of the cumulative net photosynthesis from 2009 to 2015 n is the number of years selected for research which is set as 7 in this study and p s n n e t j is the cumulative net photosynthesis of year no j 2 3 3 regional application of the aquacrop gis model we need to resort to the platform of aquacrop gis called the aquacrop gis model to achieve the regional application of the aquacrop model the details can be found in the study of lorite et al 2013 in simple terms the principle of the regional simulation of the aquacrop model in the aquacrop gis platform is that the study area is divided into independent subunits according to spatially different factors of which each subunit has an independent farmland environment the aquacrop gis platform incorporates the inputs such as irrigation soil and crop for each subunit the aquacrop model operates independently under the environmental conditions of each subunit the operation module of the platform classifies and integrates the simulation results of each subunit finally the visualization module performs spatial visual analysis of the simulation results through the gis platform 2 3 4 establishment of the regional aquacrop rs model in previous studies the aquacrop model was applied to the regional scale with only the spatial discretization of soil irrigation crop type and meteorology regardless of the spatial heterogeneity of the crop parameters in this study the spatial analysis function of arcgis is used to overlay the spatial distribution maps of ccx and brel planting structure soil type and irrigation distribution to achieve the division of simulation units for seed maize in yid for which the principles and results of the division are shown in fig 3 a and b as shown in fig 3 b the planting area is divided into 1367 simulation units the colored part the development of aquacrop gis has promoted the application of the aquacrop model to the regional scale the operation of the software requires files including a control file which indicates all the possible combinations of inputs for each field called batch crop weather management irrigation soil initial soil water content and geographic information of the study areas of which the crop files were constructed by the aquacrop model with ccx and brel and the management files were constructed with 1 brel the details on how to use the software are shown in the reference manual of aquacrop gis this study establishes the regional distributed aquacrop rs model based on the spatial variability of the parameters with remote sensing data and aquacrop gis platform the establishment principle is shown in fig 4 finally the output of the aquacrop gis model is analyzed spatially by arcgis 2 4 evaluation of the model the agreement between the observed and simulated value is analyzed using the following statistics measures namely the root mean squared error rmse the index of agreement d the normalized root mean square error nrmse the relative error re the mean absolute error mae and the difference between the absolute value of relative error dare and the variability coefficient cv is used to express the spatial variability of crop parameters the rmse is one of the most widely used statistical indicators and measures the average magnitude of the difference between simulations and observations it is calculated as 15 r m s e p i o i 2 n where oi is the observed value pi is the simulated values n is the number of sample points consequently it is also advisable to use the nrmse where normalization is achieved using the mean of the observed variable akumaga et al 2017 besides it is intuitively for the user to estimate how is the performance of the model a simulation can be considered excellent if nrmse is smaller than 10 good if between 10 and 20 fair if between 20 and 30 and poor if larger than 30 jamieson et al 1991 nrmse is calculated as 16 n r m s e 100 o p i o i 2 n where o is the mean of the observed variable the index of agreement was proposed by willmott 1982 to measure the degree to which the observed data are approached by the predicted data it ranges between 0 and 1 with 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating a perfect agreement between the predicted and observed data it is calculated as 17 d 1 p i o i 2 p i o o i o 2 in order to avoid the influence of extreme values mae is also used to calculate the simulation accuracy 18 m a e 1 n p i o i generally speaking relative error can better reflect the reliability of measurement it is expressed as a percentage 19 r e p i o i o i 100 dare is used to evaluate the difference of the absolute value between the relative errors which can be used to assess the changes of the percentage of the area in which the simulation accuracy improved reduced or no changed more specifically a decreased dare indicates a decreasing relative error and thus a high simulation accuracy of the region by the corresponding model an increased dare denotes an increasing relative error and thus a low simulation accuracy of the region by the corresponding model and an unchanged dare indicates an unchanged relative error and thus an unchanged simulation accuracy of the region by the corresponding model dare is calculated as 20 d a r e p i o j o j p i o j o j where oj is remote sensing data p i and p i are the simulated values corresponding to aquacrop rs and aquacrop gis finally the variability coefficient cv is expressed as 21 c v s o where s is standard deviation of the variable the smaller cv is the less heterogeneity of the spatial parameters would be 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of the aquacrop model at the field scale the model was initially calibrated with the experimental data of 2012 and subsequently validated with the data of 2013 in this study table 1 shows the crop parameters used for calibration results show that the simulated and observed cc biomass and swc are in well agreement at all observation points as shown in fig 5 the evaluation indices for the performance of the model are shown in table 2 the calibration results show that indices of agreement d of cc biomass swc and yield in 2012 are all greater than 0 9 the normalized root mean square error nrmse of biomass is slightly larger and the others are less than 20 which are generally considered to be good and the root mean square error rmse of all indices are within a reasonable range indicating that the simulated values fit well with the observed values in 2012 in the model validation in 2013 the evaluation effect of cc and yield is the same as that in 2012 which shows that the model can well simulate canopy growth and yield although the rmse was larger in 2013 in the validation for soil water content it is still acceptable compared to the rmse of 41 2 mm simulated by iqbal et al 2014 and d for the simulation of biomass and swc in 2013 was also greater than 0 75 these results show that the aquacrop model can be used to well simulate the growth and yield of maize at the field scale 3 2 regional expansion based on the parameter spatial variability 3 2 1 spatial distribution of ccx based on remote sensing this study inverted ccx of seed maize in yid by remote sensing in 2012 and 2013 and conducted the statistical analysis of ccx in the irrigation district the results showed that the spatial variability coefficient of ccx in 2012 and 2013 is 8 and 8 5 respectively according to the classification criteria for ccx proposed by the fao it can be divided into five levels the range of ccx between 11 64 is defined as very thinly covered 65 79 as fairly covered 80 89 as well covered 90 97 as almost entirely covered and 99 100 as entirely covered ccx of seed maize in 2012 and 2013 in the irrigation district are shown in fig 6 a d affected by the varieties water or fertility stresses or poor management in the later growing period ccx of seed maize in several areas is relatively low by comparing the interannual variations in ccx in the irrigation district we observe that no significant change has occurred fig 6 e and f the distribution hierarchy of ccx for the two years remains unchanged at 53 pixels one hierarchy decreases by 23 pixels and one hierarchy increases by 18 pixels by comparing the spatial distribution of ccx over the past two years we determine that the overall distribution trend did not change considerably and is high in the southwest and relatively low in the northeast of yid in both years 3 2 2 spatial distribution of brel based on remote sensing the spatial distribution of soil fertility in the irrigation district is unevenly distributed because of human activity and soil texture soil fertility can be reflected indirectly through the crop parameter brel this study inverted brel of seed maize in yid by remote sensing in 2012 and 2013 and the spatial distribution and interval range proportion of brel are shown in fig 7 a to 7 d the relative biomass brel at the start of flowering in yid in 2012 and 2013 exhibits spatial heterogeneity with the spatial variability coefficient of 6 3 in 2012 whereas the spatial variation of brel in 2013 decreases to a large extent with the spatial variability coefficient of 4 6 by comparing the interannual variations in brel in the irrigation district we observe that the attributable hierarchy for 2013 increases by 87 pixels see fig 7 e and 7 f for the details which means the corresponding regional soil fertility stress decreases according to the classification of fertility stress in the model the soil is suffering from moderate fertility stress with brel in 2012 between 56 and 75 slightly stress between 76 and 98 and no stress between 98 and 100 of the fields in yid 89 is under a state of slightly stress 10 with moderate fertility stress and 1 without fertility stress among them brel in the northeast and northwest is relatively low and the corresponding fertility stress is high although the spatial resolution of the remote sensing data used to conduct spatial inversion on brel is relatively low and the spatial heterogeneity of brel within the pixel has caused certain differences between actual and regional average values the value of the inversion from remote sensing can be closer to the spatial inhomogeneity of soil fertility in the district which can make up for the errors caused by a constant parameter of brel and increase the precision for the regional simulation to reduce the error further it is necessary to utilize high resolution satellite data or fusion data to carry out the spatial inversion of parameters correct understanding of the spatial variability of soil fertility in the irrigation district can provide the basis for the implementation of correct fertilization management decisions 3 2 3 effect of the regional expansion of the aquacrop rs model based on spatial parameters the spatial inhomogeneity of ccx and brel is neglected when aquacrop gis model is applied in region and the values of ccx and brel for aquacrop gis are both adopted as the validated value of 95 in the field the evapotranspiration from may to august 2012 of seed maize in the irrigation district is simulated with aquacrop gis and aquacrop rs models monthly evapotranspiration at 30 m resolution in 2012 in the middle oasis of the heihe river basin liu et al 2011 wu et al 2012 which was estimated by the latest etwatch model based on multi source remote sensing data http data tpdc ac cn zh hans is used as observation for comparison with the results mentioned previously to determine the spatial distribution of the relative errors as shown in fig 8 a and b it can be seen from fig 8 a that the evapotranspiration is mainly about 500 mm and the observation data with large error which is less than 300 mm will be removed in the process of comparative analysis according to the analysis the relative errors for 52 and 55 of the pixels from aquacrop gis and aquacrop rs model are within 5 similarly 85 and 88 of the pixels are within 10 95 and 96 of the pixels are within 15 generally the overall spatial distribution trend tends to be consistent the relative error in the northeast of the irrigation district is relatively larger which may be related to the uniform irrigation date set in the simulations that did not coincide with the actual irrigation schedules throughout the irrigation district we counted the area in which the simulation accuracy changed and statistics show that dare of 54 of the pixels decreases with a percentage larger than that of the increased pixels which indicates that the overall precision of the aquacrop rs model has improved the specific distribution and proportion of dare are shown in fig 8 c and d the simulation accuracies of the two models at each level of the two crop parameters were analyzed specifically the evaluation indices are shown in detail in table 3 the rmse nrmse and mae of the aquacrop rs model all decrease at each level of the two parameters these results indicate that the aquacrop rs model can not only upscale the spatial scale of the model in a mechanistical manner but also improve the simulation accuracy at the regional scale the distribution of the simulation accuracy of the aquacrop rs model can be described as follows this finding shows that the aquacrop rs model has a high simulation accuracy for evapotranspiration with nrmse within 10 both at each level of ccx and brel except the first and fifth one in which no data exist or the data is too less for analysis compared with the results of aquacrop gis the simulation accuracy of aquacrop rs is increased the most at the second level of ccx and at the first level of brel with an increasing by 20 respectively the simulation results of the aquacrop gis model and aquacrop rs model on the yield in yid in 2012 were compared with the survey data respectively the results show that the rmse nrmse and mae for yield of the aquacrop gis model are 1 08 ton ha 11 0 89 ton ha and that of the aquacrop rs model are 0 79 ton ha 8 0 56 ton ha the simulation accuracy of aquacrop rs model for yield is 26 36 higher than that of aquacrop gis model 3 2 4 spatial distribution of the yield and water use efficiency of seed maize in yid taking the year of 2012 as an example yield and water use efficiency of seed maize in yid are simulated by aquacrop rs model the spatial distribution of the simulation results is shown in fig 9 a b the yield and water use efficiency of seed maize in the upstream and downstream area of yid are generally lower than those in the middle reach the main reasons may be as follows the upstream area and the middle reach are close to the water intake where the area has the priority of water diversion and the amount of water irrigated to the field is relatively large by contrast the amount of water for the downstream area is relatively less the soil of some areas in the upstream part is clay loam with low saturated hydraulic conductivity studies have shown that the saturated hydraulic conductivity and sand content can seriously affect water movement in the soil baver et al 1972 usually determining evapotranspiration leenhardt et al 1994 and thus affecting the crop yield doorenbos and kassam 1979 meanwhile the distribution of brel shows that the soil fertility is generally low in some areas of the upstream part and in most of the downstream area which restrains the growth of the canopy and the improvement of the yield of seed maize affected by the soil texture and soil fertility the yield 8 9 103 kg ha and water use efficiency mainly 1 7 1 8 kg m3 are relatively low in the upstream area similarly affected by the low irrigation and soil fertility the yield and water use efficiency are generally low in the downstream area the conditions of irrigation and soil fertility for the middle reach are appropriate providing a good growing environment for crops thus the yield and water use efficiency are relatively high many experiments have shown that reasonable application of fertilizer can improve soil water preservation and inhibit evaporation thereby increasing the water use efficiency and crop yield 3 3 sensitivity analysis scenario predictions have been conducted based on the effects of ccx and brel on the yield and water use efficiency brel in the simulation scenarios is set as 50 60 70 80 and 90 and to make the simulation curve continuous the value of ccx is set in specific intervals corresponding to each brel each operation of the model can change only one of the variables to verify the sensitivity to the two parameters as mentioned previously the simulation results are shown in fig 10 a and b fig 10 a and 10 b illustrate that the effect of brel on the yield and water use efficiency is relatively significant in particular when brel changes between 50 and 80 both of the indices increase along with increasing brel similar to the findings of akumaga et al 2017 as brel continues to increase the crop yield and water use efficiency will no longer be sensitive to this parameter by combining these relationships we determine that when the amount of fertilizer is increased in a reasonable range the crop yield and water use efficiency will increase but when a certain extent is reached the increase will no longer continue significantly this finding shows that ccx has no significant effect on the crop yield fig 10 a however a negative effect on water use efficiency was observed when ccx varies between 50 and 70 fig 10 b which indicates that the excessive growth of crop canopy is not good for increasing the yield and water use efficiency thus the supply of water and fertilizer should be controlled reasonably in the process of crop growth to achieve the optimal coupling of water and fertilizer 4 conclusion in this study two key parameters i e ccx and brel in the aquacrop model are spatially derived by remote sensing and on this basis a regional aquacrop rs model is established affected by variety characteristics management and soil texture the spatial distribution of ccx of seed maize in the irrigated area is significantly different with cv of 8 and 8 5 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the same as the spatial distribution of brel for human activities and soil texture with cv of 6 3 and 4 6 which indicates different degrees of soil fertility stress in the irrigated area compared with the aquacrop gis model the aquacrop rs model generally performs better in improving the regional simulation accuracy for crop water consumption by 20 and for yield by 26 36 thus introducing the spatial crop parameters ccx and brel into the aquacrop model is the foundation for the application of the model to the regional scale achieving the optimal coupling of water and fertilizer through the appropriate adjustment of fertilizer and irrigation scheduling is a

10517,distributed crop models were considered a useful tool for allocating rational water resources however how to upscale the crop model into the regional scale is a key issue because the associated crop parameters tend to have spatial heterogeneity according to their feedback to the environment the remote sensing may provide a possible method for generating the spatial distribution of crop parameters thereby improving the upscaling approach on this basis this study aims to achieve the spatial distribution of crop parameters and establish the distributed aquacrop rs model by means of remote sensing the results showed that the distribution of two crop parameters namely the maximum canopy coverage ccx and the relative biomass brel was significantly heterogeneous with the spatial variability coefficient of 8 and 8 5 for ccx in 2012 and 2013 respectively and that of 6 3 and 4 6 for brel compared with the aquacrop gis model without introducing the spatial parameters the simulation accuracy of aquacrop rs model was improved by 20 in regional crop water consumption and by 26 36 in regional yield the new upscaling approach could be an effective and promising method of crop model upscaling keywords aquacrop model aquacrop rs model maximum canopy coverage relative biomass remote sensing 1 introduction the heihe river basin hrb which is located in northwest china is the second largest inland river basin in china the middle oasis of the hrb between yingluo gorge and zhengyi gorge is an important agricultural production base in gansu province li et al 2001 in the basin the crop water requirement is mainly supplied by irrigation kang et al 2004 however the water resources of the oasis are unevenly distributed because of the lack of reasonable measures for irrigation and irrigation distribution increasing the water utilization level in the middle reaches of the heihe river is of considerable significance to understand the spatiotemporal distribution of the crop demand for water in the oasis thus ensuring the accurate estimation of the water consumption yield and water use efficiency based on the spatial distribution of crops crop growth models are considered as very useful methods of estimating crop water consumption yield and water use efficiency at present the most commonly used crop growth models are dssat jones et al 2003 epic williams et al 1989 wofost diepen et al 1989 although these models can precisely simulate the growth status and water consumption of the crops at the field scale the widespread application of such models is limited to a large extent because of their complexity high requirements on the adjustment of the model parameters and preparation of the input data for the end users of the models vanuytrecht et al 2014a to solve this problem the food and agriculture organization fao developed the water driven aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 the aquacrop model requires relatively few input parameters and the input data are intuitive clear and easy to obtain the aquacrop model can also be applied to a variety of crops geerts et al 2009 mabhaudhi et al 2014 bello and walker 2017 leading to its rapid development and application worldwide many experiments and results have been reported using the aquacrop model in various applications heng et al 2009 tsegay et al 2012 iqbal et al 2014 including optimizing irrigation strategies andarzian et al 2011 and management measures abrha et al 2012 zinyengere et al 2011 shrestha et al 2013 and predicting the impact of climate change on cereal production vanuytrecht et al 2014b research on this model has been relatively mature in the fields of water consumption and crop yield meanwhile several scholars have applied the aquacrop model to the regional scale iqbal et al 2014 conducted a field experiment in luancheng and their model was calibrated and validated with the field data then their calibrated model was again verified in shijiazhuang to obtain the results of the two areas to reflect the agricultural production in the north china plain similar to the method employed by paredes et al 2015 however when large spatial variations exist among crops and their growth environment directly applying the results of the model at the field scale to the regional scale would lead to numerous errors mo et al 2005 the fao developed the software of aquadata and aquagis lorite et al 2013 which achieved the division of the spatial differentiation of the inputs and outputs to improve the effectiveness of the aquacrop model at the regional scale lorite et al 2013 used this software to simulate the impact of climate change over the past and next 30 years on wheat production in andalusia southern spain which significantly improved the efficiency of regional simulation however upscaling the spatial scale of the model is not simply applying the field model to the regional scale the spatial heterogeneity of the crop growth environment leads to the spatial variability of the crop parameters of the model to the environment therefore considering the spatial variation of the model parameters when applying the aquacrop model to the regional scale is necessary a large number of studies geerts et al 2009 vanuytrecht et al 2014c showed that two crop parameters i e maximum canopy coverage ccx and relative biomass brel have a significant effect on the simulation results however these two factors have not been considered sufficiently in the present regional studies li et al 2016 and the description of the spatial heterogeneity of the underlying surface has not been provided adequately in detail with the development of remote sensing the spatial and refined representations of regional parameters have been achieved xing and zhang 2003 which can provide the spatially continuous input data such as the green canopy coverage and normalized difference vegetation index for the regional application of the model this technology effectively addresses the problem of spatially discrete data and improves the accuracy of the model in the regional application dorigo et al 2007 coupling of remote sensing with crop growth models is a hotspot in current research scholars have initialized the model parameters to increase the simulation accuracy by inversion for example battude et al 2016 2017 coupled the simple algorithm for yield safy to a water balance model based on the high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data and modeled water needs and total irrigation depths of maize in the south west of france in order to solve the problem of upscaling the aquacrop model into regional scale this study selected yingke irrigation district yid a typical irrigation district in the middle oasis of the heihe river as the study area and seed maize as the research subject based on the calibration and validation of the basic crop parameters of the model the spatial inversion methods for the key crop parameters of ccx and brel were explored using remote sensing data i e mod13q1 250 m 16days and mod17a2h 500 m 8days and the spatiotemporal variation of the two parameters was analyzed on this basis a distributed aquacrop rs model based on the spatially heterogeneous parameters was built with the help of aquacrop gis to improve the regional simulation accuracy and to realize the refined simulation of the yield and water use efficiency of seed maize in yid 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in yid a typical irrigation district in the middle oasis of hrb which is located in ganzhou district zhangye city with the geographic position of 38 50 n 38 58 n 100 17 e 100 34 e see fig 1 with annual average temperature of 6 5 8 5 c multiyear average precipitation of approximately 133 mm and annual evapotranspiration of reference crops et 0 of approximately 1200 mm the groundwater depth in yid is relatively deep ranging from 40 m in the southwest to approximately 5 m in the northeast the yid covers an area of 192 km2 of which the irrigated area accounts for 68 the landuse of yid is shown in fig 2 which was provided by the key project of the chinese national natural science fund no 91125017 the main crops in the irrigated area are the seed maize field maize wheat vegetables and other crops of which the seed maize is the most important crop in the region with an acreage accounting for approximately 50 the distribution of seed maize will be derived from the landuse with the tool of arcgis in addition to the vegetables that can be grown twice a year the other crops are harvested once a year the irrigation method in yid is rotational irrigation and according to the statistics of the irrigation management division of yid the average irrigation times for seed maize in 2012 was 4 and the irrigation quota was between 507 mm and 819 mm 2 2 acquisition of the data field experiments were conducted from april 2012 to september 2013 this study takes seed maize as the research object and 24 observation points in the field see fig 1 were monitored the observation index includes the lai biomass soil water content swc and yield the soil in the experimental field is mainly silty loam with hydraulic parameters of saturation of 0 42 mm mm field capacity of 0 33 mm mm permanent wilting point of 0 08 mm mm and saturated hydraulic conductivity of 140 mm day the soil in the irrigated area is mainly silty loam and some parts are clay loam the regional soil hydraulic parameters were estimated with the rosetta software jiang et al 2015 based on soil particle size composition data from the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences meteorological data are derived from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn and considering the area and location of the study region the data from zhangye weather station are used for yid 2 3 spatial upscaling approach of the aquacrop model based on remote sensing 2 3 1 aquacrop model the aquacrop model was developed on the basis of the relationship between yield and water steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 described the mechanism of this model and the response of crops to water in detail this model is simple yet stable with a user friendly interface and has extensive application objects and fields the aquacrop model uses canopy coverage cc the percentage of the canopy shadow area to the surface area in direct sunlight instead of the leaf area index lai to express the growth process of the canopy the development of the canopy directly affects the evapotranspiration of crops and accumulation of biomass the feedback of crops to soil fertility in this model is denoted by the parameters ccx and brel where ccx is the maximum value that the canopy can reach under certain fertility stresses and brel refers to the relative biomass attainable at the start of flowering in the presence of fertility stress adams et al 1976 villalobos and fereres 1990 more descriptions and equations of the aquacrop model can be found in the aquacrop user manual the input data required for the model include the meteorological data i e temperature rainfall radiation and humidity crop parameters i e conservative and cultivar specific parameters soil parameters irrigation management parameters i e soil fertility stress and surface coverage and initial soil water content the inputs for the aquacrop model when applied to the field scale can be obtained from the field experiments however when applying the model to the regional scale the inputs mentioned previously need spatial inversion through remote sensing to ensure spatial heterogeneity in the previous research the spatial heterogeneity of the crop parameters ccx and brel and the management parameters of soil fertility stress preliminarily defined as 100 1 brel in the reference manual of aquacrop were directly neglected during the regional application of the aquacrop model the values of ccx and brel were also considered uniform along the entire study region 2 3 2 remote sensing inversion of the spatial parameters 2 3 2 1 spatial inversion of the maximum canopy coverage ccx the maximum canopy coverage ccx refers to the maximum value that the canopy can reach in the optimal environment this index reflects the growth status of the crop and affects the development and aging processes of crop canopy which in turn influences the evapotranspiration and yield directly given the influence of water fertilizer supply and human activities the spatiotemporal distribution of green canopy is different moreover ccx also exhibits spatial difference however in the presence of fertility stress ccx is usually lower than ccx this study inverted the green canopy cover using the modis ndvi product mod13q1 250 m 16days https lpdaac usgs gov in 2012 the theory of the retrieval technique was discussed in detail by viña and gitelson 2005 the data processing methods are as follows i reprojecting all of the images into the universal transverse mercator utm using the modis reprojection tool ii masking the images with the image of seed maize to obtain the spatial distribution of ndvi for the crop and iii calculating eqs 1 3 for each image using the arcgis raster calculator and obtaining the spatial distribution of canopy coverage for each growth stage 1 w d r v i α 1 n d v i α 1 α 1 n d v i α 1 2 l a i l a i max w d r v i w d r v i min w d r v i max w d r v i min 3 c c 1 005 1 exp 0 6 l a i 1 2 where wdrvi is the wide dynamic range vegetation index gitelson et al 2007 lai max is the maximum leaf area index of seed maize which is set as 5 lei et al 2013 and α is an empirical value of 0 2 finally the maximum value composite mvc holben 1986 was adopted to extract the maximum canopy coverage as follows 4 c c x m a x c c 1 c c i 1 c c i c c i 1 c c n where ccx is the actual maximum canopy coverage n is the number of images for the selected duration and cci is the canopy coverage of image no i during the growth period 2 3 2 2 spatial inversion of the relative biomass brel the relative biomass refers to the ratio between the actual biomass under fertility stress and the latent biomass at the start of flowering expressed as follows 5 b r e l b b 0 where b is the accumulated biomass at the start of flowering under fertility stress kg ha and b 0 is the latent accumulated biomass at the same time kg ha in the aquacrop model the relative biomass brel is used to evaluate the energy storage during the vegetative growth stage brel influences the harvest index hi as shown in eq 6 if brel is less than 1 when the crop enters the flowering period then hi0 will adjust according to the magnitude of brel 6 r ange b r e l ln δ h i a n t e 5 62 1 where δhiante is the allowable increase in hi 0 as the result of water stress before flowering and range brel is the range of the biomass during which hi 0 can be adjusted brel can also reflect the level of soil fertility stress indirectly as shown in eq 7 the soil fertility stress affects ccx that can reach during the middle of the growth stage and the change of the canopy coverage in the late growth stage via the stress coefficient of maximum canopy coverage ksccx and the decline coefficient of canopy cover fcdecline respectively as shown in eq 8 and eq 9 meanwhile the canopy growth coefficient and the water productivity normalized for et 0 and co2 wp decrease separately through the stress coefficients of canopy expansion ksexp f and water productivity kswp as shown in eq 10 and eq 11 7 s t r e s s 100 1 b r e l where stress is the level of soil fertility stress 8 c c x adj k s c c x c c x 9 c c adj c c x a d j f c d e c l i n e t t f u l l c a n o p y 2 t s e n t f u l l c a n o p y where c c x is the maximum canopy coverage in the absence of fertility stress t is the time after full canopy is reached t f u l l c a n o p y is the time when the canopy reaches maximum t s e n is the time when the canopy begins to senesce 10 c g c adj k s exp f c g c 11 w p adj k s w p w p where cgc is the canopy growth coefficient in the absence of soil fertility stress statistics show that water supply is sufficient during the crop growing period in the region so water stress is neglected however the distribution of soil fertility stress is spatially irregular due to the influence of soil texture and regional management therefore ccx and brel are used to conduct the spatial correction for fertility stress coefficient of distributed model so as to improve the regional simulation accuracy this study inverted the relative biomass of seed maize by means of psnnet with mod17a2 500 m 8days of 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 with the following principle 12 b r e l b b 0 p s n n e t p s n n e t max where brel is the actual relative biomass b is the actual biomass psnnet is the cumulative net photosynthesis of 2012 and psnnet max is the maximum cumulative net photosynthesis from 2009 to 2015 all at the start of flowering the specific inversion methods are similar to those for the maximum canopy coverage i the modis reprojection tool is used to reproject the remote sensing images into the utm ii the distribution map of seed maize in yid is used to conduct the mask treatment of the remote sensing images by arcgis to extract the spatial distribution of psnnet iii the arcgis raster calculator is used to overlay the spatial distribution of psnnet for each year as shown in eq 13 to obtain the distribution of the net photosynthesis for seed maize accumulated at the start of flowering 13 p s n n e t s u m p s n n e t 1 p s n n e t i 1 p s n n e t i p s n n e t i 1 p s n n e t n where psnnet is the cumulative net photosynthesis from the selected year n is the number of images for the selected duration and psnnet i is the net photosynthesis of image no i for the selected duration the maximum value composites mvc is used to extract the maximum cumulative net photosynthesis as shown in eq 14 finally brel is calculated according to the inversion principle expressed in eq 12 14 p s n n e t max m a x p s n n e t 1 p s n n e t j 1 p s n n e t j p s n n e t j 1 p s n n e t n where p s n n e t m a x is the maximum value of the cumulative net photosynthesis from 2009 to 2015 n is the number of years selected for research which is set as 7 in this study and p s n n e t j is the cumulative net photosynthesis of year no j 2 3 3 regional application of the aquacrop gis model we need to resort to the platform of aquacrop gis called the aquacrop gis model to achieve the regional application of the aquacrop model the details can be found in the study of lorite et al 2013 in simple terms the principle of the regional simulation of the aquacrop model in the aquacrop gis platform is that the study area is divided into independent subunits according to spatially different factors of which each subunit has an independent farmland environment the aquacrop gis platform incorporates the inputs such as irrigation soil and crop for each subunit the aquacrop model operates independently under the environmental conditions of each subunit the operation module of the platform classifies and integrates the simulation results of each subunit finally the visualization module performs spatial visual analysis of the simulation results through the gis platform 2 3 4 establishment of the regional aquacrop rs model in previous studies the aquacrop model was applied to the regional scale with only the spatial discretization of soil irrigation crop type and meteorology regardless of the spatial heterogeneity of the crop parameters in this study the spatial analysis function of arcgis is used to overlay the spatial distribution maps of ccx and brel planting structure soil type and irrigation distribution to achieve the division of simulation units for seed maize in yid for which the principles and results of the division are shown in fig 3 a and b as shown in fig 3 b the planting area is divided into 1367 simulation units the colored part the development of aquacrop gis has promoted the application of the aquacrop model to the regional scale the operation of the software requires files including a control file which indicates all the possible combinations of inputs for each field called batch crop weather management irrigation soil initial soil water content and geographic information of the study areas of which the crop files were constructed by the aquacrop model with ccx and brel and the management files were constructed with 1 brel the details on how to use the software are shown in the reference manual of aquacrop gis this study establishes the regional distributed aquacrop rs model based on the spatial variability of the parameters with remote sensing data and aquacrop gis platform the establishment principle is shown in fig 4 finally the output of the aquacrop gis model is analyzed spatially by arcgis 2 4 evaluation of the model the agreement between the observed and simulated value is analyzed using the following statistics measures namely the root mean squared error rmse the index of agreement d the normalized root mean square error nrmse the relative error re the mean absolute error mae and the difference between the absolute value of relative error dare and the variability coefficient cv is used to express the spatial variability of crop parameters the rmse is one of the most widely used statistical indicators and measures the average magnitude of the difference between simulations and observations it is calculated as 15 r m s e p i o i 2 n where oi is the observed value pi is the simulated values n is the number of sample points consequently it is also advisable to use the nrmse where normalization is achieved using the mean of the observed variable akumaga et al 2017 besides it is intuitively for the user to estimate how is the performance of the model a simulation can be considered excellent if nrmse is smaller than 10 good if between 10 and 20 fair if between 20 and 30 and poor if larger than 30 jamieson et al 1991 nrmse is calculated as 16 n r m s e 100 o p i o i 2 n where o is the mean of the observed variable the index of agreement was proposed by willmott 1982 to measure the degree to which the observed data are approached by the predicted data it ranges between 0 and 1 with 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating a perfect agreement between the predicted and observed data it is calculated as 17 d 1 p i o i 2 p i o o i o 2 in order to avoid the influence of extreme values mae is also used to calculate the simulation accuracy 18 m a e 1 n p i o i generally speaking relative error can better reflect the reliability of measurement it is expressed as a percentage 19 r e p i o i o i 100 dare is used to evaluate the difference of the absolute value between the relative errors which can be used to assess the changes of the percentage of the area in which the simulation accuracy improved reduced or no changed more specifically a decreased dare indicates a decreasing relative error and thus a high simulation accuracy of the region by the corresponding model an increased dare denotes an increasing relative error and thus a low simulation accuracy of the region by the corresponding model and an unchanged dare indicates an unchanged relative error and thus an unchanged simulation accuracy of the region by the corresponding model dare is calculated as 20 d a r e p i o j o j p i o j o j where oj is remote sensing data p i and p i are the simulated values corresponding to aquacrop rs and aquacrop gis finally the variability coefficient cv is expressed as 21 c v s o where s is standard deviation of the variable the smaller cv is the less heterogeneity of the spatial parameters would be 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of the aquacrop model at the field scale the model was initially calibrated with the experimental data of 2012 and subsequently validated with the data of 2013 in this study table 1 shows the crop parameters used for calibration results show that the simulated and observed cc biomass and swc are in well agreement at all observation points as shown in fig 5 the evaluation indices for the performance of the model are shown in table 2 the calibration results show that indices of agreement d of cc biomass swc and yield in 2012 are all greater than 0 9 the normalized root mean square error nrmse of biomass is slightly larger and the others are less than 20 which are generally considered to be good and the root mean square error rmse of all indices are within a reasonable range indicating that the simulated values fit well with the observed values in 2012 in the model validation in 2013 the evaluation effect of cc and yield is the same as that in 2012 which shows that the model can well simulate canopy growth and yield although the rmse was larger in 2013 in the validation for soil water content it is still acceptable compared to the rmse of 41 2 mm simulated by iqbal et al 2014 and d for the simulation of biomass and swc in 2013 was also greater than 0 75 these results show that the aquacrop model can be used to well simulate the growth and yield of maize at the field scale 3 2 regional expansion based on the parameter spatial variability 3 2 1 spatial distribution of ccx based on remote sensing this study inverted ccx of seed maize in yid by remote sensing in 2012 and 2013 and conducted the statistical analysis of ccx in the irrigation district the results showed that the spatial variability coefficient of ccx in 2012 and 2013 is 8 and 8 5 respectively according to the classification criteria for ccx proposed by the fao it can be divided into five levels the range of ccx between 11 64 is defined as very thinly covered 65 79 as fairly covered 80 89 as well covered 90 97 as almost entirely covered and 99 100 as entirely covered ccx of seed maize in 2012 and 2013 in the irrigation district are shown in fig 6 a d affected by the varieties water or fertility stresses or poor management in the later growing period ccx of seed maize in several areas is relatively low by comparing the interannual variations in ccx in the irrigation district we observe that no significant change has occurred fig 6 e and f the distribution hierarchy of ccx for the two years remains unchanged at 53 pixels one hierarchy decreases by 23 pixels and one hierarchy increases by 18 pixels by comparing the spatial distribution of ccx over the past two years we determine that the overall distribution trend did not change considerably and is high in the southwest and relatively low in the northeast of yid in both years 3 2 2 spatial distribution of brel based on remote sensing the spatial distribution of soil fertility in the irrigation district is unevenly distributed because of human activity and soil texture soil fertility can be reflected indirectly through the crop parameter brel this study inverted brel of seed maize in yid by remote sensing in 2012 and 2013 and the spatial distribution and interval range proportion of brel are shown in fig 7 a to 7 d the relative biomass brel at the start of flowering in yid in 2012 and 2013 exhibits spatial heterogeneity with the spatial variability coefficient of 6 3 in 2012 whereas the spatial variation of brel in 2013 decreases to a large extent with the spatial variability coefficient of 4 6 by comparing the interannual variations in brel in the irrigation district we observe that the attributable hierarchy for 2013 increases by 87 pixels see fig 7 e and 7 f for the details which means the corresponding regional soil fertility stress decreases according to the classification of fertility stress in the model the soil is suffering from moderate fertility stress with brel in 2012 between 56 and 75 slightly stress between 76 and 98 and no stress between 98 and 100 of the fields in yid 89 is under a state of slightly stress 10 with moderate fertility stress and 1 without fertility stress among them brel in the northeast and northwest is relatively low and the corresponding fertility stress is high although the spatial resolution of the remote sensing data used to conduct spatial inversion on brel is relatively low and the spatial heterogeneity of brel within the pixel has caused certain differences between actual and regional average values the value of the inversion from remote sensing can be closer to the spatial inhomogeneity of soil fertility in the district which can make up for the errors caused by a constant parameter of brel and increase the precision for the regional simulation to reduce the error further it is necessary to utilize high resolution satellite data or fusion data to carry out the spatial inversion of parameters correct understanding of the spatial variability of soil fertility in the irrigation district can provide the basis for the implementation of correct fertilization management decisions 3 2 3 effect of the regional expansion of the aquacrop rs model based on spatial parameters the spatial inhomogeneity of ccx and brel is neglected when aquacrop gis model is applied in region and the values of ccx and brel for aquacrop gis are both adopted as the validated value of 95 in the field the evapotranspiration from may to august 2012 of seed maize in the irrigation district is simulated with aquacrop gis and aquacrop rs models monthly evapotranspiration at 30 m resolution in 2012 in the middle oasis of the heihe river basin liu et al 2011 wu et al 2012 which was estimated by the latest etwatch model based on multi source remote sensing data http data tpdc ac cn zh hans is used as observation for comparison with the results mentioned previously to determine the spatial distribution of the relative errors as shown in fig 8 a and b it can be seen from fig 8 a that the evapotranspiration is mainly about 500 mm and the observation data with large error which is less than 300 mm will be removed in the process of comparative analysis according to the analysis the relative errors for 52 and 55 of the pixels from aquacrop gis and aquacrop rs model are within 5 similarly 85 and 88 of the pixels are within 10 95 and 96 of the pixels are within 15 generally the overall spatial distribution trend tends to be consistent the relative error in the northeast of the irrigation district is relatively larger which may be related to the uniform irrigation date set in the simulations that did not coincide with the actual irrigation schedules throughout the irrigation district we counted the area in which the simulation accuracy changed and statistics show that dare of 54 of the pixels decreases with a percentage larger than that of the increased pixels which indicates that the overall precision of the aquacrop rs model has improved the specific distribution and proportion of dare are shown in fig 8 c and d the simulation accuracies of the two models at each level of the two crop parameters were analyzed specifically the evaluation indices are shown in detail in table 3 the rmse nrmse and mae of the aquacrop rs model all decrease at each level of the two parameters these results indicate that the aquacrop rs model can not only upscale the spatial scale of the model in a mechanistical manner but also improve the simulation accuracy at the regional scale the distribution of the simulation accuracy of the aquacrop rs model can be described as follows this finding shows that the aquacrop rs model has a high simulation accuracy for evapotranspiration with nrmse within 10 both at each level of ccx and brel except the first and fifth one in which no data exist or the data is too less for analysis compared with the results of aquacrop gis the simulation accuracy of aquacrop rs is increased the most at the second level of ccx and at the first level of brel with an increasing by 20 respectively the simulation results of the aquacrop gis model and aquacrop rs model on the yield in yid in 2012 were compared with the survey data respectively the results show that the rmse nrmse and mae for yield of the aquacrop gis model are 1 08 ton ha 11 0 89 ton ha and that of the aquacrop rs model are 0 79 ton ha 8 0 56 ton ha the simulation accuracy of aquacrop rs model for yield is 26 36 higher than that of aquacrop gis model 3 2 4 spatial distribution of the yield and water use efficiency of seed maize in yid taking the year of 2012 as an example yield and water use efficiency of seed maize in yid are simulated by aquacrop rs model the spatial distribution of the simulation results is shown in fig 9 a b the yield and water use efficiency of seed maize in the upstream and downstream area of yid are generally lower than those in the middle reach the main reasons may be as follows the upstream area and the middle reach are close to the water intake where the area has the priority of water diversion and the amount of water irrigated to the field is relatively large by contrast the amount of water for the downstream area is relatively less the soil of some areas in the upstream part is clay loam with low saturated hydraulic conductivity studies have shown that the saturated hydraulic conductivity and sand content can seriously affect water movement in the soil baver et al 1972 usually determining evapotranspiration leenhardt et al 1994 and thus affecting the crop yield doorenbos and kassam 1979 meanwhile the distribution of brel shows that the soil fertility is generally low in some areas of the upstream part and in most of the downstream area which restrains the growth of the canopy and the improvement of the yield of seed maize affected by the soil texture and soil fertility the yield 8 9 103 kg ha and water use efficiency mainly 1 7 1 8 kg m3 are relatively low in the upstream area similarly affected by the low irrigation and soil fertility the yield and water use efficiency are generally low in the downstream area the conditions of irrigation and soil fertility for the middle reach are appropriate providing a good growing environment for crops thus the yield and water use efficiency are relatively high many experiments have shown that reasonable application of fertilizer can improve soil water preservation and inhibit evaporation thereby increasing the water use efficiency and crop yield 3 3 sensitivity analysis scenario predictions have been conducted based on the effects of ccx and brel on the yield and water use efficiency brel in the simulation scenarios is set as 50 60 70 80 and 90 and to make the simulation curve continuous the value of ccx is set in specific intervals corresponding to each brel each operation of the model can change only one of the variables to verify the sensitivity to the two parameters as mentioned previously the simulation results are shown in fig 10 a and b fig 10 a and 10 b illustrate that the effect of brel on the yield and water use efficiency is relatively significant in particular when brel changes between 50 and 80 both of the indices increase along with increasing brel similar to the findings of akumaga et al 2017 as brel continues to increase the crop yield and water use efficiency will no longer be sensitive to this parameter by combining these relationships we determine that when the amount of fertilizer is increased in a reasonable range the crop yield and water use efficiency will increase but when a certain extent is reached the increase will no longer continue significantly this finding shows that ccx has no significant effect on the crop yield fig 10 a however a negative effect on water use efficiency was observed when ccx varies between 50 and 70 fig 10 b which indicates that the excessive growth of crop canopy is not good for increasing the yield and water use efficiency thus the supply of water and fertilizer should be controlled reasonably in the process of crop growth to achieve the optimal coupling of water and fertilizer 4 conclusion in this study two key parameters i e ccx and brel in the aquacrop model are spatially derived by remote sensing and on this basis a regional aquacrop rs model is established affected by variety characteristics management and soil texture the spatial distribution of ccx of seed maize in the irrigated area is significantly different with cv of 8 and 8 5 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the same as the spatial distribution of brel for human activities and soil texture with cv of 6 3 and 4 6 which indicates different degrees of soil fertility stress in the irrigated area compared with the aquacrop gis model the aquacrop rs model generally performs better in improving the regional simulation accuracy for crop water consumption by 20 and for yield by 26 36 thus introducing the spatial crop parameters ccx and brel into the aquacrop model is the foundation for the application of the model to the regional scale achieving the optimal coupling of water and fertilizer through the appropriate adjustment of fertilizer and irrigation scheduling is a promising approach to improve crop productivity benefits declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

10518,the number of fertigation splits through center pivot irrigation system is a major concern for implementing sprinkler fertigation due to the possible losses caused by drift and volatilization field experiments were conducted at two sites of the semi arid regions in the north china plain with different soil fertilities to investigate the influence of the number of fertigation splits and the nitrogen applied on the nitrogen content yield and nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat in the 2018 and 2019 seasons in the experiments one n1 two n2 and three fertigation splits n3 in season based on soil nmin method was used a treatment without in season fertilization ck1 and a treatment with local fertilizer management method ck2 were applied as control similar amounts of basal fertilizers and irrigation schedules were applied for all treatments in the two year study both the nitrogen applied and sprinkler fertigation splits had significant influence on nitrogen content in winter wheat grain and these effects varied with the changes of soil fertility at the beijing site of low soil fertility the significantly great yield was obtained in the in season n management treatments and the yield increased with the increasing of fertigation splits the average yield in n3 treatment in both seasons was 32 5 and 15 1 higher than that in ck1 and ck2 treatments respectively at the hebei site where inherent soil fertility was higher than that at the beijing site there was no significant differences in yield among all treatments and the maximum yield within in season n management treatments was obtained in n3 and n2 treatment in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively in both sites and seasons the maximum partial factor productivity from applied n pfpn was obtained in ck1 treatment the average pfpn in in season n management treatments was 29 5 and 71 7 higher than that in ck2 treatment at the beijing and hebei site respectively more frequent fertigation was recommended for soils with low inherent fertility level keywords center pivot fertigation nitrogen use efficiency splits yield 1 introduction as a subset and the most widely used form of chemigation the basic idea of applying commercial fertilizer through a sprinkler irrigation system fertigation was studied by bryan and thomas 1958 more than sixty years ago the development of chemigation especially through continuously moving lateral sprinkler irrigation system peaked during the 1970 s and 1980 s in 1983 84 of the total chemigated area in the u s was chemigated with sprinkler systems thereinto 33 5 of the sprinkler irrigated area was practiced with fertigation and the remaining area was applied with herbicide and pesticide threadgill 1985 while at present fertigation is generally used in drip irrigation systems and to a lesser extent in full coverage sprinkler systems and irrigation machines in the world villalobos et al 2016 one of the main reasons is because the application of nutrients through overhead irrigation systems is another form of broadcast application and localized applications of fertilizers have emerged as alternatives to broadcast applications across the entire field surface for economic environmental and technological reasons simonne et al 2017 the additional problem may be the drift and volatilization during and subsequent to chemigation kohl et al 1987 and the landing of chemicals on the canopies of plant if the improper chemical concentrations are used there is the risk to cause extensive foliar damage or death of the entire plant just like sprinkler irrigation with reuse or saline waters benes et al 1996 jordan et al 2001 waller and yitayew 2016 compared with the drip irrigation system which can only be successfully used for chemigation of soil applied chemicals sprinkler irrigation system accommodates both soil and foliar applied chemicals when the irrigation and chemigation system are properly installed and operated and when the proper chemical chemical formulation and water application rate are used the sprinkler chemigation is an effective crop production management tool threadgill 1985 asadi et al 2002 li et al 2005 in the drip irrigation system high fertigation frequency is often recommended as it maintains a stable soil moisture and nutrient concentration in the root zone to better match crop demand abdelraouf and ragab 2018 for sprinkler fertigation high fertigation frequency will undoubtedly decrease the nutrient use efficiency due to drift and volatilization losses during the process of sprinkler fertigation if a negligible nutrient absorption from the fertilizer solution intercepted by canopy was assumed therefore the high fertigation frequency is not always suitable for sprinkler irrigation system and the number of fertigation splits will be one of the main factors affecting the nutrient use efficiency of sprinkler fertigation to improve the nutrient use efficiency the effective fertigation requires calculation of nutrient requirements based on plant requirements and soil nutrients granberry et al 2001 for a given crop the fertilizer application amount depends on soil conditions the aim of the current study was to explore the effect of sprinkler fertigation splits and nitrogen applied on the nitrogen uptake yield and nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat grown at two sites in the north china plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field study was conducted during two growing seasons of winter wheat from october 2017 to june 2018 referred to as the 2018 season and from october 2018 to june 2019 referred to as the 2019 season at two sites in the north china plain one site located at the experimental station of the national center for efficient irrigation engineering and technology research in beijing 39 39 n and 116 15 e referred to as the beijing site and the other site located at the management area of dacaozhuang in hebei province 37 30 n and 114 52 e referred to as the hebei site the beijing site experiences a warm and semi humid continental monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 11 6 c and an annual mean rainfall of 556 mm more than 70 of the rainfall occurs between july and september one 0 19 ha quadrant of the center pivot was selected as the experimental plot it was controlled by a variable rate center pivot irrigation system developed by the china institute of water resources and hydropower research zhao et al 2017 retrofitted from a single span with an overhang center pivot irrigation system seventeen nelson d3000 non rotating sprayers with nozzle no ranging from 9 42 were installed along the span and the overhang with a spacing of 2 92 m no end gun was used on the machine a diaphragm pump was installed ahead of this irrigation system to supply a constant fertilizer dosages during a fertigation event the experimental soil was silt loam according to the usda texture scheme shirazi and boersma 1984 and it comprised of 31 sand 56 silt and 13 clay in the 0 60 cm soil profile the average bulk density in the profile measured using a 100 cm3 ring was 1 41 g cm3 and the average field capacity measured by in situ test was 0 33 cm3 cm3 prior to the 2018 season the nutrient availability in the top 20 cm of soil with a ph of 8 6 contained 5 4 g of organic matter per kg of soil 7 1 mg available phosphorus per kg of soil and 110 2 mg available potassium per kg of soil the hebei site about 350 km southwest of the beijing site was also located in the temperate monsoon climate zone and belonged to a semi humid region with hot rainy summers and cold dry winters like the beijing site the annual mean temperature was 13 0 and the annual mean precipitation was 501 mm the experimental plot was one 5 67 ha semicircle controlled by a four span 190 m long center pivot irrigation system with an overhang there were 76 nelson r3000 rotating sprayers in total installed along the span and the overhang but no end gun was installed the wetted radius of the irrigation system was 210 m a pistion pump was installed ahead of the center pivot irrigation system to ensure the sprinkler fertigation with constant fertilizer dosages the soil was silt clay loam comprised of 19 sand 62 silt and 19 clay in the 0 60 cm soil profile with a bulk density of 1 68 g cm3 a field capacity of 0 34 cm3 cm3 and a ph of 7 9 on average prior to the 2018 season the soil nutrient availability in the upper 20 cm was 19 8 g of organic matter per kg of soil 10 2 mg of available phosphorus per kg of soil and 113 7 mg of available potassium per kg of soil showing a better soil fertility than the beijing site 2 2 experimental design winter wheat triticum aestivium l zhong mai no 175 was selected as the experimental crop at the beijing site in the 2018 season winter wheat was seeded in a row spacing of 15 2 cm at a rate of 375 kg ha on 2 october in 2017 and harvested on 9 june in 2018 in the 2019 season winter wheat was seeded on 8 october in 2018 and harvested on 16 june in 2019 at the hebei site the winter wheat triticum aestivium l yingbo no 700 was seeded in a row spacing of 15 8 cm at a rate of 360 kg ha on 21 october in 2017 and on 11 october in 2018 and harvested on 14 june in both years double cropping of winter wheat and summer maize is a typical cropping pattern in both sites before the sowing of winter wheat the corn stalk was crushed and ploughing into top soil the amount of n fertilizers required was determined using in season n management based on a soil nmin method proposed by wehrmann and scharpf 1986 the n application rates for crops were calculated as the difference between the plant requirement and soil nutrient availability that was determined by soil tests for nitrate nitrogen no3 n from 0 60 cm soil depth prior to planting waller and yitayew 2016 the plant requirement was calculated based on the target yield cui et al 2008 before the sowing of winter wheat both the nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n in the 0 60 cm soil layers were tested with air dried soil samples using an autoanalyzer iii bran luebbe norderstedt germany at the beijing site the average no3 n and nh4 n content was 9 7 and 1 5 mg kg in the 2018 season and was 5 2 and 4 0 mg kg in the 2019 season respectively greater mineral nitrogen content in soil was found at the hebei site where the average no3 n and nh4 n content was 12 5 and 4 3 mg kg in the 2018 season and was 26 2 and 1 3 mg kg in the 2019 season respectively at the beijing site the target yield of winter wheat was determined as 8 25 t ha based on the local average maximum production level and the n requirement was 285 kg ha according to nitrogen uptake per kilogram grain yield reported by zhang 2011 in the north china plain at the hebei site the target yield and nitrogen requirement similar to the beijing site were used in the 2018 season while in the 2019 season the target yield was set to its local maximum historic production level 9 70 t ha and the n requirement was 355 kg ha considering its ample soil nitrogen availability consequently the amount of n application based on nmin analysis was 204 9 and 241 2 kg ha at the beijing site and 159 0 and 90 4 kg ha at the hebei site in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively table 1 thereinto about 23 33 n and all the phosphorous and potassium were applied into the top 20 cm soil as basal fertilizers before sowing for all treatments the type of basal fertilizer selected was compound fertilizer with n p2o5 k2o content of 15 15 15 at the beijing site and 15 39 8 at the heibei site the remaining n was applied through sprinkler fertigation in season and three fertigation split levels of one referred to as n1 two referred to as n2 and three referred to as n3 were evaluated in the experiments the type of n fertilizer used was urea 46 n in the n1 treatment all of the urea fertilizer was applied in the seedling stage the application rates in the n2 and n3 treatments were determined according to the fertilizer requirement patterns of winter wheat reported by the institute of soil fertilizer chinese academy of agricultural sciences 1994 the n pattern during the growth stages of seedling jointing and filling was 1 9 5 7 2 4 namely the urea fertilizer was applied with ratio of 1 9 8 1 in the seedling and jointing stages in the n2 treatment and the ratio was 1 9 5 7 2 4 in the seedling jointing and filling stages in the n3 treatment in order to evaluate the effect of sprinkler fertigation based on in season n management two control treatments were set up one was the treatment without additional n application in season except for the basal fertilizer referred to as ck1 and the other was the local n management method with 280 and 190 kg ha applied in total referred to as ck2 at the beijing and hebei site respectively in the ck2 treatment subtracting a basal n similar to the n1 n2 and n3 treatment the remaining n was applied during jointing stage at the beijing site and during seedling stage at the hebei site table 1 at the beijing site the experimental design resulted in five treatments n1 n2 n3 ck1 and ck2 three replicates were used for each treatment the experimental plot was therefore divided into 15 subplots and the treatments were randomly distributed fig 1 a at the hebei site an additional control treatment ck3 was generated aiming at full using ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n in soil for this treatment the amount of n applied was determined to be 115 6 and 76 9 kg ha in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively table 1 these rates were 74 1 115 1 kg ha less than the ck2 consequently 18 subplots with six treatments of n1 n2 n3 ck1 ck2 and ck3 were randomly distributed in the experimental plot fig 1b similar irrigation schedules were used for all treatments during both seasons to guarantee the emergence and to prevent cold injury of winter wheat a germination and an overwintering irrigations were applied during the irrigation season a tdr trime tube system trime t3 imko ltd ettlingen germany was used to measure the soil water content to a depth of 100 cm at 20 cm increments every seven to ten days and the average soil water content in 80 cm depth was used to calculate the irrigation amount to refill the soil water content to 75 of field capacity guo 1997 at the beijing site one access tube was positioned approximately in the center of each subplot while two access tubes were installed in each subplot at the hebei site the mean soil water content was approximately represented by 15 measurement locations at the beijing site and by 36 locations at the hebei site the irrigation was ceased about 15 days before harvest to guarantee the maturation on time when a scheduled sprinkler fertigation event at the beginning of seedling jointing and filling stages of winter wheat was conducted table 1 the urea fertilizer was fertigated with 20 mm water no additional water was applied to wash the urea intercepted by the canopy and no visible leaf burning was detected during the growing seasons of winter wheat the same amount of water was applied in the treatments without fertigation to obtain similar soil moisture conditions for all treatments 2 3 data collection and analysis for each subplot two sampling locations at the beijing site and three sampling locations at the hebei site were selected at each location seven rows of winter wheat of 1 m length 1 1 m2 were harvested we have noticed that the arc length for each subplot along the lateral travel direction at the beijing site was short relative to the wetted radius of the sprayers about 2 m for the first sprayer with nozzle 9 especially for the innermost subplots to minimize the interactions between the adjacent subplots along the travel direction the sample locations were positioned along the central line of the truncated wedge shaped subplot and the wheat samples collected were manually threshed grain and straw above the ground were oven dried and the yields of grain were corrected to 13 moisture after the yield for each treatment was determined the partial factor productivity from applied n pfpn was calculated by dividing the yield by the total nitrogen fertilizer applied the pfpn values were reported in units of kg grain per kg n applied the nitrogen content in winter wheat grain and straw was determined on kjeldahl apparatus kjeltec 2300 denmark all data were analyzed using sas 8 01 sas institute inc cary n c one way analysis of variance anova was used to verify whether the n fertigation splits and application amount had a significant effect on yield pfpn and nitrogen content of winter wheat at a probability level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 total water received and soil water content the seasonal rainfall and cumulative irrigation water for each treatment in the 2018 and 2019 seasons are shown in fig 2 during the growing seasons the precipitation mainly concentrated on the stages from booting to filling at both sites at the beijing site the cumulative seasonal rainfall was 140 mm and the cumulative irrigation was 153 mm with seven irrigation events in the 2018 season in the 2019 season the obviously less cumulative rainfall 40 mm was received and the number of irrigation events increased greatly resulting in a seasonal irrigation of 255 mm an approximately similar water from irrigation and rainfall was received in two seasons and they were 293 and 295 mm in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively at the hebei site the long term average seasonal october to june rainfall was 152 mm the seasonal rainfall in 2018 227 mm was substantially higher than the long term average indicating a wet year there were five irrigation events and the cumulative application amount was 125 mm in the 2019 season there were 75 mm rainfall and 236 mm irrigation application the summation of rainfall and irrigation was 352 and 311 mm in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively the total water rainfall irrigation received is shown in fig 2 and the variations in soil water content at different depths during the irrigation seasons are shown in fig 3 for both sites the soil water content basically increased with the increasing soil depth and it had greater variations in the top 60 cm layers that were controlled by evapotranspiration precipitation and irrigation the temporal variability of precipitation between years and the irrigation management without soil water content measurement during the seedling stage resulted in varied seasonal patterns in soil water content during two years a lower soil water content at the beginning of irrigation season was observed in the 2018 season at the beijing site and in the 2019 season of the hebei site averagely the soil water content in the 80 cm profile varied between 60 and 75 of field capacity during the irrigation seasons generating a favorable environment of soil moisture to the growth of winter wheat guo 1997 3 2 nitrogen content in grain and straw of winter wheat the nitrogen content in winter wheat grain and straw for the 2018 and 2019 seasons at the beijing and hebei sites are shown in table 2 at the beijing site the nitrogen content in grain significantly increased with the increasing of n fertilizer applied for the ck1 nmin method n1 n2 and n3 and ck2 treatments the average grain nitrogen content was 2 30 2 44 and 2 59 for the 2018 season and was 2 57 2 62 and 2 77 for the 2019 season respectively for a given n fertilizer applied the grain nitrogen content basically decreased with the increasing of fertigation splits especially in the 2019 season a significant lower grain nitrogen content for n3 treatment than that for n2 treatment was observed in this season at the hebei site the significant differences in grain nitrogen content were also observed among treatments in the two seasons while no clear trend between the grain nitrogen content and the n fertilizer applied was found in the 2018 season the maximum grain nitrogen content was obtained in the nmin method treatments with an average value of 2 42 while the minimum value was obtained in ck2 treatment under the maximum n fertilizer amount at the 2019 season however the minimum value was obtained in ck1 treatment with the minimum n fertilizer applied for the treatments of n1 n2 and n3 with the same n fertilizer amount the nitrogen content in grain showed an increasing trend with the increasing of n fertigation splits although the difference was not statistically significant because of the transfer of nitrogen from straw to grain in the late growing stage of winter wheat the nitrogen content in straw 0 47 0 77 was considerably lower than that in grain 2 30 2 77 at the beijing site the nitrogen content in straw significantly increased with the increasing of n fertilizer applied and the maximum and minimum values were obtained in ck2 and ck1 treatments respectively these values were in agreement with the nitrogen content in grain for a given n fertilizer applied there was no significant influence of n fertigation splits on nitrogen content in straw at the hebei site there were no significant differences in straw nitrogen content among treatments in both years that may be due to the ample soil mineral nitrogen content 3 3 yield and straw mass of winter wheat the yield and straw mass of winter wheat for the 2018 and 2019 seasons are summarized in table 3 at the beijing site the maximum yield of 6 16 t ha was obtained in n3 treatment while the minimum yield 4 29 t ha was obtained in ck1 treatment the difference between the maximum and the minimum yield was significant for a given n fertilizer applied an increasing trend in yield with n fertigation splits was observed although there was no significant differences in yield among n1 n2 and n3 treatments for example an increment 0 94 t ha was observed when increasing the splits from one to two and a yield increment of 0 05 t ha was found when raising the splits from two to three for the ck2 treatment with maximum n fertilizer applied its yield 5 71 t ha was lower than n2 6 11 t ha and n3 6 16 t ha treatments while the difference was insignificant in the 2019 season the maximum yield 6 08 t ha was also obtained in n3 treatment and it was significantly higher than other treatments compared with the yield in the 2018 season the yield reduction in most treatments in the 2019 season might relate to lower soil water content during the seedling stage fig 3 which imposed negative influence on the wheat tillers at the hebei site no significant differences in yield among treatments were observed in both seasons table 3 for the treatments with n fertilizer amount determined by the soil nmin test the yield increased with the increasing of n fertigation splits in the 2018 season while the maximum yield was obtained in n2 treatment in the 2019 season compared with the 2019 season a great reduction in yield was observed in the 2018 season in was that the excess rainfall in the booting and filling stages fig 2 imposed a negative influence on dry matter cumulation in plant and grain leading to a reduction in straw mass and yield the analysis mentioned above indicated that the yields for ck2 treatment with the maximum n fertilizer applied were not significantly greater than that for n1 n2 and n3 treatments for both seasons at the two sites this confirmed again that the n fertilizer application recommended by in season n management was feasible to sprinkler fertigation gascho and hook 1991 comparing the yields between the beijing and the hebei sites leads one to find that the response of yield to nitrogen applied was related to the soil inherent fertility at the hebei site with a relatively high fertility level there was no significant difference in yield among all treatments for both seasons table 3 comparatively for the relatively low soil fertility of beijing site a general increasing trend of yield with increasing nitrogen applied was found it suggests that the increasing in yield with nitrogen applied is highly dependent on inherent fertility this results kept consistence with a finding proposed by wang et al 2003 who differentiated the contributions of basal and top dressed nitrogen fertilizers to winter wheat yield under different fertility soils using a 15n labeling technique for a given amount of n fertilizer determined by a soil nmin test the yield increased with fertigation splits especially at the beijing site of low soil fertility it indicated that a split fertigation was helpful to improve the yield of winter wheat because of the timely n supplement to soil and the canopy absorption to urea this result was comparable to that reported by cai et al 2018 who studied the influence of nitrogen application frequencies with sprinkler irrigation system on winter wheat yield under a local n fertilizer level their results indicated that there was a minor increment of yield when fertigation splits increased from three to four gascho and hook 1991 also reported that applying in four sprinkler fertigation events produced significantly greater yields of corn than the conventional fertilizer broadcasts at the 6 to 8 leaf stage the foliar absorption and avoiding possible undetected n losses from broadcasts was a contribution to yield increase on the other hand the yield in n3 treatment 8 69 t ha was lower than that in n1 8 77 t ha and n2 8 85 t ha treatments for the 2019 season at the hebei site this suggested that there exists a balance between n fertigation splits and its drift and volatilization losses to maximize yield with sprinkler fertigation balancing the n losses during the process event of sprinkler fertigation and its benefits generated by timely n supplement to soil and canopy deserves to be further studied 3 4 partial factor productivity from applied n the pfpn of winter wheat for the 2018 and 2019 seasons are shown in fig 4 at the beijing site the ck2 treatment obtained the minimum pfpn value of 20 4 and 17 6 kg kg in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively the maximum pfpn value of 76 3 and 88 1 kg kg was obtained in ck1 treatment and they were significantly higher than other treatments in both seasons for a given n fertilizer applied the pfpn shows a general increasing trend with the increasing of fertigation splits there were no significant differences in pfpn among n1 n2 and n3 treatments in the 2018 season while the pfpn in n3 treatment was significantly higher than that in n1 and n2 treatments in the 2019 season at the hebei site similar results were obtained in two seasons the pfpn decreased significantly with the increasing of n fertilizer applied the more obvious difference in pfpn caused by n fertilizer amount at the hebei site than at the beijing site demonstrated that the contribution of n fertilization to wheat yield in a low soil fertility field was greater than that in a high soil fertility field this result kept consistence with the results obtained in paddy fields zeng et al 2012 the pfpn in ck1 treatment was significantly higher than that in treatments with in season n management in both seasons of two sites especially at the hebei site of ample soil nitrogen availability for example the maximum difference in pfpn reached 256 6 kg kg this may suggest that the soil nmin method needs to be further improved to increase the pfpn of winter wheat for example when the ammonium nitrogen nh4 n in soil was considered to calculate the amount of n applied no significant differences in yield fig 4b were observed among ck3 and n1 n2 and n3 treatments while the n applied for ck3 decreased by 43 4 and 13 5 kg ha in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively a significant improvement in the pfpns in ck3 treatment were then noticed figure 5b on the other hand there was no significant difference in yield among ck1 and other treatments while ck1 treatment obtained the maximum pfpn this demonstrated that the net mineralization of nitrogen from crushing corn stalk would offer additional nitrogen for crop growth which should be considered in the improving of pfpn under different soil fertilities 4 conclusions to promote the extension of sprinkler fertigation through continuously moving type irrigation system the effects of n applied amount and fertigation splits on nitrogen uptake yield and pfpn of winter wheat was studied at beijing and hebei sites under different soil fertilities at the two sites the n fertilizer was determined based on nmin test with in season n management the following conclusions are supported by this study 1 influenced by soil inherent fertility the responses of nitrogen content and yield to nitrogen applied and fertigation splits varied at the two sites at the beijing site with low soil fertility the nitrogen content in grain and straw significantly increased with the increasing of nitrogen applied and the yield increased with the increasing of fertigation splits the significantly great yield was obtained in treatments with in season n management while at the hebei site with high soil fertility there was no significant differences in yield and in straw nitrogen content for all treatments these results demonstrated that the contribution of nitrogen applied and fertigation splits to wheat yield and nitrogen uptake in a low soil fertility field was greater than that in a high soil fertility field and more frequent fertigation could be recommended for soil with low inherent nitrogen availability 2 in both seasons of the two sites the maximum pfpn was observed in ck1 treatments and the pfpn in in season n management treatments was greater than in local n management treatments especially at the hebei site with high soil inherent fertility after considering both no3 n and nh4 n to determine the nitrogen requirement the significantly higher pfpn was obtained in ck3 treatment than in ck2 treatment these results indicated that the soil nmin method could be further improved declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that

10518,the number of fertigation splits through center pivot irrigation system is a major concern for implementing sprinkler fertigation due to the possible losses caused by drift and volatilization field experiments were conducted at two sites of the semi arid regions in the north china plain with different soil fertilities to investigate the influence of the number of fertigation splits and the nitrogen applied on the nitrogen content yield and nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat in the 2018 and 2019 seasons in the experiments one n1 two n2 and three fertigation splits n3 in season based on soil nmin method was used a treatment without in season fertilization ck1 and a treatment with local fertilizer management method ck2 were applied as control similar amounts of basal fertilizers and irrigation schedules were applied for all treatments in the two year study both the nitrogen applied and sprinkler fertigation splits had significant influence on nitrogen content in winter wheat grain and these effects varied with the changes of soil fertility at the beijing site of low soil fertility the significantly great yield was obtained in the in season n management treatments and the yield increased with the increasing of fertigation splits the average yield in n3 treatment in both seasons was 32 5 and 15 1 higher than that in ck1 and ck2 treatments respectively at the hebei site where inherent soil fertility was higher than that at the beijing site there was no significant differences in yield among all treatments and the maximum yield within in season n management treatments was obtained in n3 and n2 treatment in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively in both sites and seasons the maximum partial factor productivity from applied n pfpn was obtained in ck1 treatment the average pfpn in in season n management treatments was 29 5 and 71 7 higher than that in ck2 treatment at the beijing and hebei site respectively more frequent fertigation was recommended for soils with low inherent fertility level keywords center pivot fertigation nitrogen use efficiency splits yield 1 introduction as a subset and the most widely used form of chemigation the basic idea of applying commercial fertilizer through a sprinkler irrigation system fertigation was studied by bryan and thomas 1958 more than sixty years ago the development of chemigation especially through continuously moving lateral sprinkler irrigation system peaked during the 1970 s and 1980 s in 1983 84 of the total chemigated area in the u s was chemigated with sprinkler systems thereinto 33 5 of the sprinkler irrigated area was practiced with fertigation and the remaining area was applied with herbicide and pesticide threadgill 1985 while at present fertigation is generally used in drip irrigation systems and to a lesser extent in full coverage sprinkler systems and irrigation machines in the world villalobos et al 2016 one of the main reasons is because the application of nutrients through overhead irrigation systems is another form of broadcast application and localized applications of fertilizers have emerged as alternatives to broadcast applications across the entire field surface for economic environmental and technological reasons simonne et al 2017 the additional problem may be the drift and volatilization during and subsequent to chemigation kohl et al 1987 and the landing of chemicals on the canopies of plant if the improper chemical concentrations are used there is the risk to cause extensive foliar damage or death of the entire plant just like sprinkler irrigation with reuse or saline waters benes et al 1996 jordan et al 2001 waller and yitayew 2016 compared with the drip irrigation system which can only be successfully used for chemigation of soil applied chemicals sprinkler irrigation system accommodates both soil and foliar applied chemicals when the irrigation and chemigation system are properly installed and operated and when the proper chemical chemical formulation and water application rate are used the sprinkler chemigation is an effective crop production management tool threadgill 1985 asadi et al 2002 li et al 2005 in the drip irrigation system high fertigation frequency is often recommended as it maintains a stable soil moisture and nutrient concentration in the root zone to better match crop demand abdelraouf and ragab 2018 for sprinkler fertigation high fertigation frequency will undoubtedly decrease the nutrient use efficiency due to drift and volatilization losses during the process of sprinkler fertigation if a negligible nutrient absorption from the fertilizer solution intercepted by canopy was assumed therefore the high fertigation frequency is not always suitable for sprinkler irrigation system and the number of fertigation splits will be one of the main factors affecting the nutrient use efficiency of sprinkler fertigation to improve the nutrient use efficiency the effective fertigation requires calculation of nutrient requirements based on plant requirements and soil nutrients granberry et al 2001 for a given crop the fertilizer application amount depends on soil conditions the aim of the current study was to explore the effect of sprinkler fertigation splits and nitrogen applied on the nitrogen uptake yield and nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat grown at two sites in the north china plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field study was conducted during two growing seasons of winter wheat from october 2017 to june 2018 referred to as the 2018 season and from october 2018 to june 2019 referred to as the 2019 season at two sites in the north china plain one site located at the experimental station of the national center for efficient irrigation engineering and technology research in beijing 39 39 n and 116 15 e referred to as the beijing site and the other site located at the management area of dacaozhuang in hebei province 37 30 n and 114 52 e referred to as the hebei site the beijing site experiences a warm and semi humid continental monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 11 6 c and an annual mean rainfall of 556 mm more than 70 of the rainfall occurs between july and september one 0 19 ha quadrant of the center pivot was selected as the experimental plot it was controlled by a variable rate center pivot irrigation system developed by the china institute of water resources and hydropower research zhao et al 2017 retrofitted from a single span with an overhang center pivot irrigation system seventeen nelson d3000 non rotating sprayers with nozzle no ranging from 9 42 were installed along the span and the overhang with a spacing of 2 92 m no end gun was used on the machine a diaphragm pump was installed ahead of this irrigation system to supply a constant fertilizer dosages during a fertigation event the experimental soil was silt loam according to the usda texture scheme shirazi and boersma 1984 and it comprised of 31 sand 56 silt and 13 clay in the 0 60 cm soil profile the average bulk density in the profile measured using a 100 cm3 ring was 1 41 g cm3 and the average field capacity measured by in situ test was 0 33 cm3 cm3 prior to the 2018 season the nutrient availability in the top 20 cm of soil with a ph of 8 6 contained 5 4 g of organic matter per kg of soil 7 1 mg available phosphorus per kg of soil and 110 2 mg available potassium per kg of soil the hebei site about 350 km southwest of the beijing site was also located in the temperate monsoon climate zone and belonged to a semi humid region with hot rainy summers and cold dry winters like the beijing site the annual mean temperature was 13 0 and the annual mean precipitation was 501 mm the experimental plot was one 5 67 ha semicircle controlled by a four span 190 m long center pivot irrigation system with an overhang there were 76 nelson r3000 rotating sprayers in total installed along the span and the overhang but no end gun was installed the wetted radius of the irrigation system was 210 m a pistion pump was installed ahead of the center pivot irrigation system to ensure the sprinkler fertigation with constant fertilizer dosages the soil was silt clay loam comprised of 19 sand 62 silt and 19 clay in the 0 60 cm soil profile with a bulk density of 1 68 g cm3 a field capacity of 0 34 cm3 cm3 and a ph of 7 9 on average prior to the 2018 season the soil nutrient availability in the upper 20 cm was 19 8 g of organic matter per kg of soil 10 2 mg of available phosphorus per kg of soil and 113 7 mg of available potassium per kg of soil showing a better soil fertility than the beijing site 2 2 experimental design winter wheat triticum aestivium l zhong mai no 175 was selected as the experimental crop at the beijing site in the 2018 season winter wheat was seeded in a row spacing of 15 2 cm at a rate of 375 kg ha on 2 october in 2017 and harvested on 9 june in 2018 in the 2019 season winter wheat was seeded on 8 october in 2018 and harvested on 16 june in 2019 at the hebei site the winter wheat triticum aestivium l yingbo no 700 was seeded in a row spacing of 15 8 cm at a rate of 360 kg ha on 21 october in 2017 and on 11 october in 2018 and harvested on 14 june in both years double cropping of winter wheat and summer maize is a typical cropping pattern in both sites before the sowing of winter wheat the corn stalk was crushed and ploughing into top soil the amount of n fertilizers required was determined using in season n management based on a soil nmin method proposed by wehrmann and scharpf 1986 the n application rates for crops were calculated as the difference between the plant requirement and soil nutrient availability that was determined by soil tests for nitrate nitrogen no3 n from 0 60 cm soil depth prior to planting waller and yitayew 2016 the plant requirement was calculated based on the target yield cui et al 2008 before the sowing of winter wheat both the nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n in the 0 60 cm soil layers were tested with air dried soil samples using an autoanalyzer iii bran luebbe norderstedt germany at the beijing site the average no3 n and nh4 n content was 9 7 and 1 5 mg kg in the 2018 season and was 5 2 and 4 0 mg kg in the 2019 season respectively greater mineral nitrogen content in soil was found at the hebei site where the average no3 n and nh4 n content was 12 5 and 4 3 mg kg in the 2018 season and was 26 2 and 1 3 mg kg in the 2019 season respectively at the beijing site the target yield of winter wheat was determined as 8 25 t ha based on the local average maximum production level and the n requirement was 285 kg ha according to nitrogen uptake per kilogram grain yield reported by zhang 2011 in the north china plain at the hebei site the target yield and nitrogen requirement similar to the beijing site were used in the 2018 season while in the 2019 season the target yield was set to its local maximum historic production level 9 70 t ha and the n requirement was 355 kg ha considering its ample soil nitrogen availability consequently the amount of n application based on nmin analysis was 204 9 and 241 2 kg ha at the beijing site and 159 0 and 90 4 kg ha at the hebei site in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively table 1 thereinto about 23 33 n and all the phosphorous and potassium were applied into the top 20 cm soil as basal fertilizers before sowing for all treatments the type of basal fertilizer selected was compound fertilizer with n p2o5 k2o content of 15 15 15 at the beijing site and 15 39 8 at the heibei site the remaining n was applied through sprinkler fertigation in season and three fertigation split levels of one referred to as n1 two referred to as n2 and three referred to as n3 were evaluated in the experiments the type of n fertilizer used was urea 46 n in the n1 treatment all of the urea fertilizer was applied in the seedling stage the application rates in the n2 and n3 treatments were determined according to the fertilizer requirement patterns of winter wheat reported by the institute of soil fertilizer chinese academy of agricultural sciences 1994 the n pattern during the growth stages of seedling jointing and filling was 1 9 5 7 2 4 namely the urea fertilizer was applied with ratio of 1 9 8 1 in the seedling and jointing stages in the n2 treatment and the ratio was 1 9 5 7 2 4 in the seedling jointing and filling stages in the n3 treatment in order to evaluate the effect of sprinkler fertigation based on in season n management two control treatments were set up one was the treatment without additional n application in season except for the basal fertilizer referred to as ck1 and the other was the local n management method with 280 and 190 kg ha applied in total referred to as ck2 at the beijing and hebei site respectively in the ck2 treatment subtracting a basal n similar to the n1 n2 and n3 treatment the remaining n was applied during jointing stage at the beijing site and during seedling stage at the hebei site table 1 at the beijing site the experimental design resulted in five treatments n1 n2 n3 ck1 and ck2 three replicates were used for each treatment the experimental plot was therefore divided into 15 subplots and the treatments were randomly distributed fig 1 a at the hebei site an additional control treatment ck3 was generated aiming at full using ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n in soil for this treatment the amount of n applied was determined to be 115 6 and 76 9 kg ha in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively table 1 these rates were 74 1 115 1 kg ha less than the ck2 consequently 18 subplots with six treatments of n1 n2 n3 ck1 ck2 and ck3 were randomly distributed in the experimental plot fig 1b similar irrigation schedules were used for all treatments during both seasons to guarantee the emergence and to prevent cold injury of winter wheat a germination and an overwintering irrigations were applied during the irrigation season a tdr trime tube system trime t3 imko ltd ettlingen germany was used to measure the soil water content to a depth of 100 cm at 20 cm increments every seven to ten days and the average soil water content in 80 cm depth was used to calculate the irrigation amount to refill the soil water content to 75 of field capacity guo 1997 at the beijing site one access tube was positioned approximately in the center of each subplot while two access tubes were installed in each subplot at the hebei site the mean soil water content was approximately represented by 15 measurement locations at the beijing site and by 36 locations at the hebei site the irrigation was ceased about 15 days before harvest to guarantee the maturation on time when a scheduled sprinkler fertigation event at the beginning of seedling jointing and filling stages of winter wheat was conducted table 1 the urea fertilizer was fertigated with 20 mm water no additional water was applied to wash the urea intercepted by the canopy and no visible leaf burning was detected during the growing seasons of winter wheat the same amount of water was applied in the treatments without fertigation to obtain similar soil moisture conditions for all treatments 2 3 data collection and analysis for each subplot two sampling locations at the beijing site and three sampling locations at the hebei site were selected at each location seven rows of winter wheat of 1 m length 1 1 m2 were harvested we have noticed that the arc length for each subplot along the lateral travel direction at the beijing site was short relative to the wetted radius of the sprayers about 2 m for the first sprayer with nozzle 9 especially for the innermost subplots to minimize the interactions between the adjacent subplots along the travel direction the sample locations were positioned along the central line of the truncated wedge shaped subplot and the wheat samples collected were manually threshed grain and straw above the ground were oven dried and the yields of grain were corrected to 13 moisture after the yield for each treatment was determined the partial factor productivity from applied n pfpn was calculated by dividing the yield by the total nitrogen fertilizer applied the pfpn values were reported in units of kg grain per kg n applied the nitrogen content in winter wheat grain and straw was determined on kjeldahl apparatus kjeltec 2300 denmark all data were analyzed using sas 8 01 sas institute inc cary n c one way analysis of variance anova was used to verify whether the n fertigation splits and application amount had a significant effect on yield pfpn and nitrogen content of winter wheat at a probability level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 total water received and soil water content the seasonal rainfall and cumulative irrigation water for each treatment in the 2018 and 2019 seasons are shown in fig 2 during the growing seasons the precipitation mainly concentrated on the stages from booting to filling at both sites at the beijing site the cumulative seasonal rainfall was 140 mm and the cumulative irrigation was 153 mm with seven irrigation events in the 2018 season in the 2019 season the obviously less cumulative rainfall 40 mm was received and the number of irrigation events increased greatly resulting in a seasonal irrigation of 255 mm an approximately similar water from irrigation and rainfall was received in two seasons and they were 293 and 295 mm in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively at the hebei site the long term average seasonal october to june rainfall was 152 mm the seasonal rainfall in 2018 227 mm was substantially higher than the long term average indicating a wet year there were five irrigation events and the cumulative application amount was 125 mm in the 2019 season there were 75 mm rainfall and 236 mm irrigation application the summation of rainfall and irrigation was 352 and 311 mm in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively the total water rainfall irrigation received is shown in fig 2 and the variations in soil water content at different depths during the irrigation seasons are shown in fig 3 for both sites the soil water content basically increased with the increasing soil depth and it had greater variations in the top 60 cm layers that were controlled by evapotranspiration precipitation and irrigation the temporal variability of precipitation between years and the irrigation management without soil water content measurement during the seedling stage resulted in varied seasonal patterns in soil water content during two years a lower soil water content at the beginning of irrigation season was observed in the 2018 season at the beijing site and in the 2019 season of the hebei site averagely the soil water content in the 80 cm profile varied between 60 and 75 of field capacity during the irrigation seasons generating a favorable environment of soil moisture to the growth of winter wheat guo 1997 3 2 nitrogen content in grain and straw of winter wheat the nitrogen content in winter wheat grain and straw for the 2018 and 2019 seasons at the beijing and hebei sites are shown in table 2 at the beijing site the nitrogen content in grain significantly increased with the increasing of n fertilizer applied for the ck1 nmin method n1 n2 and n3 and ck2 treatments the average grain nitrogen content was 2 30 2 44 and 2 59 for the 2018 season and was 2 57 2 62 and 2 77 for the 2019 season respectively for a given n fertilizer applied the grain nitrogen content basically decreased with the increasing of fertigation splits especially in the 2019 season a significant lower grain nitrogen content for n3 treatment than that for n2 treatment was observed in this season at the hebei site the significant differences in grain nitrogen content were also observed among treatments in the two seasons while no clear trend between the grain nitrogen content and the n fertilizer applied was found in the 2018 season the maximum grain nitrogen content was obtained in the nmin method treatments with an average value of 2 42 while the minimum value was obtained in ck2 treatment under the maximum n fertilizer amount at the 2019 season however the minimum value was obtained in ck1 treatment with the minimum n fertilizer applied for the treatments of n1 n2 and n3 with the same n fertilizer amount the nitrogen content in grain showed an increasing trend with the increasing of n fertigation splits although the difference was not statistically significant because of the transfer of nitrogen from straw to grain in the late growing stage of winter wheat the nitrogen content in straw 0 47 0 77 was considerably lower than that in grain 2 30 2 77 at the beijing site the nitrogen content in straw significantly increased with the increasing of n fertilizer applied and the maximum and minimum values were obtained in ck2 and ck1 treatments respectively these values were in agreement with the nitrogen content in grain for a given n fertilizer applied there was no significant influence of n fertigation splits on nitrogen content in straw at the hebei site there were no significant differences in straw nitrogen content among treatments in both years that may be due to the ample soil mineral nitrogen content 3 3 yield and straw mass of winter wheat the yield and straw mass of winter wheat for the 2018 and 2019 seasons are summarized in table 3 at the beijing site the maximum yield of 6 16 t ha was obtained in n3 treatment while the minimum yield 4 29 t ha was obtained in ck1 treatment the difference between the maximum and the minimum yield was significant for a given n fertilizer applied an increasing trend in yield with n fertigation splits was observed although there was no significant differences in yield among n1 n2 and n3 treatments for example an increment 0 94 t ha was observed when increasing the splits from one to two and a yield increment of 0 05 t ha was found when raising the splits from two to three for the ck2 treatment with maximum n fertilizer applied its yield 5 71 t ha was lower than n2 6 11 t ha and n3 6 16 t ha treatments while the difference was insignificant in the 2019 season the maximum yield 6 08 t ha was also obtained in n3 treatment and it was significantly higher than other treatments compared with the yield in the 2018 season the yield reduction in most treatments in the 2019 season might relate to lower soil water content during the seedling stage fig 3 which imposed negative influence on the wheat tillers at the hebei site no significant differences in yield among treatments were observed in both seasons table 3 for the treatments with n fertilizer amount determined by the soil nmin test the yield increased with the increasing of n fertigation splits in the 2018 season while the maximum yield was obtained in n2 treatment in the 2019 season compared with the 2019 season a great reduction in yield was observed in the 2018 season in was that the excess rainfall in the booting and filling stages fig 2 imposed a negative influence on dry matter cumulation in plant and grain leading to a reduction in straw mass and yield the analysis mentioned above indicated that the yields for ck2 treatment with the maximum n fertilizer applied were not significantly greater than that for n1 n2 and n3 treatments for both seasons at the two sites this confirmed again that the n fertilizer application recommended by in season n management was feasible to sprinkler fertigation gascho and hook 1991 comparing the yields between the beijing and the hebei sites leads one to find that the response of yield to nitrogen applied was related to the soil inherent fertility at the hebei site with a relatively high fertility level there was no significant difference in yield among all treatments for both seasons table 3 comparatively for the relatively low soil fertility of beijing site a general increasing trend of yield with increasing nitrogen applied was found it suggests that the increasing in yield with nitrogen applied is highly dependent on inherent fertility this results kept consistence with a finding proposed by wang et al 2003 who differentiated the contributions of basal and top dressed nitrogen fertilizers to winter wheat yield under different fertility soils using a 15n labeling technique for a given amount of n fertilizer determined by a soil nmin test the yield increased with fertigation splits especially at the beijing site of low soil fertility it indicated that a split fertigation was helpful to improve the yield of winter wheat because of the timely n supplement to soil and the canopy absorption to urea this result was comparable to that reported by cai et al 2018 who studied the influence of nitrogen application frequencies with sprinkler irrigation system on winter wheat yield under a local n fertilizer level their results indicated that there was a minor increment of yield when fertigation splits increased from three to four gascho and hook 1991 also reported that applying in four sprinkler fertigation events produced significantly greater yields of corn than the conventional fertilizer broadcasts at the 6 to 8 leaf stage the foliar absorption and avoiding possible undetected n losses from broadcasts was a contribution to yield increase on the other hand the yield in n3 treatment 8 69 t ha was lower than that in n1 8 77 t ha and n2 8 85 t ha treatments for the 2019 season at the hebei site this suggested that there exists a balance between n fertigation splits and its drift and volatilization losses to maximize yield with sprinkler fertigation balancing the n losses during the process event of sprinkler fertigation and its benefits generated by timely n supplement to soil and canopy deserves to be further studied 3 4 partial factor productivity from applied n the pfpn of winter wheat for the 2018 and 2019 seasons are shown in fig 4 at the beijing site the ck2 treatment obtained the minimum pfpn value of 20 4 and 17 6 kg kg in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively the maximum pfpn value of 76 3 and 88 1 kg kg was obtained in ck1 treatment and they were significantly higher than other treatments in both seasons for a given n fertilizer applied the pfpn shows a general increasing trend with the increasing of fertigation splits there were no significant differences in pfpn among n1 n2 and n3 treatments in the 2018 season while the pfpn in n3 treatment was significantly higher than that in n1 and n2 treatments in the 2019 season at the hebei site similar results were obtained in two seasons the pfpn decreased significantly with the increasing of n fertilizer applied the more obvious difference in pfpn caused by n fertilizer amount at the hebei site than at the beijing site demonstrated that the contribution of n fertilization to wheat yield in a low soil fertility field was greater than that in a high soil fertility field this result kept consistence with the results obtained in paddy fields zeng et al 2012 the pfpn in ck1 treatment was significantly higher than that in treatments with in season n management in both seasons of two sites especially at the hebei site of ample soil nitrogen availability for example the maximum difference in pfpn reached 256 6 kg kg this may suggest that the soil nmin method needs to be further improved to increase the pfpn of winter wheat for example when the ammonium nitrogen nh4 n in soil was considered to calculate the amount of n applied no significant differences in yield fig 4b were observed among ck3 and n1 n2 and n3 treatments while the n applied for ck3 decreased by 43 4 and 13 5 kg ha in the 2018 and 2019 season respectively a significant improvement in the pfpns in ck3 treatment were then noticed figure 5b on the other hand there was no significant difference in yield among ck1 and other treatments while ck1 treatment obtained the maximum pfpn this demonstrated that the net mineralization of nitrogen from crushing corn stalk would offer additional nitrogen for crop growth which should be considered in the improving of pfpn under different soil fertilities 4 conclusions to promote the extension of sprinkler fertigation through continuously moving type irrigation system the effects of n applied amount and fertigation splits on nitrogen uptake yield and pfpn of winter wheat was studied at beijing and hebei sites under different soil fertilities at the two sites the n fertilizer was determined based on nmin test with in season n management the following conclusions are supported by this study 1 influenced by soil inherent fertility the responses of nitrogen content and yield to nitrogen applied and fertigation splits varied at the two sites at the beijing site with low soil fertility the nitrogen content in grain and straw significantly increased with the increasing of nitrogen applied and the yield increased with the increasing of fertigation splits the significantly great yield was obtained in treatments with in season n management while at the hebei site with high soil fertility there was no significant differences in yield and in straw nitrogen content for all treatments these results demonstrated that the contribution of nitrogen applied and fertigation splits to wheat yield and nitrogen uptake in a low soil fertility field was greater than that in a high soil fertility field and more frequent fertigation could be recommended for soil with low inherent nitrogen availability 2 in both seasons of the two sites the maximum pfpn was observed in ck1 treatments and the pfpn in in season n management treatments was greater than in local n management treatments especially at the hebei site with high soil inherent fertility after considering both no3 n and nh4 n to determine the nitrogen requirement the significantly higher pfpn was obtained in ck3 treatment than in ck2 treatment these results indicated that the soil nmin method could be further improved declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that

paper the system is an effective tool to promote soil and water conservation for sustainable development sustainable agricultural development yang and mei 2017 it is also an important work need to develop in sustainable agricultural development in the current besides soil erosion is one of the main disasters to agriculture in china which seriously restricts the sustainable agricultural development and economy khanal et al 2018 wen et al 2019 therefore it is a necessary strategic choice for the quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation obinna 2019 the new quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development based on multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation methods with incomplete information is presented in fig 1 based on analyzing the current situation of soil and water conservation in china the new quality evaluation system with the meaning of sustainable agriculture development was set up xu et al 2015 application the theory of incomplete information a set of indicators was defined to evaluate quality of soil and water conservation peng and han 2018 based on the consultation from relevant experts and some new achievements in recent studies this paper has construct a target system of accessing sustainable agriculture development in which contains 4 sub systems and 17 concrete targets the primary task is to identify the multiple resource attributes and strategy selections to develop the accurate scientific assessment indicators hierarchy and the evaluation method thus this paper builds a target system to evaluation of sustainable agriculture development and conducts empirical research with quantitative method 2 3 ecological environment most countries in the world are still confronted with many serious problems in sustainable agricultural development such as soil and water conservation ecological environment and imbalanced development if soil and water conservation continue to violate basic quality standards it will lead to tremendous influences on the ecological environment so the protection of ecological environment and biodiversity is the focal point of protection work for sustainable agricultural development protect and improve the ecological environment can ensure the quality of soil and water conservation while developing industry with great effort the city ecological environment meet the test and challenge in china in recent years various measures has been taken by chinese government to improve the ecological environment for sustainable agricultural development 2 4 economic development because protection work of economic development and ecological environment disjointed soil and water conservation is becoming a severe problem this phenomenon is not sustainable so we need to put more emphasis on the balance coordination and sustainability of economic development moreover the economic development depends on a number of factors such as utilization of precipitation resources ratio of sloping land to agricultural land and degree of sustainable development some of them do not accurately measure in numerical terms sustainable agricultural development is the foundations of china s economic development and national prosperity if chinese government can develop forest conservation grass protection and soil erosion control it might be a good example of how economic development and sustainable agricultural development can work together 2 5 social effect the implementing of social effect has a great impact on environmental benefits of soil and water conservation and it is the condition to the sustainable agricultural development and the effect of water conservation and ecological environmental protection is also great to social sustainable development engel coefficient degree of sustainable development and life expectancy should be coordinated and calibrated to ensure sustainable development society at the same time this paper point out that improving the reliability and accuracy of the new quality evaluation system is a tremendous task of promoting social progress sustainable agricultural development is also the foundation of legal effect and social progress so as to realize scientific development viewpoint 2 6 quality management as globalization becomes more prevalent a growing number of countries have adopted new quality management system to control and manage sustainable agricultural development strategy quality management system can satisfy assessment requirements with water environment quality grade qualified rate of farmland irrigation and qualified rate of water and soil quality to strengthen the quality management of sustainable agricultural development is a key to success when presenting our decision making model to the administrators and policy makers therefore we should be strict quality management system through the implementation process of soil and water conservation according to the technical route and assessment process of quality evaluation system the quality management methods are discussed in this paper 2 7 multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation methods with incomplete information the evaluation method based on induced ordered weighted averaging iowa operator is given under multiple attribute comprehensive information it is a new information aggregating operator which was widely used in many fields blanco mesa et al 2019 xian et al 2019 with regard to incomplete information problems a new iowa operator was proposed not for the multiple attributes but for the quality evaluation system zeng et al 2017 on the other hand according to the characteristics of the indexes set attribute value the iowa operator is extended to the variation coefficient operator yi et al 2018 by transforming the attribute value into the calculation and optimum of evaluation makers a new aggregation operator of iowa operator with variation coefficient is developed by combining the optimum value with the attribute weight xian et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 a comprehensive evaluation method is presented through introducing the concept of variation coefficient and adopting iowa operator to realize the order sorting of scheme under incomplete information both with expert weight and expert evaluation zhu et al 2019 this paper focused on multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation methods based on the iowa variation coefficient operator analyses every step of quality evaluation of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development by using the new method in this paper an iowa operator is firstly defined and an incomplete information scale for the comparison between two attributes is given the quality evaluation problem is described as multiple attribute weights with incomplete information and the iowa operator is proposed to provide solutions next the iowa operator for incomplete linguistic information is proposed for the quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation in this paper we assume that there are m regions and n evaluation indexes of quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development so i region and j evaluation index is expressed as xij where i 1 2 m and j 1 2 n a multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation problem with regions and evaluation indexes and the evaluation matrix is defined in table 1 step 1 data standardization processing in this paper linear proportional method is used to standardizing evaluation matrix so the negative indexes can be calculated in the following 1 x i j x i j m a x x i j j where i 1 2 m and j 1 2 n then the positive indexes can be calculated by using eq 2 in the following 2 x i j x i j m i n x i j j step 2 calculating average of quality evaluation system firstly the important role of calculating average in the quality evaluation system is explored in this paper we attempt to explore the overall pattern of quality level by using average values and variation coefficients the average values of quality evaluation system is calculated as 3 x j 1 m i 1 n x i j where j 1 2 n step 3 calculating standard deviation the multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation methods with incomplete information are used to calculating the standard deviation accurately according to the calculation of standard deviation the data structure of distribution trend is judged then sj is presented as standard deviation which can be calculated in the following 4 s j i 1 n x i j x j 2 m step 4 determining variation coefficient some kind of data analysis is usually expressed as the variation coefficient of a series of methods using these variation data we can focus on basic data analysis for each evaluation index 5 v j s j x j where vj is presented as variation coefficient of quality evaluation system step 5 determining weight of position vector we want to decompose the position vector into a sum of simpler position vectors which is shown as 6 s j l 1 j v l then the method of iowa operator was used to modify the weight vector of each index based on multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation methods with incomplete information which is calculated as 7 ω j s j s j 1 s n where j 1 2 n σ 1 2 j 1 2 l and satisfying the criteria of v σ l v σ l 1 in this paper the law of variation coefficient is adopted to confirm decision making model parameter the method is accurate and easy to calculate the weight of position vector to avoid influences caused by human factors step 6 establishing iowa operator focusing on fuzzy and stochastic characteristics of subjectivity of evaluators weights are described by iowa operator such desirable properties as monotonicity and commutativity of the new method is proposed in this paper then the incomplete information of the evaluation interval and value is integrated by utilizing the iowa operator and the decision problem to the weighted vector of the iowa operator is discussed and a normal formula of quality index for the comprehensive quality evaluation is obtained the new quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development is comprised of ecological environment v1 economic development v2 social effect v3 and quality management v4 the weights are described by iowa operator which is shown in the following 8 v 1 4 v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 this thesis defines more than 17 evaluating indexes of 3 layers framework on comprehensive quality evaluation of soil and water conservation the complete set of weighs is defined as i the over emphasis weighs of evaluation index is i1 the accordant to practice weighs of evaluation index is i2 and the solution to each of them could be expressed as a recurrence relation in the following 9 i i 1 i 2 where i 1 i 2 ϕ for all the evaluating indexes x k l i 2 the evaluating indexes before modifying are defined as w k l so the evaluating indexes after modified are presented in the following 10 w k l w k l x k l i 2 w k l 1 x k l i 1 w i j step 7 modifying weight of evaluating indexes once the index weight of determination model was set up the evaluating indexes are used to aggregate preference information by using iowa operator which is defined in the following 11 w j v j v 1 4 w 1 4 where j 1 2 3 4 step 8 calculating overall evaluation weight we can use iowa operator to compute every weight of aspects use variation coefficient to deal with the relativity between indexes moreover the mathematical expressions of overall evaluation weight for diverse quantitative indexes can be calculating as 12 y i j 1 n w j x i j where i 1 2 m though calculating the acceptable degree and optimal degree obtains the comprehensive evaluation value and determine the optimal plans 3 results the sustainable agricultural development and ecological protection is the basic guarantee in china the purpose of this article is to build a new quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development in zhejiang province of china in the prevention and control process of water and soil conservation stakeholders and different development levels are the key influencing factors in this case study taking water conservation of sustainable agricultural development for example we discuss the realizing approach of the quality evaluation system thus the hierarchical structure of quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development is shown in fig 2 from fig 2 the new quality evaluation system includes sub indicator of ecological environment v1 economic development v2 social effect v3 and quality management v4 the ecological environment s1 consists of four indexes as vegetation coverage x1 intensity of soil erosion x2 soil erosion area rate x3 and production potential realization rate x4 the economic development s2 consists of four indexes as utilization of precipitation resources x5 ratio of sloping land to agricultural land x6 per capita food x7 soil ratio of per capita income to local level x8 proportion of agricultural population x9 and degree of sustainable development x10 the social effect s3 consists of four indexes as engel coefficient x11 degree of sustainable development x12 and life expectancy x13 the quality management s4 consists of four indexes as water environment quality grade x14 qualified rate of farmland irrigation x15 cultivated land quality grade x16 and qualified rate of water and soil quality x17 because we aggregate data from many different regions our indexes are more informative than any individual region we cannot evaluate quantitatively the quality of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development because measurement of these indexes is not feasible with current data sources thus understanding how to use different sources of data and to apply them to quality evaluation system will become more important the current release of these indexes and their data sources represents the largest publicly available data resource from 8 regions of zhejiang province of china by 3 years from 2017 to 2019 which is shown as r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 r7 r8 in table 2 the index of intensity of soil erosion x2 often is measured in t km 2 a per capita food x7 measured in kilograms per year and life expectancy x13 measured in year the indexes of water environment quality grade x14 and cultivated land quality grade x16 are measured in scales of 1 10 the other indexes are measured in 100 point scales the input data sources are obtained from annual statistical reports and investigation methods of stratified sampling the summary statistics quality evaluation system of eight regions is shown in table 2 based on table 2 quality evaluation system to evaluate soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development includes positive indexes and negative indexes the quality indexes of soil erosion x2 soil erosion area rate x3 agricultural land x6 proportion of agricultural population x9 and engel coefficient x11 are negative indexes other quality indexes are positive indexes next the quality evaluation system is standardized for the eight regions from r1 to r8 which can reflect the situation of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development by using normalization equation of eqs 1 and 2 we gives out standard function to make its data dimensionless for every single index and the standardized data of eight regions is shown in table 3 then the average of quality evaluation system can be calculated by using equation of eq 3 based on eq 4 we can obtain standard deviation of distribution trend for 17 indicators next we try to solve this little puzzle by counting variable coefficient by using eq 5 in these extra computing steps in this study the selection of instance variables was used to represent computed intermediate and summary results the automatic meta analysis of calculating data can be performed by means of computer program a chance to discuss some features in design of 17 indexes for eight regions with respect to quality evaluation process and a summary of results is shown in table 4 based on eq 6 the weights of position vector of quality evaluation system can be separately calculated in the following v1 4 0 268 0 260 0 267 0 286 1 081 v5 10 0 285 0 071 0 062 0 108 0 253 0 042 0 821 v11 13 0 121 0 092 0 096 0 309 v14 17 0 231 0 037 0 236 0 034 0 538 these weights add up to rather large sums which is shown in the following s m v1 4 v5 10 v11 13 v14 17 1 081 0 822 0 309 0 538 2 749 based on eq 7 the weights vector of each index is achieved by using the method of iowa operator which is represented as shown below w1 4 1 081 2 749 0 393 w5 10 0 821 2 749 0 299 w11 13 0 309 2 749 0 112 w14 17 0 538 2 749 0 196 according to theoretical studies of iowa operator the weights of economic development v2 and quality management v4 belong to 0 15 0 30 0 15 0 35 0 15 0 25 and 0 15 0 35 therefore the weight of ecological environment v1 is 0 393 which is overestimated and the weight is modified as 0 30 moreover the weight of ecological environment v3 is 0 112 which is underestimated and the weight is modified as 0 15 so the ecological environment v1 and social effect v3 is calculated by using eq 10 on the other hand the modified weight of economic development v2 and quality management v4 can be calculated by using eq 11 the results appear as shown below w 1 4 1 081 2 749 0 300 w 5 10 0 299 1 0 15 0 3 0 299 0 196 0 332 w 11 13 0 196 1 0 15 0 3 0 299 0 196 0 150 w 14 17 0 196 1 0 15 0 3 0 299 0 196 0 218 in the next the normalized data of eight regions is shown in table 5 the weights of multiple evaluation criteria can be calculated by using eq 12 which are shown in table 6 then the weights for 17 evaluation indexes of quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development is shown in fig 3 based on the analysis of the data we provide computation and statistic scores of eight regions for quality evaluation system calculation result of this example is the following in table 7 finally the unorganized data is usually processed in some manner to make it easily readable for users as a graph the ranking results of eight regions are shown in fig 4 from fig 4 we get the sequence is r1 r4 r5 r6 r3 r2 r7 r8 and the experimental results were in accordance with the rank of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development by using the evaluation result we measured the quality levels of listed 8 regions of zhejiang province of china from ecological environment v1 economic development v2 social effect v3 and quality management v4 and made out the ranking for every region from every index the experimental results show that the new quality evaluation system for sustainable agricultural development is proved effective in enhancing the precision and speed for the decision makers the model and methods of quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation in this case study are also worthy to other areas in china 4 discussion 4 1 comparative analysis of ecological environment as the evaluation results are the subordinate degrees that belong to different grades respectively we might adopt a different quality strategy the score is 0155 to r7 0148 to r8 so r7 and r8 are among the worst performing regions ranking seventh and eighth out of 8 regions from the point view of system theory a new concept for improving the ecological environment is put forward for the two regions these measures include vegetation coverage x1 intensity of soil erosion x2 soil erosion area rate x3 and production potential realization rate x4 based on table 6 we can see that the ranking makes production potential realization rate the 5th in all the indicators while offers the best of four quality evaluation indicators the ranking results are shown in fig 5 to solve this unbalanced development problem region r7 and r8 might put forward the policy of priority for production potential realization rate and take a series of measures to develop ecological environment 4 2 comparative analysis of economic development the quality evaluation index of economic development includes six sub targets such as utilization of precipitation resources x5 ratio of sloping land to agricultural land x6 per capita food x7 soil ratio of per capita income to local level x8 proportion of agricultural population x9 and degree of sustainable development x10 region r7 is the best ranking which scores the maximum 0 273 which is shown in fig 6 so the pole management of region r7 is widely used in the economic development for other regions as a scientific and high efficient method of learning advantaged experience on the other hand it showed that the sub targets of x5 and x9 are the two former evaluation indexes based on their comprehensive score from table 6 in order to ensure economic development energetic efforts should be made to improve utilization of precipitation resources and actively reduce proportion of agricultural population for all regions 4 3 comparative analysis of social effect by selection of quality assessment indicator social effect degree constituted by three indicators in aspects of engel coefficient x11 degree of sustainable development x12 and life expectancy x13 was settled fig 7 shows the ranking results sorted this time by their scores then the average value of social effect for 8 regions is calculated as shown below a1 8 0 127 0 127 0 122 0 132 0 129 0 139 0 134 0 110 8 0 128 the result obtained shows clearly the comprehensive scores by this method not only are in line with the actual situation but also they are more balanced and reasonable and the social effect of eight regions has been astonishing largely because of rising output per farmer in sustainable agricultural development though it has also done well in social development and human progress 4 4 comparative analysis of quality management the quality management level has been continuously dropping in eight regions we see the results shown in fig 8 the trend could have serious consequences for region r8 whose quality control measures for soil and water conservation are continuing headaches for the local government compared the evaluated quality management with the iowa operator the scores were within 0 103 to 0 206 and consequently the maximum and minimum values are region r1 and r8 respectively four indexes as water environment quality grade x14 qualified rate of farmland irrigation x15 cultivated land quality grade x16 and qualified rate of water and soil quality x17 are discussed on how to enhance quality management for sustainable agricultural development as one of key techniques of quality control evaluation indicators of x14 and x16 are important and difficult to realize as well for quality managers 4 5 comprehensive analysis of the new quality evaluation system this new quality evaluation system contributes to reducing the error possibility of quality control measures according to the soil and water conservation and these measures should have a larger impact on sustainable agricultural development in china if the suspected quality evaluation system is valid details are recorded on the inaccurate report for audience and decision makers and it should result in a major loss for soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development so this new evaluation system when tightly coupled with change quality control leads to significant improvement in the work of soil and water conservation this new quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation is an effective tool for sustainable agricultural development in china 5 conclusions sustainable agricultural development has been an important direction for the future it is generally known that soil and water conservation is the inevitable requirement of sustainable agricultural development however lack of rational quality evaluation system is an outstanding problem what restricts the soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development in china thus the present situation and existing quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation was presented in this paper furthermore reasonable and accurate quality assessment of soil and water conservation will be the key to sustainable agricultural development but the traditional quality evaluation system method must analysis lots of information for all the indicators which refers to many influence factors and has a very complex process this paper provides a new evaluation criteria and principles for soil and water conservation according to the results of previous research the regional and national soil and water conservation monitoring network and quality evaluation system should provide basic guarantees for sustainable agricultural development moreover the accuracy and practicality of quantitative evaluation method is also very important to the quality evaluation system the scientific and reasonable quality evaluation methods are of important reference value for the prediction of decision support in the practice of soil and water conservation the new method of iowa operator based on multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation methods with incomplete information was presented to the quality evaluation system in this paper and the results of the case study show that the approved method have high veracity and efficiency in the quality evaluation process in future research we might try to expand the new quality evaluation system mixing with other comprehensive evaluation and statistical methods of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development declaration of competing

system soil and water conservation sustainable agricultural development induced ordered weighted averaging incomplete information 1 introduction environment protection and sustainable agricultural development are the main trend of international society at present the ones that no soil and water conservation no the sustainable agricultural development the efficient way of realizing sustainable agricultural development is the protective measures of water conservation zhang et al 2020 water and soil conservation facilities experimental sites trees and grass planted have good ecological protection and function of keeping water and soil abdul rahim et al 2018 the benefits to water conservation is the base and the core of the sustainable agricultural development choi et al 2017 thus how to realize the water conservation has become the preferential problem for sustainable agricultural development in china wang et al 2018 by the way of making soil and water conservation we can improve environment ecological protection and promote the sustainable agricultural development dagnachew et al 2020 it is also an efficient way for solving complex problems concerning resources and environment gehlot and kaur 2015 on the other hand shortage of water resources and soil erosion of fertilizer are important factors that restrict sustainable agricultural development rudic et al 2019 the seriously shortage of water resources and soil erosion is the first restrict factor for the sustainable agricultural development wolka et al 2018 yang and zhou 2017 many cases show that facilities and trees play a vital role in water and soil conservation asfaw and workineh 2019 di prima et al 2018 in order to develop agriculture sustainable and useful quality strategies the achievements management of water and soil conservation facilities and trees shall be strengthened in the future huang et al 2018 moreover the work of water and soil conservation consists of preventing soil erosion that caused by natural factors or human activities and comprehensive utilization of the resources mango et al 2017 therefore realizing sustainable agricultural development in china is one of problems that must be solved systematically based on investigation and study it is also of directive significance to this study by carrying out the quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agriculture development furthermore a scientific and reasonable quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation is one of the most efficient ways for sustainable agricultural development in china some unreasonable phenomena of quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation should influence economic and ecological coordination for sustainable agricultural development the new quality evaluation systems of soil and water conservation should be required to keep pace with sustainable agricultural development dymond et al 2017 wildemeersch et al 2015 firstly accurate evaluation results are the premise for realizing sustainable agricultural development todosi et al 2016 secondly the quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation is of great significance to soil and water loss control li et al 2019 sileshi et al 2019 the ultimate goal of quality evaluation system remains the sustainable agricultural development and livestock in areas affected by soil and water conservation mousavi et al 2020 then a good quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation will become an important component of the sustainable agricultural development in the future abouabdillah et al 2014 in addition it is the foundation and guarantee of accomplishing sustainable agricultural development wang 2014 based on incomplete information comprehensive evaluation method this paper demonstrates the quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development from theoretical and experimental analysis

evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development based on multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation methods with incomplete information is presented in fig 1 based on analyzing the current situation of soil and water conservation in china the new quality evaluation system with the meaning of sustainable agriculture development was set up xu et al 2015 application the theory of incomplete information a set of indicators was defined to evaluate quality of soil and water conservation peng and han 2018 based on the consultation from relevant experts and some new achievements in recent studies this paper has construct a target system of accessing sustainable agriculture development in which contains 4 sub systems and 17 concrete targets the primary task is to identify the multiple resource attributes and strategy selections to develop the accurate scientific assessment indicators hierarchy and the evaluation method thus this paper builds a target system to evaluation of sustainable agriculture development and conducts empirical research with quantitative method 2 3 ecological environment most countries in the world are still confronted with many serious problems in sustainable agricultural development such as soil and water conservation ecological environment and imbalanced development if soil and water conservation continue to violate basic quality standards it will lead to tremendous influences on the ecological environment so the protection of ecological environment and biodiversity is the focal point of protection work for sustainable agricultural development protect and improve the ecological environment can ensure the quality of soil and water conservation while developing industry with great effort the city ecological environment meet the test and challenge in china in recent years various measures has been taken by chinese government to improve the ecological environment for sustainable agricultural development 2 4 economic development because protection work of economic development and ecological environment disjointed soil and water conservation is becoming a severe problem this phenomenon is not sustainable so we need to put more emphasis on the balance coordination and sustainability of economic development moreover the economic development depends on a number of factors such as utilization of precipitation resources ratio of sloping land to agricultural land and degree of sustainable development some of them do not accurately measure in numerical terms sustainable agricultural development is the foundations of china s economic development and national prosperity if chinese government can develop forest conservation grass protection and soil erosion control it might be a good example of how economic development and sustainable agricultural development can work together 2 5 social effect the implementing of social effect has a great impact on environmental benefits of soil and water conservation and it is the condition to the sustainable agricultural development and the effect of water conservation and ecological environmental protection is also great to social sustainable development engel coefficient degree of sustainable development and life expectancy should be coordinated and calibrated to ensure sustainable development society at the same time this paper point out that improving the reliability and accuracy of the new quality evaluation system is a tremendous task of promoting social progress sustainable agricultural development is also the foundation of legal effect and social progress so as to realize scientific development viewpoint 2 6 quality management as globalization becomes more prevalent a growing number of countries have adopted new quality management system to control and manage sustainable agricultural development strategy quality management system can satisfy assessment requirements with water environment quality grade qualified rate of farmland irrigation and qualified rate of water and soil quality to strengthen the quality management of sustainable agricultural development is a key to success when presenting our decision making model to the administrators and policy makers therefore we should be strict quality management system through the implementation process of soil and water conservation according to the technical route and assessment process of quality evaluation system the quality management methods are discussed in this paper 2 7 multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation methods with incomplete information the evaluation method based on induced ordered weighted averaging iowa operator is given under multiple attribute comprehensive information it is a new information aggregating operator which was widely used in many fields blanco mesa et al 2019 xian et al 2019 with regard to incomplete information problems a new iowa operator was proposed not for the multiple attributes but for the quality evaluation system zeng et al 2017 on the other hand according to the characteristics of the indexes set attribute value the iowa operator is extended to the variation coefficient operator yi et al 2018 by transforming the attribute value into the calculation and optimum of evaluation makers a new aggregation operator of iowa operator with variation coefficient is developed by combining the optimum value with the attribute weight xian et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 a comprehensive evaluation method is presented through introducing the concept of variation coefficient and adopting iowa operator to realize the order sorting of scheme under incomplete information both with expert weight and expert evaluation zhu et al 2019 this paper focused on multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation methods based on the iowa variation coefficient operator analyses every step of quality evaluation of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development by using the new method in this paper an iowa operator is firstly defined and an incomplete information scale for the comparison between two attributes is given the quality evaluation problem is described as multiple attribute weights with incomplete information and the iowa operator is proposed to provide solutions next the iowa operator for incomplete linguistic information is proposed for the quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation in this paper we assume that there are m regions and n evaluation indexes of quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development so i region and j evaluation index is expressed as xij where i 1 2 m and j 1 2 n a multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation problem with regions and evaluation indexes and the evaluation matrix is defined in table 1 step 1 data standardization processing in this paper linear proportional method is used to standardizing evaluation matrix so the negative indexes can be calculated in the following 1 x i j x i j m a x x i j j where i 1 2 m and j 1 2 n then the positive indexes can be calculated by using eq 2 in the following 2 x i j x i j m i n x i j j step 2 calculating average of quality evaluation system firstly the important role of calculating average in the quality evaluation system is explored in this paper we attempt to explore the overall pattern of quality level by using average values and variation coefficients the average values of quality evaluation system is calculated as 3 x j 1 m i 1 n x i j where j 1 2 n step 3 calculating standard deviation the multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation methods with incomplete information are used to calculating the standard deviation accurately according to the calculation of standard deviation the data structure of distribution trend is judged then sj is presented as standard deviation which can be calculated in the following 4 s j i 1 n x i j x j 2 m step 4 determining variation coefficient some kind of data analysis is usually expressed as the variation coefficient of a series of methods using these variation data we can focus on basic data analysis for each evaluation index 5 v j s j x j where vj is presented as variation coefficient of quality evaluation system step 5 determining weight of position vector we want to decompose the position vector into a sum of simpler position vectors which is shown as 6 s j l 1 j v l then the method of iowa operator was used to modify the weight vector of each index based on multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation methods with incomplete information which is calculated as 7 ω j s j s j 1 s n where j 1 2 n σ 1 2 j 1 2 l and satisfying the criteria of v σ l v σ l 1 in this paper the law of variation coefficient is adopted to confirm decision making model parameter the method is accurate and easy to calculate the weight of position vector to avoid influences caused by human factors step 6 establishing iowa operator focusing on fuzzy and stochastic characteristics of subjectivity of evaluators weights are described by iowa operator such desirable properties as monotonicity and commutativity of the new method is proposed in this paper then the incomplete information of the evaluation interval and value is integrated by utilizing the iowa operator and the decision problem to the weighted vector of the iowa operator is discussed and a normal formula of quality index for the comprehensive quality evaluation is obtained the new quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development is comprised of ecological environment v1 economic development v2 social effect v3 and quality management v4 the weights are described by iowa operator which is shown in the following 8 v 1 4 v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 this thesis defines more than 17 evaluating indexes of 3 layers framework on comprehensive quality evaluation of soil and water conservation the complete set of weighs is defined as i the over emphasis weighs of evaluation index is i1 the accordant to practice weighs of evaluation index is i2 and the solution to each of them could be expressed as a recurrence relation in the following 9 i i 1 i 2 where i 1 i 2 ϕ for all the evaluating indexes x k l i 2 the evaluating indexes before modifying are defined as w k l so the evaluating indexes after modified are presented in the following 10 w k l w k l x k l i 2 w k l 1 x k l i 1 w i j step 7 modifying weight of evaluating indexes once the index weight of determination model was set up the evaluating indexes are used to aggregate preference information by using iowa operator which is defined in the following 11 w j v j v 1 4 w 1 4 where j 1 2 3 4 step 8 calculating overall evaluation weight we can use iowa operator to compute every weight of aspects use variation coefficient to deal with the relativity between indexes moreover the mathematical expressions of overall evaluation weight for diverse quantitative indexes can be calculating as 12 y i j 1 n w j x i j where i 1 2 m though calculating the acceptable degree and optimal degree obtains the comprehensive evaluation value and determine the optimal plans 3 results the sustainable agricultural development and ecological protection is the basic guarantee in china the purpose of this article is to build a new quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development in zhejiang province of china in the prevention and control process of water and soil conservation stakeholders and different development levels are the key influencing factors in this case study taking water conservation of sustainable agricultural development for example we discuss the realizing approach of the quality evaluation system thus the hierarchical structure of quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development is shown in fig 2 from fig 2 the new quality evaluation system includes sub indicator of ecological environment v1 economic development v2 social effect v3 and quality management v4 the ecological environment s1 consists of four indexes as vegetation coverage x1 intensity of soil erosion x2 soil erosion area rate x3 and production potential realization rate x4 the economic development s2 consists of four indexes as utilization of precipitation resources x5 ratio of sloping land to agricultural land x6 per capita food x7 soil ratio of per capita income to local level x8 proportion of agricultural population x9 and degree of sustainable development x10 the social effect s3 consists of four indexes as engel coefficient x11 degree of sustainable development x12 and life expectancy x13 the quality management s4 consists of four indexes as water environment quality grade x14 qualified rate of farmland irrigation x15 cultivated land quality grade x16 and qualified rate of water and soil quality x17 because we aggregate data from many different regions our indexes are more informative than any individual region we cannot evaluate quantitatively the quality of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development because measurement of these indexes is not feasible with current data sources thus understanding how to use different sources of data and to apply them to quality evaluation system will become more important the current release of these indexes and their data sources represents the largest publicly available data resource from 8 regions of zhejiang province of china by 3 years from 2017 to 2019 which is shown as r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 r7 r8 in table 2 the index of intensity of soil erosion x2 often is measured in t km 2 a per capita food x7 measured in kilograms per year and life expectancy x13 measured in year the indexes of water environment quality grade x14 and cultivated land quality grade x16 are measured in scales of 1 10 the other indexes are measured in 100 point scales the input data sources are obtained from annual statistical reports and investigation methods of stratified sampling the summary statistics quality evaluation system of eight regions is shown in table 2 based on table 2 quality evaluation system to evaluate soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development includes positive indexes and negative indexes the quality indexes of soil erosion x2 soil erosion area rate x3 agricultural land x6 proportion of agricultural population x9 and engel coefficient x11 are negative indexes other quality indexes are positive indexes next the quality evaluation system is standardized for the eight regions from r1 to r8 which can reflect the situation of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development by using normalization equation of eqs 1 and 2 we gives out standard function to make its data dimensionless for every single index and the standardized data of eight regions is shown in table 3 then the average of quality evaluation system can be calculated by using equation of eq 3 based on eq 4 we can obtain standard deviation of distribution trend for 17 indicators next we try to solve this little puzzle by counting variable coefficient by using eq 5 in these extra computing steps in this study the selection of instance variables was used to represent computed intermediate and summary results the automatic meta analysis of calculating data can be performed by means of computer program a chance to discuss some features in design of 17 indexes for eight regions with respect to quality evaluation process and a summary of results is shown in table 4 based on eq 6 the weights of position vector of quality evaluation system can be separately calculated in the following v1 4 0 268 0 260 0 267 0 286 1 081 v5 10 0 285 0 071 0 062 0 108 0 253 0 042 0 821 v11 13 0 121 0 092 0 096 0 309 v14 17 0 231 0 037 0 236 0 034 0 538 these weights add up to rather large sums which is shown in the following s m v1 4 v5 10 v11 13 v14 17 1 081 0 822 0 309 0 538 2 749 based on eq 7 the weights vector of each index is achieved by using the method of iowa operator which is represented as shown below w1 4 1 081 2 749 0 393 w5 10 0 821 2 749 0 299 w11 13 0 309 2 749 0 112 w14 17 0 538 2 749 0 196 according to theoretical studies of iowa operator the weights of economic development v2 and quality management v4 belong to 0 15 0 30 0 15 0 35 0 15 0 25 and 0 15 0 35 therefore the weight of ecological environment v1 is 0 393 which is overestimated and the weight is modified as 0 30 moreover the weight of ecological environment v3 is 0 112 which is underestimated and the weight is modified as 0 15 so the ecological environment v1 and social effect v3 is calculated by using eq 10 on the other hand the modified weight of economic development v2 and quality management v4 can be calculated by using eq 11 the results appear as shown below w 1 4 1 081 2 749 0 300 w 5 10 0 299 1 0 15 0 3 0 299 0 196 0 332 w 11 13 0 196 1 0 15 0 3 0 299 0 196 0 150 w 14 17 0 196 1 0 15 0 3 0 299 0 196 0 218 in the next the normalized data of eight regions is shown in table 5 the weights of multiple evaluation criteria can be calculated by using eq 12 which are shown in table 6 then the weights for 17 evaluation indexes of quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development is shown in fig 3 based on the analysis of the data we provide computation and statistic scores of eight regions for quality evaluation system calculation result of this example is the following in table 7 finally the unorganized data is usually processed in some manner to make it easily readable for users as a graph the ranking results of eight regions are shown in fig 4 from fig 4 we get the sequence is r1 r4 r5 r6 r3 r2 r7 r8 and the experimental results were in accordance with the rank of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development by using the evaluation result we measured the quality levels of listed 8 regions of zhejiang province of china from ecological environment v1 economic development v2 social effect v3 and quality management v4 and made out the ranking for every region from every index the experimental results show that the new quality evaluation system for sustainable agricultural development is proved effective in enhancing the precision and speed for the decision makers the model and methods of quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation in this case study are also worthy to other areas in china 4 discussion 4 1 comparative analysis of ecological environment as the evaluation results are the subordinate degrees that belong to different grades respectively we might adopt a different quality strategy the score is 0155 to r7 0148 to r8 so r7 and r8 are among the worst performing regions ranking seventh and eighth out of 8 regions from the point view of system theory a new concept for improving the ecological environment is put forward for the two regions these measures include vegetation coverage x1 intensity of soil erosion x2 soil erosion area rate x3 and production potential realization rate x4 based on table 6 we can see that the ranking makes production potential realization rate the 5th in all the indicators while offers the best of four quality evaluation indicators the ranking results are shown in fig 5 to solve this unbalanced development problem region r7 and r8 might put forward the policy of priority for production potential realization rate and take a series of measures to develop ecological environment 4 2 comparative analysis of economic development the quality evaluation index of economic development includes six sub targets such as utilization of precipitation resources x5 ratio of sloping land to agricultural land x6 per capita food x7 soil ratio of per capita income to local level x8 proportion of agricultural population x9 and degree of sustainable development x10 region r7 is the best ranking which scores the maximum 0 273 which is shown in fig 6 so the pole management of region r7 is widely used in the economic development for other regions as a scientific and high efficient method of learning advantaged experience on the other hand it showed that the sub targets of x5 and x9 are the two former evaluation indexes based on their comprehensive score from table 6 in order to ensure economic development energetic efforts should be made to improve utilization of precipitation resources and actively reduce proportion of agricultural population for all regions 4 3 comparative analysis of social effect by selection of quality assessment indicator social effect degree constituted by three indicators in aspects of engel coefficient x11 degree of sustainable development x12 and life expectancy x13 was settled fig 7 shows the ranking results sorted this time by their scores then the average value of social effect for 8 regions is calculated as shown below a1 8 0 127 0 127 0 122 0 132 0 129 0 139 0 134 0 110 8 0 128 the result obtained shows clearly the comprehensive scores by this method not only are in line with the actual situation but also they are more balanced and reasonable and the social effect of eight regions has been astonishing largely because of rising output per farmer in sustainable agricultural development though it has also done well in social development and human progress 4 4 comparative analysis of quality management the quality management level has been continuously dropping in eight regions we see the results shown in fig 8 the trend could have serious consequences for region r8 whose quality control measures for soil and water conservation are continuing headaches for the local government compared the evaluated quality management with the iowa operator the scores were within 0 103 to 0 206 and consequently the maximum and minimum values are region r1 and r8 respectively four indexes as water environment quality grade x14 qualified rate of farmland irrigation x15 cultivated land quality grade x16 and qualified rate of water and soil quality x17 are discussed on how to enhance quality management for sustainable agricultural development as one of key techniques of quality control evaluation indicators of x14 and x16 are important and difficult to realize as well for quality managers 4 5 comprehensive analysis of the new quality evaluation system this new quality evaluation system contributes to reducing the error possibility of quality control measures according to the soil and water conservation and these measures should have a larger impact on sustainable agricultural development in china if the suspected quality evaluation system is valid details are recorded on the inaccurate report for audience and decision makers and it should result in a major loss for soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development so this new evaluation system when tightly coupled with change quality control leads to significant improvement in the work of soil and water conservation this new quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation is an effective tool for sustainable agricultural development in china 5 conclusions sustainable agricultural development has been an important direction for the future it is generally known that soil and water conservation is the inevitable requirement of sustainable agricultural development however lack of rational quality evaluation system is an outstanding problem what restricts the soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development in china thus the present situation and existing quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation was presented in this paper furthermore reasonable and accurate quality assessment of soil and water conservation will be the key to sustainable agricultural development but the traditional quality evaluation system method must analysis lots of information for all the indicators which refers to many influence factors and has a very complex process this paper provides a new evaluation criteria and principles for soil and water conservation according to the results of previous research the regional and national soil and water conservation monitoring network and quality evaluation system should provide basic guarantees for sustainable agricultural development moreover the accuracy and practicality of quantitative evaluation method is also very important to the quality evaluation system the scientific and reasonable quality evaluation methods are of important reference value for the prediction of decision support in the practice of soil and water conservation the new method of iowa operator based on multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation methods with incomplete information was presented to the quality evaluation system in this paper and the results of the case study show that the approved method have high veracity and efficiency in the quality evaluation process in future research we might try to expand the new quality evaluation system mixing with other comprehensive evaluation and statistical methods of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development declaration of competing
