23660,experiments regarding the vim of ss platforms with four columns were carried out to investigate the effects of the surface roughness and the column shape two different geometry of columns were experimented rounded square and circular cross sections each model had the same arrangement of four pontoons in a closed configuration the range of reduced velocity was from 4 up to 25 covering reynolds numbers from 7 000 to 80 000 three angles of incidences for each model were tested namely 0 22 5 and 45 for each model three different levels of roughness were tested regarding roughness effects the results seem to confirm two aspects the important role played by the separation point near the rounded corners of the rounded square columns and the roughness effect on the boundary layers of the circular columns regarding the effect of the column shape the results indicated that the heading effects on the vim of ss strongly depend on the column shape the characteristic motion periods upheld the resonance behavior for the motions in the transverse direction and yaw motions for the lock in range heave roll and yaw motions did not impact the vim behavior in the horizontal plane and

overview about vim of single cylindrical structures in gonçalves et al 2012a this fact is due to the geometric dimensions of the new deep draft dd semi submersibles platforms which have increased significantly therefore promoting a notable vim an extensive review of the vim topic can be found in fujarra et al 2012 the geometry of the ss implies a more complex vim phenomenon than that identified for single cylindrical structures in the case of ss the vortex shedding occurs around each column and thus the wake interference characterizes the vim of the unit different for each current incidence platform heading the shape of the columns circular square diamond or triangle impacts directly on the vortex shedding and the wake interference around the columns consequently the vim behavior of the platforms must be affected in this context this study aims to experimentally demonstrate the effects of column shape and surface roughness on the vim response of a dd ss with four columns section 2 presents a background of vim phenomenon as well as a context of the roughness effects on viv of cylinders the experimental setup and details about the scale model are described in section 3 the analysis methodology of the tests is presented in section 4 the results concerning amplitudes of motions in the transverse and in line directions as well as characteristic yaw motion amplitudes are discussed in section 5 in the same section force coefficients drag lift and added mass and characteristic motion periods from the spectral analysis are presented finally in section 6 some conclusions are drawn 2 background 2 1 effect of the column design on vim of offshore floating units amplitudes of vim were observed for dd ss as reported in rijken and leverette 2009 and ma et al 2013 from field measurements this fact has pushed up the efforts in understanding the vim behavior of such platforms and consequently the number of new solutions to avoid the high vim amplitudes has been growing up the main geometric nondimensional parameters that affect the vim are h l s l and h p where h is the immersed column height above the pontoon l is the face width of the column s is the distance between the center of the columns and p is the pontoon height these dimensions can be illustrated as in fig 1 presently model tests are the preferred method to predict the vim response of multi column floater even the results being conservative compared with field measurement as detached by koop et al 2016b in this scenario experimental works focused on vim of ss platforms with four square columns can be cited as rijken et al 2004 2011 waals et al 2007 rijken and leverette 2008 hong et al 2008 magee et al 2011 xu 2011 xu et al 2012 gonçalves et al 2012a b 2013 irani et al 2015 kyoung et al 2015 sterenborg et al 2016 liu et al 2016a 2016b and maximiano et al 2016 2017 all of these works reported relevant motions in certain current conditions which can reduce the fatigue life of steel catenary risers scr by as much as 50 near the touch down point tdp as noted in xiang et al 2010 and cheng et al 2011 recently the geometry of the columns has changed new dd ss platforms were designed with rectangular circular or diamond column sections naturally as can be seen in table 1 the increasing number ss with circular columns is the primary motivation for the present work and the reason why we focus on such a particular geometric arrangement the works by tan et al 2014 2016 potanza et al 2015 fujiwara et al 2016 and kou et al 2016 presented the vim results for dd ss with for circular columns the results showed that for the dd ss with circular columns the largest vim motions in the transverse direction occurred for 0 deg incidence differently for dd ss with square columns in which the highest amplitudes occurred for 45 deg incidence 2 2 effect of the roughness on viv the reynolds number is well known as the ratio between inertia and friction fluid forces equation 1 easily greater than 1 10 7 when related to the vim phenomenon acting on offshore platforms 1 r e u d ν where u is the incident current velocity d is the characteristic diameter of the body and ν is the kinematic viscous of the water full scale tests for vim are too expensive and too complicated to carry out therefore model tests are conducted to determine the vim response of semi submersible floaters it is not possible to apply reynolds scaling and froude scaling at the same time and froude scaling is commonly used to offshore engineering however the related reynolds scale effects are still under investigation furthermore the effect of roughness on subcritical flows is still under discussion dijk et al 2003 discussed the procedure for increasing the surface roughness of the small scale model for a truss spar platform apparently this is a plausible method but it deserves more attention particularly due to the dependence of viv response amplitudes upon the reynolds number and thus upon surface roughness according to govardhan and williamson 2006 later confirmed by blevins and coughran 2009 the maximum transverse amplitude of viv increases with an increase of the reynolds number in the range from 2 10 2 to 1 10 5 moreover blevins and coughran had shown for circular cylinders that the maximum transverse amplitude dropped by a factor of 2 when the surface roughness was increased from k d 1 10 5 to 5 10 3 at the reynolds number of approximately 1 4 10 5 such a drop indeed comes from changes in the boundary layer and supports the procedure widely applied to the small scale tests of floating units although the reynolds number may impose substantial changes on the vim some recent model tests of spar platforms have shown that experiments at subcritical flow are valid see for instance roddier et al 2009 and that the small scale tests provide a reliable and conservative prediction for vim response of the platform however it is important to highlight that at least in two comparisons presented in rijken and leverette 2008 and ma et al 2013 for ss vim response from small scale tests are found to be 50 larger than in the field measurements this fact could be attributed to the low reynolds numbers and eventual scale effects during the tests but equally to the characteristics of the environmental conditions in full scale simultaneously composed of current flow the wind and waves and also due to damping from risers and mooring lines a better discussion about the investigation on reasons for the possible difference between vim response in the field and model tests can be found in koop et al 2016b cfd simulations have the potential to investigate the vim response at full scale reynolds number cfd calculations are cheaper than model tests and they can provide quantities in an excellent resolution and present detailed flow visualizations to understand the flow physics involved better among the cfd calculations of vim for small scale to compare with the model tests results can be cited tan et al 2013 lee et al 2014 rosetti et al 2016 and chen and chen 2016 among cfd calculation of full scale model can be cited abrishamchi and younis 2012 koop et al 2016a and holland et al 2017 however for high quality results a thorough verification and validation procedure has to be followed as the use of cfd for vim predictions in the industry is still in its early stages it should be noted that validation of full scale cfd results is still not possible due to the lack of high quality measurements at prototype scale 3 experimental setup the experimental setup is characterized by a small scale model of the semi submersible unit supported by a set of linear springs in the towing tank at the institute of technological research ipt in são paulo brazil seeking for experiments at very low levels of turbulence regarding its dimensions the ipt towing tank presents 3 5 m in depth 6 6 m in width and 280 0 m in length the setup is towed by the carriage together with the instrumentation for monitoring the relevant physical parameters of the vim phenomenon in this case floater motions in 6 degrees of freedom forces in each of the four springs that compose the equivalent mooring system and the towing velocity 3 1 ss models seeking to understand the effects of the column shape and roughness surface level on the vim response two different models of typical dd ss were constructed a platform with rounded square sections herein named sqr model see fig 2 and a platform with circular columns herein named cc model see fig 3 the pontoons arrangement was the same for both models the correct center of gravity of the models was achieved by ballast weights inside the pontoons and columns a wood deck above the water line was constructed to support the measurement system targets for an optical motion capture device and ballast to fine adjust inertial properties fig 1 and table 2 summarize the main parameters of the dd ss models for the bare hull cases 3 2 surface roughness level the models were built in fiberglass and the surface roughness was increased by using measured sand grains the sand grains were glued to the model surface the low roughness level was adopted as k l 3 9 10 3 and the high roughness level as k l 7 8 10 3 where k is the mean height of the surface protrusions and l is the face dimension of the columns the roughness level was checked using a surface profile gage and the average value of the surface roughness level was the same that the specified respectively figs 4 and 5 show pictures of the three different roughness levels for the sqr model and cc model bare hull and hull with low and high roughness level 3 3 horizontal mooring system the model was built with a circular deck located above the end of the columns to fix the mooring system as can be seen in fig 6 that deck allowed the same mooring configuration for all the different current incidences i e the same value of mooring stiffness necessary to compare the results for all the different current incidences tested a soft mooring system was adopted to restore the horizontal motions of the model on the water surface during the towing tests as shown in fig 7 featured by 4 linear springs attached to the carriage employing cables the values of horizontal stiffness were the same for both direction k x k y 212 n m the natural periods in the horizontal plane for the bare hull case are presented in table 3 the values of the natural period were the same for all the incidence angles the linear damping was lower than 2 for all degrees of freedom which was determined from decay tests 3 4 instrumentation an optical motion capture system qualisys was used for tracking a base of passive targets attached to each model tested to measure the six degrees of freedom motions during the vim tests four cameras were arranged around the template for detecting five passive targets allocated above the deck of the semi submersible model and created the rigid body that was considered to evaluate the time series the data collection system is a dedicated software of the qualisys system the acquisition frequency was 100 hz vim responses were acquired simultaneously to the carriage velocity and forces these utilizing load cells installed in the mooring lines and stiffness with a non linearity of 0 1 and capacity of 22 24 n 3 5 the test program fig 8 shows the coordinate system in the 2d horizontal plane the x and y axes represent the basin fixed global coordinate system and x and y are the body fixed local coordinate system in all the tests the current flow comes from x and x the incident current angle θ is defined as the counterclockwise angle from the vector current u along x to the axis x the tests carried out comprising three different roughness level and covered a range of reduced velocities from 4 to 30 with reynolds numbers from re 7 10 3 to 8 10 4 according to the three angles of incidence tested θ 0 22 5 and 45 the reduced velocities were selected to verify the influence on the vim phenomenon the blockage effect β can be neglected β values are lower than 1 2 β was calculated as the ratio between the area of the model and the cross sectional area depth x width of the tank the froude number tested was lower than 0 2 which indicates that the viscous effects are more significant than the gravitational ones 4 analysis methodology 4 1 motion amplitudes motions in the six degrees of freedom were measured heave roll and yaw motions did not impact the vim behavior in the horizontal plane and their amplitudes were not considered relevant because of that only the motions in the horizontal plane in line transverse and yaw are presented and discussed in this article the vim response of the ss models was analyzed through the root mean square rms of displacements in the in line and transverse directions and angles of rotation in the case of the yaw motion the rms is calculated in the case of a set of n values x 1 x 2 x n as 2 x r m s 1 n x 1 2 x 2 2 x n 2 moreover as commonly found non dimensional amplitudes in the in line and transverse directions were calculated as a quotient of the rms displacements a y by the face dimension of the column l for the rms angles of yaw a y a w no dimensionless presentation was adopted as usual in the literature 4 2 characteristic motion periods the characteristic motion periods were calculated for the motions in the transverse direction t y and for yaw motion t y a w the characteristic motion was defined as the peak of the highest energy level in the power spectrum density psd the results will be presented in the non dimensional form using the natural period in still water for each respective degree of freedom i e t y t 0 y and t y a w t 0 y a w 4 3 reduced velocities the reduced velocity v r was defined as a function of the incident current velocity u the natural period of motion in still water t 0 and the characteristic length of the body section subjected to a vortex shedding d 3 v r u t 0 d in this case d can be written as a function of the current incidence angle for rounded square columns to better represent the characteristic length of the column section on the flow i e d l s i n θ c o s θ where θ is the current incidence angle see fig 9 for circular columns cases d l for all incidence angles for defining d the column s rounding is not taken into account it is worth emphasizing that two natural periods were applied for the reduced velocity calculation namely the transverse natural period t 0 y and the yaw natural period t 0 y a w respectively for presenting the vim response in these two degrees of freedom 4 4 hydrodynamic forces the linear rigid body motion for a platform with two uncoupled degrees of freedom in line and transverse directions are represented by equation 4 proposed and discussed in sarpkaya 2004 m x c x x k x x f h x 4 m y c y y k y y f h y where m represents the platforms mass c x and the c y structural damping coefficient of the system k x and k y are the stiffness of the system f h x and f h y are the total hydrodynamic forces acting on the system in the in line x and transverse y directions similarly equation 5 presents the yaw motions 5 i z θ c θ θ k θ θ m h z where i z represents the inertia moment of yaw motion c θ structural damping coefficient k θ the yaw motion stiffness due to the linear springs m h z is the total hydrodynamic moment acting on the system around the vertical axis z i e yaw angle θ in these equations the structural forces are placed on the left side of the equations and the hydrodynamic forces are placed on the right side of the equations in the experiments the total hydrodynamic forces in each given direction are measured indirectly using these motion equations the total hydrodynamic force on the right hand side is the sum of the inertial dissipative and restoring forces of the system the restoring forces were derived from the measurement using the four load cells one in each mooring spring as mentioned then the force is decomposed in the in line and transverse directions also considering the yaw angle of the platform the vertical motions heave roll and pitch are considered small and they can be neglected in the force estimated this assumption does not affect the drag and lift force calculation the force in the transverse direction of the flow or transverse direction f h y t is commonly represented in the form of the non dimensional lift coefficient c l as in equation 6 6 c l t f h y t 1 2 ρ a p u 2 where ρ is the fluid density and a p is the submerged projected area of the platform concerning the transverse direction to the flow the force in the in line direction f h x t can be divided into two parts one related to the average drag force static component and a second one related to the dynamic drag force oscillatory component thus the average part of the drag can be described as in equation 7 7 c d f h x t 1 2 ρ a p u 2 where f h x t is the average total hydrodynamic force in the in line direction and c d is the average drag coefficient analogously the moment acting on the system around the vertical axis m h z t or yaw moment is commonly represented in the form of the nondimensional yaw moment coefficient c m t as in equation 8 8 c m t m h z t 1 2 ρ a p b u 2 where b is the beam of the platform and s is the distance between the center of columns i e b s l the non dimensional dependent lift coefficient c l and yaw moment coefficient c m were respectively evaluated as the rms value of the non dimensional force and moment time histories figs 10 and 11 show the view of the submerged projected area for the different incidence angles for sqr and cc models respectively table 4 presents the respective values of the submerged projected area the force coefficient results will be presented using the respective area for each incidence angle 4 5 added mass as usual considering that the component of the total hydrodynamic force in phase with the acceleration is related to the added mass from a standard frequency domain analysis it is possible to evaluate the added mass coefficient at the characteristic frequency of motion as proposed by vikestad fujarra and pesce 2002 the added mass coefficient c a for the motions in the transverse direction can be written as in equation 9 where ℜ represents the real part of the complex number and f f t represents the fast fourier transform operator 9 c a ℜ f f t f h y t f f t y t m 5 experimental results in this section results of the analysis of the vim phenomenon of the dd ss will be presented concerning the column design and roughness effects the results of nondimensional amplitudes for the transverse and in line directions shown in this section were calculated as rms values the nondimensional amplitudes were calculated using the face dimension of the column l 5 1 column shape effects in this sub section all the results are presented concerning the comparison between two different column section shapes in particular square rounded and circular from here sqr model will denominate the dd ss model with rounded square column sections and cc model will denominate the dd ss model with circular column sections all the results are presented as a function of the reduced velocity calculated using the natural period of the motion in the transverse direction in still water v r u t 0 y d unless specified otherwise fig 12 presents the results of the nondimensional rms amplitude for the motion in the transverse direction for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the amplitudes in the transverse direction were higher for the cc model than for the sqr models except for the 45 deg incidence considering the sqr model the highest transverse amplitudes occurred for incidences other than 0 the maximum amplitude for 0 deg incidence was a y l 0 2 for the highest reduced velocity tested v r 28 for 0 deg incidence no lock in region could be defined on the other hand the lock in region was observed in the range 5 v r 10 for 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the maximum amplitude for these cases was a y l 0 35 considering the cc model the highest transverse amplitude occurred for 0 deg incidence and it was equal to a y l 0 45 this value is higher than the maximum observed for the sqr model the lock in region could be found for all incidence angles tested 5 v r 10 outside the lock in region v r 10 the second increase in transverse amplitudes was observed for 22 5 and 45 deg incidences around v r 15 this behavior was due the higher yaw motion amplitudes found in these reduced velocities range for the same cc model case i e a coupling between the transverse and yaw motions this behavior will be better explaining later using figs 12 and 14 together for reduced velocities v r 15 remaining amplitudes of transverse motions were observed fig 13 presents the results of the nondimensional rms amplitude for the motion in the in line direction for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the amplitudes in the in line direction were lower than the transverse ones for all cases moreover the amplitudes in the in line direction were higher for the scr model than for the cc model except for the 0 deg incidence in which they are similar concerning the cc model the in line amplitudes showed to be similar for all incidence angles and apparently increased with increasing the reduced velocity yet the values of a x l did not reach 0 15 concerning the sqr model the results for 22 5 deg incidence showed to be higher than other incidences in the lock in range of transverse motions with the maximum value around a x l 0 15 the in line amplitudes increased with increasing reduced velocities for 45 deg incidence fig 14 presents the results of the rms amplitude of the yaw motion for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the reduced velocity in these cases was calculated using the natural period of the yaw motion in still water t 0 y a w the maximum yaw amplitudes observed were a y a w 3 5 degrees and a y a w 2 5 degrees for the cc and sqr models respectively for most reduced velocities v r 10 the cc model presented yaw amplitudes higher than that one for the sqr model comparing the yaw motion amplitudes for sqr and cc models the behavior was completely different it was not possible to define a lock in region for the sqr model the yaw amplitudes appeared to increase with increasing reduced velocity for all incidence angles with no evidence of falling the slightly higher amplitudes occurred for 0 deg incidence on the other hand the lock in region was well defined for the cc model with 22 5 and 45 deg incidence yaw amplitudes up to 3 5 were found in the region of reduced velocities 5 v r 8 the yaw amplitudes were different for the cc model with 0 deg incidence in this case a resonance behavior was not observed and the amplitudes were lower as compared with higher incidence angles only for highest reduced velocities v r 8 the yaw amplitudes were higher it is important to notice that the yaw response of the cc model disclosed a typical lock in phenomenon extending from reduced velocity 4 to 10 clearly showing that the vim in this degree of freedom is analogous to that in the transverse direction therefore it is a phenomenon similar to the viv typically found in cylinders to confirm the coupling between the transverse and yaw motion for the cc model with 22 5 and 45 degrees of incidence the reduced velocity for the yaw motion was also calculated using the natural period of the motion in the transverse direction as in fig 15 in this case the peaks of yaw amplitudes were observed to correspond to the same reduced velocity that occurred the second increase in the transverse amplitudes as commented previously a typical linear decrease in the ratio between the characteristic motion period and the natural period in still water represents a synchronization between the frequency of vortex shedding and the frequency of the motion details about viv on circular cylinders with two degree of freedom and the small mass ratio can be seen in works such as jauvtis and williamson 2004 gonçalves et al 2013 and gonçalves and fujarra 2014 fig 16 presents the results of the nondimensional characteristic period for the motions in the transverse direction t y t 0 y for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences except for 0 deg incidence the range of synchronization periods was larger for the sqr model than for the cc model for the motions in the transverse direction considering the sqr model with 0 deg incidence t y t 0 y was different compared with the other incidence angles the same behavior was observed for the transverse amplitude results see also fig 12 considering the cc model the behavior of t y t 0 y was similar for all incidence angles at v r 10 in this range of velocities the lock in of transverse motions occurred on the other hand a couple of the transverse and yaw motions occurred for v r 10 altering the behavior of the transverse periods in this range fig 17 presents the results of the nondimensional characteristic period for yaw motions t y a w t 0 y a w for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the reduced velocity in these cases was calculated using the natural period of the yaw motion in still water t 0 y a w the same behavior of synchronization between the vortex shedding frequency and the motions in the transverse direction could be observed for yaw motions the range of reduced velocities in which this behavior occurs was well characterized at 5 v r 9 in this region the ratio of yaw periods decreased linearly it was hard to determine the marked yaw period for v r 5 due to the low yaw amplitudes in this range of reduced velocities regarding the sqr model t y a w t 0 y a w showed a possible synchronization region around 5 v r 9 when considering the yaw natural period to calculate the reduced velocities this behavior was not feasible to determine only with the yaw motion amplitude results regarding the cc model t y a w t 0 y a w corroborated to confirm the couple between the transverse and yaw motions in the region of reduced velocities 5 v r 8 since an increase in the transverse amplitudes occurred in this reduced velocity range as pointed in fig 15 all the force coefficients were calculated using the corresponding projected area for each incidence angle fig 18 presents the results of the nondimensional mean drag coefficient c d for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the maximum drag coefficients observed were c d 2 0 and c d 1 6 for cc and sqr models respectively the values were constant for all the reduced velocities range tested except in the region which the dynamic amplification of the drag occurred the dynamic drag amplification is due to the synchronization range present in the resonance phenomenon that provides larger motion in the transverse direction this behavior was discussed in other vim of ss tests such observed by rijken et al 2004 rijken and leverette 2008 and tahar and finn 2011 the maximum value of c d occurred for 0 deg incidence a mean trend around c d 1 0 for v r 10 was observed with an exception for 0 deg incidence and sqr model with 45 deg incidence in which the values were larger c d 1 5 these values are following the results published by tahar and finn 2011 and gonçalves et al 2012b for a ss it is worth nothing the dynamic drag amplification in the range 5 v r 10 for the cc model fig 19 presents the results of the nondimensional rms lift coefficient c l for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the maximum lift coefficients observed were c l 0 6 and c l 0 3 for cc and sqr models respectively the c l was higher in the lock in region observed for the motion in the transverse direction outside this range v r 10 the c l presented low values in general lift force values for the cc model were higher than for the sqr model considering the cc model the values were higher for lower incidence angles on the other hand considering the sqr model the values were higher for higher incidence angles the highest values of c l were concentrated in the velocity range in which the lock in range could be defined fig 20 presents the results of the nondimensional rms yaw moment coefficient c m for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the reduced velocity in these cases was calculated using the natural period of the yaw motion in still water t 0 y a w the c m values were higher for cc models than for sqr models except in 0 deg incidence the maximum yaw moment coefficients observed were c m 0 09 and c m 0 07 for sqr and cc models respectively the c m was higher in the lock in region observed for the yaw motion 4 v r 8 considering the sqr model c m value was different for 0 deg incidence and higher than for other incidences on the other hand considering the cc model the behavior was the opposite the c m values were higher for 22 5 and 45 deg incidences than 0 for these cases in the same way as for lift coefficient the yaw moment coefficients were higher and concentrated in the lock in region for this degree of freedom fig 21 presents the results of nondimensional added mass coefficient for the motions in the transverse direction c a for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the added mass results in the transverse direction showed the same asymptotic decrease observed for circular cylinders as commented in fujarra and pesce 2002 in a range up to v r 15 in most cases the results corroborated to show the resonance behavior of the motion in the transverse direction the zero crossing occurred for the cc model with 0 deg incidence and sqr model with 22 5 and 45 deg incidences which confirms the end of the resonance of the transverse motion around this reduced velocity the values of added mass did not agree with the typical behavior when the couple between the transverse and the yaw motions occurred mainly as in 22 5 and 45 deg incidences for cc models 5 2 roughness effects in this sub section all the results are presented concerning the comparison between three different roughness level namely bare hull the model without roughness insertion was considered as bare low roughness level k l 3 9 10 3 and high roughness level k l 7 8 10 3 figs 22 24 present the results of the nondimensional rms amplitude for the motion in the transverse direction for the sqr model with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences respectively according to those results the roughness level for the sqr model showed a small influence on the transverse response of the vim phenomenon apparently once the amplitude trend was the same for the different roughness level on each particular incidence angle and the peak amplitude was quite similar in the lock in range 5 v r 10 the models with roughness level shifted the begin of the synchronization to earlier reduced velocities implying in higher amplitudes for lower reduced velocities as can be seen in the results for 22 5 and 45 deg incidences in these cases the resonance behavior is probably more related to the clear separation points on the corners of the squared section of the columns than to the higher roughness surface level of the columns the separation points cannot be confirmed fixed because the squared columns edges are rounded and the separation points can change a little which explain the quite difference between roughness levels for better understanding these combined effects specific tests might be conducted as flow visualization piv for instance or cfd simulations figs 25 27 present the results of the rms amplitude of yaw motion for the sqr model with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences respectively the results are shown as a function of the reduced velocity calculated using the natural period of the yaw motion in still water v r u t 0 y a w d according to those results the roughness level for the sqr model showed a small influence on the yaw response and kept the amplitude trend similar for each incidence angle as analogous to the transverse behavior contrasting to the transverse amplitudes the models with roughness level shift the begin of the synchronization to later reduced velocities implying in lower amplitudes for higher reduced velocities in the lock in range 5 v r 10 as can be seen in the results for 0 and 22 5 deg incidences the largest differences were observed for 0 deg incidence figs 28 30 present the results of the nondimensional rms amplitude for the motion in the transverse direction for the cc model dd ss model with circular columns with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences respectively by comparing the transverse results important differences due to the roughness level were observed only in the results for 45 deg incidence in the lock in range 5 v r 10 see fig 30 for the other incidences the transverse response was quite similar in the range of v r 17 and substantial differences were observed for reduced velocities higher than 17 see figs 28 and 29 for 45 deg incidence the increase of the surface level modified the peak amplitude for the bare hull a y l 0 27 in the lock in region of the motion in the transverse direction in such cases the low roughness level increased the peak amplitude to a y l 0 35 and the high roughness level decreased the peak amplitude to a y l 0 19 this behavior can be attributed to the changes in the separation point around the circular section of the columns and consequently variations in the wake geometry circular sections are more suitable to changes in the separation points than square sections and this fact ostensibly is responsible for the larger differences in the transverse amplitudes for cc model than for sqr model figs 31 33 present the results of the rms amplitude of the yaw motion for the cc model with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences respectively the yaw amplitudes for cc model showed larger differences for 0 deg incidence in which the peak values were higher for higher roughness level than bare hull case i e maximum yaw values around 3 and 2 for models with roughness and bare hull respectively the yaw amplitude differences were larger for cc model than sqr model this behavior can corroborate the statement that the separation points and wakes are more affected by the roughness level for circular sections the wake interference is more sensitive for 0 deg incidence unsurprisingly the changes in the roughness level affected the wakes and the yaw motion directly 6 conclusions as pointed out the vim of semi submersibles is an important issue to be considered in the design of risers and mooring line systems due to a possible decrease in the fatigue life of those components to better understand the effect of the design of the column shape and the surface roughness level vim tests with 1 100 small scale models of two dd ss platforms specifically rounded square and circular column sections three different roughness level were tested namely bare hull low roughness level k l 3 9 10 3 and high roughness level k l 7 8 10 3 also these effects were evaluated for three different current incidence angles in particular 0 22 5 and 45 degrees of incidence the tests were carried out in the towing tank of the ipt brazil the experimental results comprised amplitudes and frequencies in the in line and the transverse directions as well as yaw motions force coefficient results drag and lift and also added mass were investigated 6 1 column design effects the column shape showed to have a significant effect on the vim response of the dd ss circular columns and rounded square columns presented different behavior regarding transverse and yaw response for various incidence angles the circular columns seemed to result in higher vim response in the transverse direction for all current headings compared with the rounded square columns which is important to consider in the design stage of the semi submersible the transverse amplitudes were the highest for the cc model with the 0 deg incidence in a range of reduced velocities 7 v r 10 and its value was a y l 0 45 additionally the yaw motion amplitudes were highest for the cc model with 22 5 or 45 deg incidences both in a range of reduced velocities 6 v r 8 where its value was a y a w 3 5 degrees a lock in region could be well defined for the motions in the transverse direction for both models and all incidence angles except for the sqr model with 0 deg incidence this fact confirmed a resonance behavior for this degree of freedom another important aspect observed was the existence of a second peak in the transverse amplitude results for cc model with 22 5 and 45 deg incidence in that region of reduced velocities v r 15 a coupling between the transverse and yaw motion occurred due to the existence of amplitude increase at the same time for both degrees of freedom on the other hand the yaw motions presented a precise lock in range only for the cc model with the 22 5 and 45 deg incidences for the sqr model the increase in yaw amplitudes occurred for increasingly reduced velocities the characteristic motion periods corroborated to confirm the existence of a lock in range for transverse and yaw motion in this range of reduced velocities the ratio between motion period and the natural period for each degree of freedom decreased linearly showing the couple between the vortex shedding frequency and the motion frequency moreover the dynamic amplification of the drag could also be observed in the lock in region of transverse motions where the transverse amplitudes are the highest the drag coefficients reached maximum values around 2 0 and reduced velocity around 7 for sqr model with 0 deg incidence the lift and yaw moment coefficients showed the highest values at the lock in range for each degree of freedom the added mass coefficients crossed the zero axes at the end of the lock in region confirming the resonance behavior of the motions in the transverse direction 6 2 roughness effects by comparing the vim response transverse and yaw motions of the bare hull with those with two higher levels of surface roughness no substantial differences were observed for the ss model with rounded square columns even considering three different angles of current incidence for the cc model however differences due to the roughness level were found for the three angles of current incidence particularly regarding the transverse response for both ss models the intermediate level of roughness presented transverse response slightly higher than the models with the highest roughness level this behavior is not entirely understood but seems to be related to changes in the separation points which is quite sensitive to the surface roughness it is hard to give a general guideline on applying roughness in vim model test campaigns based on the results of this test campaign however for rounded square columns it seems to be valid to use the bare hull as the response using different roughness levels is very similar the flow separation is dominated by the edges of the rounded square columns and thus not much variation is observed for circular columns the response using low roughness seems to be higher than for the bare hull for the circular columns the location of separation and transition is not well defined based on the results observed in this test campaign it is good practice to apply a low level of roughness for circular columns to get the most conservative results and to minimize reynolds scaling effects also although not tested it is important to include appurtenances for round columns as they have an effect on the separation locations on the column for rounded square columns this is less necessary but good practice to include them acknowledgements this study was carried out within the vim jip which is run by the partnership between marin and usp and for whose participants the authors are grateful

23660,experiments regarding the vim of ss platforms with four columns were carried out to investigate the effects of the surface roughness and the column shape two different geometry of columns were experimented rounded square and circular cross sections each model had the same arrangement of four pontoons in a closed configuration the range of reduced velocity was from 4 up to 25 covering reynolds numbers from 7 000 to 80 000 three angles of incidences for each model were tested namely 0 22 5 and 45 for each model three different levels of roughness were tested regarding roughness effects the results seem to confirm two aspects the important role played by the separation point near the rounded corners of the rounded square columns and the roughness effect on the boundary layers of the circular columns regarding the effect of the column shape the results indicated that the heading effects on the vim of ss strongly depend on the column shape the characteristic motion periods upheld the resonance behavior for the motions in the transverse direction and yaw motions for the lock in range heave roll and yaw motions did not impact the vim behavior in the horizontal plane and

overview about vim of single cylindrical structures in gonçalves et al 2012a this fact is due to the geometric dimensions of the new deep draft dd semi submersibles platforms which have increased significantly therefore promoting a notable vim an extensive review of the vim topic can be found in fujarra et al 2012 the geometry of the ss implies a more complex vim phenomenon than that identified for single cylindrical structures in the case of ss the vortex shedding occurs around each column and thus the wake interference characterizes the vim of the unit different for each current incidence platform heading the shape of the columns circular square diamond or triangle impacts directly on the vortex shedding and the wake interference around the columns consequently the vim behavior of the platforms must be affected in this context this study aims to experimentally demonstrate the effects of column shape and surface roughness on the vim response of a dd ss with four columns section 2 presents a background of vim phenomenon as well as a context of the roughness effects on viv of cylinders the experimental setup and details about the scale model are described in section 3 the analysis methodology of the tests is presented in section 4 the results concerning amplitudes of motions in the transverse and in line directions as well as characteristic yaw motion amplitudes are discussed in section 5 in the same section force coefficients drag lift and added mass and characteristic motion periods from the spectral analysis are presented finally in section 6 some conclusions are drawn 2 background 2 1 effect of the column design on vim of offshore floating units amplitudes of vim were observed for dd ss as reported in rijken and leverette 2009 and ma et al 2013 from field measurements this fact has pushed up the efforts in understanding the vim behavior of such platforms and consequently the number of new solutions to avoid the high vim amplitudes has been growing up the main geometric nondimensional parameters that affect the vim are h l s l and h p where h is the immersed column height above the pontoon l is the face width of the column s is the distance between the center of the columns and p is the pontoon height these dimensions can be illustrated as in fig 1 presently model tests are the preferred method to predict the vim response of multi column floater even the results being conservative compared with field measurement as detached by koop et al 2016b in this scenario experimental works focused on vim of ss platforms with four square columns can be cited as rijken et al 2004 2011 waals et al 2007 rijken and leverette 2008 hong et al 2008 magee et al 2011 xu 2011 xu et al 2012 gonçalves et al 2012a b 2013 irani et al 2015 kyoung et al 2015 sterenborg et al 2016 liu et al 2016a 2016b and maximiano et al 2016 2017 all of these works reported relevant motions in certain current conditions which can reduce the fatigue life of steel catenary risers scr by as much as 50 near the touch down point tdp as noted in xiang et al 2010 and cheng et al 2011 recently the geometry of the columns has changed new dd ss platforms were designed with rectangular circular or diamond column sections naturally as can be seen in table 1 the increasing number ss with circular columns is the primary motivation for the present work and the reason why we focus on such a particular geometric arrangement the works by tan et al 2014 2016 potanza et al 2015 fujiwara et al 2016 and kou et al 2016 presented the vim results for dd ss with for circular columns the results showed that for the dd ss with circular columns the largest vim motions in the transverse direction occurred for 0 deg incidence differently for dd ss with square columns in which the highest amplitudes occurred for 45 deg incidence 2 2 effect of the roughness on viv the reynolds number is well known as the ratio between inertia and friction fluid forces equation 1 easily greater than 1 10 7 when related to the vim phenomenon acting on offshore platforms 1 r e u d ν where u is the incident current velocity d is the characteristic diameter of the body and ν is the kinematic viscous of the water full scale tests for vim are too expensive and too complicated to carry out therefore model tests are conducted to determine the vim response of semi submersible floaters it is not possible to apply reynolds scaling and froude scaling at the same time and froude scaling is commonly used to offshore engineering however the related reynolds scale effects are still under investigation furthermore the effect of roughness on subcritical flows is still under discussion dijk et al 2003 discussed the procedure for increasing the surface roughness of the small scale model for a truss spar platform apparently this is a plausible method but it deserves more attention particularly due to the dependence of viv response amplitudes upon the reynolds number and thus upon surface roughness according to govardhan and williamson 2006 later confirmed by blevins and coughran 2009 the maximum transverse amplitude of viv increases with an increase of the reynolds number in the range from 2 10 2 to 1 10 5 moreover blevins and coughran had shown for circular cylinders that the maximum transverse amplitude dropped by a factor of 2 when the surface roughness was increased from k d 1 10 5 to 5 10 3 at the reynolds number of approximately 1 4 10 5 such a drop indeed comes from changes in the boundary layer and supports the procedure widely applied to the small scale tests of floating units although the reynolds number may impose substantial changes on the vim some recent model tests of spar platforms have shown that experiments at subcritical flow are valid see for instance roddier et al 2009 and that the small scale tests provide a reliable and conservative prediction for vim response of the platform however it is important to highlight that at least in two comparisons presented in rijken and leverette 2008 and ma et al 2013 for ss vim response from small scale tests are found to be 50 larger than in the field measurements this fact could be attributed to the low reynolds numbers and eventual scale effects during the tests but equally to the characteristics of the environmental conditions in full scale simultaneously composed of current flow the wind and waves and also due to damping from risers and mooring lines a better discussion about the investigation on reasons for the possible difference between vim response in the field and model tests can be found in koop et al 2016b cfd simulations have the potential to investigate the vim response at full scale reynolds number cfd calculations are cheaper than model tests and they can provide quantities in an excellent resolution and present detailed flow visualizations to understand the flow physics involved better among the cfd calculations of vim for small scale to compare with the model tests results can be cited tan et al 2013 lee et al 2014 rosetti et al 2016 and chen and chen 2016 among cfd calculation of full scale model can be cited abrishamchi and younis 2012 koop et al 2016a and holland et al 2017 however for high quality results a thorough verification and validation procedure has to be followed as the use of cfd for vim predictions in the industry is still in its early stages it should be noted that validation of full scale cfd results is still not possible due to the lack of high quality measurements at prototype scale 3 experimental setup the experimental setup is characterized by a small scale model of the semi submersible unit supported by a set of linear springs in the towing tank at the institute of technological research ipt in são paulo brazil seeking for experiments at very low levels of turbulence regarding its dimensions the ipt towing tank presents 3 5 m in depth 6 6 m in width and 280 0 m in length the setup is towed by the carriage together with the instrumentation for monitoring the relevant physical parameters of the vim phenomenon in this case floater motions in 6 degrees of freedom forces in each of the four springs that compose the equivalent mooring system and the towing velocity 3 1 ss models seeking to understand the effects of the column shape and roughness surface level on the vim response two different models of typical dd ss were constructed a platform with rounded square sections herein named sqr model see fig 2 and a platform with circular columns herein named cc model see fig 3 the pontoons arrangement was the same for both models the correct center of gravity of the models was achieved by ballast weights inside the pontoons and columns a wood deck above the water line was constructed to support the measurement system targets for an optical motion capture device and ballast to fine adjust inertial properties fig 1 and table 2 summarize the main parameters of the dd ss models for the bare hull cases 3 2 surface roughness level the models were built in fiberglass and the surface roughness was increased by using measured sand grains the sand grains were glued to the model surface the low roughness level was adopted as k l 3 9 10 3 and the high roughness level as k l 7 8 10 3 where k is the mean height of the surface protrusions and l is the face dimension of the columns the roughness level was checked using a surface profile gage and the average value of the surface roughness level was the same that the specified respectively figs 4 and 5 show pictures of the three different roughness levels for the sqr model and cc model bare hull and hull with low and high roughness level 3 3 horizontal mooring system the model was built with a circular deck located above the end of the columns to fix the mooring system as can be seen in fig 6 that deck allowed the same mooring configuration for all the different current incidences i e the same value of mooring stiffness necessary to compare the results for all the different current incidences tested a soft mooring system was adopted to restore the horizontal motions of the model on the water surface during the towing tests as shown in fig 7 featured by 4 linear springs attached to the carriage employing cables the values of horizontal stiffness were the same for both direction k x k y 212 n m the natural periods in the horizontal plane for the bare hull case are presented in table 3 the values of the natural period were the same for all the incidence angles the linear damping was lower than 2 for all degrees of freedom which was determined from decay tests 3 4 instrumentation an optical motion capture system qualisys was used for tracking a base of passive targets attached to each model tested to measure the six degrees of freedom motions during the vim tests four cameras were arranged around the template for detecting five passive targets allocated above the deck of the semi submersible model and created the rigid body that was considered to evaluate the time series the data collection system is a dedicated software of the qualisys system the acquisition frequency was 100 hz vim responses were acquired simultaneously to the carriage velocity and forces these utilizing load cells installed in the mooring lines and stiffness with a non linearity of 0 1 and capacity of 22 24 n 3 5 the test program fig 8 shows the coordinate system in the 2d horizontal plane the x and y axes represent the basin fixed global coordinate system and x and y are the body fixed local coordinate system in all the tests the current flow comes from x and x the incident current angle θ is defined as the counterclockwise angle from the vector current u along x to the axis x the tests carried out comprising three different roughness level and covered a range of reduced velocities from 4 to 30 with reynolds numbers from re 7 10 3 to 8 10 4 according to the three angles of incidence tested θ 0 22 5 and 45 the reduced velocities were selected to verify the influence on the vim phenomenon the blockage effect β can be neglected β values are lower than 1 2 β was calculated as the ratio between the area of the model and the cross sectional area depth x width of the tank the froude number tested was lower than 0 2 which indicates that the viscous effects are more significant than the gravitational ones 4 analysis methodology 4 1 motion amplitudes motions in the six degrees of freedom were measured heave roll and yaw motions did not impact the vim behavior in the horizontal plane and their amplitudes were not considered relevant because of that only the motions in the horizontal plane in line transverse and yaw are presented and discussed in this article the vim response of the ss models was analyzed through the root mean square rms of displacements in the in line and transverse directions and angles of rotation in the case of the yaw motion the rms is calculated in the case of a set of n values x 1 x 2 x n as 2 x r m s 1 n x 1 2 x 2 2 x n 2 moreover as commonly found non dimensional amplitudes in the in line and transverse directions were calculated as a quotient of the rms displacements a y by the face dimension of the column l for the rms angles of yaw a y a w no dimensionless presentation was adopted as usual in the literature 4 2 characteristic motion periods the characteristic motion periods were calculated for the motions in the transverse direction t y and for yaw motion t y a w the characteristic motion was defined as the peak of the highest energy level in the power spectrum density psd the results will be presented in the non dimensional form using the natural period in still water for each respective degree of freedom i e t y t 0 y and t y a w t 0 y a w 4 3 reduced velocities the reduced velocity v r was defined as a function of the incident current velocity u the natural period of motion in still water t 0 and the characteristic length of the body section subjected to a vortex shedding d 3 v r u t 0 d in this case d can be written as a function of the current incidence angle for rounded square columns to better represent the characteristic length of the column section on the flow i e d l s i n θ c o s θ where θ is the current incidence angle see fig 9 for circular columns cases d l for all incidence angles for defining d the column s rounding is not taken into account it is worth emphasizing that two natural periods were applied for the reduced velocity calculation namely the transverse natural period t 0 y and the yaw natural period t 0 y a w respectively for presenting the vim response in these two degrees of freedom 4 4 hydrodynamic forces the linear rigid body motion for a platform with two uncoupled degrees of freedom in line and transverse directions are represented by equation 4 proposed and discussed in sarpkaya 2004 m x c x x k x x f h x 4 m y c y y k y y f h y where m represents the platforms mass c x and the c y structural damping coefficient of the system k x and k y are the stiffness of the system f h x and f h y are the total hydrodynamic forces acting on the system in the in line x and transverse y directions similarly equation 5 presents the yaw motions 5 i z θ c θ θ k θ θ m h z where i z represents the inertia moment of yaw motion c θ structural damping coefficient k θ the yaw motion stiffness due to the linear springs m h z is the total hydrodynamic moment acting on the system around the vertical axis z i e yaw angle θ in these equations the structural forces are placed on the left side of the equations and the hydrodynamic forces are placed on the right side of the equations in the experiments the total hydrodynamic forces in each given direction are measured indirectly using these motion equations the total hydrodynamic force on the right hand side is the sum of the inertial dissipative and restoring forces of the system the restoring forces were derived from the measurement using the four load cells one in each mooring spring as mentioned then the force is decomposed in the in line and transverse directions also considering the yaw angle of the platform the vertical motions heave roll and pitch are considered small and they can be neglected in the force estimated this assumption does not affect the drag and lift force calculation the force in the transverse direction of the flow or transverse direction f h y t is commonly represented in the form of the non dimensional lift coefficient c l as in equation 6 6 c l t f h y t 1 2 ρ a p u 2 where ρ is the fluid density and a p is the submerged projected area of the platform concerning the transverse direction to the flow the force in the in line direction f h x t can be divided into two parts one related to the average drag force static component and a second one related to the dynamic drag force oscillatory component thus the average part of the drag can be described as in equation 7 7 c d f h x t 1 2 ρ a p u 2 where f h x t is the average total hydrodynamic force in the in line direction and c d is the average drag coefficient analogously the moment acting on the system around the vertical axis m h z t or yaw moment is commonly represented in the form of the nondimensional yaw moment coefficient c m t as in equation 8 8 c m t m h z t 1 2 ρ a p b u 2 where b is the beam of the platform and s is the distance between the center of columns i e b s l the non dimensional dependent lift coefficient c l and yaw moment coefficient c m were respectively evaluated as the rms value of the non dimensional force and moment time histories figs 10 and 11 show the view of the submerged projected area for the different incidence angles for sqr and cc models respectively table 4 presents the respective values of the submerged projected area the force coefficient results will be presented using the respective area for each incidence angle 4 5 added mass as usual considering that the component of the total hydrodynamic force in phase with the acceleration is related to the added mass from a standard frequency domain analysis it is possible to evaluate the added mass coefficient at the characteristic frequency of motion as proposed by vikestad fujarra and pesce 2002 the added mass coefficient c a for the motions in the transverse direction can be written as in equation 9 where ℜ represents the real part of the complex number and f f t represents the fast fourier transform operator 9 c a ℜ f f t f h y t f f t y t m 5 experimental results in this section results of the analysis of the vim phenomenon of the dd ss will be presented concerning the column design and roughness effects the results of nondimensional amplitudes for the transverse and in line directions shown in this section were calculated as rms values the nondimensional amplitudes were calculated using the face dimension of the column l 5 1 column shape effects in this sub section all the results are presented concerning the comparison between two different column section shapes in particular square rounded and circular from here sqr model will denominate the dd ss model with rounded square column sections and cc model will denominate the dd ss model with circular column sections all the results are presented as a function of the reduced velocity calculated using the natural period of the motion in the transverse direction in still water v r u t 0 y d unless specified otherwise fig 12 presents the results of the nondimensional rms amplitude for the motion in the transverse direction for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the amplitudes in the transverse direction were higher for the cc model than for the sqr models except for the 45 deg incidence considering the sqr model the highest transverse amplitudes occurred for incidences other than 0 the maximum amplitude for 0 deg incidence was a y l 0 2 for the highest reduced velocity tested v r 28 for 0 deg incidence no lock in region could be defined on the other hand the lock in region was observed in the range 5 v r 10 for 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the maximum amplitude for these cases was a y l 0 35 considering the cc model the highest transverse amplitude occurred for 0 deg incidence and it was equal to a y l 0 45 this value is higher than the maximum observed for the sqr model the lock in region could be found for all incidence angles tested 5 v r 10 outside the lock in region v r 10 the second increase in transverse amplitudes was observed for 22 5 and 45 deg incidences around v r 15 this behavior was due the higher yaw motion amplitudes found in these reduced velocities range for the same cc model case i e a coupling between the transverse and yaw motions this behavior will be better explaining later using figs 12 and 14 together for reduced velocities v r 15 remaining amplitudes of transverse motions were observed fig 13 presents the results of the nondimensional rms amplitude for the motion in the in line direction for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the amplitudes in the in line direction were lower than the transverse ones for all cases moreover the amplitudes in the in line direction were higher for the scr model than for the cc model except for the 0 deg incidence in which they are similar concerning the cc model the in line amplitudes showed to be similar for all incidence angles and apparently increased with increasing the reduced velocity yet the values of a x l did not reach 0 15 concerning the sqr model the results for 22 5 deg incidence showed to be higher than other incidences in the lock in range of transverse motions with the maximum value around a x l 0 15 the in line amplitudes increased with increasing reduced velocities for 45 deg incidence fig 14 presents the results of the rms amplitude of the yaw motion for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the reduced velocity in these cases was calculated using the natural period of the yaw motion in still water t 0 y a w the maximum yaw amplitudes observed were a y a w 3 5 degrees and a y a w 2 5 degrees for the cc and sqr models respectively for most reduced velocities v r 10 the cc model presented yaw amplitudes higher than that one for the sqr model comparing the yaw motion amplitudes for sqr and cc models the behavior was completely different it was not possible to define a lock in region for the sqr model the yaw amplitudes appeared to increase with increasing reduced velocity for all incidence angles with no evidence of falling the slightly higher amplitudes occurred for 0 deg incidence on the other hand the lock in region was well defined for the cc model with 22 5 and 45 deg incidence yaw amplitudes up to 3 5 were found in the region of reduced velocities 5 v r 8 the yaw amplitudes were different for the cc model with 0 deg incidence in this case a resonance behavior was not observed and the amplitudes were lower as compared with higher incidence angles only for highest reduced velocities v r 8 the yaw amplitudes were higher it is important to notice that the yaw response of the cc model disclosed a typical lock in phenomenon extending from reduced velocity 4 to 10 clearly showing that the vim in this degree of freedom is analogous to that in the transverse direction therefore it is a phenomenon similar to the viv typically found in cylinders to confirm the coupling between the transverse and yaw motion for the cc model with 22 5 and 45 degrees of incidence the reduced velocity for the yaw motion was also calculated using the natural period of the motion in the transverse direction as in fig 15 in this case the peaks of yaw amplitudes were observed to correspond to the same reduced velocity that occurred the second increase in the transverse amplitudes as commented previously a typical linear decrease in the ratio between the characteristic motion period and the natural period in still water represents a synchronization between the frequency of vortex shedding and the frequency of the motion details about viv on circular cylinders with two degree of freedom and the small mass ratio can be seen in works such as jauvtis and williamson 2004 gonçalves et al 2013 and gonçalves and fujarra 2014 fig 16 presents the results of the nondimensional characteristic period for the motions in the transverse direction t y t 0 y for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences except for 0 deg incidence the range of synchronization periods was larger for the sqr model than for the cc model for the motions in the transverse direction considering the sqr model with 0 deg incidence t y t 0 y was different compared with the other incidence angles the same behavior was observed for the transverse amplitude results see also fig 12 considering the cc model the behavior of t y t 0 y was similar for all incidence angles at v r 10 in this range of velocities the lock in of transverse motions occurred on the other hand a couple of the transverse and yaw motions occurred for v r 10 altering the behavior of the transverse periods in this range fig 17 presents the results of the nondimensional characteristic period for yaw motions t y a w t 0 y a w for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the reduced velocity in these cases was calculated using the natural period of the yaw motion in still water t 0 y a w the same behavior of synchronization between the vortex shedding frequency and the motions in the transverse direction could be observed for yaw motions the range of reduced velocities in which this behavior occurs was well characterized at 5 v r 9 in this region the ratio of yaw periods decreased linearly it was hard to determine the marked yaw period for v r 5 due to the low yaw amplitudes in this range of reduced velocities regarding the sqr model t y a w t 0 y a w showed a possible synchronization region around 5 v r 9 when considering the yaw natural period to calculate the reduced velocities this behavior was not feasible to determine only with the yaw motion amplitude results regarding the cc model t y a w t 0 y a w corroborated to confirm the couple between the transverse and yaw motions in the region of reduced velocities 5 v r 8 since an increase in the transverse amplitudes occurred in this reduced velocity range as pointed in fig 15 all the force coefficients were calculated using the corresponding projected area for each incidence angle fig 18 presents the results of the nondimensional mean drag coefficient c d for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the maximum drag coefficients observed were c d 2 0 and c d 1 6 for cc and sqr models respectively the values were constant for all the reduced velocities range tested except in the region which the dynamic amplification of the drag occurred the dynamic drag amplification is due to the synchronization range present in the resonance phenomenon that provides larger motion in the transverse direction this behavior was discussed in other vim of ss tests such observed by rijken et al 2004 rijken and leverette 2008 and tahar and finn 2011 the maximum value of c d occurred for 0 deg incidence a mean trend around c d 1 0 for v r 10 was observed with an exception for 0 deg incidence and sqr model with 45 deg incidence in which the values were larger c d 1 5 these values are following the results published by tahar and finn 2011 and gonçalves et al 2012b for a ss it is worth nothing the dynamic drag amplification in the range 5 v r 10 for the cc model fig 19 presents the results of the nondimensional rms lift coefficient c l for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the maximum lift coefficients observed were c l 0 6 and c l 0 3 for cc and sqr models respectively the c l was higher in the lock in region observed for the motion in the transverse direction outside this range v r 10 the c l presented low values in general lift force values for the cc model were higher than for the sqr model considering the cc model the values were higher for lower incidence angles on the other hand considering the sqr model the values were higher for higher incidence angles the highest values of c l were concentrated in the velocity range in which the lock in range could be defined fig 20 presents the results of the nondimensional rms yaw moment coefficient c m for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the reduced velocity in these cases was calculated using the natural period of the yaw motion in still water t 0 y a w the c m values were higher for cc models than for sqr models except in 0 deg incidence the maximum yaw moment coefficients observed were c m 0 09 and c m 0 07 for sqr and cc models respectively the c m was higher in the lock in region observed for the yaw motion 4 v r 8 considering the sqr model c m value was different for 0 deg incidence and higher than for other incidences on the other hand considering the cc model the behavior was the opposite the c m values were higher for 22 5 and 45 deg incidences than 0 for these cases in the same way as for lift coefficient the yaw moment coefficients were higher and concentrated in the lock in region for this degree of freedom fig 21 presents the results of nondimensional added mass coefficient for the motions in the transverse direction c a for sqr and cc models with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences the added mass results in the transverse direction showed the same asymptotic decrease observed for circular cylinders as commented in fujarra and pesce 2002 in a range up to v r 15 in most cases the results corroborated to show the resonance behavior of the motion in the transverse direction the zero crossing occurred for the cc model with 0 deg incidence and sqr model with 22 5 and 45 deg incidences which confirms the end of the resonance of the transverse motion around this reduced velocity the values of added mass did not agree with the typical behavior when the couple between the transverse and the yaw motions occurred mainly as in 22 5 and 45 deg incidences for cc models 5 2 roughness effects in this sub section all the results are presented concerning the comparison between three different roughness level namely bare hull the model without roughness insertion was considered as bare low roughness level k l 3 9 10 3 and high roughness level k l 7 8 10 3 figs 22 24 present the results of the nondimensional rms amplitude for the motion in the transverse direction for the sqr model with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences respectively according to those results the roughness level for the sqr model showed a small influence on the transverse response of the vim phenomenon apparently once the amplitude trend was the same for the different roughness level on each particular incidence angle and the peak amplitude was quite similar in the lock in range 5 v r 10 the models with roughness level shifted the begin of the synchronization to earlier reduced velocities implying in higher amplitudes for lower reduced velocities as can be seen in the results for 22 5 and 45 deg incidences in these cases the resonance behavior is probably more related to the clear separation points on the corners of the squared section of the columns than to the higher roughness surface level of the columns the separation points cannot be confirmed fixed because the squared columns edges are rounded and the separation points can change a little which explain the quite difference between roughness levels for better understanding these combined effects specific tests might be conducted as flow visualization piv for instance or cfd simulations figs 25 27 present the results of the rms amplitude of yaw motion for the sqr model with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences respectively the results are shown as a function of the reduced velocity calculated using the natural period of the yaw motion in still water v r u t 0 y a w d according to those results the roughness level for the sqr model showed a small influence on the yaw response and kept the amplitude trend similar for each incidence angle as analogous to the transverse behavior contrasting to the transverse amplitudes the models with roughness level shift the begin of the synchronization to later reduced velocities implying in lower amplitudes for higher reduced velocities in the lock in range 5 v r 10 as can be seen in the results for 0 and 22 5 deg incidences the largest differences were observed for 0 deg incidence figs 28 30 present the results of the nondimensional rms amplitude for the motion in the transverse direction for the cc model dd ss model with circular columns with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences respectively by comparing the transverse results important differences due to the roughness level were observed only in the results for 45 deg incidence in the lock in range 5 v r 10 see fig 30 for the other incidences the transverse response was quite similar in the range of v r 17 and substantial differences were observed for reduced velocities higher than 17 see figs 28 and 29 for 45 deg incidence the increase of the surface level modified the peak amplitude for the bare hull a y l 0 27 in the lock in region of the motion in the transverse direction in such cases the low roughness level increased the peak amplitude to a y l 0 35 and the high roughness level decreased the peak amplitude to a y l 0 19 this behavior can be attributed to the changes in the separation point around the circular section of the columns and consequently variations in the wake geometry circular sections are more suitable to changes in the separation points than square sections and this fact ostensibly is responsible for the larger differences in the transverse amplitudes for cc model than for sqr model figs 31 33 present the results of the rms amplitude of the yaw motion for the cc model with 0 22 5 and 45 deg incidences respectively the yaw amplitudes for cc model showed larger differences for 0 deg incidence in which the peak values were higher for higher roughness level than bare hull case i e maximum yaw values around 3 and 2 for models with roughness and bare hull respectively the yaw amplitude differences were larger for cc model than sqr model this behavior can corroborate the statement that the separation points and wakes are more affected by the roughness level for circular sections the wake interference is more sensitive for 0 deg incidence unsurprisingly the changes in the roughness level affected the wakes and the yaw motion directly 6 conclusions as pointed out the vim of semi submersibles is an important issue to be considered in the design of risers and mooring line systems due to a possible decrease in the fatigue life of those components to better understand the effect of the design of the column shape and the surface roughness level vim tests with 1 100 small scale models of two dd ss platforms specifically rounded square and circular column sections three different roughness level were tested namely bare hull low roughness level k l 3 9 10 3 and high roughness level k l 7 8 10 3 also these effects were evaluated for three different current incidence angles in particular 0 22 5 and 45 degrees of incidence the tests were carried out in the towing tank of the ipt brazil the experimental results comprised amplitudes and frequencies in the in line and the transverse directions as well as yaw motions force coefficient results drag and lift and also added mass were investigated 6 1 column design effects the column shape showed to have a significant effect on the vim response of the dd ss circular columns and rounded square columns presented different behavior regarding transverse and yaw response for various incidence angles the circular columns seemed to result in higher vim response in the transverse direction for all current headings compared with the rounded square columns which is important to consider in the design stage of the semi submersible the transverse amplitudes were the highest for the cc model with the 0 deg incidence in a range of reduced velocities 7 v r 10 and its value was a y l 0 45 additionally the yaw motion amplitudes were highest for the cc model with 22 5 or 45 deg incidences both in a range of reduced velocities 6 v r 8 where its value was a y a w 3 5 degrees a lock in region could be well defined for the motions in the transverse direction for both models and all incidence angles except for the sqr model with 0 deg incidence this fact confirmed a resonance behavior for this degree of freedom another important aspect observed was the existence of a second peak in the transverse amplitude results for cc model with 22 5 and 45 deg incidence in that region of reduced velocities v r 15 a coupling between the transverse and yaw motion occurred due to the existence of amplitude increase at the same time for both degrees of freedom on the other hand the yaw motions presented a precise lock in range only for the cc model with the 22 5 and 45 deg incidences for the sqr model the increase in yaw amplitudes occurred for increasingly reduced velocities the characteristic motion periods corroborated to confirm the existence of a lock in range for transverse and yaw motion in this range of reduced velocities the ratio between motion period and the natural period for each degree of freedom decreased linearly showing the couple between the vortex shedding frequency and the motion frequency moreover the dynamic amplification of the drag could also be observed in the lock in region of transverse motions where the transverse amplitudes are the highest the drag coefficients reached maximum values around 2 0 and reduced velocity around 7 for sqr model with 0 deg incidence the lift and yaw moment coefficients showed the highest values at the lock in range for each degree of freedom the added mass coefficients crossed the zero axes at the end of the lock in region confirming the resonance behavior of the motions in the transverse direction 6 2 roughness effects by comparing the vim response transverse and yaw motions of the bare hull with those with two higher levels of surface roughness no substantial differences were observed for the ss model with rounded square columns even considering three different angles of current incidence for the cc model however differences due to the roughness level were found for the three angles of current incidence particularly regarding the transverse response for both ss models the intermediate level of roughness presented transverse response slightly higher than the models with the highest roughness level this behavior is not entirely understood but seems to be related to changes in the separation points which is quite sensitive to the surface roughness it is hard to give a general guideline on applying roughness in vim model test campaigns based on the results of this test campaign however for rounded square columns it seems to be valid to use the bare hull as the response using different roughness levels is very similar the flow separation is dominated by the edges of the rounded square columns and thus not much variation is observed for circular columns the response using low roughness seems to be higher than for the bare hull for the circular columns the location of separation and transition is not well defined based on the results observed in this test campaign it is good practice to apply a low level of roughness for circular columns to get the most conservative results and to minimize reynolds scaling effects also although not tested it is important to include appurtenances for round columns as they have an effect on the separation locations on the column for rounded square columns this is less necessary but good practice to include them acknowledgements this study was carried out within the vim jip which is run by the partnership between marin and usp and for whose participants the authors are grateful

23661,after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami the effectiveness of fringing reefs in protecting coastlines from tsunami induced inundation has aroused great attention in the post tsunami surveys to better understand the role of fringing reefs in the mitigation of a tsunami hazard laboratory experiments were conducted in a wave flume to study the transformation and run up of tsunami like solitary waves over various fringing reef profiles the effects of incident wave height reef flat submergence lagoon width and reef surface roughness were examined cylinder arrays were employed to create artificial roughness elements on the reef surface empirical formulas based on the experimental data were also proposed for the wave run up the ratio of the reef flat submergence to the incident wave height was always found to be the dominant parameter to characterize the wave run ups over various tested reef profiles subsequently a numerical model based on the improved boussinesq equations including the drag effect of roughness elements was validated by the experimental data the validated model was then applied to investigate the impacts of variations of reef morphologies fore reef slope back reef slope reef flat width reef crest width on the solitary wave run up keywords solitary wave wave run up lagoon width artificial roughness fringing reef 1 introduction tsunami is an extremely destructive natural disaster which can be generated by earthquakes landslides volcanic eruptions and meteorite impacts tsunami damage occurs mostly in the coastal areas where tsunami waves run up or run down the beach overtop or ruin the coastal structures and inundate the coastal towns and villages yao et al 2015 such destructive hazard is devastating as witnessed in both the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and the 2011 east japan tsunami mori et al 2012 titov et al 2005 in addition to establishing global tsunami early warning systems there is also increasing interests in understanding the possible functions of coastal vegetation such as mangrove forest coral reef etc in effective coastal management and hazard mitigation for the countries around the pacific and indian oceans coral reefs are abundant in the tropic and sub tropic regions especially around the low lying atolls among various coral reefs fringing reefs are the most common type as introduced by gourlay 1996 a typical cross shore reef profile can be characterized by a steep offshore fore reef slope and an inshore shallow reef flat there is also possibly a reef crest lying at the reef edge e g yao et al 2017 and or a narrow shallow lagoon existing behind the reef flat e g lowe et al 2009 fringing reefs have been reported as efficient buffers to the wind driven wave energy over decades e g lowe et al 2005a b lugo fernandez et al 1998 péquignet et al 2011 young 1989 however after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami the protective role of reefs in mitigating tsunami waves has begun to arise the attentions of the scholars who conducted the post disaster surveys on tsunami hazards chatenoux and peduzzi 2007 ford et al 2014 mcadoo et al 2011 and many others for example ford et al 2014 observed the tsunami dynamic characteristics within the lagoons and on the surrounding fringing reefs of two mid ocean atolls in the marshall islands after the 2011 tohoku tsunami particularly mcadoo et al 2011 showed an example of the damaged coastal reefs at the upolu island samoa after the 2009 south pacific tsunami caused by an 8 0 magnitude submarine earthquake see their fig 4 most of the existing studies about the impact of coral reefs on the tsunamis were based on the field observations however field observations are not sufficient to quantitatively determine the importance of different reef parameters in blocking tsunami energy kunkel et al 2006 therefore some scholars alternatively resort to the well controlled laboratory experiments comparing to the field observations the laboratory investigations on the interaction between waves and fringing reefs are relatively few and most of them focused only on the transformation of regular waves e g gourlay 1994 yao et al 2013 2017 or irregular waves e g buckley et al 2015 2016 demirbilek et al 2007 nwogu and demirbilek 2010 seelig 1983 among these studies only nwogu and demirbilek 2010 had ever investigated the wave run up over a back reef beach different from using regular and irregular waves to model wind waves a solitary wave has been employed in many related studies to model the leading wave of tsunami because the former can represent many important properties of the latter lin 2004 however laboratory studies on the interaction between tsunami like solitary waves and coral reefs are even fewer we are aware in the literature that only quiroga and cheung 2013 attempted to study the effects of reef roughness on the solitary wave transformation over a laboratory reef profile but the solitary wave run up on the back reef beach was not yet considered conventionally following the studies of wave driven alongshore flows and wave induced setup setdown on beaches analytical solutions based on the radiation stress concept introduced by longuet higgins and stewart 1964 have been widely used to study the wave transformation over one dimensional horizontal 1dh reef profiles e g becker et al 2014 gourlay 1996 tait 1972 vetter et al 2010 yao et al 2017 in recent years the effects of complex bathymetry and different forcing mechanisms have also been modeled by using the two dimensional horizontal 2dh and three dimensional 3d models to study both the waves and the mean flows which are typically coupled by the radiation stress concept e g douillet et al 2001 kraines et al 1998 1999 lowe et al 2009 pomeroy et al 2012 van dongeren et al 2013 among those models a type of computationally efficient and phased resolving model based on the boussinesq type equations is the most pervasive this depth integrated modeling approach employs a polynomial approximation to the vertical profile of velocity field thereby reducing one dimension of the three dimensional problem it has been proved to be able to consider both the nonlinear and dispersive effects at different degrees of accuracy it is found that the improved boussinesq model combined with some semi empirical breaking wave and bottom friction models can well simulate the motions of regular wave skotner and apelt 1999 yao et al 2012 irregular wave nwogu and demirbilek 2010 yao et al 2016 solitary wave roeber et al 2010 roeber and cheung 2012 and infragravity wave su et al 2015 over fringing reefs so far to the best of our knowledge we are only aware of that kunkel et al 2006 implemented a nonlinear shallow water model to study the effects of wave forcing and reef morphology factors i e wave height reef flat submergence lagoon width and reef surface roughness on the wave run up however their numerical model was not verified by any field observations or laboratory data moreover comparing to the nonlinear shallow water equations adopted in their study the boussinesq equations are reported better in simulating the process of wave transformation under deeper water in front of the fore reef slope because of the retention of dispersion terms yao et al 2012 although roeber and cheung 2012 have simulated the solitary wave transformation over a laboratory fringing reef with a boussinesq typed model they did not investigate the wave run up letting alone the effects of lagoon width and reef surface roughness therefore to remedy the numerical study of kunkel et al 2006 we firstly carried out a series of laboratory experiments in a wave flume to investigate the solitary wave transformation and run up over a fringing reef profile by which four aforementioned factors wave height reef flat submergence lagoon width and surface roughness that possibly affect the behaviors of solitary wave transformation and run up are examined in the well controlled laboratory environments we then implemented and validated sophisticated boussinesq type model lynett and liu 2002 to reproduce our laboratory data we finally applied the validated numerical model to further investigate the impacts of reef morphology variations on the solitary wave run up over a back reef beach the remaining of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the experimental setup is described in section 3 the experimental results including the reflective wave height in front of the fore reef slope the transmitted wave height on the reef flat and the wave run up on the back reef beach are analyzed and discussed in section 4 the governing equations numerical scheme boundary conditions and energy dissipation sub models of the adopted numerical model are described the model validation with our laboratory data are presented in section 5 in section 6 the validated model is applied to investigate the effects of reef morphology variations on the wave run up main conclusions of this study are drawn in section 7 2 experimental setup the schematic layout of the experimental arrangement is shown in fig 1 laboratory experiments were conducted in a wave flume of 40 m in length 0 50 m in width and 0 8 m in height at the hydraulics modeling laboratory changsha university of science and technology p r china a servo controlled wave maker was installed at one end of the flume to generate the target waves to establish an idealized reef model that replicates the fringing reef a plane slope of approximate 1 6 was built with the pvc plates at 27 3 m from the wave maker and was truncated to a platform when it reached 0 35 m above the flume bottom a horizontal reef flat of 9 6 m in length follows immediately after the fore reef slope and extends all the way to a back reef beach of 1 6 slope the reef flat width matches the flume width the entire model was firmly held by some stainless steel rods attached to the two walls of the flume to prevent water escaping or coming out from the gaps between the model and the flume walls glass glue was used to fill the gaps meanwhile the connection slots between two adjacent plates or between the slope and the flume bottom were sealed by adhesive tapes as indicated in fig 1 we examined three scenarios based on various laboratory reef profiles and denoted them as scenario 1 scenario 2 and scenario 3 for the convenience of description scenario 1 was for the variations of wave height and reef flat water level as also shown in fig 1 the solitary wave height h at any location is defined as the vertical distance between the maximum surface elevation and the initial still water level at that location based on above idealized reef model a series of solitary wave conditions with a combination of five incident wave heights h 0 0 04 m 0 06 m 0 08 m 0 10 m and 0 12 m and five water depths at deep section of the flume h 0 0 35 m 0 375 m 0 40 m 0 425 m and 0 45 m was tested these water depths corresponded to the reef flat submergences h r 0 m 0 025 m 0 05 m 0 075 m and 0 1 m scenario 2 was for the variations of lagoon width by modifying the idealized reef model we re designed a lagoon at the rear part of the reef flat which was formed by two 1 1 slopes connecting the reef flat and the toe of the back reef beach to the flume bottom respectively four lagoon widths w l 6 4 m 4 8 m 3 2 m and 1 6 m were tested which corresponded to the remaining reef flat width of 3 2 m 4 8 m 6 4 m and 8 m for this scenario we tested the same wave heights as scenario 1 but only under three reef flat submergences of h r 0 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m scenario 3 was for the variations of reef surface roughness based on the idealized reef without lagoon we additionally constructed the artificial roughness elements in a region starting from 1 m seaward of the reef edge to 3 2 m shoreward we chose this design due to the fact that coral colonies were frequently found to aggregate at the reef edge reef crest as a result of the long term exposure to the high energy dissipation associated with the wave breaking where their metabolic rates and biomechanical tolerances of benthic organisms can be significantly enhanced by the strong hydrodynamic gradient madin et al 2006 following lowe et al 2005a we used the cylinder array with different arrangements to model the reef surface roughness it represents a typical coral reef community composed of the coral porites compressa this coral form a complex canopy made up of individual and cylindrical branches however we focus in this study on the wave damping over the canopy rather than the flow characteristics inside the canopy as investigated by lowe et al 2005a thus the possible scale issue to model the canopy flow was not considered we will show in section 4 6 using the numerical simulations that the calibrated friction coefficients in present laboratory settings are compared to those reported in the field observations the physical roughness was realized by the perspex circular tubes with a diameter of d t 1 cm and a height of 3 5 cm which were inserted into the pre drilled holes on a pvc reef flat with 2 5 cm thickness protruding out from the reef flat surface as shown in fig 2 four arrangements of roughness elements cylinder arrays representing a series of cylinder densities were examined the density was estimated by a so called solid volume portion of vegetation tanino and nepf 2008 which gives 1 ϕ v s v with v s being the volume occupied by solid objects in a control volume v using eq 1 the solid volume portions ϕ densities of roughness elements were 0 088 0 066 0 044 and 0 022 respectively the same wave conditions as scenario 1 i e the above combination of five wave heights and five reef flat submergences were tested in this set of experiments the idealized reef model was designed to mimic a typical fringing reef at the marshall islands the dimensions of the fore reef slope and the reef flat the water depths over the reef flat and the incoming wave heights were designed according to the froude similarity with a target geometric scale factor of 1 20 thus at the prototype scale the reef flat width was 192 m which was comparable to those field reef flats at the marshall islands becker et al 2014 the range of incident wave heights was 0 8 2 4 m and it was generally consistent with the observations at these locations during the 2011 tohoku tsunami ford et al 2014 the 0 2 0 m reef flat submergence also fell in the tidal ranges reported at these reef sites becker et al 2014 and the 50 cm roughness element height was representative for a rough reef surface lowe et al 2005a b the surface elevations were measured at eight cross shore locations g1 g8 as shown in fig 1 the ultrasonic sensors general acoustics ltd germany which are non intrusive water level sensors with an accuracy of 0 1 mm were used with a sampling frequency of 50 hz this kind of sensor allows us to measure the free surface elevations in the shallow region on the reef flat g1 was selected at offshore of the fore reef slope to measure the incident wave height h 0 g2 was located at the toe of the fore reef slope g3 was placed at the middle of the fore reef to monitor the wave shoaling g4 was put at the reef edge to measure the breaking waves at the reef edge to measure the transmitted wave height close to the shoreline g8 was located at 0 2 m away from the toe of the back reef beach when there was no lagoon scenarios 1 and 3 whereas it was always put in the middle of the lagoon if the lagoon existed scenario 2 for all scenarios g5 to g7 were equally spaced between g4 and g8 to measure the water level across the reef marker lines with a spacing of 1 cm have been drawn on the back reef beach slope to capture the wave run up a video webcam logitech ltd switzerland with a resolution of 1280 pixel 720 pixel and a frame rate of 30 hz was employed to record the process of water uprush on the slope the location of the ccd camera was shifted case by case to guarantee that the shoreline could be well captured by the field of view of the camera wave run up r is defined as the maximum elevation of wave uprush above still water level see also fig 1 it was determined by taking the averaged upmost waterline on the slope in the camera images the error in measured inundation line was observed to be less than 1 cm within two adjacent marker lines corresponding to the vertical run up height of less than 1 67 mm each wave condition was run for at least three times and the data for subsequent analysis in this study are based on the mean values of three runs 3 experimental results 3 1 wave height variation across the reef to investigate the wave transformation across the idealized reef fig 3 a and b displays the normalized wave heights h i h 0 h i represents the wave height at i th wave gauge location and h 0 is the incident wave height at g1 g8 across the reef with different h 0 under the fixed reef flat submergence h r 0 05 m and with different h r under the fixed h 0 0 08 m respectively in both figures when solitary waves travelled over the fore reef slope g2 g3 wave heights increased due to the shoaling effect at the reef edge g4 wave heights started to decrease rapidly due to the onset of wave breaking around g4 except for the case of h r 0 10 m in fig 3b which can be explained by the fact that the wave breaking for that case was observed taking place at a location between g5 and g6 the surfzone process for all cases was completed at a location shoreward of g6 after this process wave heights damped very slowly due only to the bottom friction on the reef flat g7 g8 meanwhile fig 3a reveals that h i h 0 along the reef flat decreased with the increase in h 0 indicating that a smaller wave had a larger wave transmission on the reef flat fig 3b shows that h r appeared to have significant effect on h i h 0 on the reef flat this was due to the fact that the reduction of h r enhanced the energy dissipation through both the depth limited wave breaking and the bottom friction for the reefs with the lagoon and with the roughness elements fig 3c and d shows the variation of h i h 0 across the reef with different lagoon widths w l and different densities of roughness elements ϕ respectively under a typical solitary wave of h 0 0 08 m and h r 0 05 m note that both cases with w l 0 and ϕ 0 corresponded to the idealized reef overall the trends of cross reef variation of h i h 0 in both figures were similar to those of the idealized reef in fig 3a and b in addition the lagoon width seemed to have little influence on the wave height attenuation on the reef flat g5 g7 as well as in the deeper lagoon g8 the lagoon may affect the transmitted wave height through two mechanisms on one hand when wave travelled into the deep lagoon wave energy was re distributed vertically leading to a decrease in wave height according to the energy conservation along the water depth on the other hand deeper water depth suffered less frictional damping compared to the reef without lagoon these two mechanics counteracted with each other thus no definite relationship between h i h 0 and w l could be observed in contrast the wave run up on the back reef beach should not be affected by the first mechanism and it is indeed related to w l as will be shown in section 3 3 as for the effect of reef surface roughness it can be found that the presence of roughness elements damped the wave height dramatically compared to the idealized reef ϕ 0 but the decrease in transmitted wave height on the reef flat g7 and g8 was not as significant as in wave run up also will be shown in section 3 3 when the roughness density varied from ϕ 0 022 to 0 088 the pattern of wave height variation along the reef in this section was generally in agreement with that in previous studies for wind wave transformation over fringing reefs e g demirbilek et al 2007 gourlay 1996 yao et al 2012 3 2 wave reflection in front of the fore reef slope when the solitary wave interacted with our laboratory fringing reef profile a portion of wave energy was expected to be reflected back by the fore reef slope for example the time series of free surface elevation η measured by the offshore wave gauge g1 under a typical solitary wave condition h 0 0 08 m and h r 0 05 m was shown in fig 4 a it can be observed that the second peak right after the leading solitary wave was due to wave reflection from the fore reef slope similar to the incident wave we estimated the reflected wave height h r as the vertical distance between the second peak elevation and the initial still water level η 0 thus the value of h r may be affected by the tail wave oscillations after the leading solitary wave the variation of normalized reflective wave height at g1 h r h 0 i e the reflection coefficient with the normalized incident wave height h 0 h 0 indicating the incident wave nonlinearity for the idealized reef was given by fig 4b for most cases particularly those with larger reef flat submergence h r the values of h r h 0 tended to be constant and they were generally less than 0 1 indicating that wave reflection was insignificant at higher water level in that more wave energy associated with the mass transport could be transmitted over the reef flat when h r became less than 0 025 m the values of h r h 0 decreased with the increase of h 0 h 0 until they approached to the constant values at around h 0 h 0 0 3 which was expected because larger waves induce more mass transport to the reef flat thus less energy was reflected back when the reef flat wave level was kept unaltered for the reefs with the lagoon fig 4c shows that the variation of h r h 0 with h 0 h 0 is similar to the idealized reef fig 4b because the lagoon was located shoreward of the reef flat and it did not affect the wave reflection on the fore reef slope however for the reefs with the roughness elements locating around the reef edge fig 4d wave reflection was notably reduced compared to that without the roughness particularly at smaller h 0 h 0 this kind of reduction was due to the additional energy dissipation associated with the turbulence within the gaps among the elements when incident wave interacted with the roughness elements locating on the upper part of the fore reef slope 3 3 wave transmission on the reef flat and run up on the back reef beach the tsunami wave height near the shoreline is frequently used in the literature to assess the risk of a tsunami hazard since the wave run up on the beach depends largely on the local topography therefore we firstly shows the variation of dimensionless transmitted wave height at g8 the reef flat sampling location closest to the back reef beach h 8 h 0 i e the transmission coefficient with the normalized incident wave height h 0 h 0 indicating the incident wave nonlinearity for the idealized reef in fig 5 a it reveals that the values of h 8 h 0 ranged from 0 to 1 4 indicating that the fringing reef may not always serve as a damper to the incident wave height whereas it may also function as an amplifier h 8 h 0 dropped rapidly with the growth of h 0 h 0 under larger reef flat submergences h r but this decreasing trend was less obvious under relatively smaller h r for the zero reef flat submergence h r 0 h 8 h 0 started to increase with the increasing h 0 h 0 but no wave run up could be observed for small waves because they may be not large enough to conquer the frictional resistance on the reef flat meanwhile h 8 h 0 increased significantly with the increase in h r under similar h 0 h 0 the occurrences of h 8 h 0 1 normally appeared for smaller h 0 h 0 under larger h r because when small waves transformed over the reef flat under higher tidal levels wave height attenuation due to both the wave breaking and the bottom friction may be insufficient to cancel out the rise of wave height due to the wave shoaling on the fore reef slope since such wave height amplification only occurred for small waves we suggest that no special attention is needed to be paid to such cases during the risk assessment on the tsunami hazard we then plot the corresponding normalized wave run up on the back reef beach r h 0 against h 0 h 0 in fig 5b it was anticipated that the variation of r h 0 with h 0 h 0 followed the similar trend of h 8 h 0 the values of r h 0 can reach up to 3 6 within our tested range of h r indicating that the solitary wave run up height on the back reef beach can be several times higher than the offshore incident wave height practically under large water level on the reef flat this means special attention should be paid to the scenario when a tsunami event coincides with the high tidal level in the coastal plan and management for tsunami hazard mitigation as we discussed in section 3 1 h 8 was not very sensitive either to the lagoon width for the reefs with the lagoon or to the density of roughness elements for the reefs with the roughness elements within our tested range so we only show the variation of r h 0 with h 0 h 0 for these two types of reef profiles in fig 6 a and b respectively overall the dependences of r h 0 on both h 0 h 0 and h r were similar to those for the idealized reef in fig 5b when comparing among different lagoon widths w l r h 0 increased with the increasing w l particularly under w l 6 4 m this was due to the fact that a deeper and wider lagoon could exert less frictional damping on the waves above compared to the shallow reef flat in view of the artificial reef roughness in fig 6b although less obvious we could still observed that r h 0 decreased with the increase in the density of roughness elements ϕ note that no wave run up could be found when the initial reef flat submergence h r 0 was smaller than the roughness element height 2 5 cm because aside from the wave breaking dissipation the remaining wave energy had been dissipated within the element zone the results obtained in this section highlight that the presence of coral communities plays a positive role in reducing the tsunami induced coastal inundation while the presence of a lagoon has adverse impacts on the mitigation of inundation 3 4 more about the wave run up for the traditional plane beaches the following power law formula is frequently used to characterize the water run up under the action of solitary waves 2 r h 0 β 1 h 0 h 0 β 2 where the coefficients β 1 and β 2 include the effects of various dissipation mechanics synolakis 1987 derived that β 1 2 831 cot θ and β 2 5 4 where θ is the inclination angle of the plane slope figs 5 and 6 have shown that no uniform collapse of r h 0 with h 0 h 0 which means eq 2 is no longer valid indicating that the control factor for the wave transformation on the reef flat and the subsequent run up on the back reef beach is different from that for the wave run up directly on a sloping beach for the fringing reefs nwogu and demirbilek 2010 investigated the irregular wave run up experimentally and proposed an empirical formula in the form of 3 r h m 0 λ 1 ξ 2 λ 2 where h m0 is the deep water zero moment spectral wave height ξ is the surf similarity parameter which is the ratio of the bottom slope to the square root of wave steepness and λ 1 and λ 2 are the fitting values depending on the relative reef flat submergence h r h 0 although this formula is only suitable for wind waves it suggests that h r h 0 is an important factor to characterize the wave run up over the back reef beach other laboratory studies also revealed that h r h 0 was a key parameter to determine the breaking wave properties in the reef surf zone yao et al 2013 as well as the wave induced setup on the reef flat gourlay 1996 yao et al 2017 inspired by these studies and bearing in mind the importance of h r h 0 we proposed empirical relations between the normalized wave run up r h 0 and the relative reef flat submergence h r h 0 based on the power law relationship similar to eq 2 for the idealized reef where the effects of wave height and reef flat submergence were examined we give 4 r h 0 a 1 h r h 0 b 1 c 1 a best fit of eq 4 to the experimental data for the idealized reef yields a 1 1 419 b 1 0 866 and c 1 0 4 with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 98 note that the constant c 1 was required to represent the data of zero reef flat submergence i e h r 0 in view of the reefs with the lagoon the influence of lagoon width w l should be taken into consideration we normalized w l by the total reef flat width of the idealized reef w t i e the reef flat width plus the lagoon width then our suggested power law formula takes the following form 5 r h 0 a 2 h r h 0 b 2 w l w t c 2 d 2 a best fit of eq 5 to the experimental data for the reefs with the lagoon arrives a 2 1 758 b 2 0 494 c 2 0 063 and d 2 0 274 with r 2 0 96 with regard to the reefs with the roughness elements we found that the reef roughness submergence h r i e the reef flat submergence minus the roughness element height rather than h r was more appropriate to collapse the data by adding the element density ϕ as a new parameter in the power law to account for the effect of artificial roughness we suggest 6 r h 0 a 3 h r h 0 b 3 ϕ c 3 d 3 a best fit of eq 6 to the experimental data for the reefs with the roughness yields a 3 1 654 b 3 0 954 c 3 0 052 and d 3 0 395 with r 2 0 99 note that the cases with r 0 under h r 0 in fig 6b were discarded in the fitting process fig 7 a c shows the comparisons of the measured wave run ups and the predicted wave run ups based on our proposed empirical formulas i e eqs 4 6 for the three scenarios receptively the overall goodness of fit with all values of r 2 0 96 as aforementioned confirms that the adopted power law relations are appropriate to describe our wave run up data compared to the values of b 1 to b 3 the values of c 2 and c 3 are much smaller and close to zero indicating that h r h 0 rather than w l or ϕ is the most dominant parameter to characterize the wave run ups over all tested profiles of the fringing reefs since h 0 and h r are related to the incident wave forcing and the local reef morphology respectively the effects of various reef morphologies other than the lagoon width and the roughness on the solitary wave run up will be further studied to supplement the laboratory results via a validated numerical model in the subsequent sections 4 numerical model 4 1 governing equations letting the x coordinate in the direction of wave propagation and t to denote the time the effect of the artificial reef roughness can be modeled by adding a drag term r d accounting for the total drag force per unit bottom area in the boussinesq equations proposed by lynett and liu 2002 7 η t x h 0 η u f c 0 8 u t u u x g η x f m r d r f d r b d 0 where the streamwise horizontal velocity u can be evaluated at z z a with z 0 531 h 0 nwogu 1993 g is the gravity acceleration d h 0 η is the total instantaneous water depth r f and r b are ad hoc dissipative terms accounting for the bottom friction and the wave breaking respectively sub models for r f and r b will be discussed below f c and f m are the boussinesq correction terms to the nonlinear shallow water equations since we used vertical cylinders to model the roughness elements the drag term r d which was only kept in the artificial roughness zone could be obtained from the morison equation morison et al 1950 with the inertial term ignored as 9 r d 1 2 c d n t d t u p u p where d t is the diameter of cylinders n t is the number of cylinders per unit bottom area c d is the drag coefficient of individual roughness element and u p is the local pore velocity normal to the cylinders similar approaches had been applied in modeling the wave interaction with mangrove forest e g huang et al 2011 iimura and tanaka 2012 the pore velocity u p can be related to u by 10 u p u 1 ϕ where ϕ is the density of roughness elements note that we set r d 0 when the reefs without artificial roughness were simulated 4 2 numerical scheme the above equations were solved using a finite difference scheme on a structured grid a scheme of third order adams bashforth predictor and fourth order adams moulton corrector was used for time marching the implicit corrector step must be iterated until a convergence criterion was satisfied all spatial derivatives were differenced to the fourth order accuracy yielding a model which was numerically accurate to δ t 4 in time and δ x 4 in space for more details of the solver see lynett and liu 2002 4 3 sub models of the wave breaking and the bottom friction it is well known that the depth integrated boussinesq type models cannot describe the overturning of a free surface and the detailed wave breaking process hence several empirical models have been proposed for the wave breaking in the surf and swash zones the most common approach is to add an ad hoc dissipation sub model to the momentum equation this approach requires an energy dissipation mechanism and a trigger mechanism for the initiation of wave breaking in this study the eddy viscosity type formulation proposed by kennedy et al 2000 was used to model the wave energy dissipation caused by the wave breaking the model had been validated for fringing reefs by yao et al 2012 there are four empirical parameters in the model and see appendix a for details the following set of empirical parameters was chosen δ 6 0 α 1 0 65 α 2 0 08 α 3 8 as suggested by lynett and liu 2002 the bottom friction r f was calculated by the quadratic friction law 11 r f g n 2 d 1 3 u u where values of the manning coefficient n ranging from 0 01 to 0 1 may be found in the literature e g akan 2006 for the commonly used surface materials 4 4 boundary and initial conditions two types of numerical boundary conditions may be applied at the ends of the computational domain the reflective or no flux boundary condition and the radiation or open boundary condition for the latter sponge layers are frequently used to effectively damp the energy of outgoing waves the sponge layer was typically applied in a manner similar to that recommended by kirby et al 1998 the extrapolating moving boundary algorithm proposed by lynett et al 2002 was used to describe the wave run up and run down processes near the coastline internal source methods are frequently employed as efficient and accurate methods for the numerical wave generation the method using a distributed source function in the continuity equation as proposed by wei et al 1999 was adopted in this study the initial condition assumed no motion of wave or current in the computational domain 4 5 numerical setup referring to fig 1 the numerical domain was established to reproduce the main aspects of the laboratory setup the entire computational domain was 30 3 m in length where the fore reef slope and the back reef beach started from 15 m to 26 7 m away from the left boundary of the computational domain respectively the initial solitary wave was internally generated at 10 m away from the toe of the fore reef slope to ensure the absorption of reflective waves a dissipative sponge layer which had a width of 1 25 times of the incident wave length was placed adjacent to the left boundary the solitary wave length is theoretically infinite but for practical use its wave length l can be estimated by a distance containing 95 of the total mass i e l 2 12 h 0 h 0 h 0 dean and dalrymple 1991 which gave 2 20 m for the worst case h 0 0 04 m and h 0 0 35 m in the present study in order to conserve the mass in the computational domain the right boundary was backed by a solid wall the time step δ t used in the simulations was determined by the courant number c r c δ t δ x where c is the wave phase speed and δ x is the grid size c r 0 2 was used in the simulations which ensured the numerical stability and convergence for all cases normally a grid size of δ x 2 5 cm was found to be sufficient to discretize the computational domain for this study which gave the nodes per incident wave length n ranging from 150 to 200 no significant differences in terms of the wave height and run up were observed with the further increase of grid sizes also to ensure the theoretical validity for the boussinesq equations all simulations used a 4 point filter to smooth the curvature of the rapidly varying bathymetry such as at the toes of the fore reef slope and the back reef beach 4 6 calibration of the bottom friction coefficient and the drag coefficient in this study the bottom friction coefficient n needs to be calibrated first since the wave run up on a slope was very sensitive to the slope roughness lynett et al 2002 we assumed a uniform friction from the deep section of the flume across the reef profile including the lagoon if it exits and all the way to the back reef slope by considering that both the glass flume bottom and the pvc reef surface were very smooth and they were reported to have a similar manning coefficient of n 0 01 in the literature e g munson et al 2006 based on the idealized reef we firstly adjusted the input of incident wave height to ensure that the computed wave heights at g1 exactly mimicked the experimental measurement for each wave condition and we then calibrated n by seeking a best match of the transmitted wave height at the most shoreward reef flat location g8 between the simulations and measurements for all tested conditions through the trial and error process a best value of n 0 017 was found to sufficiently reproduce our data for both the idealized reef and the reefs with the lagoon therefore n 0 017 will be used in our subsequent simulations for the reefs with the artificial roughness elements the individual drag coefficient c d also needs to be calibrated in the model in terms of varying the densities of the roughness elements ϕ combined with the above manning coefficient n 0 017 accounting for the bottom friction outside of the artificial roughness zone c d of the roughness element was determined again by seeking a best match between the measured and simulated transmitted wave height at g8 for all tested wave conditions except for h r 0 no wave run up condition table 1 shows that the calibrated values of c d generally fall within the range between 0 06 and 0 38 and most of them are comparable to the wave friction coefficients reported in the previous field survey e g f w 0 24 lowe et al 2005b laboratory e g f w 0 2 buckley et al 2016 and numerical e g f w 0 6 dongeren et al 2013 studies of wind wave transformation over the rough reef surfaces c d depended not only on ϕ but also on the reef flat submergence h r c d generally increased with the decrease in h r under the same ϕ because more frictional dissipation can be aroused by the roughness elements under a shallower h r however unexpectedly c d decreased with the increase in ϕ for the same h r in fact the calibrated bulk drag coefficient c d n t indeed increased with the increase in ϕ where n t is the number of roughness element per unit area since n t increased significantly with increasing ϕ c d for individual roughness element could possibly be reduced 5 model validation 5 1 time series of computed and measured free surface elevations based on the above calibration a typical solitary wave of h 0 0 08 m and h r 0 05 m was selected in this section to illustrate the validity of the numerical model fig 8 a compares the computed and the measured time series free surface elevations at different sampling locations g1 g8 across the reef based on the idealized reef the overall agreement between the simulations and experiments for all eight locations was satisfactory although we used only the wave height at g8 to calibrate the friction coefficient particularly at the offshore of the reef g1 the incident wave was well reproduced when the solitary wave travelled from g2 to g3 on the fore reef slope it got steepened in both the simulation and measurement due to the shoaling effect during the experiments we observed that the wave breaking started at a location right before the reef edge g4 and the surfzone process extended a definite distance on the reef flat until ceased at a certain location between g6 and g7 thus from g5 to g7 the time series of wave records show the saw like profile and a sharp decrease in the maximum free surface elevation such features of the breaking waves were also well captured by the numerical model between g7 and g8 both the predictions and measurements show that wave attenuated very slowly on the reef flat as a result of the bottom friction and the second peak in the wave profile at g8 was due to the wave reflected from the back reef beach fig 8b and c shows the same comparison on the time series of wave records for the reef with the lagoon and with the roughness elements respectively for the former we display the case with w l 1 6 m while for the latter we demonstrate the case with element density of ϕ 0 044 again the model performances for these two scenarios were fairly good notable mismatch only appeared in the lagoon case for which significant tail wave oscillations could be observed at both g7 and g8 in the experiments due to a sharp change of seabed from reef flat to lagoon the adopted model failed to capture such behavior possibly because the seabed in the computation domain deviated from the laboratory at the location of rapidly varying bathymetry which was induced by the smoothing technique we used in the model in fig 8c the presence of the artificial roughness could be also observed to enhance the wave damping from g4 to g8 compared to that of the idealized reef in fig 8a this pattern was again reasonably reproduced by the simulation we finally remark that in each figure the tail of leading solitary wave was below the initial water level in the laboratory data which was due to the water lost to form the generated wave crest around the paddle of the wave maker however such phenomenon was not observed in the numerical results because the internal source method adopted in the numerical model generated the theoretical solitary wave 5 2 computed and measured wave run ups based on the idealized reef the comparisons of the transmitted wave heights h 8 and the wave run ups on the back reef beach r between computation and measurement under different incident wave heights h 0 with the same reef flat submergence h r 0 05 m are given in fig 9 a while their comparisons under different h r with the same h 0 0 08 m are given in fig 9b since the objective of our model calibration as discussed in section 4 6 is to seek a best agreement between the computation and measurement it is anticipated that the values of h 8 can be generally well predicted in both figures the simulations of r were also satisfactory although slight underprediction of r appeared almost for all cases we attribute it to the aforementioned bathymetry smoothing we adopted at the toe of the back reef beach which slightly modified the original beach slope thus affected the wave run up the comparisons between simulations and experiments with different lagoon width w l and different densities of roughness elements ϕ under the same h 0 0 08 m and h r 0 05 m are presented in fig 9c and d respectively again the predicted values of h 8 matched well with their measurements the values of r were also reasonably captured although some under estimation still existed particularly for the reefs with the artificial roughness in fig 9d overall the adopted numerical model has been validated can simulate the wave transformation and run up over fringing reefs in view of its robustness to deal with a series of impact factors h 0 h r w l and ϕ experimentally tested in this study subsequently we will apply the model to examine more reef morphology variations fore reef slope back reef slope reef flat width reef crest width that may affect the wave run up r on the back reef beach 6 model applications a sketch of the tested reef morphologic features is illustrated in fig 10 based on the idealized reef profile 1 6 for both the slopes of fore reef and back reef 9 6 m for the reef length and no reef crest we tested four additional slopes 1 2 1 4 1 8 and 1 10 which all fall within the common range of 1 1 to 1 20 in the reported field observations for both the fore reef and the back reef as well as four additional widths 0 m 4 8 m 14 4 m and 19 2 m for the reef flat we also considered a trapezoidal reef crest locating at the reef edge with its seaward slope matching the fore reef slope and its shoreward slope of 1 1 five reef crest widths 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 3 m 0 4 m and 0 5 m were examined in view that the dimension of reef crest at the field scale is on the magnitude of meters during the model applications each test was run by changing only one morphologic feature at one time while keeping other features same as the idealized reef all tests were conducted under the combination of one solitary wave height h 0 0 08 m and two reef flat submergences h r 0 05 m and 0 1 m fig 11 a shows the variation of wave run up r with different fore reef slopes as fore reef slope became steeper r decreased slightly under both h r suggesting that r was not sensitive to the change of the fore reef slope within the tested range this was because the wave breaking for this case occurred close to the reef edge g4 thus the wave energy dissipation associated with the breaking waves primarily finished on the reef flat although a steeper slope could actually shift the breaking point further shoreward r was more sensitive to the back beach slope as indicated by fig 11b r decreased almost linearly with the growth of back reef beach slope and this trend was consistent with eq 2 as described by synolakis 1987 for a plane slope meanwhile r dropped more notably under deeper h r because it allowed larger transmitted waves according to the depth limited breaking condition and it also meant less friction fig 11c shows the variation of r with the reef flat width note that the zero width approaches to a plane slope in the absence of the reef compared with the plane slope the role of the presence of a reef flat in reducing the coastal wave run up was effective r decreased significantly with the increase in the reef flat width in that a wider reef width could guarantee the completion of the surf zone process as well as caused larger frictional dissipation as for the reef crest width in fig 11d although the presence of a reef crest was reported to be an important factor affecting the wind wave transformation over fringing reefs yao et al 2017 it seemed to have little effect on r under both h r where slight decline of r can only be found under larger tested crest widths this is due to the fact that the solitary wave is very long compared to the reef crest width thus it can transmit freely over the narrow reef crest if the reef crest becomes sufficient wide we can anticipate that it will affect r in a similar way of the reef flat width as shown in fig 11d therefore in this section we conclude that the coastal regions protected by the fringing reefs with steep back reef slopes and narrow reef flats are still at some risks of inundation associated with the wave run up during a tsunami event shimozono et al 2015 also applied a boussinesq type model to simulate wave transformation over shallow fringing reefs and their model was validated by the laboratory experiments of demirbilek et al 2007 their model results suggested that maximum wave run up monotonically decreases with increasing reef width and becomes larger on steeper back reef slopes in the range of narrow reef widths our results based on the solitary waves are generally agreement with their findings although they focused on the spectral waves indicating that the protective effects of the fringing reefs on the coastlines against the tsunami waves are in a way similar to those against the storm surges 7 conclusions a series of laboratory experiments was carried out in a wave flume to study the transformation and run up of tsunami like solitary wave over fringing reefs the effects of different wave forcing and reef morphology factors incident wave height reef flat submergence lagoon width and reef surface roughness were examined based on various profiles of the reefs including the idealized reefs with without the lagoon or the roughness cylinder arrays were employed to create artificial roughness elements on the reef surface results analysis showed that the dimensionless transmitted wave on the reef flat and wave run up on the back reef slope decreased with both the increases in dimensionless incident wave height wave nonlinearity and the reef flat submergence expect under zero submergence the enhanced reef surface roughness reduced the wave run up whereas the enlarged lagoon width tended to raise it empirical formulas were proposed can predict the solitary wave run up over fringing reefs they indicated that the ratio of the reef flat submergence to the incident wave height was always the dominant parameter to characterize the wave run ups over our tested reef profiles a numerical model based on the boussinesq equations was validated to show its capability reproducing our experimental data the artificial roughness was modeled by adding a drag term in the governing equations the model was then applied to investigate the effects of four types of reef morphology variations on the wave run up it shows that the wave run up on the back reef slope was most sensitive to the variation of the reef flat width less sensitive to the back reef slope and almost insensitive to the variations of both the fore reef slope and the reef crest width within our tested ranges natural reefs are far more complex than those studied in the laboratory for a realistic reef site wind waves nearshore currents reef surface porosity etc may also modify the conclusions in this study to a more or less extent nevertheless this study highlights the positive role of a fringing reef in protecting the coastal region against the tsunami hazard however it also tells that a steep beach fringed by a reef with a relatively narrow and smooth reef flat in the presence of lagoon may still have high risk of coastal inundation when subjected to a tsunami event coinciding with a

23661,after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami the effectiveness of fringing reefs in protecting coastlines from tsunami induced inundation has aroused great attention in the post tsunami surveys to better understand the role of fringing reefs in the mitigation of a tsunami hazard laboratory experiments were conducted in a wave flume to study the transformation and run up of tsunami like solitary waves over various fringing reef profiles the effects of incident wave height reef flat submergence lagoon width and reef surface roughness were examined cylinder arrays were employed to create artificial roughness elements on the reef surface empirical formulas based on the experimental data were also proposed for the wave run up the ratio of the reef flat submergence to the incident wave height was always found to be the dominant parameter to characterize the wave run ups over various tested reef profiles subsequently a numerical model based on the improved boussinesq equations including the drag effect of roughness elements was validated by the experimental data the validated model was then applied to investigate the impacts of variations of reef morphologies fore reef slope back reef slope reef flat width reef crest width on the solitary wave run up keywords solitary wave wave run up lagoon width artificial roughness fringing reef 1 introduction tsunami is an extremely destructive natural disaster which can be generated by earthquakes landslides volcanic eruptions and meteorite impacts tsunami damage occurs mostly in the coastal areas where tsunami waves run up or run down the beach overtop or ruin the coastal structures and inundate the coastal towns and villages yao et al 2015 such destructive hazard is devastating as witnessed in both the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and the 2011 east japan tsunami mori et al 2012 titov et al 2005 in addition to establishing global tsunami early warning systems there is also increasing interests in understanding the possible functions of coastal vegetation such as mangrove forest coral reef etc in effective coastal management and hazard mitigation for the countries around the pacific and indian oceans coral reefs are abundant in the tropic and sub tropic regions especially around the low lying atolls among various coral reefs fringing reefs are the most common type as introduced by gourlay 1996 a typical cross shore reef profile can be characterized by a steep offshore fore reef slope and an inshore shallow reef flat there is also possibly a reef crest lying at the reef edge e g yao et al 2017 and or a narrow shallow lagoon existing behind the reef flat e g lowe et al 2009 fringing reefs have been reported as efficient buffers to the wind driven wave energy over decades e g lowe et al 2005a b lugo fernandez et al 1998 péquignet et al 2011 young 1989 however after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami the protective role of reefs in mitigating tsunami waves has begun to arise the attentions of the scholars who conducted the post disaster surveys on tsunami hazards chatenoux and peduzzi 2007 ford et al 2014 mcadoo et al 2011 and many others for example ford et al 2014 observed the tsunami dynamic characteristics within the lagoons and on the surrounding fringing reefs of two mid ocean atolls in the marshall islands after the 2011 tohoku tsunami particularly mcadoo et al 2011 showed an example of the damaged coastal reefs at the upolu island samoa after the 2009 south pacific tsunami caused by an 8 0 magnitude submarine earthquake see their fig 4 most of the existing studies about the impact of coral reefs on the tsunamis were based on the field observations however field observations are not sufficient to quantitatively determine the importance of different reef parameters in blocking tsunami energy kunkel et al 2006 therefore some scholars alternatively resort to the well controlled laboratory experiments comparing to the field observations the laboratory investigations on the interaction between waves and fringing reefs are relatively few and most of them focused only on the transformation of regular waves e g gourlay 1994 yao et al 2013 2017 or irregular waves e g buckley et al 2015 2016 demirbilek et al 2007 nwogu and demirbilek 2010 seelig 1983 among these studies only nwogu and demirbilek 2010 had ever investigated the wave run up over a back reef beach different from using regular and irregular waves to model wind waves a solitary wave has been employed in many related studies to model the leading wave of tsunami because the former can represent many important properties of the latter lin 2004 however laboratory studies on the interaction between tsunami like solitary waves and coral reefs are even fewer we are aware in the literature that only quiroga and cheung 2013 attempted to study the effects of reef roughness on the solitary wave transformation over a laboratory reef profile but the solitary wave run up on the back reef beach was not yet considered conventionally following the studies of wave driven alongshore flows and wave induced setup setdown on beaches analytical solutions based on the radiation stress concept introduced by longuet higgins and stewart 1964 have been widely used to study the wave transformation over one dimensional horizontal 1dh reef profiles e g becker et al 2014 gourlay 1996 tait 1972 vetter et al 2010 yao et al 2017 in recent years the effects of complex bathymetry and different forcing mechanisms have also been modeled by using the two dimensional horizontal 2dh and three dimensional 3d models to study both the waves and the mean flows which are typically coupled by the radiation stress concept e g douillet et al 2001 kraines et al 1998 1999 lowe et al 2009 pomeroy et al 2012 van dongeren et al 2013 among those models a type of computationally efficient and phased resolving model based on the boussinesq type equations is the most pervasive this depth integrated modeling approach employs a polynomial approximation to the vertical profile of velocity field thereby reducing one dimension of the three dimensional problem it has been proved to be able to consider both the nonlinear and dispersive effects at different degrees of accuracy it is found that the improved boussinesq model combined with some semi empirical breaking wave and bottom friction models can well simulate the motions of regular wave skotner and apelt 1999 yao et al 2012 irregular wave nwogu and demirbilek 2010 yao et al 2016 solitary wave roeber et al 2010 roeber and cheung 2012 and infragravity wave su et al 2015 over fringing reefs so far to the best of our knowledge we are only aware of that kunkel et al 2006 implemented a nonlinear shallow water model to study the effects of wave forcing and reef morphology factors i e wave height reef flat submergence lagoon width and reef surface roughness on the wave run up however their numerical model was not verified by any field observations or laboratory data moreover comparing to the nonlinear shallow water equations adopted in their study the boussinesq equations are reported better in simulating the process of wave transformation under deeper water in front of the fore reef slope because of the retention of dispersion terms yao et al 2012 although roeber and cheung 2012 have simulated the solitary wave transformation over a laboratory fringing reef with a boussinesq typed model they did not investigate the wave run up letting alone the effects of lagoon width and reef surface roughness therefore to remedy the numerical study of kunkel et al 2006 we firstly carried out a series of laboratory experiments in a wave flume to investigate the solitary wave transformation and run up over a fringing reef profile by which four aforementioned factors wave height reef flat submergence lagoon width and surface roughness that possibly affect the behaviors of solitary wave transformation and run up are examined in the well controlled laboratory environments we then implemented and validated sophisticated boussinesq type model lynett and liu 2002 to reproduce our laboratory data we finally applied the validated numerical model to further investigate the impacts of reef morphology variations on the solitary wave run up over a back reef beach the remaining of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the experimental setup is described in section 3 the experimental results including the reflective wave height in front of the fore reef slope the transmitted wave height on the reef flat and the wave run up on the back reef beach are analyzed and discussed in section 4 the governing equations numerical scheme boundary conditions and energy dissipation sub models of the adopted numerical model are described the model validation with our laboratory data are presented in section 5 in section 6 the validated model is applied to investigate the effects of reef morphology variations on the wave run up main conclusions of this study are drawn in section 7 2 experimental setup the schematic layout of the experimental arrangement is shown in fig 1 laboratory experiments were conducted in a wave flume of 40 m in length 0 50 m in width and 0 8 m in height at the hydraulics modeling laboratory changsha university of science and technology p r china a servo controlled wave maker was installed at one end of the flume to generate the target waves to establish an idealized reef model that replicates the fringing reef a plane slope of approximate 1 6 was built with the pvc plates at 27 3 m from the wave maker and was truncated to a platform when it reached 0 35 m above the flume bottom a horizontal reef flat of 9 6 m in length follows immediately after the fore reef slope and extends all the way to a back reef beach of 1 6 slope the reef flat width matches the flume width the entire model was firmly held by some stainless steel rods attached to the two walls of the flume to prevent water escaping or coming out from the gaps between the model and the flume walls glass glue was used to fill the gaps meanwhile the connection slots between two adjacent plates or between the slope and the flume bottom were sealed by adhesive tapes as indicated in fig 1 we examined three scenarios based on various laboratory reef profiles and denoted them as scenario 1 scenario 2 and scenario 3 for the convenience of description scenario 1 was for the variations of wave height and reef flat water level as also shown in fig 1 the solitary wave height h at any location is defined as the vertical distance between the maximum surface elevation and the initial still water level at that location based on above idealized reef model a series of solitary wave conditions with a combination of five incident wave heights h 0 0 04 m 0 06 m 0 08 m 0 10 m and 0 12 m and five water depths at deep section of the flume h 0 0 35 m 0 375 m 0 40 m 0 425 m and 0 45 m was tested these water depths corresponded to the reef flat submergences h r 0 m 0 025 m 0 05 m 0 075 m and 0 1 m scenario 2 was for the variations of lagoon width by modifying the idealized reef model we re designed a lagoon at the rear part of the reef flat which was formed by two 1 1 slopes connecting the reef flat and the toe of the back reef beach to the flume bottom respectively four lagoon widths w l 6 4 m 4 8 m 3 2 m and 1 6 m were tested which corresponded to the remaining reef flat width of 3 2 m 4 8 m 6 4 m and 8 m for this scenario we tested the same wave heights as scenario 1 but only under three reef flat submergences of h r 0 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m scenario 3 was for the variations of reef surface roughness based on the idealized reef without lagoon we additionally constructed the artificial roughness elements in a region starting from 1 m seaward of the reef edge to 3 2 m shoreward we chose this design due to the fact that coral colonies were frequently found to aggregate at the reef edge reef crest as a result of the long term exposure to the high energy dissipation associated with the wave breaking where their metabolic rates and biomechanical tolerances of benthic organisms can be significantly enhanced by the strong hydrodynamic gradient madin et al 2006 following lowe et al 2005a we used the cylinder array with different arrangements to model the reef surface roughness it represents a typical coral reef community composed of the coral porites compressa this coral form a complex canopy made up of individual and cylindrical branches however we focus in this study on the wave damping over the canopy rather than the flow characteristics inside the canopy as investigated by lowe et al 2005a thus the possible scale issue to model the canopy flow was not considered we will show in section 4 6 using the numerical simulations that the calibrated friction coefficients in present laboratory settings are compared to those reported in the field observations the physical roughness was realized by the perspex circular tubes with a diameter of d t 1 cm and a height of 3 5 cm which were inserted into the pre drilled holes on a pvc reef flat with 2 5 cm thickness protruding out from the reef flat surface as shown in fig 2 four arrangements of roughness elements cylinder arrays representing a series of cylinder densities were examined the density was estimated by a so called solid volume portion of vegetation tanino and nepf 2008 which gives 1 ϕ v s v with v s being the volume occupied by solid objects in a control volume v using eq 1 the solid volume portions ϕ densities of roughness elements were 0 088 0 066 0 044 and 0 022 respectively the same wave conditions as scenario 1 i e the above combination of five wave heights and five reef flat submergences were tested in this set of experiments the idealized reef model was designed to mimic a typical fringing reef at the marshall islands the dimensions of the fore reef slope and the reef flat the water depths over the reef flat and the incoming wave heights were designed according to the froude similarity with a target geometric scale factor of 1 20 thus at the prototype scale the reef flat width was 192 m which was comparable to those field reef flats at the marshall islands becker et al 2014 the range of incident wave heights was 0 8 2 4 m and it was generally consistent with the observations at these locations during the 2011 tohoku tsunami ford et al 2014 the 0 2 0 m reef flat submergence also fell in the tidal ranges reported at these reef sites becker et al 2014 and the 50 cm roughness element height was representative for a rough reef surface lowe et al 2005a b the surface elevations were measured at eight cross shore locations g1 g8 as shown in fig 1 the ultrasonic sensors general acoustics ltd germany which are non intrusive water level sensors with an accuracy of 0 1 mm were used with a sampling frequency of 50 hz this kind of sensor allows us to measure the free surface elevations in the shallow region on the reef flat g1 was selected at offshore of the fore reef slope to measure the incident wave height h 0 g2 was located at the toe of the fore reef slope g3 was placed at the middle of the fore reef to monitor the wave shoaling g4 was put at the reef edge to measure the breaking waves at the reef edge to measure the transmitted wave height close to the shoreline g8 was located at 0 2 m away from the toe of the back reef beach when there was no lagoon scenarios 1 and 3 whereas it was always put in the middle of the lagoon if the lagoon existed scenario 2 for all scenarios g5 to g7 were equally spaced between g4 and g8 to measure the water level across the reef marker lines with a spacing of 1 cm have been drawn on the back reef beach slope to capture the wave run up a video webcam logitech ltd switzerland with a resolution of 1280 pixel 720 pixel and a frame rate of 30 hz was employed to record the process of water uprush on the slope the location of the ccd camera was shifted case by case to guarantee that the shoreline could be well captured by the field of view of the camera wave run up r is defined as the maximum elevation of wave uprush above still water level see also fig 1 it was determined by taking the averaged upmost waterline on the slope in the camera images the error in measured inundation line was observed to be less than 1 cm within two adjacent marker lines corresponding to the vertical run up height of less than 1 67 mm each wave condition was run for at least three times and the data for subsequent analysis in this study are based on the mean values of three runs 3 experimental results 3 1 wave height variation across the reef to investigate the wave transformation across the idealized reef fig 3 a and b displays the normalized wave heights h i h 0 h i represents the wave height at i th wave gauge location and h 0 is the incident wave height at g1 g8 across the reef with different h 0 under the fixed reef flat submergence h r 0 05 m and with different h r under the fixed h 0 0 08 m respectively in both figures when solitary waves travelled over the fore reef slope g2 g3 wave heights increased due to the shoaling effect at the reef edge g4 wave heights started to decrease rapidly due to the onset of wave breaking around g4 except for the case of h r 0 10 m in fig 3b which can be explained by the fact that the wave breaking for that case was observed taking place at a location between g5 and g6 the surfzone process for all cases was completed at a location shoreward of g6 after this process wave heights damped very slowly due only to the bottom friction on the reef flat g7 g8 meanwhile fig 3a reveals that h i h 0 along the reef flat decreased with the increase in h 0 indicating that a smaller wave had a larger wave transmission on the reef flat fig 3b shows that h r appeared to have significant effect on h i h 0 on the reef flat this was due to the fact that the reduction of h r enhanced the energy dissipation through both the depth limited wave breaking and the bottom friction for the reefs with the lagoon and with the roughness elements fig 3c and d shows the variation of h i h 0 across the reef with different lagoon widths w l and different densities of roughness elements ϕ respectively under a typical solitary wave of h 0 0 08 m and h r 0 05 m note that both cases with w l 0 and ϕ 0 corresponded to the idealized reef overall the trends of cross reef variation of h i h 0 in both figures were similar to those of the idealized reef in fig 3a and b in addition the lagoon width seemed to have little influence on the wave height attenuation on the reef flat g5 g7 as well as in the deeper lagoon g8 the lagoon may affect the transmitted wave height through two mechanisms on one hand when wave travelled into the deep lagoon wave energy was re distributed vertically leading to a decrease in wave height according to the energy conservation along the water depth on the other hand deeper water depth suffered less frictional damping compared to the reef without lagoon these two mechanics counteracted with each other thus no definite relationship between h i h 0 and w l could be observed in contrast the wave run up on the back reef beach should not be affected by the first mechanism and it is indeed related to w l as will be shown in section 3 3 as for the effect of reef surface roughness it can be found that the presence of roughness elements damped the wave height dramatically compared to the idealized reef ϕ 0 but the decrease in transmitted wave height on the reef flat g7 and g8 was not as significant as in wave run up also will be shown in section 3 3 when the roughness density varied from ϕ 0 022 to 0 088 the pattern of wave height variation along the reef in this section was generally in agreement with that in previous studies for wind wave transformation over fringing reefs e g demirbilek et al 2007 gourlay 1996 yao et al 2012 3 2 wave reflection in front of the fore reef slope when the solitary wave interacted with our laboratory fringing reef profile a portion of wave energy was expected to be reflected back by the fore reef slope for example the time series of free surface elevation η measured by the offshore wave gauge g1 under a typical solitary wave condition h 0 0 08 m and h r 0 05 m was shown in fig 4 a it can be observed that the second peak right after the leading solitary wave was due to wave reflection from the fore reef slope similar to the incident wave we estimated the reflected wave height h r as the vertical distance between the second peak elevation and the initial still water level η 0 thus the value of h r may be affected by the tail wave oscillations after the leading solitary wave the variation of normalized reflective wave height at g1 h r h 0 i e the reflection coefficient with the normalized incident wave height h 0 h 0 indicating the incident wave nonlinearity for the idealized reef was given by fig 4b for most cases particularly those with larger reef flat submergence h r the values of h r h 0 tended to be constant and they were generally less than 0 1 indicating that wave reflection was insignificant at higher water level in that more wave energy associated with the mass transport could be transmitted over the reef flat when h r became less than 0 025 m the values of h r h 0 decreased with the increase of h 0 h 0 until they approached to the constant values at around h 0 h 0 0 3 which was expected because larger waves induce more mass transport to the reef flat thus less energy was reflected back when the reef flat wave level was kept unaltered for the reefs with the lagoon fig 4c shows that the variation of h r h 0 with h 0 h 0 is similar to the idealized reef fig 4b because the lagoon was located shoreward of the reef flat and it did not affect the wave reflection on the fore reef slope however for the reefs with the roughness elements locating around the reef edge fig 4d wave reflection was notably reduced compared to that without the roughness particularly at smaller h 0 h 0 this kind of reduction was due to the additional energy dissipation associated with the turbulence within the gaps among the elements when incident wave interacted with the roughness elements locating on the upper part of the fore reef slope 3 3 wave transmission on the reef flat and run up on the back reef beach the tsunami wave height near the shoreline is frequently used in the literature to assess the risk of a tsunami hazard since the wave run up on the beach depends largely on the local topography therefore we firstly shows the variation of dimensionless transmitted wave height at g8 the reef flat sampling location closest to the back reef beach h 8 h 0 i e the transmission coefficient with the normalized incident wave height h 0 h 0 indicating the incident wave nonlinearity for the idealized reef in fig 5 a it reveals that the values of h 8 h 0 ranged from 0 to 1 4 indicating that the fringing reef may not always serve as a damper to the incident wave height whereas it may also function as an amplifier h 8 h 0 dropped rapidly with the growth of h 0 h 0 under larger reef flat submergences h r but this decreasing trend was less obvious under relatively smaller h r for the zero reef flat submergence h r 0 h 8 h 0 started to increase with the increasing h 0 h 0 but no wave run up could be observed for small waves because they may be not large enough to conquer the frictional resistance on the reef flat meanwhile h 8 h 0 increased significantly with the increase in h r under similar h 0 h 0 the occurrences of h 8 h 0 1 normally appeared for smaller h 0 h 0 under larger h r because when small waves transformed over the reef flat under higher tidal levels wave height attenuation due to both the wave breaking and the bottom friction may be insufficient to cancel out the rise of wave height due to the wave shoaling on the fore reef slope since such wave height amplification only occurred for small waves we suggest that no special attention is needed to be paid to such cases during the risk assessment on the tsunami hazard we then plot the corresponding normalized wave run up on the back reef beach r h 0 against h 0 h 0 in fig 5b it was anticipated that the variation of r h 0 with h 0 h 0 followed the similar trend of h 8 h 0 the values of r h 0 can reach up to 3 6 within our tested range of h r indicating that the solitary wave run up height on the back reef beach can be several times higher than the offshore incident wave height practically under large water level on the reef flat this means special attention should be paid to the scenario when a tsunami event coincides with the high tidal level in the coastal plan and management for tsunami hazard mitigation as we discussed in section 3 1 h 8 was not very sensitive either to the lagoon width for the reefs with the lagoon or to the density of roughness elements for the reefs with the roughness elements within our tested range so we only show the variation of r h 0 with h 0 h 0 for these two types of reef profiles in fig 6 a and b respectively overall the dependences of r h 0 on both h 0 h 0 and h r were similar to those for the idealized reef in fig 5b when comparing among different lagoon widths w l r h 0 increased with the increasing w l particularly under w l 6 4 m this was due to the fact that a deeper and wider lagoon could exert less frictional damping on the waves above compared to the shallow reef flat in view of the artificial reef roughness in fig 6b although less obvious we could still observed that r h 0 decreased with the increase in the density of roughness elements ϕ note that no wave run up could be found when the initial reef flat submergence h r 0 was smaller than the roughness element height 2 5 cm because aside from the wave breaking dissipation the remaining wave energy had been dissipated within the element zone the results obtained in this section highlight that the presence of coral communities plays a positive role in reducing the tsunami induced coastal inundation while the presence of a lagoon has adverse impacts on the mitigation of inundation 3 4 more about the wave run up for the traditional plane beaches the following power law formula is frequently used to characterize the water run up under the action of solitary waves 2 r h 0 β 1 h 0 h 0 β 2 where the coefficients β 1 and β 2 include the effects of various dissipation mechanics synolakis 1987 derived that β 1 2 831 cot θ and β 2 5 4 where θ is the inclination angle of the plane slope figs 5 and 6 have shown that no uniform collapse of r h 0 with h 0 h 0 which means eq 2 is no longer valid indicating that the control factor for the wave transformation on the reef flat and the subsequent run up on the back reef beach is different from that for the wave run up directly on a sloping beach for the fringing reefs nwogu and demirbilek 2010 investigated the irregular wave run up experimentally and proposed an empirical formula in the form of 3 r h m 0 λ 1 ξ 2 λ 2 where h m0 is the deep water zero moment spectral wave height ξ is the surf similarity parameter which is the ratio of the bottom slope to the square root of wave steepness and λ 1 and λ 2 are the fitting values depending on the relative reef flat submergence h r h 0 although this formula is only suitable for wind waves it suggests that h r h 0 is an important factor to characterize the wave run up over the back reef beach other laboratory studies also revealed that h r h 0 was a key parameter to determine the breaking wave properties in the reef surf zone yao et al 2013 as well as the wave induced setup on the reef flat gourlay 1996 yao et al 2017 inspired by these studies and bearing in mind the importance of h r h 0 we proposed empirical relations between the normalized wave run up r h 0 and the relative reef flat submergence h r h 0 based on the power law relationship similar to eq 2 for the idealized reef where the effects of wave height and reef flat submergence were examined we give 4 r h 0 a 1 h r h 0 b 1 c 1 a best fit of eq 4 to the experimental data for the idealized reef yields a 1 1 419 b 1 0 866 and c 1 0 4 with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 98 note that the constant c 1 was required to represent the data of zero reef flat submergence i e h r 0 in view of the reefs with the lagoon the influence of lagoon width w l should be taken into consideration we normalized w l by the total reef flat width of the idealized reef w t i e the reef flat width plus the lagoon width then our suggested power law formula takes the following form 5 r h 0 a 2 h r h 0 b 2 w l w t c 2 d 2 a best fit of eq 5 to the experimental data for the reefs with the lagoon arrives a 2 1 758 b 2 0 494 c 2 0 063 and d 2 0 274 with r 2 0 96 with regard to the reefs with the roughness elements we found that the reef roughness submergence h r i e the reef flat submergence minus the roughness element height rather than h r was more appropriate to collapse the data by adding the element density ϕ as a new parameter in the power law to account for the effect of artificial roughness we suggest 6 r h 0 a 3 h r h 0 b 3 ϕ c 3 d 3 a best fit of eq 6 to the experimental data for the reefs with the roughness yields a 3 1 654 b 3 0 954 c 3 0 052 and d 3 0 395 with r 2 0 99 note that the cases with r 0 under h r 0 in fig 6b were discarded in the fitting process fig 7 a c shows the comparisons of the measured wave run ups and the predicted wave run ups based on our proposed empirical formulas i e eqs 4 6 for the three scenarios receptively the overall goodness of fit with all values of r 2 0 96 as aforementioned confirms that the adopted power law relations are appropriate to describe our wave run up data compared to the values of b 1 to b 3 the values of c 2 and c 3 are much smaller and close to zero indicating that h r h 0 rather than w l or ϕ is the most dominant parameter to characterize the wave run ups over all tested profiles of the fringing reefs since h 0 and h r are related to the incident wave forcing and the local reef morphology respectively the effects of various reef morphologies other than the lagoon width and the roughness on the solitary wave run up will be further studied to supplement the laboratory results via a validated numerical model in the subsequent sections 4 numerical model 4 1 governing equations letting the x coordinate in the direction of wave propagation and t to denote the time the effect of the artificial reef roughness can be modeled by adding a drag term r d accounting for the total drag force per unit bottom area in the boussinesq equations proposed by lynett and liu 2002 7 η t x h 0 η u f c 0 8 u t u u x g η x f m r d r f d r b d 0 where the streamwise horizontal velocity u can be evaluated at z z a with z 0 531 h 0 nwogu 1993 g is the gravity acceleration d h 0 η is the total instantaneous water depth r f and r b are ad hoc dissipative terms accounting for the bottom friction and the wave breaking respectively sub models for r f and r b will be discussed below f c and f m are the boussinesq correction terms to the nonlinear shallow water equations since we used vertical cylinders to model the roughness elements the drag term r d which was only kept in the artificial roughness zone could be obtained from the morison equation morison et al 1950 with the inertial term ignored as 9 r d 1 2 c d n t d t u p u p where d t is the diameter of cylinders n t is the number of cylinders per unit bottom area c d is the drag coefficient of individual roughness element and u p is the local pore velocity normal to the cylinders similar approaches had been applied in modeling the wave interaction with mangrove forest e g huang et al 2011 iimura and tanaka 2012 the pore velocity u p can be related to u by 10 u p u 1 ϕ where ϕ is the density of roughness elements note that we set r d 0 when the reefs without artificial roughness were simulated 4 2 numerical scheme the above equations were solved using a finite difference scheme on a structured grid a scheme of third order adams bashforth predictor and fourth order adams moulton corrector was used for time marching the implicit corrector step must be iterated until a convergence criterion was satisfied all spatial derivatives were differenced to the fourth order accuracy yielding a model which was numerically accurate to δ t 4 in time and δ x 4 in space for more details of the solver see lynett and liu 2002 4 3 sub models of the wave breaking and the bottom friction it is well known that the depth integrated boussinesq type models cannot describe the overturning of a free surface and the detailed wave breaking process hence several empirical models have been proposed for the wave breaking in the surf and swash zones the most common approach is to add an ad hoc dissipation sub model to the momentum equation this approach requires an energy dissipation mechanism and a trigger mechanism for the initiation of wave breaking in this study the eddy viscosity type formulation proposed by kennedy et al 2000 was used to model the wave energy dissipation caused by the wave breaking the model had been validated for fringing reefs by yao et al 2012 there are four empirical parameters in the model and see appendix a for details the following set of empirical parameters was chosen δ 6 0 α 1 0 65 α 2 0 08 α 3 8 as suggested by lynett and liu 2002 the bottom friction r f was calculated by the quadratic friction law 11 r f g n 2 d 1 3 u u where values of the manning coefficient n ranging from 0 01 to 0 1 may be found in the literature e g akan 2006 for the commonly used surface materials 4 4 boundary and initial conditions two types of numerical boundary conditions may be applied at the ends of the computational domain the reflective or no flux boundary condition and the radiation or open boundary condition for the latter sponge layers are frequently used to effectively damp the energy of outgoing waves the sponge layer was typically applied in a manner similar to that recommended by kirby et al 1998 the extrapolating moving boundary algorithm proposed by lynett et al 2002 was used to describe the wave run up and run down processes near the coastline internal source methods are frequently employed as efficient and accurate methods for the numerical wave generation the method using a distributed source function in the continuity equation as proposed by wei et al 1999 was adopted in this study the initial condition assumed no motion of wave or current in the computational domain 4 5 numerical setup referring to fig 1 the numerical domain was established to reproduce the main aspects of the laboratory setup the entire computational domain was 30 3 m in length where the fore reef slope and the back reef beach started from 15 m to 26 7 m away from the left boundary of the computational domain respectively the initial solitary wave was internally generated at 10 m away from the toe of the fore reef slope to ensure the absorption of reflective waves a dissipative sponge layer which had a width of 1 25 times of the incident wave length was placed adjacent to the left boundary the solitary wave length is theoretically infinite but for practical use its wave length l can be estimated by a distance containing 95 of the total mass i e l 2 12 h 0 h 0 h 0 dean and dalrymple 1991 which gave 2 20 m for the worst case h 0 0 04 m and h 0 0 35 m in the present study in order to conserve the mass in the computational domain the right boundary was backed by a solid wall the time step δ t used in the simulations was determined by the courant number c r c δ t δ x where c is the wave phase speed and δ x is the grid size c r 0 2 was used in the simulations which ensured the numerical stability and convergence for all cases normally a grid size of δ x 2 5 cm was found to be sufficient to discretize the computational domain for this study which gave the nodes per incident wave length n ranging from 150 to 200 no significant differences in terms of the wave height and run up were observed with the further increase of grid sizes also to ensure the theoretical validity for the boussinesq equations all simulations used a 4 point filter to smooth the curvature of the rapidly varying bathymetry such as at the toes of the fore reef slope and the back reef beach 4 6 calibration of the bottom friction coefficient and the drag coefficient in this study the bottom friction coefficient n needs to be calibrated first since the wave run up on a slope was very sensitive to the slope roughness lynett et al 2002 we assumed a uniform friction from the deep section of the flume across the reef profile including the lagoon if it exits and all the way to the back reef slope by considering that both the glass flume bottom and the pvc reef surface were very smooth and they were reported to have a similar manning coefficient of n 0 01 in the literature e g munson et al 2006 based on the idealized reef we firstly adjusted the input of incident wave height to ensure that the computed wave heights at g1 exactly mimicked the experimental measurement for each wave condition and we then calibrated n by seeking a best match of the transmitted wave height at the most shoreward reef flat location g8 between the simulations and measurements for all tested conditions through the trial and error process a best value of n 0 017 was found to sufficiently reproduce our data for both the idealized reef and the reefs with the lagoon therefore n 0 017 will be used in our subsequent simulations for the reefs with the artificial roughness elements the individual drag coefficient c d also needs to be calibrated in the model in terms of varying the densities of the roughness elements ϕ combined with the above manning coefficient n 0 017 accounting for the bottom friction outside of the artificial roughness zone c d of the roughness element was determined again by seeking a best match between the measured and simulated transmitted wave height at g8 for all tested wave conditions except for h r 0 no wave run up condition table 1 shows that the calibrated values of c d generally fall within the range between 0 06 and 0 38 and most of them are comparable to the wave friction coefficients reported in the previous field survey e g f w 0 24 lowe et al 2005b laboratory e g f w 0 2 buckley et al 2016 and numerical e g f w 0 6 dongeren et al 2013 studies of wind wave transformation over the rough reef surfaces c d depended not only on ϕ but also on the reef flat submergence h r c d generally increased with the decrease in h r under the same ϕ because more frictional dissipation can be aroused by the roughness elements under a shallower h r however unexpectedly c d decreased with the increase in ϕ for the same h r in fact the calibrated bulk drag coefficient c d n t indeed increased with the increase in ϕ where n t is the number of roughness element per unit area since n t increased significantly with increasing ϕ c d for individual roughness element could possibly be reduced 5 model validation 5 1 time series of computed and measured free surface elevations based on the above calibration a typical solitary wave of h 0 0 08 m and h r 0 05 m was selected in this section to illustrate the validity of the numerical model fig 8 a compares the computed and the measured time series free surface elevations at different sampling locations g1 g8 across the reef based on the idealized reef the overall agreement between the simulations and experiments for all eight locations was satisfactory although we used only the wave height at g8 to calibrate the friction coefficient particularly at the offshore of the reef g1 the incident wave was well reproduced when the solitary wave travelled from g2 to g3 on the fore reef slope it got steepened in both the simulation and measurement due to the shoaling effect during the experiments we observed that the wave breaking started at a location right before the reef edge g4 and the surfzone process extended a definite distance on the reef flat until ceased at a certain location between g6 and g7 thus from g5 to g7 the time series of wave records show the saw like profile and a sharp decrease in the maximum free surface elevation such features of the breaking waves were also well captured by the numerical model between g7 and g8 both the predictions and measurements show that wave attenuated very slowly on the reef flat as a result of the bottom friction and the second peak in the wave profile at g8 was due to the wave reflected from the back reef beach fig 8b and c shows the same comparison on the time series of wave records for the reef with the lagoon and with the roughness elements respectively for the former we display the case with w l 1 6 m while for the latter we demonstrate the case with element density of ϕ 0 044 again the model performances for these two scenarios were fairly good notable mismatch only appeared in the lagoon case for which significant tail wave oscillations could be observed at both g7 and g8 in the experiments due to a sharp change of seabed from reef flat to lagoon the adopted model failed to capture such behavior possibly because the seabed in the computation domain deviated from the laboratory at the location of rapidly varying bathymetry which was induced by the smoothing technique we used in the model in fig 8c the presence of the artificial roughness could be also observed to enhance the wave damping from g4 to g8 compared to that of the idealized reef in fig 8a this pattern was again reasonably reproduced by the simulation we finally remark that in each figure the tail of leading solitary wave was below the initial water level in the laboratory data which was due to the water lost to form the generated wave crest around the paddle of the wave maker however such phenomenon was not observed in the numerical results because the internal source method adopted in the numerical model generated the theoretical solitary wave 5 2 computed and measured wave run ups based on the idealized reef the comparisons of the transmitted wave heights h 8 and the wave run ups on the back reef beach r between computation and measurement under different incident wave heights h 0 with the same reef flat submergence h r 0 05 m are given in fig 9 a while their comparisons under different h r with the same h 0 0 08 m are given in fig 9b since the objective of our model calibration as discussed in section 4 6 is to seek a best agreement between the computation and measurement it is anticipated that the values of h 8 can be generally well predicted in both figures the simulations of r were also satisfactory although slight underprediction of r appeared almost for all cases we attribute it to the aforementioned bathymetry smoothing we adopted at the toe of the back reef beach which slightly modified the original beach slope thus affected the wave run up the comparisons between simulations and experiments with different lagoon width w l and different densities of roughness elements ϕ under the same h 0 0 08 m and h r 0 05 m are presented in fig 9c and d respectively again the predicted values of h 8 matched well with their measurements the values of r were also reasonably captured although some under estimation still existed particularly for the reefs with the artificial roughness in fig 9d overall the adopted numerical model has been validated can simulate the wave transformation and run up over fringing reefs in view of its robustness to deal with a series of impact factors h 0 h r w l and ϕ experimentally tested in this study subsequently we will apply the model to examine more reef morphology variations fore reef slope back reef slope reef flat width reef crest width that may affect the wave run up r on the back reef beach 6 model applications a sketch of the tested reef morphologic features is illustrated in fig 10 based on the idealized reef profile 1 6 for both the slopes of fore reef and back reef 9 6 m for the reef length and no reef crest we tested four additional slopes 1 2 1 4 1 8 and 1 10 which all fall within the common range of 1 1 to 1 20 in the reported field observations for both the fore reef and the back reef as well as four additional widths 0 m 4 8 m 14 4 m and 19 2 m for the reef flat we also considered a trapezoidal reef crest locating at the reef edge with its seaward slope matching the fore reef slope and its shoreward slope of 1 1 five reef crest widths 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 3 m 0 4 m and 0 5 m were examined in view that the dimension of reef crest at the field scale is on the magnitude of meters during the model applications each test was run by changing only one morphologic feature at one time while keeping other features same as the idealized reef all tests were conducted under the combination of one solitary wave height h 0 0 08 m and two reef flat submergences h r 0 05 m and 0 1 m fig 11 a shows the variation of wave run up r with different fore reef slopes as fore reef slope became steeper r decreased slightly under both h r suggesting that r was not sensitive to the change of the fore reef slope within the tested range this was because the wave breaking for this case occurred close to the reef edge g4 thus the wave energy dissipation associated with the breaking waves primarily finished on the reef flat although a steeper slope could actually shift the breaking point further shoreward r was more sensitive to the back beach slope as indicated by fig 11b r decreased almost linearly with the growth of back reef beach slope and this trend was consistent with eq 2 as described by synolakis 1987 for a plane slope meanwhile r dropped more notably under deeper h r because it allowed larger transmitted waves according to the depth limited breaking condition and it also meant less friction fig 11c shows the variation of r with the reef flat width note that the zero width approaches to a plane slope in the absence of the reef compared with the plane slope the role of the presence of a reef flat in reducing the coastal wave run up was effective r decreased significantly with the increase in the reef flat width in that a wider reef width could guarantee the completion of the surf zone process as well as caused larger frictional dissipation as for the reef crest width in fig 11d although the presence of a reef crest was reported to be an important factor affecting the wind wave transformation over fringing reefs yao et al 2017 it seemed to have little effect on r under both h r where slight decline of r can only be found under larger tested crest widths this is due to the fact that the solitary wave is very long compared to the reef crest width thus it can transmit freely over the narrow reef crest if the reef crest becomes sufficient wide we can anticipate that it will affect r in a similar way of the reef flat width as shown in fig 11d therefore in this section we conclude that the coastal regions protected by the fringing reefs with steep back reef slopes and narrow reef flats are still at some risks of inundation associated with the wave run up during a tsunami event shimozono et al 2015 also applied a boussinesq type model to simulate wave transformation over shallow fringing reefs and their model was validated by the laboratory experiments of demirbilek et al 2007 their model results suggested that maximum wave run up monotonically decreases with increasing reef width and becomes larger on steeper back reef slopes in the range of narrow reef widths our results based on the solitary waves are generally agreement with their findings although they focused on the spectral waves indicating that the protective effects of the fringing reefs on the coastlines against the tsunami waves are in a way similar to those against the storm surges 7 conclusions a series of laboratory experiments was carried out in a wave flume to study the transformation and run up of tsunami like solitary wave over fringing reefs the effects of different wave forcing and reef morphology factors incident wave height reef flat submergence lagoon width and reef surface roughness were examined based on various profiles of the reefs including the idealized reefs with without the lagoon or the roughness cylinder arrays were employed to create artificial roughness elements on the reef surface results analysis showed that the dimensionless transmitted wave on the reef flat and wave run up on the back reef slope decreased with both the increases in dimensionless incident wave height wave nonlinearity and the reef flat submergence expect under zero submergence the enhanced reef surface roughness reduced the wave run up whereas the enlarged lagoon width tended to raise it empirical formulas were proposed can predict the solitary wave run up over fringing reefs they indicated that the ratio of the reef flat submergence to the incident wave height was always the dominant parameter to characterize the wave run ups over our tested reef profiles a numerical model based on the boussinesq equations was validated to show its capability reproducing our experimental data the artificial roughness was modeled by adding a drag term in the governing equations the model was then applied to investigate the effects of four types of reef morphology variations on the wave run up it shows that the wave run up on the back reef slope was most sensitive to the variation of the reef flat width less sensitive to the back reef slope and almost insensitive to the variations of both the fore reef slope and the reef crest width within our tested ranges natural reefs are far more complex than those studied in the laboratory for a realistic reef site wind waves nearshore currents reef surface porosity etc may also modify the conclusions in this study to a more or less extent nevertheless this study highlights the positive role of a fringing reef in protecting the coastal region against the tsunami hazard however it also tells that a steep beach fringed by a reef with a relatively narrow and smooth reef flat in the presence of lagoon may still have high risk of coastal inundation when subjected to a tsunami event coinciding with a

23662,the mineral resources in deep seabed are attracting extensive attention because terrestrial natural resources have become progressively depleted to optimize the mining system for the deep seabed minerals the production rate and the solid fraction of liquid solid slurry production should be estimated and measured precisely however there are very unstable on board conditions due to the wave tide etc in this research we studied on on board measurement methodology to estimate the production rate and the solid fraction of the deep seabed mining we proposed a measurement technique using the measured data and physical properties of materials the technique has been verified by the real sea experiment using pilot scale lifting system also we performed the fast fourier transform fft analysis because there are significant noises in the measured data as a result of the fft analysis we found that the causes of the noises were due to the vessel behavior by the wave energy and the sloshing effect of the slurry in the storage tank keywords on board measurement methodology liquid solid slurry deep seabed lifting system recovery test of manganese nodule 1 introduction the importance of technology development to secure deep sea mineral resources such as manganese nodules is being recognized globally because the terrestrial natural resources have become progressively depleted for this reason many concepts of the commercial production for deep sea mineral resources have been studied in advanced countries such as germany usa and canada from the 1970s padan 1990 li et al 2013 valsangkar 2003 sharma 2011 senanayake 2011 wijk et al 2016 since the 1990s korea has researched and developed technologies for the continuous production of deep sea mineral resources a deep seabed integrated mining system as shown in fig 1 which is composed of a mining robot and a lifting system flexible pipe buffer and lifting pipe and pump had derived as a system concept for production of deep sea mineral resources in this r d project oh et al 2017 the mining robot collects the mineral resources on the deep sea floor the lifting system carries the mineral resources from mining robot to mining vessel the development of this integrated mining system has been completed in 2016 the developed mining robot is a self propelled underwater robot to secure deep seabed mineral resources the flexible pipe is an equipment to transfer the mineral resources from the mining robot to the buffer the buffer is a primary storage equipment to store the mineral resources delivered from the mining robot the lifting pump and pipe carry continuously a certain amount of the mineral resources from the buffer to the mining vessel the mining vessel has process facilities for refining and separation of the mineral resources transferred on board these devices of the integrated mining system are operated in special and extreme conditions such as ocean environment and soft ground for this reason reasonable design and technology development of these devices are very important for stable operation of the system ertas and yilmaz 2014 oh et al 2016 xiong et al 2017 korean researchers had used advanced engineering techniques such as simulation based design method uncertainty based design method and automatic control method for development of the reasonable integrated mining system choi et al 2011 lee et al 2012 oh et al 2014 2016 yoon et al 2014 the developed integrated mining system by the advanced engineering techniques should verify the system safety and reliability through real sea experiment in 2012 2013 the mining robot of the integrated mining system had been evaluated by real sea experiment hong et al 2013 this experiment evaluated resources harvesting ability and driving performance on the sea floor of the mining robot according to the experiment results it was clarified that the mining robot had been well developed without any technical problems and had the sufficient performance for commercialization the results of this experiment were published in several papers hong et al 2013 yeu et al 2013 sung et al 2014 oh et al 2017 after 2014 the lifting system shown in fig 2 and on board facilities had been developed concept verification of the lifting system and the performance evaluation about continuous lifting had been analyzed and discussed by hong et al 2016 and yeu et al 2016 according to their results the system had been operated without any technical problems the most important factor in the performance evaluation of this system is a predicting method of the total production of resources such as manganese nodules on board in particular a method to estimate the production of nodules contained in slurry is needed because the nodules carried through this system become a slurry mixed with sea water so far the slurry has been studied in various fields such as resources development field wu et al 2015 vedachalam et al 2016 khalil et al 2017 simone et al 2017 simulation r d field jakobs et al 2012 miedema 2016 chemical and physical properties of slurry lu and tassou 2012 merrill et al 2017 and multiphase flow measurement system development falcone et al 2009 however there are few studies to develop the equipment for estimation of the production of the nodules as mineral resources contained in the slurry therefore we proposed a measurement methodology of liquid solid slurry to measure the content of nodules in the slurry furthermore we developed a measurement system and applied it to the field test of lifting system to verify the methodology the proposed measurement methodology is a technique to estimate the total production by calculating the mass rate of nodules contained in the slurry through physical properties such as the density and weight that can be easily measured this technique can be used as an on board monitoring method to estimate the total production because the distribution of the nodule in the slurry can be estimated by real time measurement of the slurry transported on board however precise measurement is difficult due to various factors such as a vessel behavior mechanical vibrations and fluctuations of internal flow in pipeline measured data using the proposed measurement methodology also had measurement error due to various causes for this reason validation of the measurement methodology should be performed through error analysis of the measured data in order to verify the proposed measurement method it is very important to find a way to improve the measurement accuracy by eliminating the cause of the error therefore this paper introduces an on board slurry measurement methodology and system for estimation of nodule production and a feasibility study of the measurement methodology through application of the pilot scale lifting test of manganese nodules was discussed in this paper 2 measurement methodology of liquid solid slurry the amount of nodules in the slurry should be measured to verify the capability of the lifting system for recovery of nodules in this study we applied the method to calculate the composition ratio of the mixture by measuring the physical properties such as weights volumes and densities to measure the nodule content in the slurry the composition ratio of the mixture in the slurry can be calculated by comparing the density of the slurry and the densities of the sea water and the nodule the density of slurry is estimated by the weight of slurry the relationship between the weight w s and density ρ s of the slurry is expressed as eq 1 1 w s ρ s g v s where g is the acceleration of gravity and v s is a volume of the stored slurry the volume of the stored slurry is calculated by eq 2 2 v s a s h s where a s is a cross sectional area of the tank to store the slurry and h s is a height of the stored slurry a s can be obtained from the design value of a tank in which the slurry is stored h s can be obtained by measuring the height of the slurry stored in the tank w s can be obtained by measuring the weight of the stored slurry the value of ρ s can be calculated using the measured values and eqs 1 and 2 the content ratio of nodule and sea water in the slurry can be estimated using the calculated density of the slurry the known density of sea water and the known density of nodule the relation for estimation is expressed as eq 3 3 ρ s 1 x ρ l x ρ n where x is a content ratio of nodule in the slurry ρ l is the density of sea water and ρ n is the density of nodule the content ration of nodule in the slurry is estimated by eq 3 with the densities of sea water nodule and slurry finally the weight of the nodules produced on board is calculated by the content ratio of the nodule and the measured weight of the slurry as shown in eq 4 4 w n x w s the values of a s h s and w s should be known to measure the amount of nodules in the slurry by using the theoretical method therefore a measuring system should have a tank for storing a certain amount of slurry and various measuring and measuring equipment for measuring storage height and weight of slurry in this study we had developed the measuring system considering them a method of measuring the height by installing a scale on the tank was used as a method for measuring the storage height and load cells were installed at the bottom of the tank to measure the weight in real time to measure the storage weight 3 test facilities for lifting system evaluation a system for performance evaluation of the lifting system is composed of a developed pilot lifting system subsea and on board equipment for installation and operation of the pilot lifting system and measuring equipment to evaluate transfer state of sea water and nodules 3 1 pilot scale lifting system a pilot lifting system was developed by krsio korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering which is composed of a buffer lifting pipes and a lifting pump such as fig 2 the buffer is capable of nodule storage for 12min collecting and of nodule feeding for 10 kg s max 15 kg s the electric power of buffer is 150 kw for nodule feeding and angle keeping the weight is 8 6ton in air the height is 7 1 m and the diameter is 3 m the heading angle of buffer is controlled by two thrusters to keep the lifting pipe and umbilical from extreme twist it is remotely operated by electric hydraulic system the underwater position is monitored by usbl navigation system hong et al 2016 the type of lifting pump was chosen as borehole pump in order to use the identical equipment for the launch and retrieval of pipes the design specifications of the lifting pump are flowrate of 500 m3 h head of 26 5 bar for vertical lifting of 2 500 m installation water depth of 400 m volumetric slurry concentration of 5 and inner diameter of 200 mm a 6 stage centrifugal pump driven by submersible electric motor was developed the designed efficiency is 58 and the electric power is 800 kw 6 6 kv 60 hz driven by invertor of 3 930 kw the aligned assembly of pump and e motor is enveloped by shroud for provision of nodule flow passage through the annular space between shroud and e motor and for protection as well hong et al 2016 the lifting pipe was manufactured by saw submerged arc welding patented by a korea company material grade is api 5l x80 unit length is 12 5 m and inner diameter is 202 7 mm the installation depth of 500 m was reached by flange connections of 38 pipe units integrated operation system including software and hardware was developed for the purpose of real time remote operations and monitoring of lifting system together with database system yeu et al 2016 3 2 on board facilities for installation and operation of pilot lifting system the devices for installation and operation of the pilot lifting system are a mother ship such as drillship and osv offshore support vessel which is used to install the buffer lifting pipe and on board facilities equipment for installation of the lifting system such as pipe handling system and moonpool gate and equipment for operation of the lifting system such as crane a multipurpose osv of 5000ton class was utilized as the mother ship which has moonpool 6 5 m 6 5 m ahc active heave compensator crane of 100tons available deck space of 950 m2 and dp dynamic positioning system all on board equipment and facilities were designed constructed and integrated with the vessel various equipment to keep and install the pilot lifting system was designed and manufactured such as a finger board to keep the lifting pipe a moonpool tower and a moonpool gate for safe launch of the lifting system in the ocean as shown in fig 3 the finger board was designed and constructed to keep safely the lifting pipe and the lifting pump the lifting pipes and pump are fixed by clamp of finger board the moonpool tower was designed to support the launch and retrieval of buffer pipe and pump a sophisticated moonpool gate equipped with gimbal cradle was conceptualized and manufactured for the purpose of launch and retrieval operation of lifting pipe pump and buffer with repeated operations of the moonpool gate open and close the top flanges of pipes and pump are supported by and freed from the gimbal cradle which is capable of supporting the whole weight of lifting system the opening stroke of moonpool gate was designed to pass the buffer through utility facilities need for operation of the lifting system because the lifting system installed by moonpool tower and gate is operated through remote control technique the required facilities are control vans for control of the buffer and the lifting pump power vans to supply power and transmit electrical signals in various system inverters generators transformers winch and cables 3 3 on board measurement system artificial nodules transferred by the lifting system are carried to on board process facilities the on board facilities are pipes to be transferred slurry composed of sea water and nodules measuring equipment to measure experimental data such as pressure flow rate and weight and a tank to separate recovered nodules from seawater and store the nodules especially the pipe line on board for recovery of an artificial manganese nodule was designed and installed in order to simulate the total pressure drop in 2 500 m vertical lifting which was realized by multiple bents orifices and valves the on board slurry flow terminates at the nodule separator the lifted nodules are separated and recovered while the seawater was discharged out of board the nodule separator has an additional measurement tank such as fig 4 in which the nodule and seawater slurry flow during a certain time about 60 s is stored and weighed for the purpose of investigation of volumetric concentration a weight of the stored slurry was measured by load cells which is installed under the measurement tank 4 lifting test results the performance test of the developed lifting system was carried out using pure sea water and slurry mixed with sea water and nodules the purpose of the pure sea water test is to verify the operation status of the processing system the lifting system and the measurement system installed on board the objective of the slurry test is to evaluate the nodule recovery performance of the lifting system and the developed measuring system was used to verify the performance of the lifting system the system measured the weight of sea water and nodules the recovery performance of the lifting system was evaluated through the measured weights 4 1 recovery test of pure sea water the lifting test using pure sea water was performed 5 times in total the sea water transferred on board was stored in the measurement tank for a certain period of time to obtain quantitative experiment data the sea water stored in the measurement tank was weighed through load cells attached to the bottom of the tank the measured weight data of sea water are shown in fig 5 which represents continuously the measurement results from the 1st test to 5th test fig 5 shows that the measured weight is not constant from 1st to 5th the reason why the measurement weight was not constant is because the storage time of the sea water had an error when storing the sea water in the measurement tank for 60 s the time for storing the sea water in the measurement tank was 33 s for the first time and the other times were about 60 s in the first test the sea water had to be stored for 60 s but it was stored for only 33 s due to the control error of the lifting system in the second to fifth tests the measured weights are different even though the sea water was stored for the same time because the amount of sea water transferred during the same time was different due to control error of the flow rate when the sea water was carried through the lifting system this phenomenon was confirmed by the results of yeu et al 2016 fig 6 shows that the lifting system could not transfer a constant flow rate under the same control condition the mean value of the load cell data was used as the experimental correction value for the quantitative analysis of the experimental results table 1 shows the corrected values of the weight data of sea water from 1st test to 5th test measured by the load cell the corrected weight can be converted to densities using a volume of the sea water stored in the measurement tank the calibration method of the measurement data can be verified by comparing the densities because the density of sea water is known to be about 1 025 kg m3 the volume of the sea water was measured using a ruler installed on the measurement tank table 2 shows the measured volumes of sea water and the converted densities the converted densities have some errors but they are similar to theoretical density of sea water in particular the density converted to the 2nd test result has the largest error but the error rate is as low as about 2 the error of 2 in real sea experiment is negligible 4 2 recovery test of slurry with manganese nodule a nodule recovery test was performed using the developed pilot lifting system the procedure of experiment is as follows first artificial nodules were injected into the buffer located at a depth of 500 m second the injected nodule mixed with sea water and the slurry was made then it was transferred to on board facilities by the lifting system finally the slurry transferred to the on board was stored in the measurement tank to measure and remainders were transferred through the nodule recovery facility 4 2 1 artificial nodule for test an artificial nodule used in the experiment was designed to simulate manganese nodules which are minerals in the deep seabed the artificial nodule was produced in a korean company as shown in fig 7 a the size of the produced nodule is similar to the deep seabed manganese nodule however the material properties of nodules can vary due to the deformation that occurred during the fabrication process thus the density and specific gravity to be used for the analysis of the experimental results were measured before the real sea experiment the measurement method is as follows first a mass and a volume of the artificial nodule were measured using a beaker and an electronic scale as shown in fig 7 b and the density and specific gravity were calculated by using the measured mass and volume table 3 shows the measured and calculated material properties of the artificial nodule the measurement was performed 5 times to minimize the experimental error according to the results the density of the artificial nodule was about 1797 kg m3 this value is 75 greater than the density of sea water 1025 kg m3 4 2 2 recovery test result fig 8 shows the load cell data of the slurry which is a mixture of the sea water and the artificial nodule transferred by the lifting system the weight data of the slurry measured by the load cell had the same error as the experimental results using sea water thus the corrected value of the slurry weight data is 13 172 kg which is the average value of the load cell data table 4 shows the measured results from the measurement tank containing the corrected weight data the density of the slurry can be calculated by the weight and volume of the slurry stored in the tank the density of the slurry was measured to be 1035 kg m3 which is larger than the sea water density of 1025 kg m3 and smaller than the nodule density of 1 797 kg m3 because the slurry is a mixture of sea water and nodule it is possible to calculate composition ratios such as a volume ratio and a mass ratio of the sea water and the nodule in the slurry by using the measured density the volume ratio and the mass ratio were calculated as 0 013 1 3 and 0 023 2 3 the weight of the nodule in the slurry can be predicted through the measured mass ratio the estimated nodule weighed about 303 kg in addition the weight of the nodule can be measured directly after removing the sea water in the measurement tank the weight of the stored nodule was measured at 281 26 kg the reason for the difference between the predicted nodule weight and the measured nodule weight is due to loss of powdered nodule the powdered nodules in the slurry were discharged from the tank along with sea water during the separation of sea water and nodule for this reason the weight of stored nodules is reduced finally the developed pilot lifting system recovered nodules of 281 26 kg for 77 s at a mass ration of 2 2 and an average transport ratio of this system was measured at 3 65 kg sec this result means that the developed pilot lifting system has a nodule production capacity of 3 65 kg sec 5 measurement error analysis the data measured by the load cell installed on board have large and small errors the measured data with these errors cannot be used for accurate analysis of experimental results therefore we should analyze the main cause of errors and study how to eliminate or correct them for accurate analysis of experiment results 5 1 analysis of load cell data all test data have measurement errors as fig 9 that shows the measurement data of 2nd test fig 9 b shows clearly that the measuring data using load cells have irregular vibrations by measurement errors dynamic results such as the load cell data are measured as a single spectrum combining the results of several independent causes the measured combined spectrum can be analyzed for independent causes through fft fast fourier transform method cho and lee 2006 srikanth and sekhar 2016 fft analysis was performed by excel fft calculator fig 10 shows the fft result of the weight data measured by the load cell the weight data had two frequency components such as 1st mode and 2nd mode the 1st mode of the weight data occurred at about 0 13 hz the 2nd mode was caused at 2 38 hz measured data are the weight of sea water stored for 60 s in the measurement tank a weight is a physical quantity generated by gravitational acceleration therefore the error of the measured weight data may have been caused by the dynamic effect of other acceleration except gravitational acceleration acting directly on the nodule these dynamic effects include the behavior of the ship by waves the vibration of the measurement tank due to the ship behavior the sloshing effect in the measurement tank and so on also the factor that cause errors in the sensor itself are the sensor offset error and thermal effect due to direct sunlight the sensor offset error among these causes does not cause measurement error because sensor set zero during sensor installation in addition thermal effects such as thermal deformation and thermal expansion due to direct sunlight are close to 0 frequency because the generation period is 1 day according to the results of the fft analysis of the measurement data no phenomena were observed in the 0 frequency region so the thermal effects cannot be the cause of the measurement error therefore the dynamic effects acting on the measurement system are predicted as the cause of the error because the causes of errors in the sensor itself are not the cause of the measurement error fft analysis is used to analyze the cause of each factor causing the dynamic effects 5 2 cause investigation of measurement error 5 2 1 dynamic effect by vessel motion a ship has 6 way motions such as surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw the ship behavior was measured by displacement sensor which is attached in the center of gravity of the ship to minimize the motion error according to measured ship motions 3 way motions such as surge sway and yaw hardly occurred because of control by dp dynamic positioning however heave pitch and roll motions were measured as fig 11 because these motions were caused by phase difference of wave fft analysis of the measured vessel motion data was performed to analyze the dynamic effect of the vessel motion fig 12 shows the fft result of the measured ship behavior such as heave pitch and roll motions they had many frequency components including 0 13 hz 1st mode 0 78 hz 2nd mode and 1 11 hz 3rd mode and their frequency components had the same value in the same mode because the ship had the same dynamic effect in all directions according to the fft results the 1st mode of the load cell data is equal to the 1st mode of the ship behavior but the 2nd modes are different this means that the 1st mode of the load cell data was caused by the ship behavior and the cause of the 2nd mode is another factor such as shock by sloshing and structure vibration of the measurement tank among the various modes the primary effect on mechanical equipment is the 1st mode that occurs at the lower frequencies that carry the largest loads ray 2016 especially the 2nd mode has less influence than the 1st mode because the frequency difference between the 1st mode and the 2nd mode of the load cell data is large therefore the major factor affecting the measurement of the load cell is the ship behavior which is the cause of the 1st mode among the ship motion the heave motion with large displacement is the main cause because it generates more energy than pith and roll motions 5 2 2 structural dynamic effect of measurement tank a measurement error may occur due to the structural dynamic effect of the measurement tank because load cells are installed at the bottom of the measurement tank the mode analysis of the measurement tank was performed to analyze the natural frequency of the structure for analysis of the structural dynamic effect abaqus abaqus 2011 which is the commercial structural analysis software was used for mode analysis the tank has different natural frequencies depending on the installation method so the case analysis was performed by dividing the bottom welding condition case 1 of the frame supporting the tank and the entire welding condition case 2 of the frame the natural frequencies of the tank in case 1 are shown in case 1 of table 5 the first mode which is the lowest frequency occurs at 3 6482 hz with the shape shown in fig 13 the natural frequencies in case 2 are shown in case 2 of table 5 the first mode occurs at 16 89 hz with the shape shown in fig 14 in case 1 the transverse deformation of the frame occurs as shape of the first mode in case 2 the transverse deformation of the tank occurs as shape of the first mode because the entire frame was fixed as a result of mode analysis of the measurement tank the natural frequency of the measurement system is the frequency range not found in the measurement error therefore the structural dynamic effect of the measurement tank with a natural frequency above 3 6 hz is not the cause of the measurement error 5 2 3 dynamic effect by sloshing phenomenon in measurement tank the slurry mixed the manganese nodule and the sea water is transferred to the topside of the vessel through the lifting system the slurry delivered on board is stored in the measurement tank in general liquids transferred on board generate a sloshing phenomenon due to the shaking of a structure by wave and the shaking by the discharge pressure of the liquid jung et al 2015 a dynamic effect caused by this sloshing phenomenon can cause a measurement error therefore it is necessary to analyze the sloshing effect inside the tank for this analysis we used the natural frequency analysis method of a sloshing as verified by jung jung et al 2015 natural frequencies f n of the sloshing phenomenon can be calculated by the following eqs 5 and 6 5 ω n n π g l tanh n π h l 6 f n ω n 2 π where l is the tank length h is the slurry depth n is the mode number and g is the acceleration of gravity the length of the measurement tank is 1 96 m and the slurry depth is 1 6 m plus the measured length of the ruler because the ruler for measuring the slurry depth is located 1 6 m from the bottom of the measurement tank data from the pure sea water test was used for natural frequency analysis of the sloshing the natural frequencies of the sloshing in the tank calculated by these values and equations are shown in table 6 there was a mode of 2 36 hz in the natural frequency modes on sloshing phenomenon the frequency of this mode was close to 2 38 hz the second mode of the measurement error taking into account the measurement error of the ruler in the measurement tank the mode of 2 36 hz is a factor causing the measurement error therefore it was confirmed that the sloshing effect in addition to the vessel motion causes a measurement error by applying a dynamic effect to the load cells the calculated method of the natural frequency modes on sloshing phenomenon used in this study is a calculation method for two dimensional sloshing phenomenon the actual value may differ from the calculated value because the actual sloshing phenomenon is three dimensional phenomenon however according to a study by angitha 2014 the sloshing effect inside the tank was almost unaffected by depth in the same mode the results of this study can be seen in table 7 angitha s study investigated the effect of internal sloshing on lng tankers the results of his research show that there is almost no change in natural frequencies on sloshing when the volume of the liquid in the tanker changes from 20 to 90 after all the sloshing effect was two dimensional phenomenon that varied by the size of the tanker therefore it is appropriate to use the calculation method for two dimensional sloshing phenomenon in this study however the additional experiment needs to verify whether the high order mode such as 14th mode of sloshing phenomenon having low energy can influence the experimental data although it has been reported that only the first mode of sloshing phenomenon is affected in previous that the higher modes also have enough energy because they are similar to the frequency of the low order mode can be checked through the studies of the angitha 2014 and jung et al 2015 6 conclusion in this study we proposed an on board measurement method to estimate the production rate and solid fraction of the liquid solid slurry for optimizing the deep seabed mining systems the measurement technique has been verified with the real test in ocean however the measured data from the real test in ocean have significant errors to obtain the exact measurement values we performed fft analysis because there are significant noises due to the wave structural vibration and sloshing effects as a result of the fft analysis it was found that the main causes of the errors are due to the wave and the sloshing in the measuring systems so we removed the noise of the measured data using the fft results and filtering finally we obtained the accurate data as shown in fig 15 if the measurement method is applied to a commercial on board measurement system for deep seabed mining system it would be possible to optimize the mining system of deep sea manganese nodules acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the full support shown for this research work this study was initiated by an r d project entitled establishment of center for offshore research and engineering service and technology development of deep seabed mining system for manganese nodules sponsored by the ministry of oceans and fisheries of korea 
23662,the mineral resources in deep seabed are attracting extensive attention because terrestrial natural resources have become progressively depleted to optimize the mining system for the deep seabed minerals the production rate and the solid fraction of liquid solid slurry production should be estimated and measured precisely however there are very unstable on board conditions due to the wave tide etc in this research we studied on on board measurement methodology to estimate the production rate and the solid fraction of the deep seabed mining we proposed a measurement technique using the measured data and physical properties of materials the technique has been verified by the real sea experiment using pilot scale lifting system also we performed the fast fourier transform fft analysis because there are significant noises in the measured data as a result of the fft analysis we found that the causes of the noises were due to the vessel behavior by the wave energy and the sloshing effect of the slurry in the storage tank keywords on board measurement methodology liquid solid slurry deep seabed lifting system recovery test of manganese nodule 1 introduction the importance of technology development to secure deep sea mineral resources such as manganese nodules is being recognized globally because the terrestrial natural resources have become progressively depleted for this reason many concepts of the commercial production for deep sea mineral resources have been studied in advanced countries such as germany usa and canada from the 1970s padan 1990 li et al 2013 valsangkar 2003 sharma 2011 senanayake 2011 wijk et al 2016 since the 1990s korea has researched and developed technologies for the continuous production of deep sea mineral resources a deep seabed integrated mining system as shown in fig 1 which is composed of a mining robot and a lifting system flexible pipe buffer and lifting pipe and pump had derived as a system concept for production of deep sea mineral resources in this r d project oh et al 2017 the mining robot collects the mineral resources on the deep sea floor the lifting system carries the mineral resources from mining robot to mining vessel the development of this integrated mining system has been completed in 2016 the developed mining robot is a self propelled underwater robot to secure deep seabed mineral resources the flexible pipe is an equipment to transfer the mineral resources from the mining robot to the buffer the buffer is a primary storage equipment to store the mineral resources delivered from the mining robot the lifting pump and pipe carry continuously a certain amount of the mineral resources from the buffer to the mining vessel the mining vessel has process facilities for refining and separation of the mineral resources transferred on board these devices of the integrated mining system are operated in special and extreme conditions such as ocean environment and soft ground for this reason reasonable design and technology development of these devices are very important for stable operation of the system ertas and yilmaz 2014 oh et al 2016 xiong et al 2017 korean researchers had used advanced engineering techniques such as simulation based design method uncertainty based design method and automatic control method for development of the reasonable integrated mining system choi et al 2011 lee et al 2012 oh et al 2014 2016 yoon et al 2014 the developed integrated mining system by the advanced engineering techniques should verify the system safety and reliability through real sea experiment in 2012 2013 the mining robot of the integrated mining system had been evaluated by real sea experiment hong et al 2013 this experiment evaluated resources harvesting ability and driving performance on the sea floor of the mining robot according to the experiment results it was clarified that the mining robot had been well developed without any technical problems and had the sufficient performance for commercialization the results of this experiment were published in several papers hong et al 2013 yeu et al 2013 sung et al 2014 oh et al 2017 after 2014 the lifting system shown in fig 2 and on board facilities had been developed concept verification of the lifting system and the performance evaluation about continuous lifting had been analyzed and discussed by hong et al 2016 and yeu et al 2016 according to their results the system had been operated without any technical problems the most important factor in the performance evaluation of this system is a predicting method of the total production of resources such as manganese nodules on board in particular a method to estimate the production of nodules contained in slurry is needed because the nodules carried through this system become a slurry mixed with sea water so far the slurry has been studied in various fields such as resources development field wu et al 2015 vedachalam et al 2016 khalil et al 2017 simone et al 2017 simulation r d field jakobs et al 2012 miedema 2016 chemical and physical properties of slurry lu and tassou 2012 merrill et al 2017 and multiphase flow measurement system development falcone et al 2009 however there are few studies to develop the equipment for estimation of the production of the nodules as mineral resources contained in the slurry therefore we proposed a measurement methodology of liquid solid slurry to measure the content of nodules in the slurry furthermore we developed a measurement system and applied it to the field test of lifting system to verify the methodology the proposed measurement methodology is a technique to estimate the total production by calculating the mass rate of nodules contained in the slurry through physical properties such as the density and weight that can be easily measured this technique can be used as an on board monitoring method to estimate the total production because the distribution of the nodule in the slurry can be estimated by real time measurement of the slurry transported on board however precise measurement is difficult due to various factors such as a vessel behavior mechanical vibrations and fluctuations of internal flow in pipeline measured data using the proposed measurement methodology also had measurement error due to various causes for this reason validation of the measurement methodology should be performed through error analysis of the measured data in order to verify the proposed measurement method it is very important to find a way to improve the measurement accuracy by eliminating the cause of the error therefore this paper introduces an on board slurry measurement methodology and system for estimation of nodule production and a feasibility study of the measurement methodology through application of the pilot scale lifting test of manganese nodules was discussed in this paper 2 measurement methodology of liquid solid slurry the amount of nodules in the slurry should be measured to verify the capability of the lifting system for recovery of nodules in this study we applied the method to calculate the composition ratio of the mixture by measuring the physical properties such as weights volumes and densities to measure the nodule content in the slurry the composition ratio of the mixture in the slurry can be calculated by comparing the density of the slurry and the densities of the sea water and the nodule the density of slurry is estimated by the weight of slurry the relationship between the weight w s and density ρ s of the slurry is expressed as eq 1 1 w s ρ s g v s where g is the acceleration of gravity and v s is a volume of the stored slurry the volume of the stored slurry is calculated by eq 2 2 v s a s h s where a s is a cross sectional area of the tank to store the slurry and h s is a height of the stored slurry a s can be obtained from the design value of a tank in which the slurry is stored h s can be obtained by measuring the height of the slurry stored in the tank w s can be obtained by measuring the weight of the stored slurry the value of ρ s can be calculated using the measured values and eqs 1 and 2 the content ratio of nodule and sea water in the slurry can be estimated using the calculated density of the slurry the known density of sea water and the known density of nodule the relation for estimation is expressed as eq 3 3 ρ s 1 x ρ l x ρ n where x is a content ratio of nodule in the slurry ρ l is the density of sea water and ρ n is the density of nodule the content ration of nodule in the slurry is estimated by eq 3 with the densities of sea water nodule and slurry finally the weight of the nodules produced on board is calculated by the content ratio of the nodule and the measured weight of the slurry as shown in eq 4 4 w n x w s the values of a s h s and w s should be known to measure the amount of nodules in the slurry by using the theoretical method therefore a measuring system should have a tank for storing a certain amount of slurry and various measuring and measuring equipment for measuring storage height and weight of slurry in this study we had developed the measuring system considering them a method of measuring the height by installing a scale on the tank was used as a method for measuring the storage height and load cells were installed at the bottom of the tank to measure the weight in real time to measure the storage weight 3 test facilities for lifting system evaluation a system for performance evaluation of the lifting system is composed of a developed pilot lifting system subsea and on board equipment for installation and operation of the pilot lifting system and measuring equipment to evaluate transfer state of sea water and nodules 3 1 pilot scale lifting system a pilot lifting system was developed by krsio korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering which is composed of a buffer lifting pipes and a lifting pump such as fig 2 the buffer is capable of nodule storage for 12min collecting and of nodule feeding for 10 kg s max 15 kg s the electric power of buffer is 150 kw for nodule feeding and angle keeping the weight is 8 6ton in air the height is 7 1 m and the diameter is 3 m the heading angle of buffer is controlled by two thrusters to keep the lifting pipe and umbilical from extreme twist it is remotely operated by electric hydraulic system the underwater position is monitored by usbl navigation system hong et al 2016 the type of lifting pump was chosen as borehole pump in order to use the identical equipment for the launch and retrieval of pipes the design specifications of the lifting pump are flowrate of 500 m3 h head of 26 5 bar for vertical lifting of 2 500 m installation water depth of 400 m volumetric slurry concentration of 5 and inner diameter of 200 mm a 6 stage centrifugal pump driven by submersible electric motor was developed the designed efficiency is 58 and the electric power is 800 kw 6 6 kv 60 hz driven by invertor of 3 930 kw the aligned assembly of pump and e motor is enveloped by shroud for provision of nodule flow passage through the annular space between shroud and e motor and for protection as well hong et al 2016 the lifting pipe was manufactured by saw submerged arc welding patented by a korea company material grade is api 5l x80 unit length is 12 5 m and inner diameter is 202 7 mm the installation depth of 500 m was reached by flange connections of 38 pipe units integrated operation system including software and hardware was developed for the purpose of real time remote operations and monitoring of lifting system together with database system yeu et al 2016 3 2 on board facilities for installation and operation of pilot lifting system the devices for installation and operation of the pilot lifting system are a mother ship such as drillship and osv offshore support vessel which is used to install the buffer lifting pipe and on board facilities equipment for installation of the lifting system such as pipe handling system and moonpool gate and equipment for operation of the lifting system such as crane a multipurpose osv of 5000ton class was utilized as the mother ship which has moonpool 6 5 m 6 5 m ahc active heave compensator crane of 100tons available deck space of 950 m2 and dp dynamic positioning system all on board equipment and facilities were designed constructed and integrated with the vessel various equipment to keep and install the pilot lifting system was designed and manufactured such as a finger board to keep the lifting pipe a moonpool tower and a moonpool gate for safe launch of the lifting system in the ocean as shown in fig 3 the finger board was designed and constructed to keep safely the lifting pipe and the lifting pump the lifting pipes and pump are fixed by clamp of finger board the moonpool tower was designed to support the launch and retrieval of buffer pipe and pump a sophisticated moonpool gate equipped with gimbal cradle was conceptualized and manufactured for the purpose of launch and retrieval operation of lifting pipe pump and buffer with repeated operations of the moonpool gate open and close the top flanges of pipes and pump are supported by and freed from the gimbal cradle which is capable of supporting the whole weight of lifting system the opening stroke of moonpool gate was designed to pass the buffer through utility facilities need for operation of the lifting system because the lifting system installed by moonpool tower and gate is operated through remote control technique the required facilities are control vans for control of the buffer and the lifting pump power vans to supply power and transmit electrical signals in various system inverters generators transformers winch and cables 3 3 on board measurement system artificial nodules transferred by the lifting system are carried to on board process facilities the on board facilities are pipes to be transferred slurry composed of sea water and nodules measuring equipment to measure experimental data such as pressure flow rate and weight and a tank to separate recovered nodules from seawater and store the nodules especially the pipe line on board for recovery of an artificial manganese nodule was designed and installed in order to simulate the total pressure drop in 2 500 m vertical lifting which was realized by multiple bents orifices and valves the on board slurry flow terminates at the nodule separator the lifted nodules are separated and recovered while the seawater was discharged out of board the nodule separator has an additional measurement tank such as fig 4 in which the nodule and seawater slurry flow during a certain time about 60 s is stored and weighed for the purpose of investigation of volumetric concentration a weight of the stored slurry was measured by load cells which is installed under the measurement tank 4 lifting test results the performance test of the developed lifting system was carried out using pure sea water and slurry mixed with sea water and nodules the purpose of the pure sea water test is to verify the operation status of the processing system the lifting system and the measurement system installed on board the objective of the slurry test is to evaluate the nodule recovery performance of the lifting system and the developed measuring system was used to verify the performance of the lifting system the system measured the weight of sea water and nodules the recovery performance of the lifting system was evaluated through the measured weights 4 1 recovery test of pure sea water the lifting test using pure sea water was performed 5 times in total the sea water transferred on board was stored in the measurement tank for a certain period of time to obtain quantitative experiment data the sea water stored in the measurement tank was weighed through load cells attached to the bottom of the tank the measured weight data of sea water are shown in fig 5 which represents continuously the measurement results from the 1st test to 5th test fig 5 shows that the measured weight is not constant from 1st to 5th the reason why the measurement weight was not constant is because the storage time of the sea water had an error when storing the sea water in the measurement tank for 60 s the time for storing the sea water in the measurement tank was 33 s for the first time and the other times were about 60 s in the first test the sea water had to be stored for 60 s but it was stored for only 33 s due to the control error of the lifting system in the second to fifth tests the measured weights are different even though the sea water was stored for the same time because the amount of sea water transferred during the same time was different due to control error of the flow rate when the sea water was carried through the lifting system this phenomenon was confirmed by the results of yeu et al 2016 fig 6 shows that the lifting system could not transfer a constant flow rate under the same control condition the mean value of the load cell data was used as the experimental correction value for the quantitative analysis of the experimental results table 1 shows the corrected values of the weight data of sea water from 1st test to 5th test measured by the load cell the corrected weight can be converted to densities using a volume of the sea water stored in the measurement tank the calibration method of the measurement data can be verified by comparing the densities because the density of sea water is known to be about 1 025 kg m3 the volume of the sea water was measured using a ruler installed on the measurement tank table 2 shows the measured volumes of sea water and the converted densities the converted densities have some errors but they are similar to theoretical density of sea water in particular the density converted to the 2nd test result has the largest error but the error rate is as low as about 2 the error of 2 in real sea experiment is negligible 4 2 recovery test of slurry with manganese nodule a nodule recovery test was performed using the developed pilot lifting system the procedure of experiment is as follows first artificial nodules were injected into the buffer located at a depth of 500 m second the injected nodule mixed with sea water and the slurry was made then it was transferred to on board facilities by the lifting system finally the slurry transferred to the on board was stored in the measurement tank to measure and remainders were transferred through the nodule recovery facility 4 2 1 artificial nodule for test an artificial nodule used in the experiment was designed to simulate manganese nodules which are minerals in the deep seabed the artificial nodule was produced in a korean company as shown in fig 7 a the size of the produced nodule is similar to the deep seabed manganese nodule however the material properties of nodules can vary due to the deformation that occurred during the fabrication process thus the density and specific gravity to be used for the analysis of the experimental results were measured before the real sea experiment the measurement method is as follows first a mass and a volume of the artificial nodule were measured using a beaker and an electronic scale as shown in fig 7 b and the density and specific gravity were calculated by using the measured mass and volume table 3 shows the measured and calculated material properties of the artificial nodule the measurement was performed 5 times to minimize the experimental error according to the results the density of the artificial nodule was about 1797 kg m3 this value is 75 greater than the density of sea water 1025 kg m3 4 2 2 recovery test result fig 8 shows the load cell data of the slurry which is a mixture of the sea water and the artificial nodule transferred by the lifting system the weight data of the slurry measured by the load cell had the same error as the experimental results using sea water thus the corrected value of the slurry weight data is 13 172 kg which is the average value of the load cell data table 4 shows the measured results from the measurement tank containing the corrected weight data the density of the slurry can be calculated by the weight and volume of the slurry stored in the tank the density of the slurry was measured to be 1035 kg m3 which is larger than the sea water density of 1025 kg m3 and smaller than the nodule density of 1 797 kg m3 because the slurry is a mixture of sea water and nodule it is possible to calculate composition ratios such as a volume ratio and a mass ratio of the sea water and the nodule in the slurry by using the measured density the volume ratio and the mass ratio were calculated as 0 013 1 3 and 0 023 2 3 the weight of the nodule in the slurry can be predicted through the measured mass ratio the estimated nodule weighed about 303 kg in addition the weight of the nodule can be measured directly after removing the sea water in the measurement tank the weight of the stored nodule was measured at 281 26 kg the reason for the difference between the predicted nodule weight and the measured nodule weight is due to loss of powdered nodule the powdered nodules in the slurry were discharged from the tank along with sea water during the separation of sea water and nodule for this reason the weight of stored nodules is reduced finally the developed pilot lifting system recovered nodules of 281 26 kg for 77 s at a mass ration of 2 2 and an average transport ratio of this system was measured at 3 65 kg sec this result means that the developed pilot lifting system has a nodule production capacity of 3 65 kg sec 5 measurement error analysis the data measured by the load cell installed on board have large and small errors the measured data with these errors cannot be used for accurate analysis of experimental results therefore we should analyze the main cause of errors and study how to eliminate or correct them for accurate analysis of experiment results 5 1 analysis of load cell data all test data have measurement errors as fig 9 that shows the measurement data of 2nd test fig 9 b shows clearly that the measuring data using load cells have irregular vibrations by measurement errors dynamic results such as the load cell data are measured as a single spectrum combining the results of several independent causes the measured combined spectrum can be analyzed for independent causes through fft fast fourier transform method cho and lee 2006 srikanth and sekhar 2016 fft analysis was performed by excel fft calculator fig 10 shows the fft result of the weight data measured by the load cell the weight data had two frequency components such as 1st mode and 2nd mode the 1st mode of the weight data occurred at about 0 13 hz the 2nd mode was caused at 2 38 hz measured data are the weight of sea water stored for 60 s in the measurement tank a weight is a physical quantity generated by gravitational acceleration therefore the error of the measured weight data may have been caused by the dynamic effect of other acceleration except gravitational acceleration acting directly on the nodule these dynamic effects include the behavior of the ship by waves the vibration of the measurement tank due to the ship behavior the sloshing effect in the measurement tank and so on also the factor that cause errors in the sensor itself are the sensor offset error and thermal effect due to direct sunlight the sensor offset error among these causes does not cause measurement error because sensor set zero during sensor installation in addition thermal effects such as thermal deformation and thermal expansion due to direct sunlight are close to 0 frequency because the generation period is 1 day according to the results of the fft analysis of the measurement data no phenomena were observed in the 0 frequency region so the thermal effects cannot be the cause of the measurement error therefore the dynamic effects acting on the measurement system are predicted as the cause of the error because the causes of errors in the sensor itself are not the cause of the measurement error fft analysis is used to analyze the cause of each factor causing the dynamic effects 5 2 cause investigation of measurement error 5 2 1 dynamic effect by vessel motion a ship has 6 way motions such as surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw the ship behavior was measured by displacement sensor which is attached in the center of gravity of the ship to minimize the motion error according to measured ship motions 3 way motions such as surge sway and yaw hardly occurred because of control by dp dynamic positioning however heave pitch and roll motions were measured as fig 11 because these motions were caused by phase difference of wave fft analysis of the measured vessel motion data was performed to analyze the dynamic effect of the vessel motion fig 12 shows the fft result of the measured ship behavior such as heave pitch and roll motions they had many frequency components including 0 13 hz 1st mode 0 78 hz 2nd mode and 1 11 hz 3rd mode and their frequency components had the same value in the same mode because the ship had the same dynamic effect in all directions according to the fft results the 1st mode of the load cell data is equal to the 1st mode of the ship behavior but the 2nd modes are different this means that the 1st mode of the load cell data was caused by the ship behavior and the cause of the 2nd mode is another factor such as shock by sloshing and structure vibration of the measurement tank among the various modes the primary effect on mechanical equipment is the 1st mode that occurs at the lower frequencies that carry the largest loads ray 2016 especially the 2nd mode has less influence than the 1st mode because the frequency difference between the 1st mode and the 2nd mode of the load cell data is large therefore the major factor affecting the measurement of the load cell is the ship behavior which is the cause of the 1st mode among the ship motion the heave motion with large displacement is the main cause because it generates more energy than pith and roll motions 5 2 2 structural dynamic effect of measurement tank a measurement error may occur due to the structural dynamic effect of the measurement tank because load cells are installed at the bottom of the measurement tank the mode analysis of the measurement tank was performed to analyze the natural frequency of the structure for analysis of the structural dynamic effect abaqus abaqus 2011 which is the commercial structural analysis software was used for mode analysis the tank has different natural frequencies depending on the installation method so the case analysis was performed by dividing the bottom welding condition case 1 of the frame supporting the tank and the entire welding condition case 2 of the frame the natural frequencies of the tank in case 1 are shown in case 1 of table 5 the first mode which is the lowest frequency occurs at 3 6482 hz with the shape shown in fig 13 the natural frequencies in case 2 are shown in case 2 of table 5 the first mode occurs at 16 89 hz with the shape shown in fig 14 in case 1 the transverse deformation of the frame occurs as shape of the first mode in case 2 the transverse deformation of the tank occurs as shape of the first mode because the entire frame was fixed as a result of mode analysis of the measurement tank the natural frequency of the measurement system is the frequency range not found in the measurement error therefore the structural dynamic effect of the measurement tank with a natural frequency above 3 6 hz is not the cause of the measurement error 5 2 3 dynamic effect by sloshing phenomenon in measurement tank the slurry mixed the manganese nodule and the sea water is transferred to the topside of the vessel through the lifting system the slurry delivered on board is stored in the measurement tank in general liquids transferred on board generate a sloshing phenomenon due to the shaking of a structure by wave and the shaking by the discharge pressure of the liquid jung et al 2015 a dynamic effect caused by this sloshing phenomenon can cause a measurement error therefore it is necessary to analyze the sloshing effect inside the tank for this analysis we used the natural frequency analysis method of a sloshing as verified by jung jung et al 2015 natural frequencies f n of the sloshing phenomenon can be calculated by the following eqs 5 and 6 5 ω n n π g l tanh n π h l 6 f n ω n 2 π where l is the tank length h is the slurry depth n is the mode number and g is the acceleration of gravity the length of the measurement tank is 1 96 m and the slurry depth is 1 6 m plus the measured length of the ruler because the ruler for measuring the slurry depth is located 1 6 m from the bottom of the measurement tank data from the pure sea water test was used for natural frequency analysis of the sloshing the natural frequencies of the sloshing in the tank calculated by these values and equations are shown in table 6 there was a mode of 2 36 hz in the natural frequency modes on sloshing phenomenon the frequency of this mode was close to 2 38 hz the second mode of the measurement error taking into account the measurement error of the ruler in the measurement tank the mode of 2 36 hz is a factor causing the measurement error therefore it was confirmed that the sloshing effect in addition to the vessel motion causes a measurement error by applying a dynamic effect to the load cells the calculated method of the natural frequency modes on sloshing phenomenon used in this study is a calculation method for two dimensional sloshing phenomenon the actual value may differ from the calculated value because the actual sloshing phenomenon is three dimensional phenomenon however according to a study by angitha 2014 the sloshing effect inside the tank was almost unaffected by depth in the same mode the results of this study can be seen in table 7 angitha s study investigated the effect of internal sloshing on lng tankers the results of his research show that there is almost no change in natural frequencies on sloshing when the volume of the liquid in the tanker changes from 20 to 90 after all the sloshing effect was two dimensional phenomenon that varied by the size of the tanker therefore it is appropriate to use the calculation method for two dimensional sloshing phenomenon in this study however the additional experiment needs to verify whether the high order mode such as 14th mode of sloshing phenomenon having low energy can influence the experimental data although it has been reported that only the first mode of sloshing phenomenon is affected in previous that the higher modes also have enough energy because they are similar to the frequency of the low order mode can be checked through the studies of the angitha 2014 and jung et al 2015 6 conclusion in this study we proposed an on board measurement method to estimate the production rate and solid fraction of the liquid solid slurry for optimizing the deep seabed mining systems the measurement technique has been verified with the real test in ocean however the measured data from the real test in ocean have significant errors to obtain the exact measurement values we performed fft analysis because there are significant noises due to the wave structural vibration and sloshing effects as a result of the fft analysis it was found that the main causes of the errors are due to the wave and the sloshing in the measuring systems so we removed the noise of the measured data using the fft results and filtering finally we obtained the accurate data as shown in fig 15 if the measurement method is applied to a commercial on board measurement system for deep seabed mining system it would be possible to optimize the mining system of deep sea manganese nodules acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the full support shown for this research work this study was initiated by an r d project entitled establishment of center for offshore research and engineering service and technology development of deep seabed mining system for manganese nodules sponsored by the ministry of oceans and fisheries of korea 
23663,dropped objects is one of the most hazardous accidents of floating production storage offloading fpso due to the potentially severe consequences therefore the quantitative calculation of dropped objects impact risk which is featured with uncertainties is essential monte carlo simulation mcs is a method for this intention with flexibility and efficiency however wide calculating resources are needed for mcs based accident analysis especially when multiple random variables are concerned moreover dropped objects collision damage models are perplexed and usually pronounced by the finite element method fem which is of a computational complexity to address this issue this paper considered a combined methodology the artificial neural network ann adjusted by genetic algorithm ga is united with mcs to analyze dropped objects collision failure probability quantitatively a time dependent progressive simulation is employed to forecast the structural response caused by dropped objects collision then the ann ga is trained based upon the collision data and used as an alternative for the computational fem performs with the mcs methodology the risk level for the dropped objects collision of fpso is assessed by comparing the proposed method and the dnv rules and a qualitative uncertainty analysis is also conducted in this quantitative failure analysis keywords dropped objects failure analysis ann ga model mcs fpso 1 introduction the accidents of marine structures occur frequently particularly falling objects accounts 44 72 of the total number of marine structures accidents dnv 2007 ranking the first place in all kinds of marine accidents fig 1 the clash of falling object in the operating scope of fpso crane to the deck structure or deck equipment can cause structural damage or the loss of production suspension it may even lead to pipeline gas leakage and fire disaster endangering life and health and damaging the marine environment although it is strongly suggested by international rules and regulations to evaluate probabilistic impact risk from dropped objects in the offshore industry most engineers have difficulties in estimating a reliable failure probability since there is no concrete guideline on probabilistic impact failure analysis for dropped objects heo and kang 2014 therefore an effective failure analysis method for dropped objects of fpso is crucial for the marine engineering the failure analysis for dropped objects of fpso includes dropped objects occurring frequency and collision failure probability conditional failure probability the dropped objects occurring frequency may be estimated by statistical analysis or extrapolation from historical data which will be determined in section 2 1 the collision failure probability would be measured in terms of structural damage which is mainly studied in this paper a great amount of accident situations should be appropriate to cover the quantitative analyses of dropped objects collision damage therefore choosing a proper damage calculation methodology is necessary to diminish simulation time numerous researches have been organized on offshore structures collision ellinas and walker 1983 studied the marine damaged oil pipeline and proposed a semi empirical relationship between impact load p and damage depth d at impact point aimed at the submarine oil pipelines in the north sea

simulation on the impact process of the falling objects on the deck structure by the finite element software ls dyna the critical deformation energy of the impacted deck structure was obtained moreover they analyzed the constitutive relation between the failure strain and the critical deformation energy ståhlberg et al 2013 proposed meta modeling methods for estimating the extent of collision damage liu et al 2015 carried out model experimental and numerical simulation on lateral stamping of the stiffened plate structure with initial damage and proposed a simple analytical method to test the energy absorption mechanism of the damaged structure dropped objects collisions are increasingly simulated with numerical approaches foretell the structural damage generally the collision model of dropped objects are complicated and are usually resolved by the finite element method which is computationally expensive accordingly immoderate calculating resources are required if the numerical methodology is employed in mcs consequently an inspiring methodology is essential to guarantee the accuracy of the damage estimation and diminish calculating time the artificial neural network ann model is a mathematical model that tries to approximate a complex relationship between inputs and outputs which was invented by papanikolaou 2009 and sun et al 2017 to predict collision

of dropped objects collision 4 1 1 fem for dynamic simulation of dropped objects collision the stiffened plate a major structural element of offshore structures is prone to damage due to collision with other floating or fixed structures and falling objects cho and lee 2009 in this section a simulation of the stiffened plate structure collision is performed to verify the accuracy of the model the stiffened plate structure collision model test of sang rai cho and hyun seung lee is selected see fig 7 the fem simulation is carried out for five kinds of stiffened plate model the geometric and material properties of models are listed in table 2 eight strain gauges were bonded to the back face where stiffeners were welded four gauges were bonded to the plate three were bonded to the stiffener flange and one was bonded at the mid height of the stiffener web fig 8 shows the locations of strain gauges the belytschko tsay bt type shell elements are appropriate to model thin walled structures proposed by paik and hughes 2006 such as offshore structures furthermore plastic distortion can be gained efficiently as the number of through shell thickness combining points promotes hallquist 2006 the bt type element with 3 nip integration points is adjusted together with the failure strain standard employed in this paper the following equation which is derived from the cowper symonds formula is used to estimate the dynamic fracture strain jones 1989 4 1 ε f d ε f 1 ε r c 1 p 1 where ε f is the static failure strain ε f d is the dynamic failure strain ε r is the strain rate c and p are the cowper symonds material property coefficients the stress nephogram for model cs11 is presented in fig 9 the collision test and numerical simulation results are compared for model cs13 as shown in fig 10 the numerical simulation is compared with the stiffened plate structure test through collision force with penetration shown in table 3 consequently the outcomes gained by the fem are in accordance with the stiffened plate model test which suggests that the fem can be employed to indicate actual dropped objects collision progress the settings in this imitation are used in the following impact scenarios sampled by mcs 4 1 2 establishing the dropped objects collision scenario of fpso 4 1 2 1 dropped objects impact deck structure in this paper a typical deck structure of fpso is selected as the research object the deck structure is modeled with a scaling factor of 1 1 the shell163 element is used to simulate the deck deck longitudinal bone strong frame plate and stiffener and the solid164 element is used to simulate the falling objects automatic surface to surface contact is applied to describe the interaction force between the dropped objects and the deck structure the contacts between all parts of the deck structure are set to an automatic single surface and the friction coefficients of all contacts are set to 0 3 the equivalent plastic strain is widely used as the failure criterion of the structure in the simulation of collision the mesh size is selected as 0 12 m and the corresponding failure plastic strain is 0 36 which is considered as an appropriate value for the mesh size and material thickness calle and alves 2015 the material properties for deck structure are listed in table 4 the shape of falling objects are divided into two types box and round the fem as shown in fig 11 the impact location is divided into three categories as shown in fig 12 the position a is the center of the plate the position b is the longitudinal bone and the position c is the intersection of the longitudinal bone and transverse beams this paper compared and analyzed the calculation results after impacting three positions with the working conditions as follows the radius of the round falling object is 0 4 m the mass is 6t and the falling height is 15 m fig 13 shows the time history curve of the impact depth at different positions of the deck impacted by the round object the impact depth is the smallest at the intersection of the longitudinal bone and transverse beams and the largest at the central position of plate the same conclusion is also suitable for box object impacting deck structure therefore the central position of the plate with the highest failure rate after the impact is taken as the research object by changing the shape box round size mass and impact speed of the falling object the influence of initial impact parameters on impact force impact depth and failure condition is analyzed for deck structure fig 14 shows the stress nephogram of the deck structure impacted by box object with the size of 1 0 m and the mass of 20t falling from the height of 15 m 4 1 2 2 dropped objects impact deck equipment the parameters of a typical crude oil storage equipment within the operating range of the fpso crane are shown in table 5 and the material properties for deck equipment are listed in table 6 automatic surface to surface contact is applied to describe the interaction force between the dropped objects and the equipment and the tied contact is adopted for equipment and deck structure the deck equipment model is shown in fig 15 for impacting deck equipment we consider the falling object hitting at the center top of the equipment similarly by changing the shape box round size mass and impact speed of the falling object the influence of initial impact parameters on impact force impact depth and failure condition is also analyzed for deck equipment fig 16 shows the stress nephogram of the deck equipment impacted by round object with the diameter of 0 6 m and the mass of 6t falling from the height of 15 m 4 2 application of ann ga coupled with mcs method on dropped objects collision in the ann ga coupled with mcs approach the mass velocity depending on the drop height and size are considered as control parameters goerlandt et al 2012 proposed that different assumptions for the impact scenario can cause diverse results in risk analysis youssef et al 2014 proposed a sampling method for selecting a certain number of prospective impact scenarios the parameters of dropped objects impact scenarios in mcs are sampled from the probability density distribution the probability density distribution for mass of dropped objects follows a weibull distribution and the specific description is displayed in table 7 dnv rp f107 2001 the impact consequence for two shape box round is different and must be considered individually thus the shape of dropped objects is considered as a reference parameter for identifying the damage degree and failure probability but not as a control parameter in this paper the probability density distribution for size and velocity of dropped objects are assumed to be normal distribution due to the lack of historical statistical data a database consisting of 72 training samples was created based on the fem in this paper 75 of the data is used for training 10 is used for validation and 15 is used for testing a three layer bpnn is applied and the input layer includes three neurons corresponding to the three parameters of dropped objects one neuron which represents the impact depth is present in the output layer as shown in fig 3 a logsig function is used for the transfer function in the hidden layer and a purelin function is selected as the output layer the number of neurons in the hidden layer sets to 12 accordingly the bpnn structure is built as a type of 3 12 1 the chromosome length of each individual is 61 according to the architecture of the network 3 12 2 12 1 the norm of differences between the predicted impact depth and actual impact depth is defined as the fitness of ga algorithm in order to optimize the initial weights and biases of ann prior to network training other parameters of ga discussed in section 3 1 are summarized in table 8 the bpnn model optimized by ga is programmed in matlab for the iterations in the damage assessment procedure 5 results and discussion 5 1 results analysis the predicted results of ann ga model depend on the structure of the ann and the chosen algorithm moreover the number of training samples in this paper the convergence of the ann model is tested with a population size of samples from 36 to 72 the generalized results in table 9 indicate that the trained ann ga model is convergent when the number of training samples is increased to 72 the average absolute value re is 0 102 which is sufficiently small and shows that the ann ga model can be established accurately based on those samples thus the database consisting of 72 training samples created by fem for the box dropped objects impacting deck structure are used to train and validate the ann ga model it can be seen that the variation of error kept decreasing as the evolution increased until the threshold reached at seventy fig 17 and then leveled off toward the end the error range decreased from 11 6e 3 to 5 1e 3 which improves the prediction accuracy of the bpnn model through the optimization of ga the initial weights and biases of ann are shown in table 10 with the same data set the comparison of the ann ga model and the original ann model for the box dropped objects impacting deck structure is illustrated in fig 18 the output in the fig 18 represents generalized to show the correlation degree of the ann ga and fem fig 18a explain the fitting results between ann ga model and fem using training data fig 18b explain the fitting results between ann ga model and fem using test data which reflect the predicted results by the training model small generalization errors and good correlation 0 99994 for the training sets and 0 99742 for the test sets can be observed between the ann ga model and fem it also can be concluded that the accuracy of the ann ga model is significantly improved after the optimization of initial weights and biases see fig 18c and d thereby indicating that the ann ga model can be used to represent the repeated calculation of the numerical method with little bias the results trained by ann ga model for the other dropped objects conditions are presented in figs 19 21 with small generalization errors and good correlation the ann ga model can predict an accurate value of the corresponding impact depth δ based on the basic random input parameters mass velocity size for both deck structure and deck equipment with different design brown and chen 2002 proposed the number of samples in the mcs process can be 10 000 in this paper however the required size of samples in mcs is estimated by equation 3 1 and the maximum allowable error d n is assumed to be 0 1 m for the size of dropped objects 0 01 kg for the mass and 0 01 m s for the impact velocity the confidence level γ is selected as 95 the required number of sampling obtained by equation 3 1 is 18 496 which is selected to predict the impact depth δ through multiple random sampling in the ann ga coupled with mcs approach failure probability can be calculated through equation 2 3 which is also defined as the conditional failure probability the failure frequency of the different shapes of dropped objects impacting on deck structure and deck equipment are shown in tables 11 14 in order to compare the failure frequency and risk of any of the relevant hazards a ranking from 1 low frequency to 5 high frequency is proposed by dnv 2001 see table 15 the comparison results are summarized as follows i the failure frequency for box dropped objects impacting on deck structure is 1 683e 3 which is classified as a medium high risk the failure frequency for round dropped objects impacting on deck structure is 9 163e 4 which is classified as a medium risk ii the failure frequency for box dropped objects impacting on deck equipment is 7 204e 4 which is classified as a medium risk the failure frequency for round dropped objects impacting on deck equipment is 4 424e 4 which is classified as a medium risk 5 2 uncertainty analysis for the dropped objects collision of fpso probability is a tool to express uncertainty which is an important part of failure analysis possible uncertainty factors in the background knowledge must be highlighted and their effect on risk should be considered flage and aven 2009 goerlandt and montewka 2015a b proposed that uncertainty should be respected in risk analysis in order to accomplish quantitative failure analysis for the dropped objects collision of fpso several assumptions are made in the ann ga coupled with mcs method on dropped objects collision to save time and computing resources i although dropped objects from cranes are one of the most hazardous accident for fpso little information or literature is available to express the probability density distribution for input parameters of falling collision especially material properties structural arrangement and shell thicknesses which is an important part in mcs the failure probability can be more accurate by using ann ga coupled with mcs method when the probability density distribution of the input parameters are provided exactly ii the damage in collision cases is affected by the mesh size kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 indicated the influence of mesh size on the ductile fracture of large scale shell structures in this study the mesh size is selected as 0 12 m and the corresponding failure plastic strain is 0 36 which is considered as an appropriate value for the mesh size and material thickness calle and alves 2015 iii the impact location is divided into three categories for deck structure in this paper the central position of the plate with the highest failure rate after the impact is taken as the research object which will lead to the calculation result of failure probability is a little larger than the actual one however the results can also be used to provide the basis for the following risk analysis by conservative estimate 6 conclusion in this paper a combined ann ga coupled with mcs method was proposed to calculate the failure probability for dropped objects from the crane of fpso the dropped objects occurring frequency are estimated by statistical analysis and historical data the results obtained by the fem are consistent with the stiffened plate structure collision model test which indicates that the fem can be used to present actual dropped objects collision progress the proposed approach integrated with the computing accuracy of the numerical methodology and the ann s capacity for generalization thus the ann significantly reduces the number of numerical calculations and the ga improves the calculation accuracy of ann the dropped objects impact scenarios are sampled by mcs to deal with the uncertainty of random variable the risk level for the dropped objects collision of fpso is assessed by comparing the proposed method and the dnv rules the proposed approach can be employed to analyze other uncertain offshore structural issues with difficulties acknowledgements this research is funded by the national 111 project no b07019 from the administration of foreign experts affairs and ministry of education of china

23663,dropped objects is one of the most hazardous accidents of floating production storage offloading fpso due to the potentially severe consequences therefore the quantitative calculation of dropped objects impact risk which is featured with uncertainties is essential monte carlo simulation mcs is a method for this intention with flexibility and efficiency however wide calculating resources are needed for mcs based accident analysis especially when multiple random variables are concerned moreover dropped objects collision damage models are perplexed and usually pronounced by the finite element method fem which is of a computational complexity to address this issue this paper considered a combined methodology the artificial neural network ann adjusted by genetic algorithm ga is united with mcs to analyze dropped objects collision failure probability quantitatively a time dependent progressive simulation is employed to forecast the structural response caused by dropped

collision of fpso is assessed by comparing the proposed method and the dnv rules and a qualitative uncertainty analysis is also conducted in this quantitative failure analysis keywords dropped objects failure analysis ann ga model mcs fpso 1 introduction the accidents of marine structures occur frequently particularly falling objects accounts 44 72 of the total number of marine structures accidents dnv 2007 ranking the first place in all kinds of marine accidents fig 1 the clash of falling object in the operating scope of fpso crane to the deck structure or deck equipment can cause structural damage or the loss of production suspension it may even lead to pipeline gas leakage and fire disaster endangering life and health and damaging the marine environment although it is strongly suggested by international rules and regulations to evaluate probabilistic impact risk from dropped objects in the offshore industry most engineers have difficulties in estimating a reliable failure probability since there is no concrete guideline on probabilistic impact failure analysis for dropped objects heo and kang 2014 therefore an effective failure analysis method for dropped objects of fpso is crucial for the marine engineering the failure analysis for dropped objects of fpso includes dropped objects occurring frequency and collision failure probability conditional failure probability the dropped objects occurring frequency may be estimated by statistical analysis or extrapolation from historical data which will be determined in section 2 1 the collision failure probability would be measured in terms of structural damage which is mainly studied in this paper a great amount of accident situations should be appropriate to cover the quantitative analyses of dropped objects collision damage therefore choosing a proper damage calculation methodology is necessary to diminish simulation time numerous researches have been organized on offshore structures collision ellinas and walker 1983 studied the marine damaged oil pipeline and proposed a semi empirical relationship between impact load p and damage depth d at impact point aimed at the submarine oil pipelines in the north sea ellinas 1995 adopted finite element software abaqus and test data to discuss the impact and damage of several fishing gears on the pipeline equipment hao and zhang 2009 carried out numerical simulation on the impact process of the falling objects on the deck structure by the finite element software ls dyna the critical deformation energy of the impacted deck structure was obtained moreover they analyzed the constitutive relation between the failure strain and the critical deformation energy ståhlberg et al 2013 proposed meta modeling methods for estimating the extent of collision damage liu et al 2015 carried out model experimental and numerical simulation on lateral stamping of the stiffened plate structure with initial damage and proposed a simple analytical method to test the energy absorption mechanism of the damaged structure dropped objects collisions are increasingly simulated with numerical approaches foretell the structural damage generally the collision model of dropped objects are complicated and are usually resolved by the finite element method which is computationally expensive accordingly immoderate calculating resources are required if the numerical methodology is employed in mcs consequently an inspiring methodology is essential to guarantee the accuracy of the damage estimation and diminish calculating time the artificial neural

of dropped objects collision 4 1 1 fem for dynamic simulation of dropped objects collision the stiffened plate a major structural element of offshore structures is prone to damage due to collision with other floating or fixed structures and falling objects cho and lee 2009 in this section a simulation of the stiffened plate structure collision is performed to verify the accuracy of the model the stiffened plate structure collision model test of sang rai cho and hyun seung lee is selected see fig 7 the fem simulation is carried out for five kinds of stiffened plate model the geometric and material properties of models are listed in table 2 eight strain gauges were bonded to the back face where stiffeners were welded four gauges were bonded to the plate three were bonded to the stiffener flange and one was bonded at the mid height of the stiffener web fig 8 shows the locations of strain gauges the belytschko tsay bt type shell elements are appropriate to model thin walled structures proposed by paik and hughes 2006 such as offshore structures furthermore plastic distortion can be gained efficiently as the number of through shell thickness combining points promotes hallquist 2006 the bt type element with 3 nip integration points is adjusted together with the failure strain standard employed in this paper the following equation which is derived from the cowper symonds formula is used to estimate the dynamic fracture strain jones 1989 4 1 ε f d ε f 1 ε r c 1 p 1 where ε f is the static failure strain ε f d is the dynamic failure strain ε r is the strain rate c and p are the cowper symonds material property coefficients the stress nephogram for model cs11 is presented in fig 9 the collision test and numerical simulation results are compared for model cs13 as shown in fig 10 the numerical simulation is compared with the stiffened plate structure test through collision force with penetration shown in table 3 consequently the outcomes gained by the fem are in accordance with the stiffened plate model test which suggests that the fem can be employed to indicate actual dropped objects collision progress the settings in this imitation are used in the following impact scenarios sampled by mcs 4 1 2 establishing the dropped objects collision scenario of fpso 4 1 2 1 dropped objects impact deck structure in this paper a typical deck structure of fpso is selected as the research object the deck structure is modeled with a scaling factor of 1 1 the shell163 element is used to simulate the deck deck longitudinal bone strong frame plate and stiffener and the solid164 element is used to simulate the falling objects automatic surface to surface contact is applied to describe the interaction force between the dropped objects and the deck structure the contacts between all parts of the deck structure are set to an automatic single surface and the friction coefficients of all contacts are set to 0 3 the equivalent plastic strain is widely used as the failure criterion of the structure in the simulation of collision the mesh size is selected as 0 12 m and the corresponding failure plastic strain is 0 36 which is considered as an appropriate value for the mesh size and material thickness calle and alves 2015 the material properties for deck structure are listed in table 4 the shape of falling objects are divided into two types box and round the fem as shown in fig 11 the impact location is divided into three categories as shown in fig 12 the position a is the center of the plate the position b is the longitudinal bone and the position c is the intersection of the longitudinal bone and transverse beams this paper compared and analyzed the calculation results after impacting three positions with the working conditions as follows the radius of the round falling object is 0 4 m the mass is 6t and the falling height is 15 m fig 13 shows the time history curve of the impact depth at different positions of the deck impacted by the round object the impact depth is the smallest at the intersection of the longitudinal bone and transverse beams and the largest at the central position of plate the same conclusion is also suitable for box object impacting deck structure therefore the central position of the plate with the highest failure rate after the impact is taken as the research object by changing the shape box round size mass and impact speed of the falling object the influence of initial impact parameters on impact force impact depth and failure condition is analyzed for deck structure fig 14 shows the stress nephogram of the deck structure impacted by box object with the size of 1 0 m and the mass of 20t falling from the height of 15 m 4 1 2 2 dropped objects impact deck equipment the parameters of a typical crude oil storage equipment within the operating range of the fpso crane are shown in table 5 and the material properties for deck equipment are listed in table 6 automatic surface to surface contact is applied to describe the interaction force between the dropped objects and the equipment and the tied contact is adopted for equipment and deck structure the deck equipment model is shown in fig 15 for impacting deck equipment we consider the falling object hitting at the center top of the equipment similarly by changing the shape box round size mass and impact speed of the falling object the influence of initial impact parameters on impact force impact depth and failure condition is also analyzed for deck equipment fig 16 shows the stress nephogram of the deck equipment impacted by round object with the diameter of 0 6 m and the mass of 6t falling from the height of 15 m 4 2 application of ann ga coupled with mcs method on dropped objects collision in the ann ga coupled with mcs approach the mass velocity depending on the drop height and size are considered as control parameters goerlandt et al 2012 proposed that different assumptions for the impact scenario can cause diverse results in risk analysis youssef et al 2014 proposed a sampling method for selecting a certain number of prospective impact scenarios the parameters of dropped objects impact scenarios in mcs are sampled from the probability density distribution the probability density distribution for mass of dropped objects follows a weibull distribution and the specific description is displayed in table 7 dnv rp f107 2001 the impact consequence for two shape box round is different and must be considered individually thus the shape of dropped objects is considered as a reference parameter for identifying the damage degree and failure probability but not as a control parameter in this paper the probability density distribution for size and velocity of dropped objects are assumed to be normal distribution due to the lack of historical statistical data a database consisting of 72 training samples was created based on the fem in this paper 75 of the data is used for training 10 is used for validation and 15 is used for testing a three layer bpnn is applied and the input layer includes three neurons corresponding to the three parameters of dropped objects one neuron which represents the impact depth is present in the output layer as shown in fig 3 a logsig function is used for the transfer function in the hidden layer and a purelin function is selected as the output layer the number of neurons in the hidden layer sets to 12 accordingly the bpnn structure is built as a type of 3 12 1 the chromosome length of each individual is 61 according to the architecture of the network 3 12 2 12 1 the norm of differences between the predicted impact depth and actual impact depth is defined as the fitness of ga algorithm in order to optimize the initial weights and biases of ann prior to network training other parameters of ga discussed in section 3 1 are summarized in table 8 the bpnn model optimized by ga is programmed in matlab for the iterations in the damage assessment procedure 5 results and discussion 5 1 results analysis the predicted results of ann ga model depend on the structure of the ann and the chosen algorithm moreover the number of training samples in this paper the convergence of the ann model is tested with a population size of samples from 36 to 72 the generalized results in table 9 indicate that the trained ann ga model is convergent when the number of training samples is increased to 72 the average absolute value re is 0 102 which is sufficiently small and shows that the ann ga model can be established accurately based on those samples thus the database consisting of 72 training samples created by fem for the box dropped objects impacting deck structure are used to train and validate the ann ga model it can be seen that the variation of error kept decreasing as the evolution increased until the threshold reached at seventy fig 17 and then leveled off toward the end the error range decreased from 11 6e 3 to 5 1e 3 which improves the prediction accuracy of the bpnn model through the optimization of ga the initial weights and biases of ann are shown in table 10 with the same data set the comparison of the ann ga model and the original ann model for the box dropped objects impacting deck structure is illustrated in fig 18 the output in the fig 18 represents generalized to show the correlation degree of the ann ga and fem fig 18a explain the fitting results between ann ga model and fem using training data fig 18b explain the fitting results between ann ga model and fem using test data which reflect the predicted results by the training model small generalization errors and good correlation 0 99994 for the training sets and 0 99742 for the test sets can be observed between the ann ga model and fem it also can be concluded that the accuracy of the ann ga model is significantly improved after the optimization of initial weights and biases see fig 18c and d thereby indicating that the ann ga model can be used to represent the repeated calculation of the numerical method with little bias the results trained by ann ga model for the other dropped objects conditions are presented in figs 19 21 with small generalization errors and good correlation the ann ga model can predict an accurate value of the corresponding impact depth δ based on the basic random input parameters mass velocity size for both deck structure and deck equipment with different design brown and chen 2002 proposed the number of samples in the mcs process can be 10 000 in this paper however the required size of samples in mcs is estimated by equation 3 1 and the maximum allowable error d n is assumed to be 0 1 m for the size of dropped objects 0 01 kg for the mass and 0 01 m s for the impact velocity the confidence level γ is selected as 95 the required number of sampling obtained by equation 3 1 is 18 496 which is selected to predict the impact depth δ through multiple random sampling in the ann ga coupled with mcs approach failure probability can be calculated through equation 2 3 which is also defined as the conditional failure probability the failure frequency of the different shapes of dropped objects impacting on deck structure and deck equipment are shown in tables 11 14 in order to compare the failure frequency and risk of any of the relevant hazards a ranking from 1 low frequency to 5 high frequency is proposed by dnv 2001 see table 15 the comparison results are summarized as follows i the failure frequency for box dropped objects impacting on deck structure is 1 683e 3 which is classified as a medium high risk the failure frequency for round dropped objects impacting on deck structure is 9 163e 4 which is classified as a medium risk ii the failure frequency for box dropped objects impacting on deck equipment is 7 204e 4 which is classified as a medium risk the failure frequency for round dropped objects impacting on deck equipment is 4 424e 4 which is classified as a medium risk 5 2 uncertainty analysis for the dropped objects collision of fpso probability is a tool to express uncertainty which is an important part of failure analysis possible uncertainty factors in the background knowledge must be highlighted and their effect on risk should be considered flage and aven 2009 goerlandt and montewka 2015a b proposed that uncertainty should be respected in risk analysis in order to accomplish quantitative failure analysis for the dropped objects collision of fpso several assumptions are made in the ann ga coupled with mcs method on dropped objects collision to save time and computing resources i although dropped objects from cranes are one of the most hazardous accident for fpso little information or literature is available to express the probability density distribution for input parameters of falling collision especially material properties structural arrangement and shell thicknesses which is an important part in mcs the failure probability can be more accurate by using ann ga coupled with mcs method when the probability density distribution of the input parameters are provided exactly ii the damage in collision cases is affected by the mesh size kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 indicated the influence of mesh size on the ductile fracture of large scale shell structures in this study the mesh size is selected as 0 12 m and the corresponding failure plastic strain is 0 36 which is considered as an appropriate value for the mesh size and material thickness calle and alves 2015 iii the impact location is divided into three categories for deck structure in this paper the central position of the plate with the highest failure rate after the impact is taken as the research object which will lead to the calculation result of failure probability is a little larger than the actual one however the results can also be used to provide the basis for the following risk analysis by conservative estimate 6 conclusion in this paper a combined ann ga coupled with mcs method was proposed to calculate the failure probability for dropped objects from the crane of fpso the dropped objects occurring frequency are estimated by statistical analysis and historical data the results obtained by the fem are consistent with the stiffened plate structure collision model test which indicates that the fem can be used to present actual dropped objects collision progress the proposed approach integrated with the computing accuracy of the numerical methodology and the ann s capacity for generalization thus the ann significantly reduces the number of numerical calculations and the ga improves the calculation accuracy of ann the dropped objects impact scenarios are sampled by mcs to deal with the uncertainty of random variable the risk level for the dropped objects collision of fpso is assessed by comparing the proposed method and the dnv rules the proposed approach can be employed to analyze other uncertain offshore

23664,long term cyclic loads with a stress level lower than the critical cyclic stress applied on soft soil can lead to soil deformation but not to failure the monismith model is known for its simplicity and capacity to describe the cumulative plastic strain of soil under cyclic loads however it is unsuccessfully applied in these cases because the plastic strain in this model would increase endlessly till to failure with increasing number of load cycles to solve this problem a novel empirical model with three parameters is proposed based on analogy analysis of the hardin drnevich model and monismith model the proposed model is verified by experimental data from existing literature and is shown to have better capability and performance than the monismith model in predicting the cumulative plastic strain of soft soil subjected to long term low cyclic loads the value of parameter b is recommended to be 0 5 and relationships of parameters a and c with the cyclic stress ratio are also proposed for soft clay applications of the proposed model are elaborated in detail and in situ test results for settlement of soft subgrade are used to evaluate the performance of this model the prediction results are consistent with the test results the research results present a promising method for investigating the development of deformation and the settlement of soft foundation in the near shore and off shore areas caused by wave and or traffic loads keywords empirical model cumulative plastic strain long term low cyclic loads soft soil 1 introduction soft marine clay has a high void ratio a high water content low permeability high compressibility and high sensitivity and is susceptible to outside disturbances it is also widely distributed in the east coast area of china in this marine environment the foundation design of offshore installations suction anchors wind turbines gravity platforms etc or near shore structures seawalls harbors dockyards lighthouse etc is governed by the bearing capacity and the serviceability under cyclic loads andersen 2009 hu and ding 2010 wichtmann et al 2013 these cyclic loads are caused by waves vehicle traffic and the operation of machinery resulting in a reduction of strength rao and panda 1999 moses and rao 2003 li et al 2011 and bearing capacity wichtmann et al 2013 tang et al 2011 unexpected settlement ren et al 2012 see ng et al 2013 for an example of settlement lei et al 2016 and other geotechnical engineering problems mayoral et al 2016 a model for cumulative deformation is a theoretical basis for solving the problems of dynamic stability and settlement of subgrade under long term cyclic loads at present the cumulative plastic deformation models under cyclic loading are mainly classified into two categories theoretical models and empirical models in the scientific literature theoretical models mainly include the modified cambridge model carter et al 1982 nested yield surface model mroz 1967 prevost 1977 1978 bounding surface model dafalias 1986a 1986b hu and liu 2015 etc these theoretical models are capable of calculating the plastic strain generated by each cyclic load generally being high in accuracy but complex in calculation however to meet the accuracy requirements most of these models need to adopt sufficiently small calculation steps to simulate the process of each cycle of loading and unloading this often leads to model failure due to excessive calculation especially for a large number of cyclic loads empirical models are usually established by using the results of laboratory tests and field tests which avoids excessive calculation as they meet the requirements of engineering practice empirical models have been widely used in practical engineering despite being less accurate than theoretical models a number of empirical models have been developed for predicting cumulative plastic deformation in soil under cyclic loading however the most commonly used is the following power model monismith et al 1975 1 ε p a n b where ε p is the cumulative plastic strain n is the number of cyclic load applications and a and b are two parameters that depend on the soil type soil properties and stress state afterward many researchers improved the power model 1 li and selig 1996 took into account the influence of the cyclic deviator stress σ d and soil statistic strength σ s on coefficient a in 1 as follows 2a a a σ d σ s m 2b ε p a σ d σ s m n b where a and m are material parameters m has a range of 1 0 4 2 and a has a range of 0 3 3 5 for 22 soils studied chai and miura 2002 considered the effect of the initial deviator stress σ i d on the cumulative plastic strain and proposed the following equation 3 ε p a σ d σ s m 1 σ i d σ s n n b where n is a constant coefficient with a recommended value of 1 0 various similar models have been developed parr 1972 moses et al 2003 abdelkrim et al 2003 huang et al 2006 shahin et al 2011 wang et al 2013 guo et al 2013 wang and li 2015 etc for different engineering backgrounds and practical applications in general these empirical models represent a relationship between the cumulative plastic strain and the number of repeated load applications some models also considered stresses the strain rate the soil type and soil properties the aim of this paper is to develop a novel empirical model for cumulative plastic deformation of soft marine clay subjected to cyclic loads characterized by a large number of repeated load applications and low stress this will provide an opportunity to discuss the settlement and strength decrease of foundation soils in the near shore and off shore areas under wave or traffic loads and to provide a broad even if not complete overview of deformation characteristics and their controlling factors as well as the relationship with time in the following we discuss the major influencing factors on cumulative deformation in terms of the stress state soil type and soil properties in section 2 section 3 presents a cumulative plastic deformation model and the proposed model will be verified and evaluated by test results in section 4 relationships between three model parameters the physical soil state and the stress state applications of the proposed model and model limitations are discussed in section 5 summaries and main conclusions are drawn in the last part of the paper 2 influencing factors a good prediction model for cumulative plastic deformation should take into account the major influencing factors the list of the most frequently quoted factors includes the physical properties of soil water content atterberg limits specific gravity particle size specific surface area etc stress state dynamic stress confining pressure over consolidation ratio loading frequency etc drainage conditions and stress path loading waveform loading method test control mode the rotation of principal stress axis etc li and selig 1996 huang et al 2006 ren et al 2012 cai et al 2013 sun et al 2015 gu et al 2016 elia and rouainia 2016 hicher 2016 among these factors for a given soil the most dominant influencing factor of cumulative plastic deformation is the cyclic deviator stress σ d which was recognized through laboratory test results conducted by many researchers such as seed et al 1955 monismith et al 1975 li and selig 1996 huang et al 2006 shahin et al 2011 etc the second important factor is the confining pressure these two factors mainly determine the development model of strain and the dissipation of excess pore water the existence of a critical cyclic stress or threshold stress has long been recognized by many researchers e g larew and leonards 1962 mitchell and king 1977 sangrey et al 1978 lefebvre et al 1989 tang et al 2003 shahin et al 2011 and the critical cyclic stress for several different soft soils is summarized in table 1 the critical cyclic stress is defined as the stress below which the soil will not suffer failure regardless of the number of repeated load applications and above which soil deformation will continually increase up to failure in other words when the applied cyclic stress is lower than the critical stress the cumulative plastic deformation of soil will not continually increase with an increase in the number of repeated load applications but tend to a stable limited value based on the critical cyclic stress level cai and cao 1996 classified the development of the permanent deformation into three types attenuation type critical type and destructive type and suggested applying different models for the different deformation types in many practical cases the cyclic loads applied on the mucky soft soil consist of long term repeated applications and a low stress level which is often lower than the critical stress of the soil therefore the plastic accumulative deformation induced by these loads will gradually increase at the beginning but the deformation rate gradually decreases after a certain time the cumulative plastic deformation reaches the maximum and tends to be stable no longer increasing over time however monismith s model the most widely used empirical model is not capable of predicting the deformation caused by the stress that is below the critical cyclic stress because the plastic strain it describes will increase endlessly with increasing number of cyclic loading applications 3 cumulative plastic deformation model fig 1 a shows the skeleton curve of stress strain relationship of soils subjected to cyclic loading which was described as a hyperbolic equation by hardin and drnevich 1972 i e the well known classical hardin drnevich model eq 4 4 σ d ε d a b ε d where a and b are model parameters fig 1 b shows the typical curve of cumulative deformation of soft soils under long term low cyclic stress it can be seen from fig 1 that the two curves look very similar it was therefore concluded that a function similar to that of equation 4 might be applicable to the cumulative plastic strain of soft soils under cyclic load conditions combining the monismith model eq 1 and hardin drnevich model a new model is proposed as equation 5 for the cumulative plastic deformation caused by cyclic stress with long term application and a low stress level especially for the stress lower than the critical stress of soil 5 ε p n b a c n b where a b and c are parameters that depend on the stress path stress state and physical properties of soil the impact of parameters a b and c on the cumulative plastic strain is shown in fig 2 b a and c respectively fig 2 a shows that for given values of parameters a and c the slope of the curve increases with increasing exponent parameter b while the initial and final strain remains the same regardless of b fig 2 b shows that the slope will remain stable and the curve will parallelly move toward the left or right if parameter b is given a certain value this observation suggests that the exponent parameter b characterizes the rate of accumulative plastic strain and does not affect the final amount of deformation of soil following this observation it might be reasonable to conclude that parameter b depends on the physical properties of the soil itself such as the water content void ratio particle size and particle specific surface area monismith et al 1975 suggested that the rate of cumulative plastic strain is unrelated to the dynamic stress level namely dynamic stress does not affect exponent parameter b in addition li and selig 1996 obtained similar conclusions and suggested that for a given soil parameter b should be a constant to examine whether parameter b in the proposed model also has a similar feature we complied experimental data from previous research to discuss the relationships between parameter b and the dynamic deviator stress σ d and loading stress ratio η which is expressed as η σ d 2 p where p σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 it can be seen from fig 3 a and b that parameter b seems to have no clear relationship with σ d and η which indicates that the exponent parameter b only depends on the soil type and soil properties and is unrelated to the subjected loads it should be a constant for a given soil this observation is consistent with previous studies see the references of monismith et al 1975 li and selig 1996 furthermore most values of parameter b are within a narrow range of 0 18 0 82 with a mean value of approximately 0 5 fig 2 b shows the influence of parameter a on the cumulative plastic strain for given parameters b and c the strain curve moves toward the right with parameter a increasing namely the time or number of repeated load applications required for the final deformation to become stable increases with an increase in parameter a meanwhile the final deformation and strain rate remain constant in addition after the first cyclic load application n 1 the caused strain 1 a c will increase with parameter a decreasing for a given parameter c therefore parameter a characterizes the degree of difficulty of the soil beginning to deform and the initial strain during the first cyclic load application to make parameter a much clearer the frequency of cyclic load f and application time t are introduced to replace the number of cyclic load applications n by the relation n t f thus equation 6 could be rewritten as 6 ε p t f b a c t f b for a given parameter b 1 both sides of equation 6 are divided by the time t then yielding 7 ε p ε p t f a c t f when time t 0 the strain rate becomes 8 ε p f a equation 8 further indicates that parameter a controls the initial strain of soil that is the degree of difficulty of the soil beginning to deform in addition since the first cyclic loading application will cause more or less deformation the caused strain 1 a c is always greater than zero namely a c 0 to explore the physical meaning of parameter c the bounds of equation 6 are discussed when the number of cyclic load applications n approaches infinity namely n the final cumulative plastic strain is 9 ε p f 1 c equation 9 indicates that the final strain is only dependent on parameter c regardless of the parameters a and b which could also be seen from fig 2 c for given parameters a and b the final strain increases with parameter c decreasing meanwhile both the initial strain stain at n 1 and the time to reach the final strain are the same for different c thus the factors that affect the final deformation e g physical properties of soils and cyclic deviator stress will also control parameter c since this paper s focus is on the case in which the applied stress is less than the critical cyclic stress the caused final strain should not exceed the critical strain of soils ε p c that is c 1 ε p c many researchers have investigated the critical strain of different types of soft soil under various cyclic stress and suggested a range of 1 0 ε p c 12 as shown in table 1 consequently the range of values for parameter c can be estimated as c 0 08 and parameter a c 0 08 in summary we proposed a new model with three parameters a b and c which denote the initial strain strain at n 1 strain rate and final cumulative strain respectively unfortunately although the physical meaning of every parameter is clear there is no appropriate experimental method to measure the parameters directly which weakens the application of the proposed model in practice therefore it is important to build links between the parameters and other easily measurable parameters such as the liquid limit undrained static strength confining pressure and cyclic deviator stress these links will be thoroughly analyzed in the following section 4 verification and validation to verify and validate the proposed model some available laboratory test results from the existing literature are compared with their corresponding predicted results a series of experimental data of cumulative plastic deformation under cyclic loads from the existing literature are compiled to examine the performance of the proposed model eq 5 and monismith model eq 1 the data involved four different soft clay type soils and were obtained via cyclic triaxial tests whose applied cyclic loads had a large number of cyclic load applications and a lower stress than critical stress level the least square method was used to obtain the parameters in equations 1 and 5 by fitting the data set of cumulative plastic strain ε p and number of cyclic load applications n using the fitted parameters the cumulative plastic strain was computed via the proposed model and monismith model and we made a comparison with the test results shown in fig 4 taking fig 4 a as an example the comparisons of the predicted and experimental cumulative plastic strain for remolded kaolinite clay are shown the test results were obtained by shahin et al 2011 the soil physical states specific gravity g s 2 65 liquid limit w l 53 plastic limit w p 26 stress state effective confining pressure σ 3 2 65 cyclic stress ratio csr 0 63 loading frequency f 1 0 hz were taken into account in the tests and the applied dynamic deviator stress was lower than the critical stress level specific details for the test procedures and other information of the soil and stress are available in the literature of shahin et al 2011 the predicted results of the monismith model and the proposed model in this paper are shown by the red dotted line and blue solid line respectively as illustrated the proposed model successfully reproduced the experimental data and produced a much lower root mean square error than the classical monismith model especially at the larger number of cyclic load applications the same conclusion can also be drawn from the other three figures the results indicate that the proposed model performs better in describing the cumulative plastic strain caused by long term low cyclic stress and is more suitable than the monismith model for describing the final deformation of soft clay when the applied cyclic deviator stress is below the critical stress level of soil wang et al 2013 carried out a series of triaxial tests with a large number of load applications on soft marine clay under various stress levels and different confining pressures of 50 kpa 100 kpa and 200 kpa for the test procedures and physical properties of the soils refer to this literature these test results are used to further validate the applicability of the proposed model we assume that the exponent parameter b in equation 5 is a constant of 0 5 according to fig 3 and the other two parameters a and c are fitted by the least square method using the test results for the confining pressures of 100 kpa and 200 kpa the fitted results are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that both parameters a and c have a strong correlation with the cyclic stress ratio csr and their relationship expressions are also obtained for this soil then using best fit parameters the cumulative plastic strain of soils for different cyclic stress ratios is predicted with the proposed equation 5 comparisons are made between the predicted values and measured values for the confining pressure of 50 kpa which was not used to fit the parameters fig 6 a and b show the comparisons of the predicted and experimental cumulative plastic strains it can be seen that the predicted data agree very well with the measured experimental data although several relatively large errors the maximum error is 31 exist at the low number of cyclic load applications most of the predicted values fall within the 10 error area this indicates that the proposed model has a good prediction capability for the cumulative plastic strain of soft soil especially for that under long term large number of cyclic load applications cyclic loads with a low stress level 5 discussions and applications since no simple test exists to directly determine the parameters a b and c it is essential to make an estimation based on the soil state and stress state for these purpose the relationships of these parameters with soil properties and the stress state are discussed in this part 5 1 model parameters following the above observations since the exponent parameter b only depends on the physical properties of soil regardless of the stress state we try to determine the exponent parameter b by using easily measurable parameters of the physical properties of soils the average value of parameter b was calculated under different stress conditions for a given soil and its relationship with the water content ratio w r is shown in fig 7 the water content ratio is defined as the ratio of the natural water content w to the liquid limit ll namely w r w l l for a given soil its water content ratio is a constant it can be seen from fig 4 that a linear relationship exists between parameter b and the water content ratio w r 10 b 0 584 w r 0 007 the correlation coefficient is equal to 0 87 r 0 87 and the root mean square deviation is 0 08 r m s e 0 08 for equation 10 which suggests that this correlation is very significant it is worth noting that this relationship is built upon fine grained soils whether it is applicable for coarse grained soils needs further study in addition for soft marine clay generally with high water content ratio parameter b is recommended to be a constant value of 0 5 as shown in the shadow area of fig 7 which is also highlighted by fig 3 according to previous discussions parameter c characterizes the final plastic strain of soils mainly depending on the type of soils physical properties and subjected stress fig 8 shows the influence of dynamic deviator stress σ d confining stress σ c dry density and water content on parameter c as seen in fig 8 all of these factors have a remarkable effect on parameter c thus a good formula to determine parameter c should cover these main factors and must maintain sufficient simplicity at the same time many researchers monismith et al 1975 li and selig 1996 seed et al 1955 etc suggested that the cyclic deviator stress σ d is the most dominant influencing factor on the plastic strain of soil namely on parameter c this indicates that σ d is an essential element to determine parameter c in addition the undrained static strength τ u is introduced to represent the influence of the confining pressure soil type and physical properties of soils which can be easily determined by undrained triaxial tests the cyclic stress ratio csr defined as the ratio of cyclic shear stress τ d σ d 2 to static strength τ u is introduced to determine parameter c 11 c s r σ d 2 τ c u σ d q c u where σ d is the dynamic deviatoric stress imposed in the cyclic triaxial tests and q c u 2 τ c u is the deviatoric stress at failure obtained from an undrained monotonic triaxial test the relationships of parameters a and c with csr for different soft soil are plotted and shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively in addition the parameter values in these relationships are recommended and listed in table 2 these values are determined based on back calculated results with a given constant value of parameter b 0 5 fig 9 shows that parameter c has a good power relation with csr r 2 0 8611 and can be expressed as the following equation 12 c c 1 c s r c 2 c1 and c2 are parameters equation 12 shows that when the cyclic stress ratio tends to zero c s r 0 parameter c tends to infinity c and then the final deformation tends to zero 1 c 0 this indicates that the proposed equation 12 is reasonable since it meets the physical meaning of parameter c it can be seen from table 2 for soft soils the parameter c1 ranges from 0 0293 to 0 1156 with an average value of 0 0645 while the parameter c2 ranging from 2 2073 to 4 3040 with an average value of 2 9211 fig 10 shows that the model parameter a has a strong correlation with csr r 2 0 9433 and can be expressed as an exponential function of csr 13 a a 1 e a 2 c s r the values of parameter a1 and a2 are presented in table 2 for soft soils the parameter a1 ranges from 457 to 1539 with an average value of 705 while the parameter a2 ranging from 4 43 to 8 48 with an average value of 6 42 to facilitate the use of equations 12 and 13 in practice for soft soils the average values for the parameters c1 c2 in equation 12 and a1 a2 in equation 13 are recommended when lack of experimental data 5 2 applications to elaborate the application of the proposed model in calculating settlement four steps can be followed 5 2 1 determine the cyclic stress ratio csr according to the definition of csr it can be determined by the cyclic deviatoric stress σ d and static strength τ u these two stress states can be calculated using theoretical constitutive models combined with a finite element numerical simulation for example dong et al 2010 proposed a method to determine σ d and τ u as follows see more details in dong et al 2010 14 σ d 3 j 2 1 2 σ x d σ y d 2 σ x d σ z d σ z d σ y d 6 τ x y d 2 τ c u c c u cos φ c u 1 sin φ c u σ z 1 k 0 2 sin φ c u 1 φ c u in addition σ d and τ u can also be directly determined by field tests 5 2 2 determine model parameters model parameters can be determined by dynamic triaxial tests under the stress state determined in the first step for soft marine clay or ch soils in the absence of test results parameter b is recommended to remain constant at 0 5 and the parameters a and c can be estimated with proposed equations 13 and 12 respectively 5 2 3 determine the cumulative plastic strain the cumulative plastic strain for each subdivided layer of soil can be easily determined by the proposed model 5 with known model parameters 5 2 4 determine the cumulative deformation the cumulative deformation or final settlement can be determined by summing up the deformations of all subdivided layers using the following equation 15 s i 1 n ε p i h i where h i is the thickness of each subdivided layer in situ tests were performed on a soft subgrade at the transportation technology center ttc in pueblo co to investigate soft subgrade performance under repeated heavy axle loading for detailed test program and subgrade description refer to li and selig 1996 the subgrade settlements are predicted by the proposed model 5 and the prediction results are shown in table 3 the subgrade was filled with soft soil of vicksburg buckshot clay pi 40 45 ll 60 70 and the soft subgrade consisted of 5 sublayers each 0 3 m thick the deviator stress at the center of each subdivided layer was determined by the geotrack model li 1994 li and selig 1996 and is shown in table 3 the total number of repeated load applications n is 770 000 li 1994 since the filled subgrade soil is soft clay ch the model parameter b is assumed to be 0 5 and parameters a and c are estimated by equations 13 and 12 with the recommended average values for c1 c2 a1 and a2 respectively the cumulative plastic strain ε p i of each subdivided layer was calculated with equation 5 and the final settlement of subgrade was determined with equation 15 the results of subgrade settlement predicted by this paper and by li and selig 1996 are also plotted in fig 11 with the test results the range of results predicted by both this paper and li and selig 1996 are consistent with the range of test results in addition the average settlement predicted by this paper is much closer to the average settlement obtained via test compared to that predicted by li and selig 1996 notably the recommended values for parameter b and for parameters a and c estimated by equations 13 and 12 are proposed based on back calculation results for soft clay ch which may be not applicable for other soil classifications such as ml mh and cl 5 3 limitations 1 although the physical meaning of parameters in the proposed model is clear there is no appropriate experimental method to measure these parameters directly which weakens the application of the proposed model in practice 2 the method using the cyclic stress ratio csr to estimate parameters a and c misses some other important factors such as the stress history overconsolidation ratio static deviator stress and frequency of applied cyclic loads 3 the proposed model performs well in predicting the cumulative plastic strain and final settlement for a given soft deposit however for different soft soils it still lacks enough information to determine model parameters with universal applicability it needs further experimental research 6 summary and conclusions in many practical cases the cyclic loads applied on mucky soft soil are of long term repeated applications and a low stress level even lower than the critical stress of soil which can lead to deformation but not failure regardless of the number of repeated applications these cases are very common for soft soils subjected to wave or traffic loads in the near shore and off shore areas of china however there is still no suitable model to describe deformation development over time in response to this situation a novel empirical model was proposed to predict the cumulative plastic deformation of soft marine clay subjected to long term low cyclic loads this model was based on analogy analysis of the hardin drnevich model and monismith model with three parameters comparisons were made between prediction results and available experimental results in the literature that had not been used to fit the parameters the comparison showed that the new model presents better capability and performance than the monismith model in predicting the cumulative plastic strain of soft soil especially for that under a long term large number of cyclic load applications low stress level relationships between the three parameters for the prediction model and readily measurable soil parameters as well as the stress state in the absence of test results are recommended for soft soils ch these relationships were obtained by statistical regression analysis of available test results in the literature the exponent parameter b in this prediction model was proved to only depend on the physical properties of soil regardless of the stress state and is recommended to be 0 5 for soft soils the dynamic deviator stress is the most important stress factor for the cumulative plastic strain and is taken into account by the other two parameters a and c in the prediction model meanwhile the effect of the soil physical state moisture content dry density porosity etc captured by the soil static strength is also reflected by these two parameters both of them can be expressed as a function of the cyclic stress ratio csr applications of the proposed model were elaborated in detail and in situ test results for settlement of soft subgrade were used to evaluate the performance of this model the prediction results are consistent with the test results the model presented in this paper mainly considered the influence of the dynamic deviator stress the number of cyclic load applications the soil physical state and other factors probably indirectly captured by the static strength through the cyclic stress ratio however the frequency of the applied cyclic load and static deviator stress which probably has an important impact on the cumulative plastic strain is not considered in this paper in addition although the proposed model has been verified and validated with test results it still needs further study to improve the model parameters for expansive applicability acknowledgments the project is supported by the national natural science

23664,long term cyclic loads with a stress level lower than the critical cyclic stress applied on soft soil can lead to soil deformation but not to failure the monismith model is known for its simplicity and capacity to describe the cumulative plastic strain of soil under cyclic loads however it is unsuccessfully applied in these cases because the plastic strain in this model would increase endlessly till to failure with increasing number of load cycles to solve this problem a novel empirical model with three parameters is proposed based on analogy analysis of the hardin drnevich model and monismith model the proposed model is verified by experimental data from existing literature and is shown to have better capability and performance than the monismith model in predicting the cumulative plastic strain of soft soil subjected to long term low cyclic loads the value of parameter b is recommended to be 0 5 and relationships of parameters a and c with the cyclic stress ratio are also proposed for soft clay applications of the proposed model are elaborated in detail and in situ test results for settlement of soft subgrade are used to evaluate the performance of this model the prediction results are consistent with the test results the research results present a promising method for investigating the development of deformation and the settlement of soft foundation in the near shore and off shore areas caused by wave and or traffic loads keywords empirical model cumulative plastic strain long term low cyclic loads soft soil 1 introduction soft marine clay has a high void ratio a high water content low permeability high compressibility and high sensitivity and is susceptible to outside disturbances it is also widely distributed in the east coast area of china in this marine environment the foundation design of offshore installations suction anchors wind turbines gravity platforms etc or near shore structures seawalls harbors dockyards lighthouse etc is governed by the bearing capacity and the serviceability under cyclic loads andersen 2009 hu and ding 2010 wichtmann et al 2013 these cyclic loads are caused by waves vehicle traffic and the operation of machinery resulting in a reduction of strength rao and panda 1999 moses and rao 2003 li et al 2011 and bearing capacity wichtmann et al 2013 tang et al 2011 unexpected settlement ren et al 2012 see ng et al 2013 for an example of settlement lei et al 2016 and other geotechnical engineering problems mayoral et al 2016 a model for cumulative deformation is a theoretical basis for solving the problems of dynamic stability and settlement of subgrade under long term cyclic loads at present the cumulative plastic deformation models under cyclic loading are mainly classified into two categories theoretical models and empirical models in the scientific literature theoretical models mainly include the modified cambridge model carter et al 1982 nested yield surface model mroz 1967 prevost 1977 1978 bounding surface model dafalias 1986a 1986b hu and liu 2015 etc these theoretical models are capable of calculating the plastic strain generated by each cyclic load generally being high in accuracy but complex in calculation however to meet the accuracy requirements most of these models need to adopt sufficiently small calculation steps to simulate the process of each cycle of loading and unloading this often leads to model failure due to excessive calculation especially for a large number of cyclic loads empirical models are usually established by using the results of laboratory tests and field tests which avoids excessive calculation as they meet the requirements of engineering practice empirical models have been widely used in practical engineering despite being less accurate than theoretical models a number of empirical models have been developed for predicting cumulative plastic deformation in soil under cyclic loading however the most commonly used is the following power model monismith et al 1975 1 ε p a n b where ε p is the cumulative plastic strain n is the number of cyclic load applications and a and b are two parameters that depend on the soil type soil properties and stress state afterward many researchers improved the power model 1 li and selig 1996 took into account the influence of the cyclic deviator stress σ d and soil statistic strength σ s on coefficient a in 1 as follows 2a a a σ d σ s m 2b ε p a σ d σ s m n b where a and m are material parameters m has a range of 1 0 4 2 and a has a range of 0 3 3 5 for 22 soils studied chai and miura 2002 considered the effect of the initial deviator stress σ i d on the cumulative plastic strain and proposed the following equation 3 ε p a σ d σ s m 1 σ i d σ s n n b where n is a constant coefficient with a recommended value of 1 0 various similar models have been developed parr 1972 moses et al 2003 abdelkrim et al 2003 huang et al 2006 shahin et al 2011 wang et al 2013 guo et al 2013 wang and li 2015 etc for different engineering backgrounds and practical applications in general these empirical models represent a relationship between the cumulative plastic strain and the number of repeated load applications some models also considered stresses the strain rate the soil type and soil properties the aim of this paper is to develop a novel empirical model for cumulative plastic deformation of soft marine clay subjected to cyclic loads characterized by a large number of repeated load applications and low stress this will provide an opportunity to discuss the settlement and strength decrease of foundation soils in the near shore and off shore areas under wave or traffic loads and to provide a broad even if not complete overview of deformation characteristics and their controlling factors as well as the relationship with time in the following we discuss the major influencing factors on cumulative deformation in terms of the stress state soil type and soil properties in section 2 section 3 presents a cumulative plastic deformation model and the proposed model will be verified and evaluated by test results in section 4 relationships between three model parameters the physical soil state and the stress state applications of the proposed model and model limitations are discussed in section 5 summaries and main conclusions are drawn in the last part of the paper 2 influencing factors a good prediction model for cumulative plastic deformation should take into account the major influencing factors the list of the most frequently quoted factors includes the physical properties of soil water content atterberg limits specific gravity particle size specific surface area etc stress state dynamic stress confining pressure over consolidation ratio loading frequency etc drainage conditions and stress path loading waveform loading method test control mode the rotation of principal stress axis etc li and selig 1996 huang et al 2006 ren et al 2012 cai et al 2013 sun et al 2015 gu et al 2016 elia and rouainia 2016 hicher 2016 among these factors for a given soil the most dominant influencing factor of cumulative plastic deformation is the cyclic deviator stress σ d which was recognized through laboratory test results conducted by many researchers such as seed et al 1955 monismith et al 1975 li and selig 1996 huang et al 2006 shahin et al 2011 etc the second important factor is the confining pressure these two factors mainly determine the development model of strain and the dissipation of excess pore water the existence of a critical cyclic stress or threshold stress has long been recognized by many researchers e g larew and leonards 1962 mitchell and king 1977 sangrey et al 1978 lefebvre et al 1989 tang et al 2003 shahin et al 2011 and the critical cyclic stress for several different soft soils is summarized in table 1 the critical cyclic stress is defined as the stress below which the soil will not suffer failure regardless of the number of repeated load applications and above which soil deformation will continually increase up to failure in other words when the applied cyclic stress is lower than the critical stress the cumulative plastic deformation of soil will not continually increase with an increase in the number of repeated load applications but tend to a stable limited value based on the critical cyclic stress level cai and cao 1996 classified the development of the permanent deformation into three types attenuation type critical type and destructive type and suggested applying different models for the different deformation types in many practical cases the cyclic loads applied on the mucky soft soil consist of long term repeated applications and a low stress level which is often lower than the critical stress of the soil therefore the plastic accumulative deformation induced by these loads will gradually increase at the beginning but the deformation rate gradually decreases after a certain time the cumulative plastic deformation reaches the maximum and tends to be stable no longer increasing over time however monismith s model the most widely used empirical model is not capable of predicting the deformation caused by the stress that is below the critical cyclic stress because the plastic strain it describes will increase endlessly with increasing number of cyclic loading applications 3 cumulative plastic deformation model fig 1 a shows the skeleton curve of stress strain relationship of soils subjected to cyclic loading which was described as a hyperbolic equation by hardin and drnevich 1972 i e the well known classical hardin drnevich model eq 4 4 σ d ε d a b ε d where a and b are model parameters fig 1 b shows the typical curve of cumulative deformation of soft soils under long term low cyclic stress it can be seen from fig 1 that the two curves look very similar it was therefore concluded that a function similar to that of equation 4 might be applicable to the cumulative plastic strain of soft soils under cyclic load conditions combining the monismith model eq 1 and hardin drnevich model a new model is proposed as equation 5 for the cumulative plastic deformation caused by cyclic stress with long term application and a low stress level especially for the stress lower than the critical stress of soil 5 ε p n b a c n b where a b and c are parameters that depend on the stress path stress state and physical properties of soil the impact of parameters a b and c on the cumulative plastic strain is shown in fig 2 b a and c respectively fig 2 a shows that for given values of parameters a and c the slope of the curve increases with increasing exponent parameter b while the initial and final strain remains the same regardless of b fig 2 b shows that the slope will remain stable and the curve will parallelly move toward the left or right if parameter b is given a certain value this observation suggests that the exponent parameter b characterizes the rate of accumulative plastic strain and does not affect the final amount of deformation of soil following this observation it might be reasonable to conclude that parameter b depends on the physical properties of the soil itself such as the water content void ratio particle size and particle specific surface area monismith et al 1975 suggested that the rate of cumulative plastic strain is unrelated to the dynamic stress level namely dynamic stress does not affect exponent parameter b in addition li and selig 1996 obtained similar conclusions and suggested that for a given soil parameter b should be a constant to examine whether parameter b in the proposed model also has a similar feature we complied experimental data from previous research to discuss the relationships between parameter b and the dynamic deviator stress σ d and loading stress ratio η which is expressed as η σ d 2 p where p σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 it can be seen from fig 3 a and b that parameter b seems to have no clear relationship with σ d and η which indicates that the exponent parameter b only depends on the soil type and soil properties and is unrelated to the subjected loads it should be a constant for a given soil this observation is consistent with previous studies see the references of monismith et al 1975 li and selig 1996 furthermore most values of parameter b are within a narrow range of 0 18 0 82 with a mean value of approximately 0 5 fig 2 b shows the influence of parameter a on the cumulative plastic strain for given parameters b and c the strain curve moves toward the right with parameter a increasing namely the time or number of repeated load applications required for the final deformation to become stable increases with an increase in parameter a meanwhile the final deformation and strain rate remain constant in addition after the first cyclic load application n 1 the caused strain 1 a c will increase with parameter a decreasing for a given parameter c therefore parameter a characterizes the degree of difficulty of the soil beginning to deform and the initial strain during the first cyclic load application to make parameter a much clearer the frequency of cyclic load f and application time t are introduced to replace the number of cyclic load applications n by the relation n t f thus equation 6 could be rewritten as 6 ε p t f b a c t f b for a given parameter b 1 both sides of equation 6 are divided by the time t then yielding 7 ε p ε p t f a c t f when time t 0 the strain rate becomes 8 ε p f a equation 8 further indicates that parameter a controls the initial strain of soil that is the degree of difficulty of the soil beginning to deform in addition since the first cyclic loading application will cause more or less deformation the caused strain 1 a c is always greater than zero namely a c 0 to explore the physical meaning of parameter c the bounds of equation 6 are discussed when the number of cyclic load applications n approaches infinity namely n the final cumulative plastic strain is 9 ε p f 1 c equation 9 indicates that the final strain is only dependent on parameter c regardless of the parameters a and b which could also be seen from fig 2 c for given parameters a and b the final strain increases with parameter c decreasing meanwhile both the initial strain stain at n 1 and the time to reach the final strain are the same for different c thus the factors that affect the final deformation e g physical properties of soils and cyclic deviator stress will also control parameter c since this paper s focus is on the case in which the applied stress is less than the critical cyclic stress the caused final strain should not exceed the critical strain of soils ε p c that is c 1 ε p c many researchers have investigated the critical strain of different types of soft soil under various cyclic stress and suggested a range of 1 0 ε p c 12 as shown in table 1 consequently the range of values for parameter c can be estimated as c 0 08 and parameter a c 0 08 in summary we proposed a new model with three parameters a b and c which denote the initial strain strain at n 1 strain rate and final cumulative strain respectively unfortunately although the physical meaning of every parameter is clear there is no appropriate experimental method to measure the parameters directly which weakens the application of the proposed model in practice therefore it is important to build links between the parameters and other easily measurable parameters such as the liquid limit undrained static strength confining pressure and cyclic deviator stress these links will be thoroughly analyzed in the following section 4 verification and validation to verify and validate the proposed model some available laboratory test results from the existing literature are compared with their corresponding predicted results a series of experimental data of cumulative plastic deformation under cyclic loads from the existing literature are compiled to examine the performance of the proposed model eq 5 and monismith model eq 1 the data involved four different soft clay type soils and were obtained via cyclic triaxial tests whose applied cyclic loads had a large number of cyclic load applications and a lower stress than critical stress level the least square method was used to obtain the parameters in equations 1 and 5 by fitting the data set of cumulative plastic strain ε p and number of cyclic load applications n using the fitted parameters the cumulative plastic strain was computed via the proposed model and monismith model and we made a comparison with the test results shown in fig 4 taking fig 4 a as an example the comparisons of the predicted and experimental cumulative plastic strain for remolded kaolinite clay are shown the test results were obtained by shahin et al 2011 the soil physical states specific gravity g s 2 65 liquid limit w l 53 plastic limit w p 26 stress state effective confining pressure σ 3 2 65 cyclic stress ratio csr 0 63 loading frequency f 1 0 hz were taken into account in the tests and the applied dynamic deviator stress was lower than the critical stress level specific details for the test procedures and other information of the soil and stress are available in the literature of shahin et al 2011 the predicted results of the monismith model and the proposed model in this paper are shown by the red dotted line and blue solid line respectively as illustrated the proposed model successfully reproduced the experimental data and produced a much lower root mean square error than the classical monismith model especially at the larger number of cyclic load applications the same conclusion can also be drawn from the other three figures the results indicate that the proposed model performs better in describing the cumulative plastic strain caused by long term low cyclic stress and is more suitable than the monismith model for describing the final deformation of soft clay when the applied cyclic deviator stress is below the critical stress level of soil wang et al 2013 carried out a series of triaxial tests with a large number of load applications on soft marine clay under various stress levels and different confining pressures of 50 kpa 100 kpa and 200 kpa for the test procedures and physical properties of the soils refer to this literature these test results are used to further validate the applicability of the proposed model we assume that the exponent parameter b in equation 5 is a constant of 0 5 according to fig 3 and the other two parameters a and c are fitted by the least square method using the test results for the confining pressures of 100 kpa and 200 kpa the fitted results are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that both parameters a and c have a strong correlation with the cyclic stress ratio csr and their relationship expressions are also obtained for this soil then using best fit parameters the cumulative plastic strain of soils for different cyclic stress ratios is predicted with the proposed equation 5 comparisons are made between the predicted values and measured values for the confining pressure of 50 kpa which was not used to fit the parameters fig 6 a and b show the comparisons of the predicted and experimental cumulative plastic strains it can be seen that the predicted data agree very well with the measured experimental data although several relatively large errors the maximum error is 31 exist at the low number of cyclic load applications most of the predicted values fall within the 10 error area this indicates that the proposed model has a good prediction capability for the cumulative plastic strain of soft soil especially for that under long term large number of cyclic load applications cyclic loads with a low stress level 5 discussions and applications since no simple test exists to directly determine the parameters a b and c it is essential to make an estimation based on the soil state and stress state for these purpose the relationships of these parameters with soil properties and the stress state are discussed in this part 5 1 model parameters following the above observations since the exponent parameter b only depends on the physical properties of soil regardless of the stress state we try to determine the exponent parameter b by using easily measurable parameters of the physical properties of soils the average value of parameter b was calculated under different stress conditions for a given soil and its relationship with the water content ratio w r is shown in fig 7 the water content ratio is defined as the ratio of the natural water content w to the liquid limit ll namely w r w l l for a given soil its water content ratio is a constant it can be seen from fig 4 that a linear relationship exists between parameter b and the water content ratio w r 10 b 0 584 w r 0 007 the correlation coefficient is equal to 0 87 r 0 87 and the root mean square deviation is 0 08 r m s e 0 08 for equation 10 which suggests that this correlation is very significant it is worth noting that this relationship is built upon fine grained soils whether it is applicable for coarse grained soils needs further study in addition for soft marine clay generally with high water content ratio parameter b is recommended to be a constant value of 0 5 as shown in the shadow area of fig 7 which is also highlighted by fig 3 according to previous discussions parameter c characterizes the final plastic strain of soils mainly depending on the type of soils physical properties and subjected stress fig 8 shows the influence of dynamic deviator stress σ d confining stress σ c dry density and water content on parameter c as seen in fig 8 all of these factors have a remarkable effect on parameter c thus a good formula to determine parameter c should cover these main factors and must maintain sufficient simplicity at the same time many researchers monismith et al 1975 li and selig 1996 seed et al 1955 etc suggested that the cyclic deviator stress σ d is the most dominant influencing factor on the plastic strain of soil namely on parameter c this indicates that σ d is an essential element to determine parameter c in addition the undrained static strength τ u is introduced to represent the influence of the confining pressure soil type and physical properties of soils which can be easily determined by undrained triaxial tests the cyclic stress ratio csr defined as the ratio of cyclic shear stress τ d σ d 2 to static strength τ u is introduced to determine parameter c 11 c s r σ d 2 τ c u σ d q c u where σ d is the dynamic deviatoric stress imposed in the cyclic triaxial tests and q c u 2 τ c u is the deviatoric stress at failure obtained from an undrained monotonic triaxial test the relationships of parameters a and c with csr for different soft soil are plotted and shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively in addition the parameter values in these relationships are recommended and listed in table 2 these values are determined based on back calculated results with a given constant value of parameter b 0 5 fig 9 shows that parameter c has a good power relation with csr r 2 0 8611 and can be expressed as the following equation 12 c c 1 c s r c 2 c1 and c2 are parameters equation 12 shows that when the cyclic stress ratio tends to zero c s r 0 parameter c tends to infinity c and then the final deformation tends to zero 1 c 0 this indicates that the proposed equation 12 is reasonable since it meets the physical meaning of parameter c it can be seen from table 2 for soft soils the parameter c1 ranges from 0 0293 to 0 1156 with an average value of 0 0645 while the parameter c2 ranging from 2 2073 to 4 3040 with an average value of 2 9211 fig 10 shows that the model parameter a has a strong correlation with csr r 2 0 9433 and can be expressed as an exponential function of csr 13 a a 1 e a 2 c s r the values of parameter a1 and a2 are presented in table 2 for soft soils the parameter a1 ranges from 457 to 1539 with an average value of 705 while the parameter a2 ranging from 4 43 to 8 48 with an average value of 6 42 to facilitate the use of equations 12 and 13 in practice for soft soils the average values for the parameters c1 c2 in equation 12 and a1 a2 in equation 13 are recommended when lack of experimental data 5 2 applications to elaborate the application of the proposed model in calculating settlement four steps can be followed 5 2 1 determine the cyclic stress ratio csr according to the definition of csr it can be determined by the cyclic deviatoric stress σ d and static strength τ u these two stress states can be calculated using theoretical constitutive models combined with a finite element numerical simulation for example dong et al 2010 proposed a method to determine σ d and τ u as follows see more details in dong et al 2010 14 σ d 3 j 2 1 2 σ x d σ y d 2 σ x d σ z d σ z d σ y d 6 τ x y d 2 τ c u c c u cos φ c u 1 sin φ c u σ z 1 k 0 2 sin φ c u 1 φ c u in addition σ d and τ u can also be directly determined by field tests 5 2 2 determine model parameters model parameters can be determined by dynamic triaxial tests under the stress state determined in the first step for soft marine clay or ch soils in the absence of test results parameter b is recommended to remain constant at 0 5 and the parameters a and c can be estimated with proposed equations 13 and 12 respectively 5 2 3 determine the cumulative plastic strain the cumulative plastic strain for each subdivided layer of soil can be easily determined by the proposed model 5 with known model parameters 5 2 4 determine the cumulative deformation the cumulative deformation or final settlement can be determined by summing up the deformations of all subdivided layers using the following equation 15 s i 1 n ε p i h i where h i is the thickness of each subdivided layer in situ tests were performed on a soft subgrade at the transportation technology center ttc in pueblo co to investigate soft subgrade performance under repeated heavy axle loading for detailed test program and subgrade description refer to li and selig 1996 the subgrade settlements are predicted by the proposed model 5 and the prediction results are shown in table 3 the subgrade was filled with soft soil of vicksburg buckshot clay pi 40 45 ll 60 70 and the soft subgrade consisted of 5 sublayers each 0 3 m thick the deviator stress at the center of each subdivided layer was determined by the geotrack model li 1994 li and selig 1996 and is shown in table 3 the total number of repeated load applications n is 770 000 li 1994 since the filled subgrade soil is soft clay ch the model parameter b is assumed to be 0 5 and parameters a and c are estimated by equations 13 and 12 with the recommended average values for c1 c2 a1 and a2 respectively the cumulative plastic strain ε p i of each subdivided layer was calculated with equation 5 and the final settlement of subgrade was determined with equation 15 the results of subgrade settlement predicted by this paper and by li and selig 1996 are also plotted in fig 11 with the test results the range of results predicted by both this paper and li and selig 1996 are consistent with the range of test results in addition the average settlement predicted by this paper is much closer to the average settlement obtained via test compared to that predicted by li and selig 1996 notably the recommended values for parameter b and for parameters a and c estimated by equations 13 and 12 are proposed based on back calculation results for soft clay ch which may be not applicable for other soil classifications such as ml mh and cl 5 3 limitations 1 although the physical meaning of parameters in the proposed model is clear there is no appropriate experimental method to measure these parameters directly which weakens the application of the proposed model in practice 2 the method using the cyclic stress ratio csr to estimate parameters a and c misses some other important factors such as the stress history overconsolidation ratio static deviator stress and frequency of applied cyclic loads 3 the proposed model performs well in predicting the cumulative plastic strain and final settlement for a given soft deposit however for different soft soils it still lacks enough information to determine model parameters with universal applicability it needs further experimental research 6 summary and conclusions in many practical cases the cyclic loads applied on mucky soft soil are of long term repeated applications and a low stress level even lower than the critical stress of soil which can lead to deformation but not failure regardless of the number of repeated applications these cases are very common for soft soils subjected to wave or traffic loads in the near shore and off shore areas of china however there is still no suitable model to describe deformation development over time in response to this situation a novel empirical model was proposed to predict the cumulative plastic deformation of soft marine clay subjected to long term low cyclic loads this model was based on analogy analysis of the hardin drnevich model and monismith model with three parameters comparisons were made between prediction results and available experimental results in the literature that had not been used to fit the parameters the comparison showed that the new model presents better capability and performance than the monismith model in predicting the cumulative plastic strain of soft soil especially for that under a long term large number of cyclic load applications low stress level relationships between the three parameters for the prediction model and readily measurable soil parameters as well as the stress state in the absence of test results are recommended for soft soils ch these relationships were obtained by statistical regression analysis of available test results in the literature the exponent parameter b in this prediction model was proved to only depend on the physical properties of soil regardless of the stress state and is recommended to be 0 5 for soft soils the dynamic deviator stress is the most important stress factor for the cumulative plastic strain and is taken into account by the other two parameters a and c in the prediction model meanwhile the effect of the soil physical state moisture content dry density porosity etc captured by the soil static strength is also reflected by these two parameters both of them can be expressed as a function of the cyclic stress ratio csr applications of the proposed model were elaborated in detail and in situ test results for settlement of soft subgrade were used to evaluate the performance of this model the prediction results are consistent with the test results the model presented in this paper mainly considered the influence of the dynamic deviator stress the number of cyclic load applications the soil physical state and other factors probably indirectly captured by the static strength through the cyclic stress ratio however the frequency of the applied cyclic load and static deviator stress which probably has an important impact on the cumulative plastic strain is not considered in this paper in addition although the proposed model has been verified and validated with test results it still needs further study to improve the model parameters for expansive applicability acknowledgments the project is supported by the national natural science
