4985,tunnel excavation in karst areas could affect natural karst hydrological processes and runoff resulting in groundwater drainage and even underground river cut off the hydrological model is a good tool with which to study the hydrological effect of tunnels the application of current hydrological models in karst areas usually requires a large amount of modelling data especially hydrogeological data that are much more difficult to obtain than those in non karst areas to overcome the difficulty of modelling in karst areas this study presents a new fully physically based distributed karst tunnel hydrological model kthm with a simple structure and simple parameters the underground confluence module is divided into only two layers confluence in the epikarst zone and the underground river such a simple structure makes it possible to build a model in karst basins with only a small amount of hydrogeological data in the structure of this kthm the tunnel is incorporated in a specially designed submodule to quantify the influence of the tunnel hydrological effect on the water volume if the tunnel submodule is turned off then this model becomes a karst hydrological model khm and can be used in other karst basins without tunnels the simulation results of 20 flow processes and 2 annual runoffs modelled by the khm and kthm are compared the kthm is more accurate in the study area which indicates that the tunnel submodule in the model is necessary and that the kthm is feasible for performing runoff simulations in the study area the sensitivity sequence of hydrological effects of tunnels on runoff in karst areas is as follows dry season runoff volume normal runoff volume interannual runoff volume flood peak flow flood volume keywords karst tunnel hydrological model kthm hydrological effects of tunnel excavation tunnel submodule runoff simulations southwest china 1 introduction tunnel excavation in karst areas will affect the local karst water system which is mainly reflected in changes in the groundwater flow field the water cycle processes rules and ultimately the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of karst water resources yuan 2002 hartmann et al 2014 because the hydrogeological conditions in karst areas are more complicated and changeable than those in non karst areas tunnel excavation in karst areas is more likely to affect more fragile and sensitive karst water systems thereby leading to interruptions of the natural hydrological cycle or problems in the ecological environment such as surface water leakage karst water inrush groundwater drainage and karst collapse iacobellis et al 2015 vigna et al 2017 tunnels are densely distributed in the zhongliangshan karst valley basin in chongqing china the study area of this paper there are three tunnels within a range of only 12 km2 with an average spacing of approximately 2 km several more tunnels are planned to be built this phenomenon of densely packed tunnels is common in mountain cities such as chongqing in the study area according to a previous basin survey these tunnels have had serious impacts on the local karst water system and ecological environment lv et al 2020 the underground river in the study area previously flowed regularly but is now occasionally cut off under the influence of the tunnels and a large area of former paddy fields has become dry land there were fifteen epikarst springs in the basin before 2000 which are the main source of water supply for local residents livelihood and irrigation needs however only one spring with low discharge was found in 2017 liu et al 2019 and it is now often cut off during the dry season therefore studying the hydrological effects of tunnel excavation in the study area is necessary in this study we focus on the impact of tunnel engineering on the runoff process and water quantity at natural underground river outlets in the study area where there are no surface rivers and an underground river within the basin is the only confluence of drainage after a tunnel was built it drained some of the water that should have flowed from the underground river the water volume at the underground river outlet should be reduced however the expected level of reduction was not clear although a gauging station has been set up at the underground river outlet it was installed after completion of a tunnel and the changes in underground runoff before and after tunnel construction cannot be compared therefore it is necessary to establish a mathematical physical model to quantitatively compare the impact of tunnel engineering on natural runoff in karst areas and hydrological models can represent good tools for such investigations goldscheider and drew 2007 li et al 2019a 2019b recent research on the hydrological modelling in karst basins with tunnels has focused on mainly the prediction of tunnel water inrush linbin et al 2010 wang et al 2019 neukomm et al 2020 for which modflow for example is widely used reimann et al 2009 gallegos et al 2013 simulations of underground water flow regimes or seepage fields under the influence of tunnels raposo et al 2010 chen et al 2020 engineering geological hazards caused by tunnel construction such as karst collapse zini et al 2015 lv et al 2020 and the environmental impacts of tunnelling in karst regions milanovic 2002 bonacci 2014 parise et al 2015 liu et al 2019 in addition some classic hydrological models such as the she model abbott et al 986a abbott et al 1986b swat model peterson and hamlett 1998 and topmodel ambroise et al 1996 are often used in hydrological simulations and predictions in karst areas doummar et al 2012 li et al 2012 ren 2016 baffaut and benson 2009 suo et al 2007 pan 2014 although the above simulations and predictions by hydrological models have achieved good research results in karst basins with tunnels the cost of modelling in karst areas is relatively high on the one hand the intricate underlying surface conditions and hydrogeological characteristics in karst areas pose great challenges for accurately simulating hydrological effects of tunnels fiorillo et al 2015 xu et al 2020 in particular the anisotropic interactions of karst aquifers make it difficult to accurately describe the movement and transformation of rainfall infiltration water in karst water bearing media milanovic 2002 bartolomé et al 2006 on the other hand hydrological models especially distributed hydrological models freeze and harlan 1969 usually have multiple and complex structures with many parameters chen 2009 2018 hartmann et al 2015 so more data especially a large amount of hydrogeological data are needed to build the model in addition obtaining these data is much more difficult in karst areas than in non karst areas ford and williams 2007 vincenzi et al 2009 for example borehole pumping tests are needed to determine the influence of tunnel construction on karst groundwater dynamics birk et al 2005 schiller and renard 2016 to address the difficulty of insufficient data for distributed models used in karst areas in this study a new fully distributed karst tunnel hydrological model kthm is developed to simulate hydrological effects of tunnels in detail unlike other distributed hydrological models used in karst basins which often require a considerable amount of data to build the model due to their complex structural features kraller et al 2014 hartmann et al 2015 this new kthm has particular advantages when used in karst areas the model structure is relatively simple and its overall structure is divided into only two parts the surface and the underground parts the main function of the former is to converge surface rivers into the underground river system while the latter corresponds to the confluent output of the karst underground river in the basin therefore this kthm is an integration of a surface hydrological model and groundwater flow model in terms of its mechanism the underground confluence module of the vertical structure is also divided into two layers and the physical significance of each layer is explicit and simple which makes it possible to build models that represent karst areas with only limited meteorological and hydrogeological data in addition the model is calibrated and validated against field hydrogeological data that can be easily obtained by for example tracer experiments the model parameters are classified and dimensionless and only the moderate and high sensitivity parameters need to be optimized which saves calculation time this new kthm has great potential for application in karst areas due to these advantages in the model structure of the kthm a tunnel submodule is designed as an independent structure for detailed simulations of the response of hydrological processes to tunnels in the study area in the tunnel submodule considering that the shape of the tunnel is usually regular the water movement in the tunnel basically conforms to darcy s law and parameters such as the distribution shape and size of the tunnel are easy to obtain thus this study refers to the algorithm of modflow cfpm1 gallegos et al 2013 for tunnel drainage simulations in addition to describe runoff generation and confluence in anisotropic water bearing karst media karst aquifers need to be discretized effectively this discrete method in the kthm is revised from the modlow cfpm1 module qin and jiang 2014 when the tunnel submodule is turned off the model becomes a karst hydrological model khm the simulated water quantity difference between the khm and the kthm can reflect the influence of tunnels on the flow processes and runoff quantity in the study area and 20 flow processes and 2 annual runoffs of the underground river outlet are selected to verify the performance of the kthm in karst simulations 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the zhongliangshan karst basin in chongqing a highly developed karst area in southwest china is selected as the study area it is located at 106 23 e 106 28 e 29 41 n 29 48 n the basin area is approximately 12 km2 and karst trough valley is the main landform the average annual temperature is 18 3 c and the subtropical monsoon climate brings abundant rainfall to the basin the average annual precipitation is 1100 mm liu et al 2019 which is mainly concentrated in the flood season from april to october the terrain of the basin consists of three low mountains with two karst trough valleys and the elevations of the mountains range from 200 to 700 m the main exposed strata form the guanyinxia anticline where the core of the anticline is a karst aquifer composed of limestone and the strata are the lower triassic feixianguan formation t1f the formations on both sides of the anticline core are the middle series of the leikoupo formation t2l and the lower series of the jialing river formation t1j the formation at the two sides of the basin is the upper triassic xujiahe formation t3xj and lower jurassic pearl chong formation j1z where the lithologies are feldspar quartz sandstone shale and mudstone wu et al 2018 fig 1 shows the zhongliangshan karst basin map there are currently three tunnels in the study area and their basic information is shown in table 1 2 2 data preparation the basic data for building the distributed hydrological model are mainly digital elevation model dem data soil type data and land use data among them the high resolution dem data are the key to dividing the karst subwatershed the original dem data soil type data and land use data can be freely downloaded from databases at official websites site links are provided later in this article the spatial resolution of the dem is 30 m 30 m while the resolutions for the soil type and land use data are 1000 m 1000 m these are low resolutions for such a small study area 12 km2 according to the research results of the correlation between the area of the karst watershed and the spatial resolution of the distributed model chen et al 2017 the spatial resolutions of the dem soil type and land use data are resampled at 15 m 15 m for the kthm using arcgis 10 2 software rainfall is the main recharge source of karst underground water in the basin and the outlet discharge of the underground river responds quickly to rainfall for which the response time of the peak discharge is 6 8 h the tracer experiment results in the study area show that the boundary between the surface watershed and the subsurface river confluence is basically consistent and that water supply replenishment does not occur from adjacent watersheds a direct hydraulic connection is observed between tunnel drainage and the underground river the karst morphology of the underground river is extremely developed which is manifested as a large single karst conduit without obvious water system branches there may be subterranean pools or lakes along the underground rivers they are embodied in the kthm as underground reservoir cells and their storage capacity can be estimated based on tracer recovery and retention time then the number of reservoir cells can be deduced by setting their water storage in the model the land use types in the study area are mainly cultivated land forest and grassland barren karst waste land and residential land there are three soil types zonal yellow soil unsaturated cambisol and chromic luvisol which account for 53 38 5 and 8 5 of the basin area respectively liu et al 2019 in this study area 20 flows and 2 annual runoffs of the underground river outlet are selected to verify the performance of the kthm in karst simulations to describe the hydrological effects of tunnelling on the karst hydrological processes within a year in detail the 20 flow processes are divided into flood runoff dry season runoff and normal runoff flood runoff refers to a peak discharge greater than 500 l s 1 and total flood greater than 160 000 l dry season runoff refers to a peak discharge less than 200 l s 1 and total flood less than 80 000 l and normal runoff corresponds to conditions between these limits 3 development and validation of the kthm 3 1 model development in this study a new distributed kthm is developed to simulate the hydrological effects of tunnels in detail the structure of the kthm is explicit and has physical significance the vertical structure is divided into two parts the surface and the underground parts the surface part controls the recharge from surface rivers to the underground river system and the underground part corresponds to the confluent output of the karst underground river the runoff generation and confluence modes change in different karst landforms thus in the kthm the rainfall runoff is calculated by the excess infiltration runoff in exposed karst landform units and by the runoff yield under saturated storage in buried karst landforms in the vertical model structure five layers are created vegetation cover soil layer rock strata of the epikarst zone bedrock and the underground river system from top to bottom the underground confluence module in the model is divided into only two layers the epikarst zone and the underground river such a simple model structure makes it possible to build a model in karst areas with only a small amount of hydrogeological data the horizontal structure includes river cells hill slope cells and reservoir cells fig 2 shows the modelling and calculation flow chart of the kthm 3 1 1 tunnel submodule the tunnel submodule is an independent structure in the kthm and is used to simulate the decrease in water volume at the underground river outlet under the influence of the tunnel in the study area in the tunnel submodule some simplification is needed to calculate the rainfall runoff and confluence processes within the tunnels which can be generalized into many large multisection circular pipelines due to their shape and structural characteristics considering that tunnel engineering in karst areas is usually performed in the unsaturated zone water movement in regularly shaped pipelines basically conforms to darcy s law when the water surface in the pipe rises or falls the change in flow into the unfilled pipelines can be calculated based on the modflow cfpm1 module by the following formula valiantzas 2008 qin and jiang 2014 1 q δ t v t 1 v t 0 δ t v t θ t sin θ t d 2 δ l τ 8 where 2 θ 2 sin 1 2 d d d d where q δ t is the flow difference between the inflow and outflow rates per unit area in the unfilled pipes l s 1 v t 1 v t 0 is the

diameter dm δ l is the length of the pipeline dm and τ is the pipe tortuosity in the tunnel submodule of the kthm water is exchanged between each pipe node and the adjacent fissure grid node which can be determined by the following equation meseguer and mellibovsky 2007 3 q ex jp 1 np k w ijk π d jp 1 2 δ l jp τ jp r jp h n h ijk where q ex is the water exchange in the tunnel submodule l s 1 h ijk

pipeline respectively dm δ l jp is the length between the jth and pth pipelines dm and τ jp is the pipe tortuosity 3 1 2 rainfall interpolation and evapotranspiration calculation a limited number of rain gauges in the basin can collect point data for rain falling to the surface but the model calculation needs rainfall data over the whole basin therefore the observed rainfall point data is converted into basin areal rainfall by spatial interpolation in this study the inverse distance weighted interpolation method chen 2009 2018 is used to calculate the spatial interpolation of rainfall in the river basin 4 z i 1 n 1 d i p z i i 1 n 1 d i p where z is the property value of the estimated point n is the number of points in the domain 1 di p is the weight value of the ith point on the estimated point d i is the distance dm and p is the power of distance where the larger the value of p is the faster the weight decays with distance the power exponent p can be optimized based on the principle of minimum root mean square error rainfall and soil moisture before flood events are the key factors affecting evapotranspiration in the basin the vegetation evaporation is calculated as follows 5 e i v i i t δ t v i i t p s max r l ai f where ei is the vegetation evaporation mm v i i t δ t v i i t is the variation in rainfall interception in the vegetation canopy mm p is the rain falling on the leaves mm smax is the maximum interception of vegetation r is the vegetation interception coefficient l ai is the leaf area index and f is the canopy coverage watershed soil evapotranspiration and phreatic water evaporation are calculated by the following equation chen 2018 6 e s λ e p i f s s c e s λ e p s f c i f s s c e g i 1 m a γ γ γ b γ 1 e a b λ e p 1 b d m b i where 7 a β d m d o b i d max m es is the current actual soil evapotranspiration mm λ is the evaporation coefficient which can reflect the vegetational form and λ 1 c where c is the runoff coefficient

the saturated water content eg is the phreatic water evaporation mm m is the number of calculation cells γ and β are the shape and scale parameters of the gamma function respectively do is the initial groundwater burial depth dm dm is the average groundwater burial depth dm dmax is the maximum groundwater burial depth dm γ γ is the gamma function a and b are the intermediate variables for calculation 3 1 3 rainfall runoff and confluence calculation the horizontal structure of the kthm includes river cells hill slope cells and reservoir cells a hill slope cell in this study refers to an exposed karst slope landform cell where runoff can be generated directly when the rainfall intensity is greater than the soil infiltration capacity runoff can be determined by subtracting subsoil seepage from net rainfall on the hill slope cells net rainfall refers to the amount of rain that percolates into the soil after plant interception and evapotranspiration and the net rainfall on the slope cell can be described by the following equation 8 p n t max 0 p i t e t e t e i t e s t e g t where pn t and pi t are the net rainfall and rainfall at time t respectively mm e t is the evapotranspiration at time t mm and ei t es t and eg t are the vegetation evaporation soil evapotranspiration and phreatic water evaporation respectively mm the net rainfall on the surface river cells refers to the amount of rain that falls directly into a river channel and plays an important role in the rainfall runoff process in particular it affects the flow value in the outlet section of the basin and is combined with the river runoff in the confluence calculation the net rainfall on each surface river cell can be calculated by the following equation bao et al 2016 9 p r t p i t e p l r r cw max a where pr and pi t are the net rainfall and rainfall at time t respectively on the rth surface river cell mm ep is the potential evaporation mm lr is the length of the rth river segment selected dm r cw max is the river width corresponding to the maximum river cross section dm and a is the area of the surface river cell dm2 the vertical structure of the kthm has 5 layers vegetation cover soil layer rock strata of the epikarst zone bedrock and the underground river system when the net rainfall reaches the exposed karst slope cells runoff can be generated if the rainfall intensity is greater than the soil infiltration capacity this part of the runoff is called excess infiltration runoff in the kthm the rest of the net rainfall seeps into the soil in the surface karst zone and the water quantity that infiltrates first compensates for any water shortage in the vadose zone after the vadose zone is full part of the water flows through the soil layer the subsurface flow the rest of the water continues to seep into the underground river system in the kthm the depth of the surface excess infiltration runoff on slope cells and the underground runoff can be described by the following equation 10 r si p i f i p i i f r si 0 p i i f i f α f c s δ s f r gi r 0 i exp a t b where r si is the surface excess infiltration runoff depth on the slope cells at period t mm pi and fi are the net rainfall and amount of infiltration into the epikarst zone respectively mm i f is the infiltration capacity mm which varies in different karst landforms α and δ are the parameters of the holtan model f c is the field capacity mm s is the actual soil moisture content mm s f is the steady infiltration water volume mm r gi is the underground runoff depth at period t mm r 0 i is the average depth of runoff that seeps into an underground water mm and a and b are constants based on the thickness of the karst aquifers and the soil infiltration capacity which can be calculated by conducting a soil infiltration test based on the holtan model in the study area the subsurface flow in the soil layer can be calculated by the following equation chen 2009 11 q lat x s fw z s t q r q per q lat v lat s fw z v lat k tan α s f c v lat 0 s f where q lat is the subsurface flow in the soil layer in the horizontal direction l s 1 v lat is its flow velocity m s 1 sfw is the width of the subsurface flow m z is the soil layer thickness m s and fc are the soil water storage and field capacity respectively qr is the runoff recharge at time t l s 1 q per is the seepage into the soil layer l s 1 k is the current soil hydraulic conductivity and α is the hydraulic gradient of the subsurface flow in the epikarst zone the distribution of small karst fissure systems is dominant and the water movement pattern basically conforms to darcy s law karst conduit systems have limited distribution but the underground water flow can be laminar or turbulent thus the karst water bearing system in the epikarst zone can be generalized into a fissure system and conduit system the former includes the rock matrix and very small cracks while the latter includes the large karst voids and corrosion conduits this generalization method is the same as that used in the cfpm1 module in the modflow cfp in the kthm the infiltration water flow into the epikarst zone is considered carefully in particular the rules for the movement of infiltrated net rainfall and its transformation in the rock strata of the epikarst zone are refined to describe runoff generation from net rainfall infiltration and confluence in water bearing karst media karst aquifers need to be discretized into small cuboid units according to the characteristics of the water bearing karst media the cuboid units can be further divided into l layers and each layer includes m rows and n columns the water head at the centre of the lattice represents that of the unit and the permeation boundary is located at the unit edge considering that water movement in the epikarst zone basically conforms to darcy s law the confluence mode is basically consistent with the cfpm1 module in the modflow cfp therefore in the model this discrete method is revised from the modlow cfpm1 module qin and jiang 2014 this discretized treatment of karst aquifers makes it easier for the model to effectively describe water movement within the units fig 3 shows a cuboid unit of the simplified karst aquifer after the karst aquifer is discretized to accurately simulate the water movement in the different water bearing media in the karst aquifers the karst water bearing media need to be generalized effectively in the kthm different generalization methods are adopted for the various karst media in the study area for instance the underground river system is generalized as a water rich belt consisting of several connected large karst conduits in which the flow is characterized as rapid flow li et al 2019a 2019b fissured karst can be treated as an equivalent continuous medium the water rich zone in the epikarst zone can be generalized as a saturated medium with high permeability and large effective porosity and caves are treated as anisotropic media with multiple holes and a large infiltration coefficient these different generalization methods for karst media enable the kthm to easily identify and simulate the water movement in karst aquifers in these cuboid units of the simplified karst aquifer the valid computational unit fig 3 is regarded as a dual medium that includes a porous medium and a very small fissure when runoff flows into porous media such as large karst caves and conduits rapid underground runoff develops and quickly flows into the river channels of the subbasins when the runoff passes through tiny karst fissures and small cracks it forms slow underground runoff which gradually collects into larger conduits and then drains into the underground river in the cuboid unit of the simplified karst aquifer in the epikarst zone the water flow from a unit to an adjacent low gradient unit can be calculated by the following formula modified form zhang et al 2009 12 q t ijk b ijk δ h δ l t t ij r i c j when water flows through tiny karst fissures the hydraulic conductivity of slow underground runoff is as follows beven and fisher 1996 13 t t ij n r ρ g r i c j l k 12 v when water flows

permeability of the soil hij is the groundwater burial depth m and zij is the thickness of the epikarst zone m catchment confluence is the general term for the hydrological processes that lead various runoff pathways to converge into the outlet section of a river basin in the kthm the calculation of runoff confluence includes the surface river confluence hill slope confluence and underground river confluence among them the surface river and hill slope confluence are calculated by the saint venant equations a one dimensional wave movement equation is used for the hill slope confluence and a diffusion wave movement equation is used for the confluence of the surface river the confluence calculation processes involve the calculation of surface runoff confluence in the liuxihe model chen 2009 2018 the confluence calculation process of karst underground rivers is described by using the muskingum confluence model in the kthm this algorithm and its steps are described by li et al 2019a li et al 2019b 3 2 model calibration and uncertainty analysis the kthm contains fifteen parameters table 2 a among them only the parameters with high and moderate sensitivities need to be optimized and the insensitive parameters do not require optimization the sensitivities of these parameters are calculated and evaluated in the following part of this paper ultimately only ten parameters have to be optimized in the model which improves the efficiency of the model calculation to a great extent table 2 lists the parameter set of the model the possible range of the initial values for some hydrogeological parameters in the study area must be determined before parametric optimization for instance the thickness and lithologic and stratigraphic properties of the epikarst zone can be obtained based on a field survey the direction and distribution of karst underground river systems can be obtained by tracer tests in the study area and the parameters related to rainfall infiltration can be obtained by infiltration experiments in the kthm an improved particle swarm optimization pso algorithm chen et al 2016 is employed to optimize the model parameters after parametric optimization the performance of the model in karst hydrological process simulations is verified in this verification the evaluation index of the simulation effect includes the correlation coefficient relative flow process error flood peak error and peak time difference and the water balance coefficient the uncertainty of the model simulation results is mainly based on three aspects 1 uncertainty of the model input data such as rainfall and flow data and more critically hydrogeological data which are more difficult to obtain in karst areas than in non karst areas 2 uncertainty of the model structure itself which is caused by systematic errors of the mathematical physical model 3 uncertainty of the model parameter optimization in this paper an improved pso algorithm chen et al 2016 which has been proven to effectively reduce the uncertainty of parameter transfer for distributed hydrological models is used to optimize the parameters of the model li et al 2017 2019 chen et al 2017 in addition the uncertainty of the model parameters can also be reduced by evaluating the sensitivity of the parameters in this study a multiparametric sensitivity analysis algorithm choi et al 1999 li et al 2019a 2019b is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters in the kthm where the nash sutcliffe coefficient is adopted as the objective function for the model calibration considering runoff simulation and forecasting especially flood event forecasting the simulation results of the flood peak flow are the most commonly used so the minimum relative error of simulated peak flow is taken to calculate the nash sutcliffe coefficient in this study 15 e 1 i 1 n q i q i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 where e is the value of the nash sutcliffe coefficient qi and qi are the observed and simulated peak flows respectively l s 1 q is the average observed peak flow l s 1 and n is the number of observations the procedure for parameter sensitivity analysis of the kthm involves the following steps 1 the initial parameter value range is set to 0 2 3 0 according to the parameter properties the convergence condition for parameter optimization is set to 10 4 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient threshold value is set to 0 9 2 three thousand groups of initial parameter sets for each model parameter are acquired based on the monte carlo sampling method in the model li et al 2019a 2019b 3 the flow process is simulated by using these three thousand groups of parameters in the kthm and the nash coefficients for each simulation are recorded 4 these nash coefficient values are compared with the threshold of 0 9 if a coefficient is greater than 0 9 then it is considered an acceptable value otherwise it is considered an unacceptable value 5 evaluating the degree of dispersion of the acceptable and unacceptable values implies the sensitivity of each model parameter 3 3 model setup the model setting mainly refers to some initial value ranges and conditional assumptions before the simulation calculation including the following points 1 the initial soil moisture is set to 20 90 of the saturated soil water content during floods however the most suitable soil moisture content within this range in the early stage of flood needs to be determined by many model runs 2 the groundwater divide and initial water head are determined by tracer experiments and flow field analysis of the karst aquifers in the study area in the tunnel submodule this groundwater divide is the boundary of the complete hydrogeological unit across which the tunnel passes in the dry season the flow in karst conduits in the tunnel site area is small so the tunnels in this study area can be used as temporary dynamic head boundaries 3 the flow direction and distribution of underground rivers in the study area are also deduced by tracer experiments where the water level and flow are monitored in real time by an automatic water station at the outlet of the underground river the river base flow is 60 l s 1 according to the perennial average dry season runoff 4 the initial value range of the model parameters must be set to optimize the parameters 5 the dem land use soil and flow data are input to the kthm to verify its performance in karst hydrological simulations the hydrological effects of tunnel drainage can be determined through the simulated water volume difference between the khm without the tunnel submodule and the kthm according to the characteristics of karst development in the underlying rocks of the basin 1267 karst subbasin units including 372 river cells 836 hill slope cells and 59 reservoir cells are identified based on the 15 m 15 m dem the bottom plate of the tunnel submodule is set to an elevation of 0 m in the simulations and its dimensions are a length of 4035 m and a thickness of 8 m the karst aquifer in the tunnel site area is generalized as cuboid units fig 3 where they are divided into 179 layers 465 rows and 625 columns 4 results 4 1 results of the parametric sensitivity analysis the parameter sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the sensitivity of each parameter and determine the highly sensitive moderately sensitive and insensitive parameters in the kthm in parametric optimization only highly and moderately sensitive parameters must be optimized and insensitive parameters do not require optimization thus the efficiency of the model calculation can be considerably improved the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters is calculated by eq 15 where flood peak flow is used as the state variable in the parameter sensitivity analysis and the results are listed in table 3 the results of the parameter sensitivity in table 3 show that the calculated values are all between 0 and 1 the closer the value is to 1 the greater the sensitivity of the parameter we set calculated value intervals to categorize the sensitivity of parameters a calculated value between 0 7 and 1 is considered a highly sensitive parameter the calculated value of a moderately sensitive parameter is between 0 45 and 0 7 and a calculated value less than 0 45 is considered insensitive therefore the highly sensitive parameters in the kthm are the infiltration coefficient ic permeability coefficient k rock porosity rp saturated water content sc field capacity fc specific yield sy and flow direction fd the insensitive parameters are the attenuation coefficient ac potential evaporation ep and wilting coefficient wc the remaining model parameters are moderately sensitive the order of parameter sensitivity is as follows infiltration coefficient ic permeability coefficient k rock porosity rp saturated water content sc field capacity fc specific yield sy flow direction fd thickness h slope s0 channel roughness n evaporation coefficient λ attenuation coefficient ac potential evaporation ep wilting coefficient wc 4 2 results of model parametric optimization twenty flow processes and two annual runoffs are chosen to verify the results of the kthm hydrological simulations in karst among them four flows including flows 201804210800 201809100345 201905261200 and 201907261200 are selected for model parametric optimization and floods with the optimal simulation effect are used for the final parameter optimization these four typical flow processes can basically represent all flow conditions in the research area where flow 201804210800 represents dry season runoff flows 201809100345 and 201905261200 represent normal runoff and flow 201907261200 represents flood runoff the remaining flows are used to validate the performance of the kthm the kthm has a total of 15 parameters among which only the 10 parameters with high and moderate sensitivities need to be optimized the parametric optimization results of the kthm are shown in fig 4 the parametric optimization results in fig 4 illustrate that the model parameters and their objective functions converge after 20 iterations and that the sensitivities of the parameters remain constant after 60 iterations which implies that the computational efficiency of the model is very high to verify the simulation effects of the model on different hydrological processes dry season runoff normal runoff and flood events are used to calibrate the model parameters in this study fig 5 shows the flow simulation effects based on the parameter optimization in fig 5 the simulated effects based on the kthm are satisfactory for all the hydrological processes and the kthm performs better than the khm in runoff simulations especially the simulated peak flows which demonstrates that the tunnel submodule in the kthm is effective the good simulation results indicate that the improved pso algorithm chosen in the parametric optimization of the kthm is feasible the results from the simulations of the four flows in fig 5 show that the best simulated effect is obtained for normal flow 201905261200 the overall simulation effect of this multipeak flood is the best therefore the parameter results corresponding to flow 201905261200 are used as the optimal parameter set to simulate and verify the remaining nineteen flow processes and 2 annual runoffs to further verify the results of parameter optimization five evaluation indices for the simulated flow effects including the correlation coefficient the relative flow process error the flood peak error and its peak time difference and the water balance coefficient are calculated and listed in table 4 the simulated flow effects in table 4 reveal that compared with the performance of the khm the kthm presents more accurate results and superior evaluation indices from flow simulations with the kthm the correlation coefficient increases by 14 the relative flow process error decreases by 9 the flood peak error decreases by 12 the water balance coefficient decreases by 27 and the peak time error decreases by 2 h compared to the results of the khm the best simulated evaluation indices are obtained for normal flow 201905261200 which is the same result as shown in fig 5 4 3 model validation in runoff simulations during the year nineteen flow processes during the year including floods normal runoff and dry season runoff at the outlet of the underground river are used to verify the performance of the kthm to describe the effects of the tunnel submodule in the model the flow simulation results determined by the khm and kthm are compared in fig 6 however only six of the flow process simulation results are shown here due to space limitations among them each has two flows representing flood runoff normal runoff and dry season runoff the simulated flow results in fig 6 illustrate that the simulated flow processes based on the kthm are much more accurate than those based on the khm the flow simulation values of the khm are larger than the observed values while the flow values simulated by the kthm are very close to the observed values these results are consistent with those of the four flows used in parametric optimization and confirm that adding the tunnel submodule to the khm to develop the kthm is necessary to further compare the simulated flow results based on the khm and kthm five evaluation indices of all nineteen flows are used to assess the simulated effects as listed in table 5 in table 5 the average values of the correlation coefficient relative flow process error flood peak error water balance coefficient and peak flow time error based on the khm are 0 73 29 30 1 16 and 6 h respectively whereas the average values of these five evaluation indices based on the kthm are 0 95 11 6 0 94 and 3 h respectively these findings indicate that all the evaluation indices from the kthm are more accurate than those from the khm thus the tunnel submodule designed in the model is effective and the kthm proposed in this study is feasible for flow simulations in karst areas the difference between the water amounts simulated by the khm and kthm represents the water loss caused by tunnel engineering in the study area the simulated water volume can be determined by the area enclosed by the flow process lines and the time axes table 6 shows the calculated results of the water volume difference between the khm and the kthm in a year in table 6 the differential ratio refers to the ratio of the difference between the simulated peak flow or total flood volume of the models to the observed value this value is the proportion of water loss caused by the tunnels of the observed water volume which reflects the influence of the tunnels on the water volume of the runoff at the underground river outlet the results in table 6 show that the peak flows and water amounts simulated by the khm are larger than the observed values while the simulated values of the kthm are close to the observed values the average differential ratios for the flood peak flow and the flood water volume are 16 and 12 the simulated peak flow and water volume of the normal runoff are 25 and 21 of the observed values whereas simulated peak flow and water volume of the dry season runoff are 29 and 24 these findings indicate that the influence of a tunnel is greater on the peak flow than on the water volume and that a tunnel has the greatest influence on the dry season runoff and the least influence on the flood runoff among the runoff categories moreover the sensitivity of the hydrological effects of tunnels follows the order of water volume of dry season runoff normal runoff volume flood peak flow flood volume 4 4 interannual runoff simulation results runoff during the year is divided into flood dry season runoff and normal runoff according to the amount of water the kthm works well for runoff simulations throughout a year to further validate the performance of the new kthm for interannual runoff simulations 2 annual runoffs 2018 and 2019 are simulated by the kthm in this study fig 7 shows the flow simulated effects by the khm and kthm and table 7 lists their evaluation indices the results of the 2 annual runoff simulations from the khm and kthm shown in fig 7 and table 7 indicate that the kthm results are more accurate for interannual runoff simulations than the khm results in particular the simulation effects of almost every peak flow in the annual flow processes by the kthm are very close to the observed values and the average value of the simulated peak flow error is only 8 in contrast the simulation effect of the khm for each peak flow is poor the simulated value is much larger than the observed value with an average simulated peak flow error of 32 thus the tunnel submodule designed in the kthm is effective and necessary this finding is consistent with the results previously discussed in section 4 3 to describe the impact of tunnel engineering on the water volume of interannual runoff the water volume of 2 annual runoffs is simulated by the khm and kthm and listed in table 8 table 8 shows that the water volumes of the interannual runoff simulated by the khm are larger than those of the observed values and that the average relative error between the simulated value and the observed value is 13 however the interannual runoff volume simulated by the kthm is more accurate and the average relative error is only 6 moreover the average differential ratio is 19 with the kthm a comparison of the results of the effect of a tunnel on the flow processes within a year table 6 shows that the influence the tunnel on the flow processes within a year is greater than that of the interannual runoff 5 discussion 5 1 effects of tunnel excavation on groundwater flow processes the simulated runoff results during the year fig 6 and the annual runoff fig 7 show that the flow processes at the outlet of the underground river simulated by the khm and the kthm are reliable moreover the flow process lines of the simulations by the khm and kthm are generally consistent with the observed values however the average relative flow process error p of simulated runoff during the year is 29 with the khm and 11 with the kthm table 5 and the interannual runoff is 24 with the khm and 15 with the kthm table 7 in addition the hydrological effects of tunnel engineering on the flow processes are considerable as indicated by the relative error between the flow processes simulated by the khm and the observed processes this result is reliable because the khm and the kthm are actually the same model and the only difference is that a tunnel submodule is not included in the khm since the simulation results of the same model are compared the systematic errors inside the model can be ignored the influence of tunnel engineering in karst areas on flow processes is also reflected in flood detention during a flood tunnel drainage removes some of the water that should be discharged from the underground river outlet thus leading to a time lag of the flood peak in table 5 the peak time errors t with the khm and kthm are 6 and 3 h respectively these findings show that the tunnels in the study area caused the flood peak of the underground river to appear 3 h later the flood detention effect of tunnels should be considered in future flood forecasting in the research area 5 2 effects of tunnel excavation on groundwater quantity the hydrological effects of tunnelling on runoff mainly occur through the influence of tunnel engineering on runoff quantity the results of 19 flow processes and 2 annual runoffs simulated with the khm and the kthm show that the simulated values of floods normal runoff and dry season runoff as well as 2 annual runoffs are larger than the observed values when utilizing the khm while those simulated values by the kthm are basically consistent with the observations tables 6 and 8 this difference is because the khm does not consider tunnel drainage in the study area therefore according to the principle of water balance some of the water that should drain from the tunnels is added to the flow at the outlet of the underground river as a result the flows simulated by the khm are larger than the observed values when the tunnel submodule is added in the kthm to simulate the flow processes the simulated values are completely consistent with the observed values this finding indicates that the calculation of the actual water volume of the basin in the kthm is basically balanced however the kthm underestimates the flood runoff normal runoff table 6 and interannual runoff table 8 but overestimates the dry season runoff table 6 the errors of water quantity overestimation or underestimation are not large and thus may be caused by the systematic error of the model the simulation results for runoff during a year table 6 and interannual runoff table 8 show that the influence of the tunnels on the peak flow is greater than that on its water volume in addition the influence of tunnel engineering in karst areas on the runoff quantity during a year is greater than that of interannual runoff this is because the simulation results of the interannual runoff balance the water volume difference between the flood and dry season runoff the results in table 6 show that tunnels in karst areas have the greatest influence on the water volume of runoff in the dry season 24 and the least influence on flood runoff 12 this is because the shape and size of the tunnels are fixed the corresponding drainage is usually fixed within a certain range and the water loss by tunnels accounts for a large proportion in the dry season runoff decreasing the dry season runoff in contrast tunnel water loss accounts for a small proportion of the flood water volume and has little impact on it the sensitivity sequence of hydrological effects of tunnels is as follows water volume of dry season runoff normal runoff volume water volume of interannual runoff flood peak flow flood volume in summary tunnel engineering in the study area has a great influence on natural karst runoff tunnels can reduce the discharge flow at the underground river outlet and delay the occurrence time of peak discharge tunnels have a great influence on runoff during the dry season and the underground rivers in this area were initially perennial however these rivers were cut off seasonally after tunnel construction tunnel excavation also leads to serious surface water leakage and groundwater drainage problems in the study area a large area of paddy fields is now abandoned dry land local residents have to drill wells more than 117 m deep to obtain a reasonable water supply a certain range of karst rocky desertification forms due to surface water leakage tunnel engineering in karst areas has caused almost irreversible damage to the originally fragile karst water system and ecological environment 5 3 uncertainty analysis of simulation results the uncertainty of the model simulation results is due to mainly the following three aspects first there may be uncertainties in the acquisition mode and data reliability of the model input data in particular it is difficult to obtain reliable hydrogeological data in karst areas regarding the meteorological hydrological and geological data used to build the kthm in this study three types of reviews must be conducted before the values are input into the model a reliability review of data sources and consistency and representative evaluations of the data for the pretreatment process for these data our previous research results can be referenced li et al 2019a 2019b second as a mathematical physical model the distributed hydrological model structure may be uncertain due to systematic errors which are mainly reduced by simplifying the model structure and improving the algorithm for instance the underground confluence module is divided into only two layers the confluence of the epikarst zone and the underground river system and the algorithms of slow and rapid flow in karst water bearing media are improved effectively eqs 12 14 third uncertainty arises during model parameter optimization there are many parameters in a distributed hydrological model which leads to some uncertainty in parameter optimization in this study we reduce the uncertainty of model parameters in two ways first an improved pso algorithm is used to automatically optimize the model parameters which can reduce the uncertainty of parameter transfer in the model effectively second parametric sensitivity analysis is performed to reduce uncertainty we calculate the sensitivity of each parameter of the kthm in detail table 3 and the sensitivity of the model parameters is divided into highly sensitive moderately sensitive and insensitive when parameters are optimized only the highly and moderately sensitive parameters need to be calculated while the insensitive parameters do not need to be optimized which improves the computational efficiency of the model from the results of the parametric sensitivity analysis in section 4 1 the parameters related to the infiltration characteristics and karst water bearing medium are highly sensitive while the model parameters associated with evapotranspiration and wilting coefficient are not sensitive this shows that the karst hydrogeological characteristics especially those of an anisotropic karst aquifer have the greatest influence on the parameters of the distributed hydrological model which controls the movement and transformation of infiltration water in karst water bearing media however parameters such as evapotranspiration in the basin are insensitive indicating that the water loss by evaporation has little influence on the quantity of water at the underground river outlet in the study area especially during the flood season and that the proportion of evapotranspiration from the flood water is very small by evaluating the uncertainty of the model simulation results the errors of the hydrological simulation in the model karst can be greatly reduced and the accuracy can be well improved the kthm developed in this study is applicable in the study area and the mechanism of this kthm is suitable for performing hydrological simulation of a variety of karst landforms because the runoff generation and confluence module in the model includes the excess infiltration runoff and runoff generation under saturated conditions eqs 10 and 11 when the model is applied to exposed karst areas the rainfall runoff can be calculated by using the excess infiltration runoff module while in buried karst basins it can be described by runoff generation under saturated conditions the results of this study provide a good tool for the hydrological simulation and hydrological effect analysis of tunnels in karst areas 6 conclusions tunnel engineering in the study area has a great impact on the natural karst hydrological process according to the field survey therefore building a hydrological model to stimulate the hydrological effects of tunnels is necessary however the complicated underlying surface conditions and heterogeneous aquifer interactions in the study area pose great challenges for the application of hydrological models and make it difficult to accurately describe the water movement and transformation in karst water bearing media in addition the current distributed hydrological models usually need a considerable amount of hydrogeological data when used in karst areas due to the variety of structures and range of parameters to overcome the challenge of applying a distributed model in the study area a new fully distributed kthm is proposed in this study to investigate the hydrological effects of tunnels the following conclusions are based on the research results 1 the parameters related to the infiltration and karst water bearing medium in the kthm are highly sensitive while those related to the evapotranspiration are insensitive the order of parameter sensitivity is as follows infiltration coefficient ic permeability coefficient k rock porosity rp saturated water content sc field capacity fc specific yield sy flow direction fd thickness h slope s0 channel roughness n evaporation coefficient λ attenuation coefficient ac potential evaporation ep wilting coefficient wc 2 the improved pso algorithm is effective for parametric optimization of the kthm and can considerably increase the computational efficiency of the model and the model parameters and their objective functions converge after only 20 iterations comparing the performances of the khm and kthm in flood simulations with parametric optimization the kthm is more accurate than the khm the correlation coefficient increases by 14 the relative flow process error decreases by 9 the flood peak error decreases by 12 the water balance coefficient decreases by 27 and the peak time error decreases by 2 h 3 the simulated flood results from the kthm are more accurate than those from the khm especially the simulated peak flows the 5 evaluation indices improve considerably when the kthm is used the average values of the correlation coefficient relative flow process error flood peak error water balance coefficient and peak flow time error based on the khm are 0 73 29 30 1 16 and 6 h respectively whereas the average values of these five evaluation indices based on the kthm are 0 95 11 6 0 94 and 3 h respectively clearly the evaluation indices of the kthm indicate that this approach is considerably more accurate the khm suggesting that the tunnel submodule is effective and that the kthm proposed in this study is feasible for performing flood simulations in the study area 4 the water volume difference between the khm and the kthm represents the water loss caused by the tunnels in the study area the simulated water difference indicates that tunnel engineering in the study area has a great influence on the runoff at the outlet of underground rivers the influence on the runoff during a year is greater than that of interannual runoff and its influence on the peak flow is greater than that on its water volume in the study area tunnels have the greatest impact on runoff during the dry season by reducing the runoff volume which leads to seasonal interruptions in underground river flow tunnels have little influence on flood runoff the sensitivity sequence of the hydrological effects of tunnelling is as follows water volume of dry season runoff normal runoff volume water volume of interannual runoff flood peak flow flood volume 5 these reasonable flow simulation results in the study area show that the kthm model developed in this paper is feasible for karst hydrology simulation and that the tunnel submodule in the model can effectively describe the drainage of tunnels because of the simple structure of this kthm it is easy to build models to represent other karst basins with tunnels similar to the zhongliangshan karst basin therefore this model has great application potential in karst areas considering that several additional tunnel projects will be constructed in the research area this kthm can be built in advance to predict the possible drainage conditions of the tunnel which will be very helpful for the tunnel engineering design and can provide strong theoretical and data support 7 data availability all data used in this paper are available

4985,tunnel excavation in karst areas could affect natural karst hydrological processes and runoff resulting in groundwater drainage and even underground river cut off the hydrological model is a good tool with which to study the hydrological effect of tunnels the application of current hydrological models in karst areas usually requires a large amount of modelling data especially hydrogeological data that are much more difficult to obtain than those in non karst areas to overcome the difficulty of modelling in karst areas this study presents a new fully physically based distributed karst tunnel hydrological model kthm with a simple structure and simple parameters the underground confluence module is divided into only two layers confluence in the epikarst zone and the underground river such a simple structure makes it possible to build a model in karst basins with only a small amount of hydrogeological data in the structure of this kthm the tunnel is incorporated in a specially designed submodule to quantify the influence of the tunnel hydrological effect on the water volume if the tunnel submodule is turned off then this model becomes a karst hydrological model khm and can be used in other karst basins without tunnels the simulation results of 20 flow processes and 2 annual runoffs modelled by the khm and kthm are compared the kthm is more accurate in the study area which indicates that the tunnel submodule in the model is necessary and that the kthm is feasible for performing runoff simulations in the study area the sensitivity sequence of hydrological effects of tunnels on runoff in karst areas is as follows dry season runoff volume normal runoff volume interannual runoff volume flood peak flow flood volume keywords karst tunnel hydrological model kthm hydrological effects of tunnel excavation tunnel submodule runoff simulations southwest china 1 introduction tunnel excavation in karst areas will affect the local karst water system which is mainly reflected in changes in the groundwater flow field the water cycle processes rules and ultimately the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of karst water resources yuan 2002 hartmann et al 2014 because the hydrogeological conditions in karst areas are more complicated and changeable than those in non karst areas tunnel excavation in karst areas is more likely to affect more fragile and sensitive karst water systems thereby leading to interruptions of the natural hydrological cycle or problems in the ecological environment such as surface water leakage karst water inrush groundwater drainage and karst collapse iacobellis et al 2015 vigna et al 2017 tunnels are densely distributed in the zhongliangshan karst valley basin in chongqing china the study area of this paper there are three tunnels within a range of only 12 km2 with an average spacing of approximately 2 km several more tunnels are planned to be built this phenomenon of densely packed tunnels is common in mountain cities such as chongqing in the study area according to a previous basin survey these tunnels have had serious impacts on the local karst water system and ecological environment lv et al 2020 the underground river in the study area previously flowed regularly but is now occasionally cut off under the influence of the tunnels and a large area of former paddy fields has become dry land there were fifteen epikarst springs in the basin before 2000 which are the main source of water supply for local residents livelihood and irrigation needs however only one spring with low discharge was found in 2017 liu et al 2019 and it is now often cut off during the dry season therefore studying the hydrological effects of tunnel excavation in the study area is necessary in this study we focus on the impact of tunnel engineering on the runoff process and water quantity at natural underground river outlets in the study area where there are no surface rivers and an underground river within the basin is the only confluence of drainage after a tunnel was built it drained some of the water that should have flowed from the underground river the water volume at the underground river outlet should be reduced however the expected level of reduction was not clear although a gauging station has been set up at the underground river outlet it was installed after completion of a tunnel and the changes in underground runoff before and after tunnel construction cannot be compared therefore it is necessary to establish a mathematical physical model to quantitatively compare the impact of tunnel engineering on natural runoff in karst areas and hydrological models can represent good tools for such investigations goldscheider and drew 2007 li et al 2019a 2019b recent research on the hydrological modelling in karst basins with tunnels has focused on mainly the prediction of tunnel water inrush linbin et al 2010 wang et al 2019 neukomm et al 2020 for which modflow for example is widely used reimann et al 2009 gallegos et al 2013 simulations of underground water flow regimes or seepage fields under the influence of tunnels raposo et al 2010 chen et al 2020 engineering geological hazards caused by tunnel construction such as karst collapse zini et al 2015 lv et al 2020 and the environmental impacts of tunnelling in karst regions milanovic 2002 bonacci 2014 parise et al 2015 liu et al 2019 in addition some classic hydrological models such as the she model abbott et al 986a abbott et al 1986b swat model peterson and hamlett 1998 and topmodel ambroise et al 1996 are often used in hydrological simulations and predictions in karst areas doummar et al 2012 li et al 2012 ren 2016 baffaut and benson 2009 suo et al 2007 pan 2014 although the above simulations and predictions by hydrological models have achieved good research results in karst basins with tunnels the cost of modelling in karst areas is relatively high on the one hand the intricate underlying surface conditions and hydrogeological characteristics in karst areas pose great challenges for accurately simulating hydrological effects of tunnels fiorillo et al 2015 xu et al 2020 in particular the anisotropic interactions of karst aquifers make it difficult to accurately describe the movement and transformation of rainfall infiltration water in karst water bearing media milanovic 2002 bartolomé et al 2006 on the other hand hydrological models especially distributed hydrological models freeze and harlan 1969 usually have multiple and complex structures with many parameters chen 2009 2018 hartmann et al 2015 so more data especially a large amount of hydrogeological data are needed to build the model in addition obtaining these data is much more difficult in karst areas than in non karst areas ford and williams 2007 vincenzi et al 2009 for example borehole pumping tests are needed to determine the influence of tunnel construction on karst groundwater dynamics birk et al 2005 schiller and renard 2016 to address the difficulty of insufficient data for distributed models used in karst areas in this study a new fully distributed karst tunnel hydrological model kthm is developed to simulate hydrological effects of tunnels in detail unlike other distributed hydrological models used in karst basins which often require a considerable amount of data to build the model due to their complex structural features kraller et al 2014 hartmann et al 2015 this new kthm has particular advantages when used in karst areas the model structure is relatively simple and its overall structure is divided into only two parts the surface and the underground parts the main function of the former is to converge surface rivers into the underground river system while the latter corresponds to the confluent output of the karst underground river in the basin therefore this kthm is an integration of a surface hydrological model and groundwater flow model in terms of its mechanism the underground confluence module of the vertical structure is also divided into two layers and the physical significance of each layer is explicit and simple which makes it possible to build models that represent karst areas with only limited meteorological and hydrogeological data in addition the model is calibrated and validated against field hydrogeological data that can be easily obtained by for example tracer experiments the model parameters are classified and dimensionless and only the moderate and high sensitivity parameters need to be optimized which saves calculation time this new kthm has great potential for application in karst areas due to these advantages in the model structure of the kthm a tunnel submodule is designed as an independent structure for detailed simulations of the response of hydrological processes to tunnels in the study area in the tunnel submodule considering that the shape of the tunnel is usually regular the water movement in the tunnel basically conforms to darcy s law and parameters such as the distribution shape and size of the tunnel are easy to obtain thus this study refers to the algorithm of modflow cfpm1 gallegos et al 2013 for tunnel drainage simulations in addition to describe runoff generation and confluence in anisotropic water bearing karst media karst aquifers need to be discretized effectively this discrete method in the kthm is revised from the modlow cfpm1 module qin and jiang 2014 when the tunnel submodule is turned off the model becomes a karst hydrological model khm the simulated water quantity difference between the khm and the kthm can reflect the influence of tunnels on the flow processes and runoff quantity in the study area and 20 flow processes and 2 annual runoffs of the underground river outlet are selected to verify the performance of the kthm in karst simulations 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the zhongliangshan karst basin in chongqing a highly developed karst area in southwest china is selected as the study area it is located at 106 23 e 106 28 e 29 41 n 29 48 n the basin area is approximately 12 km2 and karst trough valley is the main landform the average annual temperature is 18 3 c and the subtropical monsoon climate brings abundant rainfall to the basin the average annual precipitation is 1100 mm liu et al 2019 which is mainly concentrated in the flood season from april to october the terrain of the basin consists of three low mountains with two karst trough valleys and the elevations of the mountains range from 200 to 700 m the main exposed strata form the guanyinxia anticline where the core of the anticline is a karst aquifer composed of limestone and the strata are the lower triassic feixianguan formation t1f the formations on both sides of the anticline core are the middle series of the leikoupo formation t2l and the lower series of the jialing river formation t1j the formation at the two sides of the basin is the upper triassic xujiahe formation t3xj and lower jurassic pearl chong formation j1z where the lithologies are feldspar quartz sandstone shale and mudstone wu et al 2018 fig 1 shows the zhongliangshan karst basin map there are currently three tunnels in the study area and their basic information is shown in table 1 2 2 data preparation the basic data for building the distributed hydrological model are mainly digital elevation model dem data soil type data and land use data among them the high resolution dem data are the key to dividing the karst subwatershed the original dem data soil type data and land use data can be freely downloaded from databases at official websites site links are provided later in this article the spatial resolution of the dem is 30 m 30 m while the resolutions for the soil type and land use data are 1000 m 1000 m these are low resolutions for such a small study area 12 km2 according to the research results of the correlation between the area of the karst watershed and the spatial resolution of the distributed model chen et al 2017 the spatial resolutions of the dem soil type and land use data are resampled at 15 m 15 m for the kthm using arcgis 10 2 software rainfall is the main recharge source of karst underground water in the basin and the outlet discharge of the underground river responds quickly to rainfall for which the response time of the peak discharge is 6 8 h the tracer experiment results in the study area show that the boundary between the surface watershed and the subsurface river confluence is basically consistent and that water supply replenishment does not occur from adjacent watersheds a direct hydraulic connection is observed between tunnel drainage and the underground river the karst morphology of the underground river is extremely developed which is manifested as a large single karst conduit without obvious water system branches there may be subterranean pools or lakes along the underground rivers they are embodied in the kthm as underground reservoir cells and their storage capacity can be estimated based on tracer recovery and retention time then the number of reservoir cells can be deduced by setting their water storage in the model the land use types in the study area are mainly cultivated land forest and grassland barren karst waste land and residential land there are three soil types zonal yellow soil unsaturated cambisol and chromic luvisol which account for 53 38 5 and 8 5 of the basin area respectively liu et al 2019 in this study area 20 flows and 2 annual runoffs of the underground river outlet are selected to verify the performance of the kthm in karst simulations to describe the hydrological effects of tunnelling on the karst hydrological processes within a year in detail the 20 flow processes are divided into flood runoff dry season runoff and normal runoff flood runoff refers to a peak discharge greater than 500 l s 1 and total flood greater than 160 000 l dry season runoff refers to a peak discharge less than 200 l s 1 and total flood less than 80 000 l and normal runoff corresponds to conditions between these limits 3 development and validation of the kthm 3 1 model development in this study a new distributed kthm is developed to simulate the hydrological effects of tunnels in detail the structure of the kthm is explicit and has physical significance the vertical structure is divided into two parts the surface and the underground parts the surface part controls the recharge from surface rivers to the underground river system and the underground part corresponds to the confluent output of the karst underground river the runoff generation and confluence modes change in different karst landforms thus in the kthm the rainfall runoff is calculated by the excess infiltration runoff in exposed karst landform units and by the runoff yield under saturated storage in buried karst landforms in the vertical model structure five layers are created vegetation cover soil layer rock strata of the epikarst zone bedrock and the underground river system from top to bottom the underground confluence module in the model is divided into only two layers the epikarst zone and the underground river such a simple model structure makes it possible to build a model in karst areas with only a small amount of hydrogeological data the horizontal structure includes river cells hill slope cells and reservoir cells fig 2 shows the modelling and calculation flow chart of the kthm 3 1 1 tunnel submodule the tunnel submodule is an independent structure in the kthm and is used to simulate the decrease in water volume at the underground river outlet under the influence of the tunnel in the study area in the tunnel submodule some simplification is needed to calculate the rainfall runoff and confluence processes within the tunnels which can be generalized into many large multisection circular pipelines due to their shape and structural characteristics considering that tunnel engineering in karst areas is usually performed in the unsaturated zone water movement in regularly shaped pipelines basically conforms to darcy s law when the water surface in the pipe rises or falls the change in flow into the unfilled pipelines can be calculated based on the modflow cfpm1 module by the following formula valiantzas 2008 qin and jiang 2014 1 q δ t v t 1 v t

pipeline respectively dm δ l jp is the length between the jth and pth pipelines dm and τ jp is the pipe tortuosity 3 1 2 rainfall interpolation and evapotranspiration calculation a limited number of rain gauges in the basin can collect point data for rain falling to the surface but the model calculation needs rainfall data over the whole basin therefore the observed rainfall point data is converted into basin areal rainfall by spatial interpolation in this study the inverse distance weighted interpolation method chen 2009 2018 is used to calculate the spatial interpolation of rainfall in the river basin 4 z i 1 n 1 d i p z i i 1 n 1 d i p where z is the property value of the estimated point n is the number of points in the domain 1 di p is the weight value of the ith point on the estimated point d i is the distance dm and p is the power of distance where the larger the value of p is the faster the weight decays with distance the power exponent p can be optimized based on the principle of minimum root mean square error rainfall and soil moisture before flood events are the key factors affecting evapotranspiration in the basin the vegetation evaporation is calculated as follows 5 e i v i i t δ t v i i t p s max r l ai f where ei is the vegetation evaporation mm v i i t δ t v i i t is the variation in rainfall interception in the vegetation canopy mm p is the rain

groundwater burial depth dm dm is the average groundwater burial depth dm dmax is the maximum groundwater burial depth dm γ γ is the gamma function a and b are the intermediate variables for calculation 3 1 3 rainfall runoff and confluence calculation the horizontal structure of the kthm includes river cells hill slope cells and reservoir cells a hill slope cell in this study refers to an exposed karst slope landform cell where runoff can be generated directly when the rainfall intensity is greater than the soil infiltration capacity runoff can be determined by subtracting subsoil seepage from net rainfall on the hill slope cells net rainfall refers to the amount of rain that percolates into the soil after plant interception and evapotranspiration and the net rainfall on the slope cell can be described by the following equation 8 p n t max 0 p i t e t e t e i t e s t e g t where pn t and pi t are the net rainfall and rainfall at time t respectively mm e t is the evapotranspiration at time t mm and ei t es t and eg t are the vegetation evaporation soil evapotranspiration and phreatic water evaporation respectively mm the net rainfall on the surface river cells refers to the amount of rain that falls directly into a river channel and plays an important role in the rainfall runoff process in particular it affects the flow value in the outlet section of the basin and is combined with the river runoff in the confluence calculation the net rainfall on each surface river cell can be calculated by the following equation bao et al 2016 9 p r t p i t e p l r r

selected dm r cw max is the river width corresponding to the maximum river cross section dm and a is the area of the surface river cell dm2 the vertical structure of the kthm has 5 layers vegetation cover soil layer rock strata of the epikarst zone bedrock and the underground river system when the net rainfall reaches the exposed karst slope cells runoff can be generated if the rainfall intensity is greater than the soil infiltration capacity this part of the runoff is called excess infiltration runoff in the kthm the rest of the net rainfall seeps into the soil in the surface karst zone and the water quantity that infiltrates first compensates for any water shortage in the vadose zone after the vadose zone is full part of the water flows through the soil layer the subsurface flow the rest of the water continues to seep into the underground river system in the kthm the depth of the surface excess infiltration runoff on slope cells and the underground runoff can be described by the following equation 10 r si p i f i p i i f r si 0 p i i f i f α f c s δ s f r gi r 0 i exp a t b where r si is the surface excess infiltration runoff depth on the slope cells at period t mm pi and fi

average depth of runoff that seeps into an underground water mm and a and b are constants based on the thickness of the karst aquifers and the soil infiltration capacity which can be calculated by conducting a soil infiltration test based on the holtan model in the study area the subsurface flow in the soil layer can be calculated by the following equation chen 2009 11 q lat x s fw z s t q r q per q lat v lat s fw z v lat k tan α s f c v lat 0 s f where q lat is the subsurface flow in the soil layer in the horizontal direction l s 1 v lat is its flow velocity m s 1 sfw is the width of the subsurface flow m z is the soil layer thickness m s and fc are the soil water storage and field capacity respectively qr is the runoff recharge at time t l s 1 q per is the seepage into the soil layer l s 1 k is the current soil hydraulic conductivity and α is the hydraulic gradient of the subsurface flow in the epikarst zone the distribution of small karst fissure systems is dominant and the water movement pattern basically conforms to darcy s law karst conduit systems have limited distribution but the underground water flow can be laminar or turbulent thus the karst water bearing system in the epikarst zone can be generalized into a fissure system and conduit system the former includes the rock matrix and very small cracks while the latter includes the large karst voids and corrosion conduits this generalization method is the same as that used in the cfpm1 module in the modflow cfp in the kthm the infiltration water flow into the epikarst zone is considered carefully in particular the rules for the movement of infiltrated net rainfall and its transformation in the rock strata of the epikarst zone are refined to describe runoff generation from net rainfall infiltration and confluence in water bearing karst media karst aquifers need to be discretized into small cuboid units according to the characteristics of the water bearing karst media the cuboid units can be further divided into l layers and each layer includes m rows and n columns the water head at the centre of the lattice represents that of the unit and the permeation boundary is located at the unit edge considering that water movement in the epikarst zone basically conforms to darcy s law the confluence mode is basically consistent with the cfpm1 module in the modflow cfp therefore in the model this discrete method is revised from the modlow cfpm1 module qin and jiang 2014 this discretized treatment of karst aquifers makes it easier for the model to effectively describe water movement within the units fig 3 shows a cuboid unit of the simplified karst aquifer after the karst aquifer is discretized to accurately simulate the water movement in the different water bearing media in the karst aquifers the karst water bearing media need to be generalized effectively in the kthm different generalization methods are adopted for the various karst media in the study area for instance the underground river system is generalized as a water rich belt consisting of several connected large karst conduits in which the flow is characterized as rapid flow li et al 2019a 2019b fissured karst can be treated as an equivalent continuous medium the water rich zone in the epikarst zone can be generalized as a saturated medium with high permeability and large effective porosity and caves are treated as anisotropic media with multiple holes and a large infiltration coefficient these different generalization methods for karst media enable the kthm to easily identify and simulate the water movement in karst aquifers in these cuboid units of the simplified karst aquifer the valid computational unit fig 3 is regarded as a dual medium that includes a porous medium and a very small fissure when runoff flows into porous media such as large karst caves and conduits rapid underground runoff develops and quickly flows into the river channels of the subbasins when the runoff passes through tiny karst fissures and small cracks it forms slow underground runoff which gradually collects into larger conduits and then drains into the underground river in the cuboid unit of the simplified karst aquifer in the epikarst zone the water flow from a unit to an adjacent low gradient unit can be calculated by the following formula modified form zhang et al 2009 12 q t ijk b ijk δ h δ l t t ij

permeability of the soil hij is the groundwater burial depth m and zij is the thickness of the epikarst zone m catchment confluence is the general term for the hydrological processes that lead various runoff pathways to converge into the outlet section of a river basin in the kthm the calculation of runoff confluence includes the surface river confluence hill slope confluence and underground river confluence among them the surface river and hill slope confluence are calculated by the saint venant equations a one dimensional wave movement equation is used for the hill slope confluence and a diffusion wave movement equation is used for the confluence of the surface river the confluence calculation processes involve the calculation of surface runoff confluence in the liuxihe model chen 2009 2018 the confluence calculation process of karst underground rivers is described by using the muskingum confluence model in the kthm this algorithm and its steps are described by li et al 2019a li et al 2019b 3 2 model calibration and uncertainty analysis the kthm contains fifteen parameters table 2 a among them only the parameters with high and moderate sensitivities need to be optimized and the insensitive parameters do not require optimization the sensitivities of these parameters are calculated and evaluated in the following part of this paper ultimately only ten parameters have to be optimized in the model which improves the efficiency of the model calculation to a great extent table 2 lists the parameter set of the model the possible range of the initial values for some hydrogeological parameters in the study area must be determined before parametric optimization for instance the thickness and lithologic and stratigraphic properties of the epikarst zone can be obtained based on a field survey the direction and distribution of karst underground river systems can be obtained by tracer tests in the study area and the parameters related to rainfall infiltration can be obtained by infiltration experiments in the kthm an improved particle swarm optimization pso algorithm chen et al 2016 is employed to optimize the model parameters after parametric optimization the performance of the model in karst hydrological process simulations is verified in this verification the evaluation index of the simulation effect includes the correlation coefficient relative flow process error flood peak error and peak time difference and the water balance coefficient the uncertainty of the model simulation results is mainly based on three aspects 1 uncertainty of the model input data such as rainfall and flow data and more critically hydrogeological data which are more difficult to obtain in karst areas than in non karst areas 2 uncertainty of the model structure itself which is caused by systematic errors of the mathematical physical model 3 uncertainty of the model parameter optimization in this paper an improved pso algorithm chen et al 2016 which has been proven to effectively reduce the uncertainty of parameter transfer for distributed hydrological models is used to optimize the parameters of the model li et al 2017 2019 chen et al 2017 in addition the uncertainty of the model parameters can also be reduced by evaluating the sensitivity of the parameters in this study a multiparametric sensitivity analysis algorithm choi et al 1999 li et al 2019a 2019b is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters in the kthm where the nash sutcliffe coefficient is adopted as the objective function for the model calibration considering runoff simulation and forecasting especially flood event forecasting the simulation results of the flood peak flow are the most commonly used so the minimum relative error of simulated peak flow is taken to calculate the nash sutcliffe coefficient in this study 15 e 1 i 1 n q i q i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 where e is the value of the nash sutcliffe coefficient qi and qi are the observed and simulated peak flows respectively l s 1 q is the average observed peak flow l s 1 and n is the number of observations the procedure for parameter sensitivity analysis of the kthm involves the following steps 1 the initial parameter value range is set to 0 2 3 0 according to the parameter properties the convergence condition for parameter optimization is set to 10 4 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient threshold value is set to 0 9 2 three thousand groups of initial parameter sets for each model parameter are acquired based on the monte carlo sampling method in the model li et al 2019a 2019b 3 the flow process is simulated by using these three thousand groups of parameters in the kthm and the nash coefficients for each simulation are recorded 4 these nash coefficient values are compared with the threshold of 0 9 if a coefficient is greater than 0 9 then it is considered an acceptable value otherwise it is considered an unacceptable value 5 evaluating the degree of dispersion of the acceptable and unacceptable values implies the sensitivity of each model parameter 3 3 model setup the model setting mainly refers to some initial value ranges and conditional assumptions before the simulation calculation including the following points 1 the initial soil moisture is set to 20 90 of the saturated soil water content during floods however the most suitable soil moisture content within this range in the early stage of flood needs to be determined by many model runs 2 the groundwater divide and initial water head are determined by tracer experiments and flow field analysis of the karst aquifers in the study area in the tunnel submodule this groundwater divide is the boundary of the complete hydrogeological unit across which the tunnel passes in the dry season the flow in karst conduits in the tunnel site area is small so the tunnels in this study area can be used as temporary dynamic head boundaries 3 the flow direction and distribution of underground rivers in the study area are also deduced by tracer experiments where the water level and flow are monitored in real time by an automatic water station at the outlet of the underground river the river base flow is 60 l s 1 according to the perennial average dry season runoff 4 the initial value range of the model parameters must be set to optimize the parameters 5 the dem land use soil and flow data are input to the kthm to verify its performance in karst hydrological simulations the hydrological effects of tunnel drainage can be determined through the simulated water volume difference between the khm without the tunnel submodule and the kthm according to the characteristics of karst development in the underlying rocks of the basin 1267 karst subbasin units including 372 river cells 836 hill slope cells and 59 reservoir cells are identified based on the 15 m 15 m dem the bottom plate of the tunnel submodule is set to an elevation of 0 m in the simulations and its dimensions are a length of 4035 m and a thickness of 8 m the karst aquifer in the tunnel site area is generalized as cuboid units fig 3 where they are divided into 179 layers 465 rows and 625 columns 4 results 4 1 results of the parametric sensitivity analysis the parameter sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the sensitivity of each parameter and determine the highly sensitive moderately sensitive and insensitive parameters in the kthm in parametric optimization only highly and moderately sensitive parameters must be optimized and insensitive parameters do not require optimization thus the efficiency of the model calculation can be considerably improved the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters is calculated by eq 15 where flood peak flow is used as the state variable in the parameter sensitivity analysis and the results are listed in table 3 the results of the parameter sensitivity in table 3 show that the calculated values are all between 0 and 1 the closer the value is to 1 the greater the sensitivity of the parameter we set calculated value intervals to categorize the sensitivity of parameters a calculated value between 0 7 and 1 is considered a highly sensitive parameter the calculated value of a moderately sensitive parameter is between 0 45 and 0 7 and a calculated value less than 0 45 is considered insensitive therefore the highly sensitive parameters in the kthm are the infiltration coefficient ic permeability coefficient k rock porosity rp saturated water content sc field capacity fc specific yield sy and flow direction fd the insensitive parameters are the attenuation coefficient ac potential evaporation ep and wilting coefficient wc the remaining model parameters are moderately sensitive the order of parameter sensitivity is as follows infiltration coefficient ic permeability coefficient k rock porosity rp saturated water content sc field capacity fc specific yield sy flow direction fd thickness h slope s0 channel roughness n evaporation coefficient λ attenuation coefficient ac potential evaporation ep wilting coefficient wc 4 2 results of model parametric optimization twenty flow processes and two annual runoffs are chosen to verify the results of the kthm hydrological simulations in karst among them four flows including flows 201804210800 201809100345 201905261200 and 201907261200 are selected for model parametric optimization and floods with the optimal simulation effect are used for the final parameter optimization these four typical flow processes can basically represent all flow conditions in the research area where flow 201804210800 represents dry season runoff flows 201809100345 and 201905261200 represent normal runoff and flow 201907261200 represents flood runoff the remaining flows are used to validate the performance of the kthm the kthm has a total of 15 parameters among which only the 10 parameters with high and moderate sensitivities need to be optimized the parametric optimization results of the kthm are shown in fig 4 the parametric optimization results in fig 4 illustrate that the model parameters and their objective functions converge after 20 iterations and that the sensitivities of the parameters remain constant after 60 iterations which implies that the computational efficiency of the model is very high to verify the simulation effects of the model on different hydrological processes dry season runoff normal runoff and flood events are used to calibrate the model parameters in this study fig 5 shows the flow simulation effects based on the parameter optimization in fig 5 the simulated effects based on the kthm are satisfactory for all the hydrological processes and the kthm performs better than the khm in runoff simulations especially the simulated peak flows which demonstrates that the tunnel submodule in the kthm is effective the good simulation results indicate that the improved pso algorithm chosen in the parametric optimization of the kthm is feasible the results from the simulations of the four flows in fig 5 show that the best simulated effect is obtained for normal flow 201905261200 the overall simulation effect of this multipeak flood is the best therefore the parameter results corresponding to flow 201905261200 are used as the optimal parameter set to simulate and verify the remaining nineteen flow processes and 2 annual runoffs to further verify the results of parameter optimization five evaluation indices for the simulated flow effects including the correlation coefficient the relative flow process error the flood peak error and its peak time difference and the water balance coefficient are calculated and listed in table 4 the simulated flow effects in table 4 reveal that compared with the performance of the khm the kthm presents more accurate results and superior evaluation indices from flow simulations with the kthm the correlation coefficient increases by 14 the relative flow process error decreases by 9 the flood peak error decreases by 12 the water balance coefficient decreases by 27 and the peak time error decreases by 2 h compared to the results of the khm the best simulated evaluation indices are obtained for normal flow 201905261200 which is the same result as shown in fig 5 4 3 model validation in runoff simulations during the year nineteen flow processes during the year including floods normal runoff and dry season runoff at the outlet of the underground river are used to verify the performance of the kthm to describe the effects of the tunnel submodule in the model the flow simulation results determined by the khm and kthm are compared in fig 6 however only six of the flow process simulation results are shown here due to space limitations among them each has two flows representing flood runoff normal runoff and dry season runoff the simulated flow results in fig 6 illustrate that the simulated flow processes based on the kthm are much more accurate than those based on the khm the flow simulation values of the khm are larger than the observed values while the flow values simulated by the kthm are very close to the observed values these results are consistent with those of the four flows used in parametric optimization and confirm that adding the tunnel submodule to the khm to develop the kthm is necessary to further compare the simulated flow results based on the khm and kthm five evaluation indices of all nineteen flows are used to assess the simulated effects as listed in table 5 in table 5 the average values of the correlation coefficient relative flow process error flood peak error water balance coefficient and peak flow time error based on the khm are 0 73 29 30 1 16 and 6 h respectively whereas the average values of these five evaluation indices based on the kthm are 0 95 11 6 0 94 and 3 h respectively these findings indicate that all the evaluation indices from the kthm are more accurate than those from the khm thus the tunnel submodule designed in the model is effective and the kthm proposed in this study is feasible for flow simulations in karst areas the difference between the water amounts simulated by the khm and kthm represents the water loss caused by tunnel engineering in the study area the simulated water volume can be determined by the area enclosed by the flow process lines and the time axes table 6 shows the calculated results of the water volume difference between the khm and the kthm in a year in table 6 the differential ratio refers to the ratio of the difference between the simulated peak flow or total flood volume of the models to the observed value this value is the proportion of water loss caused by the tunnels of the observed water volume which reflects the influence of the tunnels on the water volume of the runoff at the underground river outlet the results in table 6 show that the peak flows and water amounts simulated by the khm are larger than the observed values while the simulated values of the kthm are close to the observed values the average differential ratios for the flood peak flow and the flood water volume are 16 and 12 the simulated peak flow and water volume of the normal runoff are 25 and 21 of the observed values whereas simulated peak flow and water volume of the dry season runoff are 29 and 24 these findings indicate that the influence of a tunnel is greater on the peak flow than on the water volume and that a tunnel has the greatest influence on the dry season runoff and the least influence on the flood runoff among the runoff categories moreover the sensitivity of the hydrological effects of tunnels follows the order of water volume of dry season runoff normal runoff volume flood peak flow flood volume 4 4 interannual runoff simulation results runoff during the year is divided into flood dry season runoff and normal runoff according to the amount of water the kthm works well for runoff simulations throughout a year to further validate the performance of the new kthm for interannual runoff simulations 2 annual runoffs 2018 and 2019 are simulated by the kthm in this study fig 7 shows the flow simulated effects by the khm and kthm and table 7 lists their evaluation indices the results of the 2 annual runoff simulations from the khm and kthm shown in fig 7 and table 7 indicate that the kthm results are more accurate for interannual runoff simulations than the khm results in particular the simulation effects of almost every peak flow in the annual flow processes by the kthm are very close to the observed values and the average value of the simulated peak flow error is only 8 in contrast the simulation effect of the khm for each peak flow is poor the simulated value is much larger than the observed value with an average simulated peak flow error of 32 thus the tunnel submodule designed in the kthm is effective and necessary this finding is consistent with the results previously discussed in section 4 3 to describe the impact of tunnel engineering on the water volume of interannual runoff the water volume of 2 annual runoffs is simulated by the khm and kthm and listed in table 8 table 8 shows that the water volumes of the interannual runoff simulated by the khm are larger than those of the observed values and that the average relative error between the simulated value and the observed value is 13 however the interannual runoff volume simulated by the kthm is more accurate and the average relative error is only 6 moreover the average differential ratio is 19 with the kthm a comparison of the results of the effect of a tunnel on the flow processes within a year table 6 shows that the influence the tunnel on the flow processes within a year is greater than that of the interannual runoff 5 discussion 5 1 effects of tunnel excavation on groundwater flow processes the simulated runoff results during the year fig 6 and the annual runoff fig 7 show that the flow processes at the outlet of the underground river simulated by the khm and the kthm are reliable moreover the flow process lines of the simulations by the khm and kthm are generally consistent with the observed values however the average relative flow process error p of simulated runoff during the year is 29 with the khm and 11 with the kthm table 5 and the interannual runoff is 24 with the khm and 15 with the kthm table 7 in addition the hydrological effects of tunnel engineering on the flow processes are considerable as indicated by the relative error between the flow processes simulated by the khm and the observed processes this result is reliable because the khm and the kthm are actually the same model and the only difference is that a tunnel submodule is not included in the khm since the simulation results of the same model are compared the systematic errors inside the model can be ignored the influence of tunnel engineering in karst areas on flow processes is also reflected in flood detention during a flood tunnel drainage removes some of the water that should be discharged from the underground river outlet thus leading to a time lag of the flood peak in table 5 the peak time errors t with the khm and kthm are 6 and 3 h respectively these findings show that the tunnels in the study area caused the flood peak of the underground river to appear 3 h later the flood detention effect of tunnels should be considered in future flood forecasting in the research area 5 2 effects of tunnel excavation on groundwater quantity the hydrological effects of tunnelling on runoff mainly occur through the influence of tunnel engineering on runoff quantity the results of 19 flow processes and 2 annual runoffs simulated with the khm and the kthm show that the simulated values of floods normal runoff and dry season runoff as well as 2 annual runoffs are larger than the observed values when utilizing the khm while those simulated values by the kthm are basically consistent with the observations tables 6 and 8 this difference is because the khm does not consider tunnel drainage in the study area therefore according to the principle of water balance some of the water that should drain from the tunnels is added to the flow at the outlet of the underground river as a result the flows simulated by the khm are larger than the observed values when the tunnel submodule is added in the kthm to simulate the flow processes the simulated values are completely consistent with the observed values this finding indicates that the calculation of the actual water volume of the basin in the kthm is basically balanced however the kthm underestimates the flood runoff normal runoff table 6 and interannual runoff table 8 but overestimates the dry season runoff table 6 the errors of water quantity overestimation or underestimation are not large and thus may be caused by the systematic error of the model the simulation results for runoff during a year table 6 and interannual runoff table 8 show that the influence of the tunnels on the peak flow is greater than that on its water volume in addition the influence of tunnel engineering in karst areas on the runoff quantity during a year is greater than that of interannual runoff this is because the simulation results of the interannual runoff balance the water volume difference between the flood and dry season runoff the results in table 6 show that tunnels in karst areas have the greatest influence on the water volume of runoff in the dry season 24 and the least influence on flood runoff 12 this is because the shape and size of the tunnels are fixed the corresponding drainage is usually fixed within a certain range and the water loss by tunnels accounts for a large proportion in the dry season runoff decreasing the dry season runoff in contrast tunnel water loss accounts for a small proportion of the flood water volume and has little impact on it the sensitivity sequence of hydrological effects of tunnels is as follows water volume of dry season runoff normal runoff volume water volume of interannual runoff flood peak flow flood volume in summary tunnel engineering in the study area has a great influence on natural karst runoff tunnels can reduce the discharge flow at the underground river outlet and delay the occurrence time of peak discharge tunnels have a great influence on runoff during the dry season and the underground rivers in this area were initially perennial however these rivers were cut off seasonally after tunnel construction tunnel excavation also leads to serious surface water leakage and groundwater drainage problems in the study area a large area of paddy fields is now abandoned dry land local residents have to drill wells more than 117 m deep to obtain a reasonable water supply a certain range of karst rocky desertification forms due to surface water leakage tunnel engineering in karst areas has caused almost irreversible damage to the originally fragile karst water system and ecological environment 5 3 uncertainty analysis of simulation results the uncertainty of the model simulation results is due to mainly the following three aspects first there may be uncertainties in the acquisition mode and data reliability of the model input data in particular it is difficult to obtain reliable hydrogeological data in karst areas regarding the meteorological hydrological and geological data used to build the kthm in this study three types of reviews must be conducted before the values are input into the model a reliability review of data sources and consistency and representative evaluations of the data for the pretreatment process for these data our previous research results can be referenced li et al 2019a 2019b second as a mathematical physical model the distributed hydrological model structure may be uncertain due to systematic errors which are mainly reduced by simplifying the model structure and improving the algorithm for instance the underground confluence module is divided into only two layers the confluence of the epikarst zone and the underground river system and the algorithms of slow and rapid flow in karst water bearing media are improved effectively eqs 12 14 third uncertainty arises during model parameter optimization there are many parameters in a distributed hydrological model which leads to some uncertainty in parameter optimization in this study we reduce the uncertainty of model parameters in two ways first an improved pso algorithm is used to automatically optimize the model parameters which can reduce the uncertainty of parameter transfer in the model effectively second parametric sensitivity analysis is performed to reduce uncertainty we calculate the sensitivity of each parameter of the kthm in detail table 3 and the sensitivity of the model parameters is divided into highly sensitive moderately sensitive and insensitive when parameters are optimized only the highly and moderately sensitive parameters need to be calculated while the insensitive parameters do not need to be optimized which improves the computational efficiency of the model from the results of the parametric sensitivity analysis in section 4 1 the parameters related to the infiltration characteristics and karst water bearing medium are highly sensitive while the model parameters associated with evapotranspiration and wilting coefficient are not sensitive this shows that the karst hydrogeological characteristics especially those of an anisotropic karst aquifer have the greatest influence on the parameters of the distributed hydrological model which controls the movement and transformation of infiltration water in karst water bearing media however parameters such as evapotranspiration in the basin are insensitive indicating that the water loss by evaporation has little influence on the quantity of water at the underground river outlet in the study area especially during the flood season and that the proportion of evapotranspiration from the flood water is very small by evaluating the uncertainty of the model simulation results the errors of the hydrological simulation in the model karst can be greatly reduced and the accuracy can be well improved the kthm developed in this study is applicable in the study area and the mechanism of this kthm is suitable for performing hydrological simulation of a variety of karst landforms because the runoff generation and confluence module in the model includes the excess infiltration runoff and runoff generation under saturated conditions eqs 10 and 11 when the model is applied to exposed karst areas the rainfall runoff can be calculated by using the excess infiltration runoff module while in buried karst basins it can be described by runoff generation under saturated conditions the results of this study provide a good tool for the hydrological simulation and hydrological effect analysis of tunnels in karst areas 6 conclusions tunnel engineering in the study area has a great impact on the natural karst hydrological process according to the field survey therefore building a hydrological model to stimulate the hydrological effects of tunnels is necessary however the complicated underlying surface conditions and heterogeneous aquifer interactions in the study area pose great challenges for the application of hydrological models and make it difficult to accurately describe the water movement and transformation in karst water bearing media in addition the current distributed hydrological models usually need a considerable amount of hydrogeological data when used in karst areas due to the variety of structures and range of parameters to overcome the challenge of applying a distributed model in the study area a new fully distributed kthm is proposed in this study to investigate the hydrological effects of tunnels the following conclusions are based on the research results 1 the parameters related to the infiltration and karst water bearing medium in the kthm are highly sensitive while those related to the evapotranspiration are insensitive the order of parameter sensitivity is as follows infiltration coefficient ic permeability coefficient k rock porosity rp saturated water content sc field capacity fc specific yield sy flow direction fd thickness h slope s0 channel roughness n evaporation coefficient λ attenuation coefficient ac potential evaporation ep wilting coefficient wc 2 the improved pso algorithm is effective for parametric optimization of the kthm and can considerably increase the computational efficiency of the model and the model parameters and their objective functions converge after only 20 iterations comparing the performances of the khm and kthm in flood simulations with parametric optimization the kthm is more accurate than the khm the correlation coefficient increases by 14 the relative flow process error decreases by 9 the flood peak error decreases by 12 the water balance coefficient decreases by 27 and the peak time error decreases by 2 h 3 the simulated flood results from the kthm are more accurate than those from the khm especially the simulated peak flows the 5 evaluation indices improve considerably when the kthm is used the average values of the correlation coefficient relative flow process error flood peak error water balance coefficient and peak flow time error based on the khm are 0 73 29 30 1 16 and 6 h respectively whereas the average values of these five evaluation indices based on the kthm are 0 95 11 6 0 94 and 3 h respectively clearly the evaluation indices of the kthm indicate that this approach is considerably more accurate the khm suggesting that the tunnel submodule is effective and that the kthm proposed in this study is feasible for performing flood simulations in the study area 4 the water volume difference between the khm and the kthm represents the water loss caused by the tunnels in the study area the simulated water difference indicates that tunnel engineering in the study area has a great influence on the runoff at the outlet of underground rivers the influence on the runoff during a year is greater than that of interannual runoff and its influence on the peak flow is greater than that on its water volume in the study area tunnels have the greatest impact on runoff during the dry season by reducing the runoff volume which leads to seasonal interruptions in underground river flow tunnels have little influence on flood runoff the sensitivity sequence of the hydrological effects of tunnelling is as follows water volume of dry season runoff normal runoff volume water volume of interannual runoff flood peak flow flood volume 5 these reasonable flow simulation results in the study area show that the kthm model developed in this paper is feasible for karst hydrology simulation and that the tunnel submodule in the model can effectively describe the drainage of tunnels because of the simple structure of this kthm it is easy to build models to represent other karst basins with tunnels similar to the zhongliangshan karst basin therefore this model has great application potential in karst areas considering that several additional tunnel projects will be constructed in the research area this kthm can be built in advance to predict the possible drainage conditions of the tunnel which will be very helpful for the tunnel engineering design and can provide strong theoretical and data support 7 data availability all data used in this paper are available

4986,infiltration is of great concern in many fields like hydrology agriculture as well as geotechnical and geological engineering this study aims to investigate water infiltration in a cracked soil infiltration tests were conducted on compacted soil samples with different cracking degrees by drying to various water contents three drying wetting cycles were applied experimental results show that no desiccation cracks are observed in the first drying process while cracks initiate and propagate in the second and third drying processes different from the infiltration curve of the non cracked soil sample consisting of two distinct stages that of the cracked soil consists of three distinct stages representing constant rapid reduction and gradual reduction in infiltration rate respectively a modified equation is proposed to describe the infiltration behavior of a cracked soil considering the prehealing time of cracks furthermore it is found that for the tested soil 4 of surface crack ratio is a critical value when surface crack ratio is smaller than the critical value its influence on infiltration capacity is insignificant afterwards the infiltration capacity increases dramatically with increasing surface crack ratio based on this observation a piecewise function is proposed to characterize the relationship between the normalized infiltration capacity of cracked soil and surface crack ratio infiltration capacity also increases with decreasing initial water content and increasing number of drying wetting cycles in terms of steady final infiltration rate it increases with increasing initial water content as well as increasing number of drying wetting cycles but is not affected by desiccation cracking keywords drying wetting cycle infiltration rate desiccation cracking water content clayey soil 1 introduction infiltration the process of water penetration into soil is a key process in many aspects in hydrology infiltration is part of the terrestrial water cycle linking overland flow and groundwater recharge liu et al 2019 in agriculture infiltration is of particular interest with respect to the surface irrigation pandey and pandey 1982 in geotechnical and geological engineering infiltration is closely related to soil erosion slope stability and many other problems rodriguez iturbe et al 2007 rahardjo et al 2010 many researchers have paid attention to infiltration and found that it can be influenced by different factors including water supply rate chemical compositions of both water and soil temperature boundary conditions soil density spatial distribution of the hydraulic properties within the soil profile and so on baker 1979 diskin and nazimov 1996 loague and gander 1990 ng and zhan 2003 su 2010 corradini et al 2000 2011 assouline 2013 wang et al 2017 demand et al 2019 investigation on the infiltration laws is of great importance in guiding scientific research and practical design in the above mentioned disciplines desiccation cracking is a common phenomenon in clayey soils thanks to the water loss in the drought climate morris et al 1992 tang et al 2008 vardon 2015 zeng et al 2020 under drying condition water evaporation from soil results in an initiation of tensile stress once the tensile stress increases with decreasing water content and exceeds the tensile strength of soil desiccation cracking may develop tang et al 2011 cheng et al 2020 many studies have shown that desiccation cracking depends upon a large number of factors mineral composition fine content temperature boundary conditions relative humidity drying wetting cycles sample size etc morris et al 1992 miller et al 1998 yesiller et al 2000 rodríguez et al 2007 tang et al 2008 2011 decarlo and shokri 2014 tollenaar et al 2017 lakshmikantha et al 2018 levatti et al 2019 the open voids of cracks can be beneficial for the budding seeds to break through and further growth scott et al 1988 weisbrod et al 2009 more importantly the development of desiccation cracking may have some negative influence on the hydrological regimes and geotechnical engineering as it has a significant influence on the mechanical and hydraulic properties of soils morris et al 1992 miller et al 1998 yesiller et al 2000 albrecht and benson 2001 rayhani et al 2007 tang et al 2008 lozada et al 2015 the desiccation cracks can reduce the soil strength and make the soil become more compressible in pavement engineering the weakened mechanical properties of subsoil induced by cracks may reduce the long term performance of the roadways decarlo and shokri 2014 guo et al 2018 moreover the desiccation cracks can provide preferential pathways for rainfall infiltration and gas emission the crack induced preferential pathways in landfill cover system may result in ground water pollution as well as air pollution mckay et al 1993 romkens and prasad 2006 tang et al 2019 it may also lead to catastrophic failures of levees and dikes which severely impacts the economy and environment mckay et al 1993 van baars 2005 aghakouchak et al 2015 robinson and vahedifard 2016 in terms of water infiltration in cracked soils it is expected that different cracking degrees will have impact in the infiltration the cracking degree can be quantitative analysed by some methods like image analysis and fractal analysis miller et al 1998 volgel et al 2005 tang et al 2008 lakshmikantha et al 2009 li and zhang 2011 liu et al 2013a 2013b lu et al 2016 previous studies have found that water content is a key factor affecting the development of cracks in natural condition there is periodic dry and wet climate gens 2010 tang et al 2011 burton et al 2015 he et al 2017 crack initiation and propagation is also closely related to the drying wetting cycles for a given soil tested under a certain environmental condition the cracking degree increases with decreasing water content and increasing number of drying wetting cycles tang et al 2011 however experimental investigation on quantitative influence of desiccation cracking on water infiltration in soils is limited so far most of previous studies on this topic are focused on theoretical and numerical methods pandey and pandey 1982 chertkov and ravina 2001 wang et al 2019 the principle objective of this study is to investigate water infiltration in a cracked soil considering the effect of drying wetting cycles a series of infiltration tests were conducted on compacted soil samples with different cracking degrees induced by drying to various water contents i e 25 23 21 19 17 15 and 13 three drying wetting cycles were applied to simulate the natural conditions of rainfall and evaporation the development of crack pattern along the drying process in each cycle was quantified in this study the cracking degree is represented by the crack images at the top surface of soil samples effects of desiccation cracking and drying wetting cycles on infiltration were analysed 2 materials and methods 2 1 testing material and sample preparation the testing material in this study is pukou soil from the nanjing china it widely distributes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the fractions of sand silt and clay are 24 34 and 41 respectively the plastic and liquid limits are 29 1 and 76 4 respectively the maximum dry density and optimum water content are 1 69 g cm3 and 18 3 respectively the physical properties are summarized in table 1 according to the unified soil classification system astm d 2487 2017 the test soil is classified as a fat clay ch the tested soil was air dried crushed using a rubber pestle and passed through a 2 mm sieve after air drying the water content of the soil is about 4 then a desired amount of de aired water was added to reach the target water content of 25 after that the soil was sealed inside a plastic bag for 48 h to ensure the moisture equalization static compaction was adopted to prepare the compacted soil samples the sample size was 50 mm in diameter and 100 mm in height and the dry density was controlled to be 1 30 g cm3 which is close to the dry density of surface soil in the field each soil sample was statically compacted in four layers in total 63 samples were prepared in this study 2 2 testing apparatus a flexible wall permeameter was utilised to conduct the infiltration tests as shown in fig 1 a a confining pressure of 50 kpa was applied in each infiltration test to avoid the side wall leakage which is commonly observed when using rigid wall permeameter samingan et al 2003 the hydraulic head gradient can be applied by making a difference between the top water pressure and bottom water pressure the water flow in out was continuously monitored until reaching a steady state condition the equilibrium state can be considered to be attained when the inflow rate was approximately equal to the outflow rate in this study the constant head method is adopted in the infiltration tests and the hydraulic head gradient is kept at 15 kpa the infiltration rate i at any time interval t is calculated by the following equation 1 i t dv d t a where dv is the volume change of water infiltrated within a given time dt a is cross sectional area of the soil sample 2 3 testing procedure the compacted soil samples with initial water content of 25 were subjected to three drying wetting cycles under room temperature 20 2 c as illustrated in fig 1 b during the first drying process a series of target water contents i e 25 23 21 19 17 15 and 13 were set in order to obtain soil samples with different cracking degrees when each of the target water content was reached three parallel samples were collected and sealed using a plastic wrap and kept for 48 h for moisture equalization then the plastic wrap was removed and the soil sample was setting up in the flexible wall permeameter for infiltration test during drying when the final target water content of 13 was reached the rest of samples were dry to the residual water content about 4 the next step was to saturate the soil sample by placed in a rigid mold 50 mm in diameter and 100 mm in height and submerged in de aired water under the state of vacuum for 48 h the water content of each sample at saturation was about 40 after saturation the samples were taken out and a second drying process was applied similarly several samples with various target water contents as the same with the first dying path were collected and subjected to infiltration tests after that the wetting drying cycle was repeated again fig 1 b in this study the water content during drying path was monitored by weighting the soil sample at regular intervals moreover before setting up in the flexible wall permeameter the images of the soil top surface were taken by using a digital camera for quantitative analysis of desiccation cracks 2 4 cracking image analysis a software crack image analysis system cias available at www climate engeo com is adopted for the quantitative analysis of the crack images some image pre processing steps including grayscale binalization denoising skeletonising and crack identification are conducted before quantitative analysis in the following section analysing results of surface crack ratio number of cracks and average crack width are reported more details of the procedure of the quantitative cracking image analysis are reported by tang et al 2008 and liu et al 2013 it should be noted that with elapsed drying time soil sample shrinks and the diameter of soil sample becomes less than 50 mm when determining the surface crack ratio the edge shrinkage area of each soil sample has not be taken into consideration which is different from previous studies tang et al 2008 2011 cheng et al 2020 this is because the soil sample in the flexible wall permeameter is covered by a membrane and the edge shrinkage has no influence on the water infiltration 2 5 calculation of normalized infiltration capacity in order to eliminate the influence of initial water content infiltration capacity of a cracked soil sample with a given initial water content q 0 c is normalized by that of a non cracked soil sample with the same given initial water content q 0 nc noted that q 0 nc is related to the soil type and density of the soil sample a smaller density represents a larger q 0 nc the normalized infiltration capacity of the non cracked soil sample is equal to 1 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 soil desiccation cracking behaviour and the effect of wetting drying cycles during the first drying process no cracks are observed on the soil surface by naked eyes however in the second and third drying processes obvious desiccation cracking phenomenon occurs this is likely because the first drying is started from the compaction water content while the subsequent drying processes start after the soil sample is fully saturated moreover before the first drying the soil structure is relatively homogenous and only shrinkage is observed during the first drying moreover the volume change during drying and wetting results in a decrease in soil integrity and an increase in weak zones in soil samples yong and warkentin 1975 these weak zones may trigger development of cracks weinberger 1999 tang et al 2008 fig 2 shows the typical crack images at the top surface of soil samples at selected water contents during the second and third drying with water evaporation under drying condition matric suction is developed at the corresponding time the suction dependent tensile stress increases once the tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of the soil desiccation cracks may initiate tang et al 2011 it is interesting to found that the cracks initiated at the boundaries are almost perpendicular to the tangent direction pointing to the centre of the soil sample this is attributed to the boundary effect tang et al 2011 cui et al 2014 the soil shrinkage during the drying process results in a separation away from the vertical walls of the mold and creates cracks along the boundary direction then the strain energy is released and the maximum tensile stress direction induced by shrinkage is parallel to the tangent direction as the propagation direction of desiccation crack is always perpendicular to the maximum tensile stress the cracks are pointing to the centre of the soil sample as observed moreover in each drying process with decreasing water content the cracks gradually initiate and widen at a given water content there are more thin cracks in the third drying process compared with the second drying images showing development of desiccation cracking have been quantitatively analysed surface crack ratio which is defined as the ratio of the surface area of cracks to the total surface area of soil sample is an important parameter to describe the cracking degree fig 3 a shows the evolution of surface crack ratio with decreasing water content during the second and third drying processes as can be seen from the figure during the second drying process surface crack ratio increases by about twice from 2 6 to 5 1 when water content decreases from 25 to 13 with continuous decrease in water content the cracks propagate resulting in an increase in surface crack ratio the evolution of surface cracking ratio during the third drying process shows a different trend compared with that during the second drying surface crack ratio increases from 2 6 to 5 6 when drying from 25 to 15 followed by a slight reduction to 4 4 when further drying to water content of 13 the reduction in surface crack ratio can be attributed to the drying induced soil bulk volume shrinkage tang et al 2019 moreover it is found that at a given water content the surface crack ratio in the third drying process is always larger than that in the second drying process the change of number of cracks during the drying processes is shown in fig 3 b the numbers of cracks in both second and third drying processes show an increasing trend and the number of cracks in the third drying process is about 2 5 times as that in the second one on average in the third drying process when drying to water content of 17 the number of cracks becomes almost unchanged while the surface crack ratio keeps increasing this is because when the crack pattern is formed further drying results in a widening of existing cracks tang et al 2011 cheng et al 2020 in the third drying with further drying from water content of 17 to 13 the number of cracks keeps increasing the increase of number of cracks in the later stage is due to the initiation of many thin and fine cracks as pointed by tang et al 2011 drying wetting cycles make the initially homogeneous non aggregated structure convert to a heterogeneous aggregated structure creating many inter aggregate pores theses inter aggregate pores are acting as weak zones and affect the cracks during the subsequent drying period yong and warkentin 1975 cheng et al 2020 in terms of average crack width it almost doubles during the second drying process from water content of 25 to 13 as shown in fig 3 c however in the third drying process the average crack width increases dramatically from about 0 4 to 1 0 when drying from water content of 25 21 with further drying to water content of 13 the average crack width starts to decrease as more thin and fine cracks initiate 3 2 effect of desiccation cracking and wetting drying cycles on infiltration fig 4 a depicts the evolution of infiltration rate of soil samples at various water contents in the first drying process with elapsed time it can be found that at a given time the infiltration rate increases with decreasing initial water content for the soil sample at each initial water content the infiltration rate decreases with elapsed wetting time and finally reaches an equilibrium state and the changing rate of the infiltration rate the slope of the curve also show a decreasing trend with elapsed time in the semi log plane the infiltration curve can be regards as two distinct stages one is for rapid decrease in infiltration rate with time and the other is for infiltration rate to slowly decrease and finally reach the equilibrium state the majority of infiltration equations used today were based either on the diffusion equation or empirical formulation su 2010 a widely adopted empirical equation in hydrology to describe the evolution of infiltration rate is proposed by horton 1933 2 q t q f q 0 q f e α t where q is the infiltration rate at a certain time q f is the steady final infiltration rate q 0 is the initial infiltration rate t is the time α is a decay constant this equation is adopted to describe the infiltration curves shown in fig 4 a and the fitted value of α of each soil sample has been listed in table 2 it can be found that with decreasing initial water content from 25 to 13 the value of α decreases by about 72 from 8 42 to 2 36 that is to say the decay constant is influenced by the initial water content the infiltration curves of soil samples at various initial water contents in the second drying process with elapsed time show a different pattern as shown in fig 4 b compared with those in the first drying process the infiltration curve can be regarded as consisting of three distinct stages the infiltration rate keeps almost constant for a certain period of time at the early stage this is because the initiation of desiccation cracking provides a preferential pathway for water infiltration wang et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 resulting in a sustained period of relatively rapid infiltration then the infiltration rate starts to dramatically decrease followed by a gradually decrease before reaching the final equilibrium value this can be contributed to the crack closure induced by increasing water content chertkov and ravina 2001 liu et al 2013a 2013b qi et al 2020 for the soil samples at each initial water content the infiltration rate in the second drying process is over ten times larger than that in the first drying similar results are found in the third drying process as shown in fig 4 c equation 2 cannot capture the above mentioned phenomenon as there is no consideration of desiccation cracking and drying wetting cycles thus based on the previous results equation 2 is suggested to be modified to characterize this phenomenon 3 q t q 0 t t c q f q 0 q f e α t t c t t c where t c is the period for crack to gradually heal prehealing time as illustrated in fig 4 b it should be noted that t c is related to the degree of cracking development with a larger crack ratio t c is larger and vice versa as showing in table 2 for a given soil type with increasing number of drying wetting cycles at a given initial water content the value of α decreases moreover in the second and third drying process with decreasing initial water content from 25 to 13 the value of α decreases by about 31 and 25 respectively this illustrates that in addition to initial water content both the cracking degree and number of drying wetting cycles plays a role in the decay constant fig 5 shows the effect of drying wetting cycles on infiltration curve of soil samples at selected initial water contents i e 25 19 and 13 as the number of drying wetting cycles goes up at a given initial water content and a given time the infiltration rate increases this can be attributed to the increase in surface crack ratio with increasing number of drying wetting cycles in addition structure degradation induced by drying wetting cycles also contributes drying wetting cycles make the soil structure change from a non aggregated structure to an aggregated one and create many large size inter aggregate pores tang et al 2011 which accelerate the water infiltration moreover with decreasing initial water content the difference in infiltration curve in between the second and third drying becomes less obvious infiltration capacity which is defined as the maximal rate at which the soil sample can absorb water is an important parameter to evaluate the water infiltration assouline 2013 if the water supply exceeds the infiltration capacity only part of water can infiltrate and the rest may pond on the soil surface in this study with the selected confining stress and water head the water supply is larger than the infiltration capacity besides as the water content and cracking keeps changing the infiltration capacity is not a constant for each soil sample for simplicity the initial infiltration rate of soil samples at each water content in each drying process is regarded as the corresponding infiltration capacity effect of initial water content on infiltration capacity is shown in fig 6 a it can be found that with increasing number of drying wetting cycles the infiltration capacity increases and the effect of initial water content on the infiltration rate becomes more obvious this is contributed to the development of desiccation cracking in the drying wetting cycles for the tested soil in the testing water content range the infiltration capacity can be enhanced by 5 to 16 times in the past numerical studies the effect of cracking on infiltration capacity has been widely investigated for example novák et al 2000 developed a fracture model and found that the infiltration capacity of a cracked soil is about 66 larger than that of a non cracked soil this suggests that numerical methods may underestimate effect of cracking on infiltration capacity in the first drying process the infiltration capacity triples when drying from water content of 25 to 13 while in the second and third drying in the same water content range more significant rises of infiltration capacity can be observed 7 5 times and 5 times respectively in other words effect of initial water content on the infiltration capacity is strengthened by the effect of cracking induced by drying wetting cycles moreover for non cracked soil the hysteresis effect results in lower infiltration and less movement of water through the soil bashir et al 2016 however as the desiccation cracks can provide preferential pathways for water infiltration the hysteresis effect is not pronounced on water infiltration in cracked soil details about effect of cracking on infiltration capacity are analysed in the next section the steady final infiltration rate is also an important parameter for evaluating the water infiltration fig 6 b depicts the effect of initial water content on steady final infiltration rate as can be seen from the figure in each drying process the steady final infiltration rate decreases with decreasing initial water content drying is always accompanied by soil shrinkage according to existing elasto plastic model e g alonso et al 1990 there is a positive relationship between the volume shrinkage and water content change thus the soil sample with a smaller initial water content has a larger density which may result in a smaller steady final infiltration rate at a given initial water content and a given time the steady final infiltration rate increases with increasing number of drying wetting cycles as the crack closes during the water infiltration the increase in steady final infiltration rate is due to the structure degradation induced by drying wetting cycles as discussed previously furthermore with increasing number of drying wetting cycles the effect of initial water content on steady final infiltration rate becomes more significant this is because the cumulative volume change of soil sample also increases with increasing cycles ng and zhou 2014 li et al 2018 even though in the second and third drying processes there are desiccation cracks observed in this study the surface cracks close completely during the water infiltration as the tested soil has a certain expansibility under wetting tang et al 2011 the wetting induced crack closure is also experimentally verified by qi et al 2020 they also pointed out that the crack closure degree is significantly influenced by the water supply rate under a relatively small water supply rate the cracks can only partially close which have an influence on the steady final infiltration rate density effect on the steady final infiltration rate may be compensated by the effect of non fully close cracks the time spent to reach the steady final infiltration rate is named as equilibrium time effect of initial water content on equilibrium time is shown in fig 6 c it can be found that in each drying process the equilibrium time increases with decreasing initial water content moreover at a given initial water content with increasing number of drying wetting cycles more cracks initiate and the equilibrium time also increases as more time is needed for crack closure 3 3 quantitative relationship between desiccation cracking and infiltration fig 7 shows the effect of desiccation cracking on normalized infiltration capacity as can be seen from the fig 7 a there is no obvious difference in the second and third drying processes a positive relationship between surface crack ratio and normalized infiltration capacity can be observed in other words in terms of the impact on infiltration capacity at a given initial water content desiccation cracking plays a more important role compared with drying wetting cycles moreover the relationship between normalized infiltration capacity and surface crack ratio can be regarded as two approximately linear segments when the surface crack ratio is smaller than 4 the normalized infiltration capacity slightly increases with increasing surface crack ratio when the surface crack ratio increases over 4 a dramatic increase in normalized infiltration capacity is observed this is likely because when the surface crack ratio is smaller than a certain value the degree of crack development inside the soil sample is relatively low and cracks may not penetrate the soil sample delerue et al 2003 tang et al 2019 the connection of crack network is not well built hence its influence on infiltration capacity is less significant zhang et al 2015 after that cracks may connect to each other and provide preferential flow paths contributing to the significant increase of infiltration capacity fig 7 a therefore the surface crack ratio of 4 is defined as the critical surface crack ratio r sc c related to soil infiltration behaviour for different kinds of soils the specific value of the critical surface crack ratio may be different based on the observed phenomenon the following equation is proposed to describe the effect of surface crack ratio on normalized infiltration capacity 4 q 0 c q 0 nc a r sc 1 r sc r sc c b r sc a b r sc c 1 r sc r sc c where r sc is the surface crack ratio a and b represent effect of surface crack ratio on infiltration capacity before and after the critical surface crack ratio r sc c moreover a and b are two soil parameters for the tested soil the values of a and b are 1 60 and 4 58 respectively fig 7 b shows that the normalized infiltration capacity increases linearly with increasing number of cracks for each additional crack the infiltration capacity of soil increased by about 21 however in terms of effect of average crack width shown in fig 7 c it seems that there is no clear relationship between average crack width and the infiltration capacity similarly steady final infiltration rate of a cracked soil sample with a given initial water content is normalized by that of a non cracked soil sample with the same given initial water content and the effect of surface crack ratio on normalized steady final infiltration rate is shown in fig 8 a it can be found that there is no obvious change in normalized steady final infiltration rate with surface crack ratio this is likely because when reaching the steady final infiltration rate the cracks close due to swelling of soil particles and slaking of soil clods during the water infiltration the observation is consistent with previous study conducted by liu et al 2013 they found that the surface crack ratio of a swelling soil enhanced only the infiltration capacity while had little influence on the steady final infiltration rate similar results can be found in fig 8 b and c that both number of cracks and average crack ratio do not affect the steady final infiltration rate as can be seen from fig 5 b and c the infiltration curve of cracked soil in the semi lop plane can be separated into three distinct stages the first stage represents that the infiltration rate keeps at a relative high value due to the wetting induced crack healing and water content change the infiltration rate starts to decrease which is represented by the second stage the last stage means that the infiltration rate tends to reach the steady final value the corresponding time of the intersection between the first and second stage is defined as the prehealing time of cracks as shown in fig 4 b fig 9 a and b illustrates the effects of surface crack ratio and number of cracks on the prehealing time of desiccation cracking respectively it can be found that in the second and third drying process the prehealing time increases almost linearly with increasing surface crack ratio and number of cracks however the changing rate of prehealing time with increasing surface crack ratio and number of cracks in the second drying process 0 30 h and 0 04 h is about ten times as large as that in the third drying process about 0 02 h and 0 004 h however average crack width is not a suitable quantitative parameter to be chosen for describing the effect of cracking degree on prehealing time as shown in fig 9 c it should be noted that in this study a certain soil type is chosen as the testing material the specific value of some parameters may vary according to the soil for example the prehealing time may be influenced by the soil type with increasing clay content the desiccation cracking phenomenon becomes more serious yesiller et al 2000 that is to say for a soil type with a higher clay content effects of desiccation cracking on water infiltration may be more significant and the prehealing time may be longer even so the research methods and understandings obtained in this paper are of referential significance for studying soils in other regions 4 conclusions water infiltration in a cracked soil considering effect of drying wetting cycles is investigated experimentally in this study different cracking degrees is obtained by drying the soil samples to various water contents and three drying wetting cycles are applied the development of surface crack is monitored and its influence on infiltration behaviour was quantitative analysed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in the first drying process there is no desiccation cracks in the second and third drying processes cracks initiate and propagate with decreasing water content moreover with increasing drying wetting cycles more cracks are observed as the drying wetting cycles result in a decrease in soil integrity and an increase in weak zones in soil samples 2 for the non cracked soil sample the infiltration curve in the semi log plane shows a two stage pattern the infiltration rate decreases dramatically first and then gradually slow down to reach an equilibrium state with elapsed wetting time however for the cracked soil sample a three stage infiltration curve can be observed a constant rapid infiltration is observed at the early wetting stage the corresponding time of the intersection between the first and second stage is defined as the prehealing time of cracks 3 a modified equation is proposed to describe the infiltration curve of a cracked soil based on the prehealing time of cracks as well as horton s equation 4 the infiltration capacity of soil contains cracks significantly depends on surface crack ratio when the surface crack ratio is smaller than a critical value its influence on normalized infiltration capacity is insignificant afterwards the normalized infiltration capacity increase dramatically with increasing surface crack ratio based on this observation a piecewise function is proposed to characterize the relationship between the normalized infiltration capacity of cracked soil and surface crack ratio moreover it is found that the normalized infiltration capacity increases almost linearly with increasing number of cracks while there is no obvious relationship between the normalized infiltration capacity and average crack width in addition to desiccation cracking infiltration capacity also increases with decreasing initial water content as well as increasing number of drying wetting cycles 5 during the water infiltration the prehealing time of cracks increases with increasing surface crack ratio and number of cracks while the changing rate decreases with increasing number of drying wetting cycles 6 the steady final infiltration rate increases with increasing initial water content as well as increasing number of drying wetting cycles however desiccation cracking has little influence on the steady final infiltration rate 7 the equilibrium time is the period spent to reach the steady final infiltration rate and it increases with decreasing initial water content and

4986,infiltration is of great concern in many fields like hydrology agriculture as well as geotechnical and geological engineering this study aims to investigate water infiltration in a cracked soil infiltration tests were conducted on compacted soil samples with different cracking degrees by drying to various water contents three drying wetting cycles were applied experimental results show that no desiccation cracks are observed in the first drying process while cracks initiate and propagate in the second and third drying processes different from the infiltration curve of the non cracked soil sample consisting of two distinct stages that of the cracked soil consists of three distinct stages representing constant rapid reduction and gradual reduction in infiltration rate respectively a modified equation is proposed to describe the infiltration behavior of a cracked soil considering the prehealing time of cracks furthermore it is found that for the tested soil 4 of surface crack ratio is a critical value when surface crack ratio is smaller than the critical value its influence on infiltration capacity is insignificant afterwards the infiltration capacity increases dramatically with increasing surface crack ratio based on this observation a piecewise function is proposed to characterize the relationship between the normalized infiltration capacity of cracked soil and surface crack ratio infiltration capacity also increases with decreasing initial water content and increasing number of drying wetting cycles in terms of steady final infiltration rate it increases with increasing initial water content as well as increasing number of drying wetting cycles but is not affected by desiccation cracking keywords drying wetting cycle infiltration rate desiccation cracking water content clayey soil 1 introduction infiltration the process of water penetration into soil is a key process in many aspects in hydrology infiltration is part of the terrestrial water cycle linking overland flow and groundwater recharge liu et al 2019 in agriculture infiltration is of particular interest with respect to the surface irrigation pandey and pandey 1982 in geotechnical and geological engineering infiltration is closely related to soil erosion slope stability and many other problems rodriguez iturbe et al 2007 rahardjo et al 2010 many researchers have paid attention to infiltration and found that it can be influenced by different factors including water supply rate chemical compositions of both water and soil temperature boundary conditions soil density spatial distribution of the hydraulic properties within the soil profile and so on baker 1979 diskin and nazimov 1996 loague and gander 1990 ng and zhan 2003 su 2010 corradini et al 2000 2011 assouline 2013 wang et al 2017 demand et al 2019 investigation on the infiltration laws is of great importance in guiding scientific research and practical design in the above mentioned disciplines desiccation cracking is a common phenomenon in clayey soils thanks to the water loss in the drought climate morris et al 1992 tang et al 2008 vardon 2015 zeng et al 2020 under drying condition water evaporation from soil results in an initiation of tensile stress once the tensile stress increases with decreasing water content and exceeds the tensile strength of soil desiccation cracking may develop tang et al 2011 cheng et al 2020 many studies have shown that desiccation cracking depends upon a large number of factors mineral composition fine content temperature boundary conditions relative humidity drying wetting cycles sample size etc morris et al 1992 miller et al 1998 yesiller et al 2000 rodríguez et al 2007 tang et al 2008 2011 decarlo and shokri 2014 tollenaar et al 2017 lakshmikantha et al 2018 levatti et al 2019 the open voids of cracks can be beneficial for the budding seeds to break through and further growth scott et al 1988 weisbrod et al 2009 more importantly the development of desiccation cracking may have some negative influence on the hydrological regimes and geotechnical engineering as it has a significant influence on the mechanical and hydraulic properties of soils morris et al 1992 miller et al 1998 yesiller et al 2000 albrecht and benson 2001 rayhani et al 2007 tang et al 2008 lozada et al 2015 the desiccation cracks can reduce the soil strength and make the soil become more compressible in pavement engineering the weakened mechanical properties of subsoil induced by cracks may reduce the long term performance of the roadways decarlo and shokri 2014 guo et al 2018 moreover the desiccation cracks can provide preferential pathways for rainfall infiltration and gas emission the crack induced preferential pathways in landfill cover system may result in ground water pollution as well as air pollution mckay et al 1993 romkens and prasad 2006 tang et al 2019 it may also lead to catastrophic failures of levees and dikes which severely impacts the economy and environment mckay et al 1993 van baars 2005 aghakouchak et al 2015 robinson and vahedifard 2016 in terms of water infiltration in cracked soils it is expected that different cracking degrees will have impact in the infiltration the cracking degree can be quantitative analysed by some methods like image analysis and fractal analysis miller et al 1998 volgel et al 2005 tang et al 2008 lakshmikantha et al 2009 li and zhang 2011 liu et al 2013a 2013b lu et al 2016 previous studies have found that water content is a key factor affecting the development of cracks in natural condition there is periodic dry and wet climate gens 2010 tang et al 2011 burton et al 2015 he et al 2017 crack initiation and propagation is also closely related to the drying wetting cycles for a given soil tested under a certain environmental condition the cracking degree increases with decreasing water content and increasing number of drying wetting cycles tang et al 2011 however experimental investigation on quantitative influence of desiccation cracking on water infiltration in soils is limited so far most of previous studies on this topic are focused on theoretical and numerical methods pandey and pandey 1982 chertkov and ravina 2001 wang et al 2019 the principle objective of this study is to investigate water infiltration in a cracked soil considering the effect of drying wetting cycles a series of infiltration tests were conducted on compacted soil samples with different cracking degrees induced by drying to various water contents i e 25 23 21 19 17 15 and 13 three drying wetting cycles were applied to simulate the natural conditions of rainfall and evaporation the development of crack pattern along the drying process in each cycle was quantified in this study the cracking degree is represented by the crack images at the top surface of soil samples effects of desiccation cracking and drying wetting cycles on infiltration were analysed 2 materials and methods 2 1 testing material and sample preparation the testing material in this study is pukou soil from the nanjing china it widely distributes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the fractions of sand silt and clay are 24 34 and 41 respectively the plastic and liquid limits are 29 1 and 76 4 respectively the maximum dry density and optimum water content are 1 69 g cm3 and 18 3 respectively the physical properties are summarized in table 1 according to the unified soil classification system astm d 2487 2017 the test soil is classified as a fat clay ch the tested soil was air dried crushed using a rubber pestle and passed through a 2 mm sieve after air drying the water content of the soil is about 4 then a desired amount of de aired water was added to reach the target water content of 25 after that the soil was sealed inside a plastic bag for 48 h to ensure the moisture equalization static compaction was adopted to prepare the compacted soil samples the sample size was 50 mm in diameter and 100 mm in height and the dry density was controlled to be 1 30 g cm3 which is close to the dry density of surface soil in the field each soil sample was statically compacted in four layers in total 63 samples were prepared in this study 2 2 testing apparatus a flexible wall permeameter was utilised to conduct the infiltration tests as shown in fig 1 a a confining pressure of 50 kpa was applied in each infiltration test to avoid the side wall leakage which is commonly observed when using rigid wall permeameter samingan et al 2003 the hydraulic head gradient can be applied by making a difference between the top water pressure and bottom water pressure the water flow in out was continuously monitored until reaching a steady state condition the equilibrium state can be considered to be attained when the inflow rate was approximately equal to the outflow rate in this study the constant head method is adopted in the infiltration tests and the hydraulic head gradient is kept at 15 kpa the infiltration rate i at any time interval t is calculated by the following equation 1 i t dv d t a where dv is the volume change of water infiltrated within a given time dt a is cross sectional area of the soil sample 2 3 testing procedure the compacted soil samples with initial water content of 25 were subjected to three drying wetting cycles under room temperature 20 2 c as illustrated in fig 1 b during the first drying process a series of target water contents i e 25 23 21 19 17 15 and 13 were set in order to obtain soil samples with different cracking degrees when each of the target water content was reached three parallel samples were collected and sealed using a plastic wrap and kept for 48 h for moisture equalization then the plastic wrap was removed and the soil sample was setting up in the flexible wall permeameter for infiltration test during drying when the final target water content of 13 was reached the rest of samples were dry to the residual water content about 4 the next step was to saturate the soil sample by placed in a rigid mold 50 mm in diameter and 100 mm in height and submerged in de aired water under the state of vacuum for 48 h the water content of each sample at saturation was about 40 after saturation the samples were taken out and a second drying process was applied similarly several samples with various target water contents as the same with the first dying path were collected and subjected to infiltration tests after that the wetting drying cycle was repeated again fig 1 b in this study the water content during drying path was monitored by weighting the soil sample at regular intervals moreover before setting up in the flexible wall permeameter the images of the soil top surface were taken by using a digital camera for quantitative analysis of desiccation cracks 2 4 cracking image analysis a software crack image analysis system cias available at www climate engeo com is adopted for the quantitative analysis of the crack images some image pre processing steps including grayscale binalization denoising skeletonising and crack identification are conducted before quantitative analysis in the following section analysing results of surface crack ratio number of cracks and average crack width are reported more details of the procedure of the quantitative cracking image analysis are reported by tang et al 2008 and liu et al 2013 it should be noted that with elapsed drying time soil sample shrinks and the diameter of soil sample becomes less than 50 mm when determining the surface crack ratio the edge shrinkage area of each soil sample has not be taken into consideration which is different from previous studies tang et al 2008 2011 cheng et al 2020 this is because the soil sample in the flexible wall permeameter is covered by a membrane and the edge shrinkage has no influence on the water infiltration 2 5 calculation of normalized infiltration capacity in order to eliminate the influence of initial water content infiltration capacity of a cracked soil sample with a given initial water content q 0 c is normalized by that of a non cracked soil sample with the same given initial water content q 0 nc noted that q 0 nc is related to the soil type and density of the soil sample a smaller density represents a larger q 0 nc the normalized infiltration capacity of the non cracked soil sample is equal to 1 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 soil desiccation cracking behaviour and the effect of wetting drying cycles during the first drying process no cracks are observed on the soil surface by naked eyes however in the second and third drying processes obvious desiccation cracking phenomenon occurs this is likely because the first drying is started from the compaction water content while the subsequent drying processes start after the soil sample is fully saturated moreover before the first drying the soil structure is relatively homogenous and only shrinkage is observed during the first drying moreover the volume change during drying and wetting results in a decrease in soil integrity and an increase in weak zones in soil samples yong and warkentin 1975 these weak zones may trigger development of cracks weinberger 1999 tang et al 2008 fig 2 shows the typical crack images at the top surface of soil samples at selected water contents during the second and third drying with water evaporation under drying condition matric suction is developed at the corresponding time the suction dependent tensile stress increases once the tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of the soil desiccation cracks may initiate tang et al 2011 it is interesting to found that the cracks initiated at the boundaries are almost perpendicular to the tangent direction pointing to the centre of the soil sample this is attributed to the boundary effect tang et al 2011 cui et al 2014 the soil shrinkage during the drying process results in a separation away from the vertical walls of the mold and creates cracks along the boundary direction then the strain energy is released and the maximum tensile stress direction induced by shrinkage is parallel to the tangent direction as the propagation direction of desiccation crack is always perpendicular to the maximum tensile stress the cracks are pointing to the centre of the soil sample as observed moreover in each drying process with decreasing water content the cracks gradually initiate and widen at a given water content there are more thin cracks in the third drying process compared with the second drying images showing development of desiccation cracking have been quantitatively analysed surface crack ratio which is defined as the ratio of the surface area of cracks to the total surface area of soil sample is an important parameter to describe the cracking degree fig 3 a shows the evolution of surface crack ratio with decreasing water content during the second and third drying processes as can be seen from the figure during the second drying process surface crack ratio increases by about twice from 2 6 to 5 1 when water content decreases from 25 to 13 with continuous decrease in water content the cracks propagate resulting in an increase in surface crack ratio the evolution of surface cracking ratio during the third drying process shows a different trend compared with that during the second drying surface crack ratio increases from 2 6 to 5 6 when drying from 25 to 15 followed by a slight reduction to 4 4 when further drying to water content of 13 the reduction in surface crack ratio can be attributed to the drying induced soil bulk volume shrinkage tang et al 2019 moreover it is found that at a given water content the surface crack ratio in the third drying process is always larger than that in the second drying process the change of number of cracks during the drying processes is shown in fig 3 b the numbers of cracks in both second and third drying processes show an increasing trend and the number of cracks in the third drying process is about 2 5 times as that in the second one on average in the third drying process when drying to water content of 17 the number of cracks becomes almost unchanged while the surface crack ratio keeps increasing this is because when the crack pattern is formed further drying results in a widening of existing cracks tang et al 2011 cheng et al 2020 in the third drying with further drying from water content of 17 to 13 the number of cracks keeps increasing the increase of number of cracks in the later stage is due to the initiation of many thin and fine cracks as pointed by tang et al 2011 drying wetting cycles make the initially homogeneous non aggregated structure convert to a heterogeneous aggregated structure creating many inter aggregate pores theses inter aggregate pores are acting as weak zones and affect the cracks during the subsequent drying period yong and warkentin 1975 cheng et al 2020 in terms of average crack width it almost doubles during the second drying process from water content of 25 to 13 as shown in fig 3 c however in the third drying process the average crack width increases dramatically from about 0 4 to 1 0 when drying from water content of 25 21 with further drying to water content of 13 the average crack width starts to decrease as more thin and fine cracks initiate 3 2 effect of desiccation cracking and wetting drying cycles on infiltration fig 4 a depicts the evolution of infiltration rate of soil samples at various water contents in the first drying process with elapsed time it can be found that at a given time the infiltration rate increases with decreasing initial water content for the soil sample at each initial water content the infiltration rate decreases with elapsed wetting time and finally reaches an equilibrium state and the changing rate of the infiltration rate the slope of the curve also show a decreasing trend with elapsed time in the semi log plane the infiltration curve can be regards as two distinct stages one is for rapid decrease in infiltration rate with time and the other is for infiltration rate to slowly decrease and finally reach the equilibrium state the majority of infiltration equations used today were based either on the diffusion equation or empirical formulation su 2010 a widely adopted empirical equation in hydrology to describe the evolution of infiltration rate is proposed by horton 1933 2 q t q f q 0 q f e α t where q is the infiltration rate at a certain time q f is the steady final infiltration rate q 0 is the initial infiltration rate t is the time α is a decay constant this equation is adopted to describe the infiltration curves shown in fig 4 a and the fitted value of α of each soil sample has been listed in table 2 it can be found that with decreasing initial water content from 25 to 13 the value of α decreases by about 72 from 8 42 to 2 36 that is to say the decay constant is influenced by the initial water content the infiltration curves of soil samples at various initial water contents in the second drying process with elapsed time show a different pattern as shown in fig 4 b compared with those in the first drying process the infiltration curve can be regarded as consisting of three distinct stages the infiltration rate keeps almost constant for a certain period of time at the early stage this is because the initiation of desiccation cracking provides a preferential pathway for water infiltration wang et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 resulting in a sustained period of relatively rapid infiltration then the infiltration rate starts to dramatically decrease followed by a gradually decrease before reaching the final equilibrium value this can be contributed to the crack closure induced by increasing water content chertkov and ravina 2001 liu et al 2013a 2013b qi et al 2020 for the soil samples at each initial water content the infiltration rate in the second drying process is over ten times larger than that in the first drying similar results are found in the third drying process as shown in fig 4 c equation 2 cannot capture the above mentioned phenomenon as there is no consideration of desiccation cracking and drying wetting cycles thus based on the previous results equation 2 is suggested to be modified to characterize this phenomenon 3 q t q 0 t t c q f q 0 q f e α t t c t t c where t c is the period for crack to gradually heal prehealing time as illustrated in fig 4 b it should be noted that t c is related to the degree of cracking development with a larger crack ratio t c is larger and vice versa as showing in table 2 for a given soil type with increasing number of drying wetting cycles at a given initial water content the value of α decreases moreover in the second and third drying process with decreasing initial water content from 25 to 13 the value of α decreases by about 31 and 25 respectively this illustrates that in addition to initial water content both the cracking degree and number of drying wetting cycles plays a role in the decay constant fig 5 shows the effect of drying wetting cycles on infiltration curve of soil samples at selected initial water contents i e 25 19 and 13 as the number of drying wetting cycles goes up at a given initial water content and a given time the infiltration rate increases this can be attributed to the increase in surface crack ratio with increasing number of drying wetting cycles in addition structure degradation induced by drying wetting cycles also contributes drying wetting cycles make the soil structure change from a non aggregated structure to an aggregated one and create many large size inter aggregate pores tang et al 2011 which accelerate the water infiltration moreover with decreasing initial water content the difference in infiltration curve in between the second and third drying becomes less obvious infiltration capacity which is defined as the maximal rate at which the soil sample can absorb water is an important parameter to evaluate the water infiltration assouline 2013 if the water supply exceeds the infiltration capacity only part of water can infiltrate and the rest may pond on the soil surface in this study with the selected confining stress and water head the water supply is larger than the infiltration capacity besides as the water content and cracking keeps changing the infiltration capacity is not a constant for each soil sample for simplicity the initial infiltration rate of soil samples at each water content in each drying process is regarded as the corresponding infiltration capacity effect of initial water content on infiltration capacity is shown in fig 6 a it can be found that with increasing number of drying wetting cycles the infiltration capacity increases and the effect of initial water content on the infiltration rate becomes more obvious this is contributed to the development of desiccation cracking in the drying wetting cycles for the tested soil in the testing water content range the infiltration capacity can be enhanced by 5 to 16 times in the past numerical studies the effect of cracking on infiltration capacity has been widely investigated for example novák et al 2000 developed a fracture model and found that the infiltration capacity of a cracked soil is about 66 larger than that of a non cracked soil this suggests that numerical methods may underestimate effect of cracking on infiltration capacity in the first drying process the infiltration capacity triples when drying from water content of 25 to 13 while in the second and third drying in the same water content range more significant rises of infiltration capacity can be observed 7 5 times and 5 times respectively in other words effect of initial water content on the infiltration capacity is strengthened by the effect of cracking induced by drying wetting cycles moreover for non cracked soil the hysteresis effect results in lower infiltration and less movement of water through the soil bashir et al 2016 however as the desiccation cracks can provide preferential pathways for water infiltration the hysteresis effect is not pronounced on water infiltration in cracked soil details about effect of cracking on infiltration capacity are analysed in the next section the steady final infiltration rate is also an important parameter for evaluating the water infiltration fig 6 b depicts the effect of initial water content on steady final infiltration rate as can be seen from the figure in each drying process the steady final infiltration rate decreases with decreasing initial water content drying is always accompanied by soil shrinkage according to existing elasto plastic model e g alonso et al 1990 there is a positive relationship between the volume shrinkage and water content change thus the soil sample with a smaller initial water content has a larger density which may result in a smaller steady final infiltration rate at a given initial water content and a given time the steady final infiltration rate increases with increasing number of drying wetting cycles as the crack closes during the water infiltration the increase in steady final infiltration rate is due to the structure degradation induced by drying wetting cycles as discussed previously furthermore with increasing number of drying wetting cycles the effect of initial water content on steady final infiltration rate becomes more significant this is because the cumulative volume change of soil sample also increases with increasing cycles ng and zhou 2014 li et al 2018 even though in the second and third drying processes there are desiccation cracks observed in this study the surface cracks close completely during the water infiltration as the tested soil has a certain expansibility under wetting tang et al 2011 the wetting induced crack closure is also experimentally verified by qi et al 2020 they also pointed out that the crack closure degree is significantly influenced by the water supply rate under a relatively small water supply rate the cracks can only partially close which have an influence on the steady final infiltration rate density effect on the steady final infiltration rate may be compensated by the effect of non fully close cracks the time spent to reach the steady final infiltration rate is named as equilibrium time effect of initial water content on equilibrium time is shown in fig 6 c it can be found that in each drying process the equilibrium time increases with decreasing initial water content moreover at a given initial water content with increasing number of drying wetting cycles more cracks initiate and the equilibrium time also increases as more time is needed for crack closure 3 3 quantitative relationship between desiccation cracking and infiltration fig 7 shows the effect of desiccation cracking on normalized infiltration capacity as can be seen from the fig 7 a there is no obvious difference in the second and third drying processes a positive relationship between surface crack ratio and normalized infiltration capacity can be observed in other words in terms of the impact on infiltration capacity at a given initial water content desiccation cracking plays a more important role compared with drying wetting cycles moreover the relationship between normalized infiltration capacity and surface crack ratio can be regarded as two approximately linear segments when the surface crack ratio is smaller than 4 the normalized infiltration capacity slightly increases with increasing surface crack ratio when the surface crack ratio increases over 4 a dramatic increase in normalized infiltration capacity is observed this is likely because when the surface crack ratio is smaller than a certain value the degree of crack development inside the soil sample is relatively low and cracks may not penetrate the soil sample delerue et al 2003 tang et al 2019 the connection of crack network is not well built hence its influence on infiltration capacity is less significant zhang et al 2015 after that cracks may connect to each other and provide preferential flow paths contributing to the significant increase of infiltration capacity fig 7 a therefore the surface crack ratio of 4 is defined as the critical surface crack ratio r sc c related to soil infiltration behaviour for different kinds of soils the specific value of the critical surface crack ratio may be different based on the observed phenomenon the following equation is proposed to describe the effect of surface crack ratio on normalized infiltration capacity 4 q 0 c q 0 nc a r sc 1 r sc r sc c b r sc a b r sc c 1 r sc r sc c where r sc is the surface crack ratio a and b represent effect of surface crack ratio on infiltration capacity before and after the critical surface crack ratio r sc c moreover a and b are two soil parameters for the tested soil the values of a and b are 1 60 and 4 58 respectively fig 7 b shows that the normalized infiltration capacity increases linearly with increasing number of cracks for each additional crack the infiltration capacity of soil increased by about 21 however in terms of effect of average crack width shown in fig 7 c it seems that there is no clear relationship between average crack width and the infiltration capacity similarly steady final infiltration rate of a cracked soil sample with a given initial water content is normalized by that of a non cracked soil sample with the same given initial water content and the effect of surface crack ratio on normalized steady final infiltration rate is shown in fig 8 a it can be found that there is no obvious change in normalized steady final infiltration rate with surface crack ratio this is likely because when reaching the steady final infiltration rate the cracks close due to swelling of soil particles and slaking of soil clods during the water infiltration the observation is consistent with previous study conducted by liu et al 2013 they found that the surface crack ratio of a swelling soil enhanced only the infiltration capacity while had little influence on the steady final infiltration rate similar results can be found in fig 8 b and c that both number of cracks and average crack ratio do not affect the steady final infiltration rate as can be seen from fig 5 b and c the infiltration curve of cracked soil in the semi lop plane can be separated into three distinct stages the first stage represents that the infiltration rate keeps at a relative high value due to the wetting induced crack healing and water content change the infiltration rate starts to decrease which is represented by the second stage the last stage means that the infiltration rate tends to reach the steady final value the corresponding time of the intersection between the first and second stage is defined as the prehealing time of cracks as shown in fig 4 b fig 9 a and b illustrates the effects of surface crack ratio and number of cracks on the prehealing time of desiccation cracking respectively it can be found that in the second and third drying process the prehealing time increases almost linearly with increasing surface crack ratio and number of cracks however the changing rate of prehealing time with increasing surface crack ratio and number of cracks in the second drying process 0 30 h and 0 04 h is about ten times as large as that in the third drying process about 0 02 h and 0 004 h however average crack width is not a suitable quantitative parameter to be chosen for describing the effect of cracking degree on prehealing time as shown in fig 9 c it should be noted that in this study a certain soil type is chosen as the testing material the specific value of some parameters may vary according to the soil for example the prehealing time may be influenced by the soil type with increasing clay content the desiccation cracking phenomenon becomes more serious yesiller et al 2000 that is to say for a soil type with a higher clay content effects of desiccation cracking on water infiltration may be more significant and the prehealing time may be longer even so the research methods and understandings obtained in this paper are of referential significance for studying soils in other regions 4 conclusions water infiltration in a cracked soil considering effect of drying wetting cycles is investigated experimentally in this study different cracking degrees is obtained by drying the soil samples to various water contents and three drying wetting cycles are applied the development of surface crack is monitored and its influence on infiltration behaviour was quantitative analysed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in the first drying process there is no desiccation cracks in the second and third drying processes cracks initiate and propagate with decreasing water content moreover with increasing drying wetting cycles more cracks are observed as the drying wetting cycles result in a decrease in soil integrity and an increase in weak zones in soil samples 2 for the non cracked soil sample the infiltration curve in the semi log plane shows a two stage pattern the infiltration rate decreases dramatically first and then gradually slow down to reach an equilibrium state with elapsed wetting time however for the cracked soil sample a three stage infiltration curve can be observed a constant rapid infiltration is observed at the early wetting stage the corresponding time of the intersection between the first and second stage is defined as the prehealing time of cracks 3 a modified equation is proposed to describe the infiltration curve of a cracked soil based on the prehealing time of cracks as well as horton s equation 4 the infiltration capacity of soil contains cracks significantly depends on surface crack ratio when the surface crack ratio is smaller than a critical value its influence on normalized infiltration capacity is insignificant afterwards the normalized infiltration capacity increase dramatically with increasing surface crack ratio based on this observation a piecewise function is proposed to characterize the relationship between the normalized infiltration capacity of cracked soil and surface crack ratio moreover it is found that the normalized infiltration capacity increases almost linearly with increasing number of cracks while there is no obvious relationship between the normalized infiltration capacity and average crack width in addition to desiccation cracking infiltration capacity also increases with decreasing initial water content as well as increasing number of drying wetting cycles 5 during the water infiltration the prehealing time of cracks increases with increasing surface crack ratio and number of cracks while the changing rate decreases with increasing number of drying wetting cycles 6 the steady final infiltration rate increases with increasing initial water content as well as increasing number of drying wetting cycles however desiccation cracking has little influence on the steady final infiltration rate 7 the equilibrium time is the period spent to reach the steady final infiltration rate and it increases with decreasing initial water content and increasing number of drying wetting cycles credit authorship contribution statement qing cheng writing original draft formal analysis chao sheng tang conceptualization supervision funding acquisition

of the other purpose to improve the quality of downstream fish habitats using selective withdrawal operations for this a coupled hydrodynamic and habitat modeling approach was used the study area was an 11 km reach located downstream of the soyang gang dam to compute the change of the water temperature in the soyang reservoir the ce qual w2 model was used using the results from the ce qaul w2 model the temperature of the water discharged from the dam was obtained for three selective withdrawal operations namely surface layer withdrawal middle layer withdrawal and bottom layer withdrawal hydrodynamic simulations were performed using the hec ras model and the distributions of the flow depth velocity and water temperature were obtained over the study area physical habitat simulations phss were carried out using habitat suitability curves hscs for both adult and spawning zacco platypus results from the phss indicated that fish habitats in the regulated streams can be seriously degraded due to cold water releases from the dam but its impact can be reduced significantly using selective withdrawal operations keywords selective withdrawal water temperature physical habitat simulation habitat suitability curve ce qual w2 1 introduction in general dam construction induces changes in the hydrologic regime of the reach downstream of the dam maingi and marsh 2002 batalla et al 2004 magilligan and nislow 2005 the floods disappear and the downstream reach experiences fluctuations in flow if the dam is operated for hydropower generation to follow economic market supply and demand namely peak flow during the period of hydropower generation and base flow during the recession period this is called hydropeaking flows many researchers have investigated the impact of hydropeaking flows on the downstream habitat of aquatic animals and have revealed that they have negative impacts freeman et al 2001 boavida et al 2015 schmutz et al 2015 choi et al 2017 in addition to the hydrologic regime change the flow regulation by the dam leads to changes in the thermal regime of the downstream reach zhong and power 1996 rolls et al 2013 the temperature of the water released from the dam is likely to be different from that of the water flowing in the downstream reach kedra and wiejaczka 2018 he et al 2020 specially for most large dams in korea hypolimnetic water released from the dam is cooler and warmer than water in the stream during the summer and winter respectively therefore the hydropeaking flows from the dam induce fluctuations in the water temperature in the reach downstream of the dam this is called thermopeaking and its impact was found to be as significant as that of hydropeaking naiman et al 2008 olden and naiman 2010 bruno et al 2013 in large dams the stratification of stored water begins in the spring during the summer a thermocline is clearly formed between the epilimnion and hypolimnion where water is warmer or less dense and cooler or denser respectively in the late fall the stratification is weakened as the surrounding air becomes cool water released from the hypolimnion may become anoxic and can induce cold water damage in agricultural produce if the water is used for irrigation specially water from the hypolimnetic layer can reduce the maximum water temperature in the summer and delay of water from reaching its maximum temperature for several weeks olden and naiman 2010 previous studies revealed that cold water releases from the hypolimnetic layer in a reservoir degrades the quality of fish habitats in the downstream reach of the dam preece and jones 2002 kang et al 2017 song et al 2018 gray et al 2019 wu et al 2019 for example preece and jones 2002 studied the impact of cold water discharge from the keepit dam on downstream fish habitats in the namoi river australia they found the maximum daily temperature downstream of the dam to be lowered by approximately 5 c and the annual maximum temperature to occur three weeks later compared to the pre dam conditions in addition the lowered water temperature was found to disrupt thermal spawning cues for native fish species todd et al 2005 investigated the impact of cold water releases on post spawning survival of murray cod in the mitta mitta river australia using the stochastic population model they predicted a 50 reduction in post spawning survival at temperatures below 14 8 c revealing that cold water releases can be a significant threat to the murray cod population abdo et al 2018 examined the effect of the irapé reservoir in brazil on the growth and gonadal maturation of prochilodus hartii they investigated the maturation and gonadosomatic indices of p hartii in the downstream reaches of the reservoir and found that the reduced temperatures negatively impacted the somatic growth and gonadal development of p hartii in korea discharges from the large dams often caused water quality problems in the downstream area specifically the high turbidity and low temperature of the released flow negatively affected agriculture and habitat quality of downstream aquatic animals choi 2001 when heavy rainfalls poured a large amount of fine sediment inflow into the dam occurred and highly turbid water lasted in the reservoir for about a year yum et al 2011 for the supply of clean water from the dam the korean government established a so called turbidity reduction plan in 2007 and one of the action plans was to build a selective withdrawal structure in the reservoir previously olden and naiman 2010 and kang et al 2017 provided a possibility of mitigating damage from cold water releases by controlling the temperature of the water released from the dam however no previous studies have confirmed this quantitatively this study explores the research question can we use the selective withdrawal facility built for discharging clear water during the occurrence of turbid water in large dams to reduce the damage from the cold water release we used an ecohydraulic modeling framework to assess quantitatively the impact of selective withdrawal on downstream fish habitats in order to assess habitat quality of the target fish quantitatively the physical habitat simulation phs was used the phs is an ecohydraulic model that quantifies the quality of habitats for target fish species in a stream phs evaluates the suitability of habitat variables at a particular rate of discharge bovee 1982 booker and dunbar 2004 in the present study two metrics namely composite suitability index csi and weighted usable area wua were used in the phs to evaluate the spatial distribution of habitat suitability and quantity of available habitats in the study area respectively the study area was an approximately 11 km reach of the soyang gang river located downstream of the soyang gang dam one of large dams in korea the annual change in the water temperature in the reservoir was computed and the temperature of the water released from the dam was obtained for various selective withdrawal schemes then hydraulic and water temperature simulations were carried out for various selective withdrawal operations resulting in habitat variables over the study area finally the habitat simulations were performed and the csi and wua were obtained for various selective withdrawal operations 2 material and methods to investigate the impact of selective withdrawal from a thermally stratified reservoir on downstream fish habitats three stages of numerical simulations were carried out first the distribution of the water temperature in the reservoir was simulated using the ce qual w2 model the annual variation in the temperature of the water released from the dam was obtained and used to compute the change in the water temperature in the study area for a given discharge second hydrodynamic and water temperature simulations were carried out in the downstream reach of the dam using the hec ras model the longitudinal distributions of the flow depth velocity and water temperature over the study area were obtained finally phss were carried out using the habitat suitability curves hscs with the results from the hydrodynamic and water temperature simulations the csi distributions and wua values were obtained and used to evaluate the quality of the fish habitat downstream of the dam numerical simulations were carried out for the year of 2005 when typical dam operations were made without serious floods nor droughts 2 1 study area an 11 km reach of the soyang gang river located downstream of the soyang gang dam was selected as the study area fig 1 the soyang gang river is a tributary of the bukhan gang river located in the north eastern part of korea the watershed area and total length of the soyang gang river are 2798 50 km2 and 156 80 km respectively the median size of the bed sediment in the study area ranges from 12 mm to 18 mm indicating a gravel bed river ministry of construction and transportation 2002 based on the inflow discharges to the soyang gang dam recorded from 2005 to 2017 the drought flow q355 low flow q275 normal flow q185 and high flow q95 are 1 52 3 60 5 80 and 12 26 m3 s respectively here qn denotes the average discharge which are exceeded on n days of the year construction of the soyang gang dam began in 1967 and was completed in 1973 the height and width of the dam are 123 m and 530 m respectively the total storage capacity of the dam is 2 9 109 m3 the elevation of dam crest is 203 el m at the water surface level of 193 5 el m the volume surface area and maximum depth are 1 9 109 m3 65 4 km2 and 113 5 m respectively korea water resources corporation 1999 the soyang reservoir is known to have a long retention time of approximately 0 7 years due to the small amount of inflow to the dam kim et al 2001 the shape of the reservoir is dendritic extending 60 km along its primary axis with a mean width of 0 5 km see fig 1 the original intake facility of the soyang gang dam withdrew water at 130 150 el m corresponding to heights of 53 73 m below the dam crest however the discharges from the intake facility of the dam often caused water quality problems in the downstream area specifically the low temperature and high turbidity of the released flow negatively affected agriculture and habitat quality of downstream aquatic animals choi 2001 when typhoon ewiniar hit the korean peninsula in 2006 a large amount of fine sediment inflow into the dam occurred with a maximum hourly rainfall of 88 mm thereafter highly turbid water in the reservoir lasted for about eight months for the supply of clean water from the dam the korean government established a so called turbidity reduction plan and one of the action plans was to build a selective withdrawal structure in the reservoir the construction of the selective withdrawal structure see fig 2 a by korea water resources corporation began in 2009 and ended in 2017 the selective withdrawal structure can release water at different elevations which enables selective withdrawal operations in a stratified reservoir as shown in fig 2 b 2 2 methods 2 2 1 temperature distribution modeling in the soyang reservoir the ce qual w2 model was used to simulate the annual variation of the water temperature in the soyang reservoir at hourly resolution the ce qual w2 model is a two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model which is capable of calculating water surface elevation velocity temperature and water quality components such as ammonium nitrate nitrite and phosphorus cole and wells 2018 the ce qual w2 model assumes that lateral variations in velocity temperature and constituents are negligible this assumption is valid for large reservoirs in mountainous areas the shape of which is long narrow and deep in the length width and depth respectively all of these are true in the soyang reservoir computational grids in the ce qual w2 model were constructed using bathymetry data surveyed by korea water resources cooperation 2007 and the longitudinal and vertical grids were given by the segment and the layer respectively in the present study the computational grids for the soyang reservoir are composed of 125 segments and 123 layers fig 3 to simulate the distribution of the water temperature in the reservoir using the ce qual w2 model both the inflow and outflow are required together with meteorological data such as air temperature dew point temperature wind velocity wind direction and cloud cover in this study hourly meteorological data obtained from chuncheon station for the year of 2005 were used korea meteorological administration http kma go kr accessed february 12 2019 hourly time series data for the inflows and hydropeaking flows were obtained from the water management information system wamis http wamis go kr accessed 13 february 2019 the water temperature of the inflow was estimated using the following equations 1a t w 0 32 t air 0 34 t dew 7 69 for q 300 m 3 s 1b t w 0 02 t air 0 24 t dew 11 04 for q 300 m 3 s where t w is water temperature t air is air temperature and t dew is dew point temperature eqs 1a and 1b were obtained by korea water resources corporation 2007 using a regression analysis of the observed data in the study area fig 4 a and 4 b show the inflows to and hydropeaking flows from the soyang gang dam in 2005 respectively regarding the inflows to the dam flood flows occurred in april june july august and september in 2005 and the peak flows of the floods ranged between 257 2 and 832 8 m3 s except for in flood seasons low flows were maintained in terms of the hydropeaking flows from the dam the daily peak discharges during hydropower generation ranged from 200 to 230 m3 s and the base flows during the hydropower generation recession period ranges between 0 3 and 0 5 m3 s 2 2 2 hydrodynamic and water temperature simulation in the downstream reach of the soyang gang dam changes of the hydraulic and water temperature conditions induced by hydropeaking flows from the dam were simulated using the hec ras model u s army corps of engineers 2010 at hourly resolution the hec ras model solves the saint venant equations for flow and the advection dispersion equation for the water temperature thirty cross sections were used to construct the topography of the study reach in the hec ras model the average distance between the cross sections was about 390 m for the hydraulic simulations hydropeaking flows from the soyang gang dam and the normal depth were used as upstream and downstream boundary conditions respectively in this study a roughness coefficient of 0 035 suggested by ministry of construction and transportation 2002 was used for simulations of the water temperature the water temperature of inflows from the upstream boundary is required in this study the water temperature of the discharge from the dam obtained by the ce qual w2 model was used as the upstream boundary condition other than this to compute the water temperature using the hec ras model meteorological data are needed such as atmospheric pressure air temperature humidity shortwave radiation cloudiness and wind speed in this study hourly recorded meteorological data obtained from chuncheon station were used korea meteorological administration http kma go kr accessed february 12 2019 2 2 3 hscs for z platypus field monitoring by chae and yoon 2001 revealed that the dominant fish species in rivers in the soyang gang river basin are z platypus 21 1 followed by zacco temmincki 14 8 microphysogobio yaluensis 10 3 moroco oxycephalus 10 1 coreoleuciscus splendidus 4 8 and nemacheilus toni 4 3 in this study both adult and spawning stages of z platypus were selected as the target fish species for the phss for the flow depth and velocity the hscs for adult and spawning z platypus proposed by sung et al 2005 were used see fig 5 a and 5 b these hscs were constructed using field monitoring data from the nakdong gang river basin the data included the observed population against the flow depth and velocity then the constructed hscs were adjusted by expert judgement for the water temperature hscs for both adult and spawning z platypus were constructed see fig 5 c to construct hscs related to the water temperature for adult and spawning z platypus previous findings in the literature were used kang et al 2017 indicated that warm water fish in korea including cyprinid species e g z platypus achieve their highest growth rate in the temperature range of 23 to 28 c choi and choi 2018 found that adult z platypus has a strong preference for water temperatures in the range of 20 25 c and a moderate preference for those in the range of 15 20 c based on these findings in the present study the optimal water temperature range for adult z platypus was set as 20 28 c the lower and upper limits of the temperature tolerance for adult z platypus were determined to be 3 c and 31 c respectively kim 1999 kang et al 2013 it was assumed that the hsc changes linearly between the optimal range and the lower and upper limits of the temperature the spawning season of z platypus is known to be from may to august when the water temperature increases significantly in korea cho and reu 1998 yeom et al 2007 regarding the optimal range of the water temperature for spawning z platypus because z platypus spawns only in a certain water temperature range as do other fish species the range of the preferred water temperature is likely to be narrower than that required by adult z platypus for spawning z platypus the optimal range of the water temperature was set at 23 28 c this is based on laboratory experiments conducted to identify the suitable condition of the water temperature for hatching z platypus nam et al 1999 moon et al 2012 temperatures of 12 c and 31 c were set as the lower and upper limits of the tolerance respectively for spawning z platypus kim 1999 kang et al 2013 2 2 4 habitat simulation phss were carried out to investigate the impact of the discharge from the dam using various selective withdrawal operations on habitat quality of the target fish species in this study such habitat variables as flow depth velocity and water temperature were used in the phs the overall habitat suitability is indicated by the csi which is a combined value of each habitat suitability calculated by hscs the following geometric mean method was used to compute the csi 2 csi f h f v f t 1 3 where f h v is the suitability value for each habitat variable hv here hv includes flow depth h velocity v and water temperature t the values of the csi range between zero and unity indicating the worst and optimal habitats respectively the wua is an index indicating the habitat potential for the target species in the study area bovee 1982 the wua can be estimated by the csi distribution over the study area using the following relationship 3 wua i 1 n csi i a i where n is the total number of cells c s i i is the csi of the i th cell and a i is the area of the i th cell the wua ratio is the wua divided by the wetted area of the study reach and is given by 4 wua ratio i 1 n csi i a i a total where a t o t a l is the total wetted area 2 3 experimental design various selective withdrawal scenarios were tested to assess the impact of selective withdrawal on downstream fish habitats in the present study three scenarios of water release from the dam were considered based on different selective withdrawal operations according to the elevation of water intake the selective withdrawal operations can largely be classified into three options namely surface layer withdrawal middle layer withdrawal and bottom layer withdrawal before the selective withdrawal structure was constructed the soyang gang dam released water at about 130 150 el m corresponding to the height of the middle layer the elevations of surface layer and bottom layer withdrawals were assumed to be 160 180 el m and 95 115 el m respectively annual variations of the temperature of the water released from the dam were obtained using the simulation results from the ce qual w2 model then hydrodynamic simulations were performed with the hec ras model and the distributions of the flow depth velocity and water temperature were obtained over the study area habitat simulations were carried out for the three selective withdrawal scenarios using the phs in the phs two metrics such as csi and wua were used to evaluate habitat quality of the target fish the spatial distribution of habitat suitability and quantity of available habitat in the study area were evaluated using the csi distribution and wua values respectively comparative analysis was conducted using the results from the phs and the impact of selective withdrawals on downstream fish habitats was evaluated 3 results 3 1 water temperature scenarios for selective withdrawal operations 3 1 1 validation of the ce qual w2 model for the validation of the ce qual w2 model computed water temperatures were compared with the measured data at hourly resolution in this study numerical simulations were carried out to compute the two dimensional distribution of the water temperature in the soyang reservoir in 2005 the model coefficients suggested by kim and kim 2006 were used in the ce qual w2 model and are listed in table 1 fig 6 shows spatial distributions of the water temperature in the reservoir on eight different days in 2005 it can be seen that the water temperature in march 2005 was nearly uniform in the vertical direction but increased from the water surface from may 2005 in july 2005 the water temperature near the water surface increased to 27 3 c and the thermocline was formed at 140 0 el m showing the thermal stratification of the reservoir in october the water temperature near the water surface started to decrease and a weak stratification was maintained in december 2005 fig 7 presents comparisons between the water temperature computed by the ce qual w2 model and the measured data at a station located upstream of the dam marked as a circle in fig 1 it can be seen that the computed water temperature compares favorably to measured data the ranges of the mean absolute error and the coefficient of determination were 0 15 0 93 c and 0 92 0 99 respectively indicating that the ce qual w2 model predicted successfully the annual change in the water temperature of the soyang reservoir 3 1 2 annual water temperature scenarios for selective withdrawal operations fig 8 shows simulated annual temperature changes in the water released from the dam for the various selective withdrawal operations for this calculation the simulation results from the ce qual w2 model were used in the present study the impact of withdrawal on the water temperature in the reservoir was neglected the symbols on the lines are values of the water temperature computed at 12 00 on 15 of each month at hourly resolution the measured water temperature obtained from previous discharges without the selective withdrawal structure was also given for comparison kim 2010 it can be seen that the water temperature changes significantly depending on the selective withdrawal operation when surface layer withdrawal was used the overall water temperature appeared to be high specifically the water temperature increased significantly from march to june and high water temperatures were maintained during june to august showing a maximum temperature of 24 7 c for middle layer withdrawal the water temperature increased rapidly from june to august and was high during september to october the highest water temperature in this period was 17 7 c interestingly the calculated water temperature for middle layer withdrawal was in good agreement with the measured data this is because as stated earlier before the construction of the selective withdrawal structure the soyang gang dam released water at about 130 150 el m which corresponds to the height of the middle layer the temperature difference between surface layer withdrawal and middle layer withdrawal increased from april showing a maximum value of 13 6 c in june and the difference decreased to 2 3 c in october compared to the water temperatures for both surface and middle layer withdrawals the water temperature for bottom layer withdrawal was more or less constant at about 6 c without great variation the release of water from the bottom layer was expected to negatively affect downstream fish habitats due to its seriously low water temperature throughout the year seasonal characteristics of the change in the water temperature can also be seen in fig 8 when surface layer withdrawal was used the highest water temperatures were maintained for all seasons specifically average values of the water temperature were 10 9 23 9 20 2 and 9 5 c for spring summer fall and winter respectively for middle layer withdrawal the respective water temperatures were 6 3 12 8 17 0 and 9 1 c it is interesting to note that the water temperature for surface layer withdrawal was highest in summer while the water temperature for middle layer withdrawal was highest in fall the differences in the water temperature between the surface layer and middle layer withdrawal operations were 10 4 and 0 5 c in summer and winter respectively these correspond to the maximum and minimum differences respectively in a year 3 2 impact of selective withdrawal operations on downstream fish habitats results from the previous section indicated that the difference in the water temperature for surface and middle layer withdrawals increased from spring to summer reaching a maximum in june specifically surface layer withdrawal might increase the water temperature over 20 c after june which greatly affects the growth and spawning of the target fish species fig 9 a and 9 b show csi distributions from phss for the peak flow during hydropower generation on june 28 2005 for adult and spawning z platypus respectively the csi distribution in the figures changes in the transverse direction although one dimensional hydraulic simulations were carried out this is because the cross section was divided into 20 40 sub sections by verticals and the value of csi is constant in each sub section the figure compared the csi distributions of the three withdrawals for the peak flow the overall csi of surface layer withdrawal appeared to be relatively high followed by the csi of middle and bottom layer withdrawals this is mainly due to the fact that the water temperature of surface layer withdrawal was most suitable for both adult and spawning z platypus in the downstream reach specifically the water temperature of surface layer withdrawal ranged between 23 7 and 25 1 c indicating that the water temperature which was 23 7 c immediately downstream of the dam increased along the downstream direction due to the surrounding air however the water temperature ranges of middle and bottom layer withdrawals were 11 1 14 1 c and 4 9 8 5 c respectively see fig s3 in supplementary material the water temperature of these withdrawals was not suitable for both adult and spawning z platypus as can be seen in fig 5 c fig 10 shows similar csi distributions for the base flow during the hydropower generation recession period overall the csis were relatively high compared to those of the peak flow during hydropower generation period shown in fig 9 this is because the base flow provided relatively a shallow water depth with moderate velocity which was suitable for habitats of the target fish species specifically the average values of the flow depth and velocity were 1 06 m and 0 95 m s for the peak flow while those for the base were 0 36 m and 0 34 m s respectively see figs s1 and s2 in supplementary material it is also noteworthy that the overall csi of surface layer withdrawal was higher than that of middle layer withdrawal under the base flow condition this is related to the fact that the water temperature in the reach downstream of the dam ranged between 23 8 and 23 9 c meaning that if the dam releases water from surface layer withdrawal it is good for habitats of z platypus in contrast middle and bottom layer withdrawals induced water temperatures in the range of 6 0 13 2 c which were too low for both the adult and spawning stages of z platypus see fig s4 in supplementary material fig 11 shows comparisons of the wua ratios computed from the csi distributions in figs 9 and 10 in general it can be seen that the wua ratios for the base flow were larger than those of the peak flow this is because the peak flow provided deep fast water which degraded habitat quality of the target fish species specifically for surface layer withdrawal the wua ratio of the base flow was about 4 1 times larger than that of the peak flow this is true for both adult and spawning z platypus for adult z platypus the wua ratio of surface layer withdrawal was highest followed by that of middle and bottom layer withdrawal regardless of the flow condition this is related to the water temperature of surface layer withdrawal which was ideal for maintaining the optimal condition of the downstream habitat of the target fish species a similar trend can be observed in the wua ratios of spawning z platypus that is the wua ratio of surface layer withdrawal was larger than that of middle layer withdrawal however the wua ratio of bottom layer withdrawal was zero for both peak flow and base flow the water temperature for bottom layer withdrawal was 4 7 c in june which provided zero suitability in terms of the water temperature for spawning z platypus as can be seen in fig 5 c in addition the figure indicated that spawning z platypus were more affected by the type of withdrawal released than were adult z platypus fig 12 shows the annual changes in the wua according to the three withdrawal operations in general the wua of all withdrawal operations was observed to change daily due to hydropeaking flows wua values showed the daily maximum and minimum for the base and peak flows during the periods of recession and hydropower generation respectively over a year a general feature seen in the figure was that the wua of surface layer withdrawal was the largest followed by those of middle and bottom layer withdrawal fig 12 a revealed that the wua for adult z platypus relating to surface layer withdrawal increased significantly from april to july for spawning z platypus the wuas of all withdrawal operations were zero from january to march fig 12 b indicating that the study area did not provide suitable habitats for spawning z platypus the wua of surface layer withdrawal which began to increase from april was highest from june to september the period of high wua includes the spawning season similarly for spawning z platypus the wuas of surface and bottom layer withdrawals were the largest and smallest respectively the seasonal change in the wua for adult z platypus is depicted in fig 13 to obtain the seasonal change wua values in fig 12 a were averaged over the four seasons for each season it can be seen that the average wua of surface layer withdrawal was largest followed by the average wuas of middle and bottom layer withdrawal the only exception was in the spring when the wuas of middle and bottom layer withdrawals were nearly the same this is due to the water temperature in the surface layer increasing in the spring when the water temperature in the middle layer was almost same as that in the bottom layer as can be seen in fig 8 it is also noteworthy that surface layer withdrawal improved habitat quality the most in the spring compared to the other seasons quantitatively the wua of surface layer withdrawal was 48 larger than that of middle layer withdrawal in the spring this is because the temperature of the water taken at the surface layer was significantly higher than that taken at the middle layer for surface layer withdrawal the wua in the summer was highest followed by the wuas in the fall spring and winter indicating that the study area provided the target fish species with the most suitable habitat in that order of seasons similarly the wua values for spawning z platypus were averaged over the spawning season it was found that the average wuas of middle and bottom layer withdrawals were about 35 and 5 respectively of the average wua of surface layer withdrawal this suggests that middle and bottom layer withdrawals can seriously degrade the quality of habitats of spawning z platypus especially during the spawning season particularly bottom layer withdrawal can deteriorate habitats of spawning z platypus to a fatal level 4 discussion the soyang gang dam released water from the hypolimnetic layer before the selective withdrawal structure was equipped simulation and monitoring results showed that the annual pattern of the water temperature in the reach downstream of the soyang gang dam was consistent in that cold water was discharged during the warm months from spring to summer and the delay of water from reaching its maximum temperature occurred for several weeks olden and naiman 2010 indicated that this phenomenon occurred all the way through in the reaches regulated by large hypolimnetic release dams over the world in addition simulation results indicated that middle layer and bottom layer withdrawals can degrade habitat quality of the target fish species in the reach downstream of the soyang gang dam it is because temperature of water released from these layers may not reach the suitable condition for the target fish species this result conforms to previous findings in the literature which reported negative impacts of cold water releases from the dam such as disruption of spawning cues preece and jones 2002 reduction in post spawning survival todd et al 2005 and decrease in the growth of fishes abdo et al 2018 song et al 2018 in korea kang et al 2017 studied the impact of cold water releases from the andong dam on gonad development of z platypus in the nakdong gang river basin kang et al found that the water temperature in the reach downstream of the andong dam was lower by 6 10 c than that of neighboring reaches they also confirmed that gonad development of z platypus was seriously delayed which can be attributed to the release of cold water from the dam kang et al s 2017 study suggests that z platypus in the downstream reach of the soyang gang dam can be damaged in gonad development if middle layer withdrawal or bottom layer withdrawal was used the reduced growth rate of fish caused by cold water releases from the dam from spring to fall might also decrease the survival rate of the fish in the winter as the water temperature decreases in the late fall fish experience reduced food availability and a decrease in swimming and feeding abilities beamish 1978 parsons and smiley 2003 then the fish start to minimize energy expenditure via inactivity and sustain low metabolic rates speers roesch et al 2018 in the winter small fish undergo higher rates of starvation and mortality because they exhaust reserves more rapidly than do larger fish post and evans 1989 schultz and conover 1999 a previous study by van de wolfshaar 2006 revealed that fish that are undergrown spring to fall struggle to survive during the winter the results from the present study suggest that surface layer withdrawal would increase the possibility of survival of the target fish species during the winter by increasing the growth rate of the fish from spring to fall the present study proposed selective withdrawal as an alternative to reduce the damage caused by cold water releases in a large dam it was shown that the release from surface layer withdrawal increased the water temperature significantly leading to the improvement of the quality of downstream habitat of z platypus this may positively affect habitat quality of other warm water fish species in the study area such as m yaluensis however it has also been reported that cold water fish species such as m oxycephalus and c splendidus also inhabit the soyang gang river basin warm water release might negatively affect habitat quality of cold water fish species as indicated by lessard and hayes 2003 and horne et al 2004 therefore it might be desirable to properly determine the withdrawal height that meets the requirements of a target fish community rather than of a single target fish species previous studies for example olden and naiman 2010 have pointed out the selective withdrawal structure can be used to improve downstream fish habitats even though the impact of selective withdrawal operations on downstream water temperatures has been studied yang et al 2012 rheinheimer et al 2015 the direct impact on the fish habitats has not been investigated therefore there has been a lack of understanding of specific spatial and temporal impacts of selective withdrawal operations on downstream fish habitats in the present study an ecohydraulic modeling framework was established to assess these impacts two quantitative indices csi and wua in the phs successfully showed spatial and seasonal impacts of the selective withdrawal operations on downstream fish habitats indicating that the phs an ecohydraulic model can be a suitable approach for the comparative analysis of various selective withdrawal operations this study can be used in decision making in the reservoir management for the protection of fish habitats in the downstream reach of the dam where cold water damages are serious due to the dam operation a complicated situation might occur leading the manager of the reservoir to face the tradeoffs between different uses of water for example if the selective withdrawal structure is used to release surface water in the reservoir to improve downstream fish habitats the discharge of turbid water from the dam can be limited especially during the rainy season then turbid water in the reservoir can last for a long time which can lead to the disruption of the public water supply chou and wu 2010 and the acceleration of fine sediment deposition in the reservoir schleiss et al 2016 in such case the selective withdrawal of warm water or clean water can be determined by assessing accurately the possible benefits of each discharge 5 conclusions this study investigated the impact of selective withdrawal operations in the soyang reservoir on downstream fish habitats using a coupled hydrodynamic and habitat modeling approach the study area was an approximately 11 km reach downstream of the soyang gang dam in the soyang gang river korea the average water depth near the dam exceeds 110 m almost every year the stored water is stratified from may to june and destratification occurs from september to the following february for the assessment of the impact of selective withdrawal in the soyang reservoir phss were carried out with both adult and spawning z platypus as the target fish species three different selective withdrawal operations namely surface layer withdrawal middle layer withdrawal and bottom layer withdrawal were considered to simulate the change of the water temperature in the soyang reservoir the ce qual w2 model was used it was found that the dam discharges water at different temperatures depending on the selective withdrawal operations specifically the dam released water at a maximum temperature of about 25 c using surface layer withdrawal but the maximum water temperature was about 18 c in october using middle layer withdrawal hydraulic simulations were performed using the hec ras model and the distributions of flow depth velocity and water temperature were obtained over the study area habitat simulations were carried out using hscs results from the phss indicated that habitats of both adult and spawning z platypus were most suitable when surface layer withdrawal was used followed by middle and bottom layer withdrawals for example surface layer withdrawal increased the average wua for adult z platypus by 48 in the spring when compared to middle layer withdrawal and by 33 in the summer this is due to the fact that neither adult nor spawning z platypus prefer cold water released by middle and bottom layer withdrawals in addition spawning z platypus were more affected by the selective withdrawal operations than were adult z platypus because they are more sensitive to the water temperature the present study indicated that fish habitats in the regulated streams can be seriously degraded due to cold water releases from the dam but its impact can be reduced significantly using a selective withdrawal operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

4987,the soyang gang dam is one of large dams in korea highly turbid water has sometimes occurred in the reservoir after heavy rainfall lasting for long periods this turbid water necessitated the building of a selective withdrawal structure in 2017 the original purpose of this structure was to supply clean water from the dam to the downstream area the present study investigated the possibility of the other purpose to improve the quality of downstream fish habitats using selective withdrawal operations for this a coupled hydrodynamic and habitat modeling approach was used the study area was an 11 km reach located downstream of the soyang gang dam to compute the change of the water temperature in the soyang reservoir the ce qual w2 model was used using the results from the ce qaul w2 model the temperature of the water discharged from the dam was obtained for three selective withdrawal operations namely surface layer withdrawal middle layer withdrawal and bottom layer withdrawal hydrodynamic simulations were performed using the hec ras model and the distributions of the flow depth velocity and water temperature were obtained over the study area physical habitat simulations phss were carried out using habitat suitability curves hscs for both adult and spawning zacco platypus results from the phss indicated that fish habitats in the regulated streams can be seriously degraded due to cold water releases from the dam but its impact can be reduced significantly using selective withdrawal operations keywords selective withdrawal water temperature physical habitat simulation habitat suitability curve ce qual w2 1 introduction in general dam construction induces changes in the hydrologic regime of the reach downstream of the dam maingi and marsh 2002 batalla et al 2004 magilligan and nislow 2005 the floods disappear and the downstream reach experiences fluctuations in flow if the dam is operated for hydropower generation to follow economic market supply and demand namely peak flow during the period of hydropower generation and base flow during the recession period this is called hydropeaking flows many researchers have investigated the impact of hydropeaking flows on the downstream habitat of aquatic animals and have revealed that they have negative impacts freeman et al 2001 boavida et al 2015 schmutz et al 2015 choi et al 2017 in addition to the hydrologic regime change the flow regulation by the dam leads to changes in the thermal regime of the downstream reach zhong and power 1996 rolls et al 2013 the temperature of the water released from the dam is likely to be different from that of the water flowing in the downstream reach kedra and wiejaczka 2018 he et al 2020 specially for most large dams in korea hypolimnetic water released from the dam is cooler and warmer than water in the stream during the summer and winter respectively therefore the hydropeaking flows from the dam induce fluctuations in the water temperature in the reach downstream of the dam this is called thermopeaking and its impact was found to be as significant as that of hydropeaking naiman et al 2008 olden and naiman 2010 bruno et al 2013 in large dams the stratification of stored water begins in the spring during the summer a thermocline is clearly formed between the epilimnion and hypolimnion where water is warmer or less dense and cooler or denser respectively in the late fall the stratification is weakened as the surrounding air becomes cool water released from the hypolimnion may become anoxic and can induce cold water damage in agricultural produce if the water is used for irrigation specially water from the hypolimnetic layer can reduce the maximum water temperature in the summer and delay of water from reaching its maximum temperature for several weeks olden and naiman 2010 previous studies revealed that cold water releases from the hypolimnetic layer in a reservoir degrades the quality of fish habitats in the downstream reach of the dam preece and jones 2002 kang et al 2017 song et al 2018 gray et al 2019 wu et al 2019 for example preece and jones 2002 studied the impact of cold water discharge from the keepit dam on downstream fish habitats in the namoi river australia they found the maximum daily temperature downstream of the dam to be lowered by approximately 5 c and the annual maximum temperature to occur three weeks later compared to the pre dam conditions in addition the lowered water temperature was found to disrupt thermal spawning cues for native fish species todd et al 2005 investigated the impact of cold water releases on post spawning survival of murray cod in the mitta mitta river australia using the stochastic population model they predicted a 50 reduction in post spawning survival at temperatures below 14 8 c revealing that cold water releases can be a significant threat to the murray cod population abdo et al 2018 examined the effect of the irapé reservoir in brazil on the growth and gonadal maturation of prochilodus hartii they investigated the maturation and gonadosomatic indices of p hartii in the downstream reaches of the reservoir and found that the reduced temperatures negatively impacted the somatic growth and gonadal development of p hartii in korea discharges from the large dams often caused water quality problems in the downstream area specifically the high turbidity and low temperature of the released flow negatively affected agriculture and habitat quality of downstream aquatic animals choi 2001 when heavy rainfalls poured a large amount of fine sediment inflow into the dam occurred and highly turbid water lasted in the reservoir for about a year yum et al 2011 for the supply of clean water from the dam the korean government established a so called turbidity reduction plan in 2007 and one of the action plans was to build a selective withdrawal structure in the reservoir previously olden and naiman 2010 and kang et al 2017 provided a possibility of mitigating damage from cold water releases by controlling the temperature of the water released from the dam however no previous studies have confirmed this quantitatively this study explores the research question can we use the selective withdrawal facility built for discharging clear water during the occurrence of turbid water in large dams to reduce the damage from the cold water release we used an ecohydraulic modeling framework to assess quantitatively the impact of selective withdrawal on downstream fish habitats in order to assess habitat quality of the target fish quantitatively the physical habitat simulation phs was used the phs is an ecohydraulic model that quantifies the quality of habitats for target fish species in a stream phs evaluates the suitability of habitat variables at a particular rate of discharge bovee 1982 booker and dunbar 2004 in the present study two metrics namely composite suitability index csi and weighted usable area wua were used in the phs to evaluate the spatial distribution of habitat suitability and quantity of available habitats in the study area respectively the study area was an approximately 11 km reach of the soyang gang river located downstream of the soyang gang dam one of large dams in korea the annual change in the water temperature in the reservoir was computed and the temperature of the water released from the dam was obtained for various selective withdrawal schemes then hydraulic and water temperature simulations were carried out for various selective withdrawal operations resulting in habitat variables over the study area finally the habitat simulations were performed and the csi and wua were obtained for various selective withdrawal operations 2 material and methods to investigate the impact of selective withdrawal from a thermally stratified reservoir on downstream fish habitats three stages of numerical simulations were carried out first the distribution of the water temperature in the reservoir was simulated using the ce qual w2 model the annual variation in the temperature of the water released from the dam was obtained and used to compute the change in the water temperature in the study area for a given discharge second hydrodynamic and water temperature simulations were carried out in the downstream reach of the dam using the hec ras model the longitudinal distributions of the flow depth velocity and water temperature over the study area were obtained finally phss were carried out using the habitat suitability curves hscs with the results from the hydrodynamic and water temperature simulations the csi distributions and wua values were obtained and used to evaluate the quality of the fish habitat downstream of the dam numerical simulations were carried out for the year of 2005 when typical dam operations were made without serious floods nor droughts 2 1 study area an 11 km reach of the soyang gang river located downstream of the soyang gang dam was selected as the study area fig 1 the soyang gang river is a tributary of the bukhan gang river located in the north eastern part of korea the watershed area and total length of the soyang gang river are 2798 50 km2 and 156 80 km respectively the median size of the bed sediment in the study area ranges from 12 mm to 18 mm indicating a gravel bed river ministry of construction and transportation 2002 based on the inflow discharges to the soyang gang dam recorded from 2005 to 2017 the drought flow q355 low flow q275 normal flow q185 and high flow q95 are 1 52 3 60 5 80 and 12 26 m3 s respectively here qn denotes the average discharge which are exceeded on n days of the year construction of the soyang gang dam began in 1967 and was completed in 1973 the height and width of the dam are 123 m and 530 m respectively the total storage capacity of the dam is 2 9 109 m3 the elevation of dam crest is 203 el m at the water surface level of 193 5 el m the volume surface area and maximum depth are 1 9 109 m3 65 4 km2 and 113 5 m respectively korea water resources corporation 1999 the soyang reservoir is known to have a long retention time of approximately 0 7 years due to the small amount of inflow to the dam kim et al 2001 the shape of the reservoir is dendritic extending 60 km along its primary axis with a mean width of 0 5 km see fig 1 the original intake facility of the soyang gang dam withdrew water at 130 150 el m corresponding to heights of 53 73 m below the dam crest however the discharges from the intake facility of the dam often caused water quality problems in the downstream area specifically the low temperature and high turbidity of the released flow negatively affected agriculture and habitat quality of downstream aquatic animals choi 2001 when typhoon ewiniar hit the korean peninsula in 2006 a large amount of fine sediment inflow into the dam occurred with a maximum hourly rainfall of 88 mm thereafter highly turbid water in the reservoir lasted for about eight months for the supply of clean water from the dam the korean government established a so called turbidity reduction plan and one of the action plans was to build a selective withdrawal structure in the reservoir the construction of the selective withdrawal structure see fig 2 a by korea water resources corporation began in 2009 and ended in 2017 the selective withdrawal structure can release water at different elevations which enables selective withdrawal operations in a stratified reservoir as shown in fig 2 b 2 2 methods 2 2 1 temperature distribution modeling in the soyang reservoir the ce qual w2 model was used to simulate the annual variation of the water temperature in the soyang reservoir at hourly resolution the ce qual w2 model is a two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model which is capable of calculating water surface elevation velocity temperature and water quality components such as ammonium nitrate nitrite and phosphorus cole and wells 2018 the ce qual w2 model assumes that lateral variations in velocity temperature and constituents are negligible this assumption is valid for large reservoirs in mountainous areas the shape of which is long narrow and deep in the length width and depth respectively all of these are true in the soyang reservoir computational grids in the ce qual w2 model were constructed using bathymetry data surveyed by korea water resources cooperation 2007 and the longitudinal and vertical grids were given by the segment and the layer respectively in the present study the computational grids for the soyang reservoir are composed of 125 segments and 123 layers fig 3 to simulate the distribution of the water temperature in the reservoir using the ce qual w2 model both the inflow and outflow are required together with meteorological data such as air temperature dew point temperature wind velocity wind direction and cloud cover in this study hourly meteorological data obtained from chuncheon station for the year of 2005 were used korea meteorological administration http kma go kr accessed february 12 2019 hourly time series data for the inflows and hydropeaking flows were obtained from the water management information system wamis http wamis go kr accessed 13 february 2019 the water temperature of the inflow was estimated using the following equations 1a t w 0 32 t air 0 34 t dew 7 69 for q 300 m 3 s 1b t w 0 02 t air 0 24 t dew 11 04 for q 300 m 3 s where t w is water temperature t air is air temperature and t dew is dew point temperature eqs 1a and 1b were obtained by korea water resources corporation 2007 using a regression analysis of the observed data in the study area fig 4 a and 4 b show the inflows to and hydropeaking flows from the soyang gang dam in 2005 respectively regarding the inflows to the dam flood flows occurred in april june july august and september in 2005 and the peak flows of the floods ranged between 257 2 and 832 8 m3 s except for in flood seasons low flows were maintained in terms of the hydropeaking flows from the dam the daily peak discharges during hydropower generation ranged from 200 to 230 m3 s and the base flows during the hydropower generation recession period ranges between 0 3 and 0 5 m3 s 2 2 2 hydrodynamic and water temperature simulation in the downstream reach of the soyang gang dam changes of the hydraulic and water temperature conditions induced by hydropeaking flows from the dam were simulated using the hec ras model u s army corps of engineers 2010 at hourly resolution the hec ras model solves the saint venant equations for flow and the advection dispersion equation for the water temperature thirty cross sections were used to construct the topography of the study reach in the hec ras model the average distance between the cross sections was about 390 m for the hydraulic simulations hydropeaking flows from the soyang gang dam and the normal depth were used as upstream and downstream boundary conditions respectively in this study a roughness coefficient of 0 035 suggested by ministry of construction and transportation 2002 was used for simulations of the water temperature the water temperature of inflows from the upstream boundary is required in this study the water temperature of the discharge from the dam obtained by the ce qual w2 model was used as the upstream boundary condition other than this to compute the water temperature using the hec ras model meteorological data are needed such as atmospheric pressure air temperature humidity shortwave radiation cloudiness and wind speed in this study hourly recorded meteorological data obtained from chuncheon station were used korea meteorological administration http kma go kr accessed february 12 2019 2 2 3 hscs for z platypus field monitoring by chae and yoon 2001 revealed that the dominant fish species in rivers in the soyang gang river basin are z platypus 21 1 followed by zacco temmincki 14 8 microphysogobio yaluensis 10 3 moroco oxycephalus 10 1 coreoleuciscus splendidus 4 8 and nemacheilus toni 4 3 in this study both adult and spawning stages of z platypus were selected as the target fish species for the phss for the flow depth and velocity the hscs for adult and spawning z platypus proposed by sung et al 2005 were used see fig 5 a and 5 b these hscs were constructed using field monitoring data from the nakdong gang river basin the data included the observed population against the flow depth and velocity then the constructed hscs were adjusted by expert judgement for the water temperature hscs for both adult and spawning z platypus were constructed see fig 5 c to construct hscs related to the water temperature for adult and spawning z platypus previous findings in the literature were used kang et al 2017 indicated that warm water fish in korea including cyprinid species e g z platypus achieve their highest growth rate in the temperature range of 23 to 28 c choi and choi 2018 found that adult z platypus has a strong preference for water temperatures in the range of 20 25 c and a moderate preference for those in the range of 15 20 c based on these findings in the present study the optimal water temperature range for adult z platypus was set as 20 28 c the lower and upper limits of the temperature tolerance for adult z platypus were determined to be 3 c and 31 c respectively kim 1999 kang et al 2013 it was assumed that the hsc changes linearly between the optimal range and the lower and upper limits of the temperature the spawning season of z platypus is known to be from may to august when the water temperature increases significantly in korea cho and reu 1998 yeom et al 2007 regarding the optimal range of the water temperature for spawning z platypus because z platypus spawns only in a certain water temperature range as do other fish species the range of the preferred water temperature is likely to be narrower than that required by adult z platypus for spawning z platypus the optimal range of the water temperature was set at 23 28 c this is based on laboratory experiments conducted to identify the suitable condition of the water temperature for hatching z platypus nam et al 1999 moon et al 2012 temperatures of 12 c and 31 c were set as the lower and upper limits of the tolerance respectively for spawning z platypus kim 1999 kang et al 2013 2 2 4 habitat simulation phss were carried out to investigate the impact of the discharge from the dam using various selective withdrawal operations on habitat quality of the target fish species in this study such habitat variables as flow depth velocity and water temperature were used in the phs the overall habitat suitability is indicated by the csi which is a combined value of each habitat suitability calculated by hscs the following geometric mean method was used to compute the csi 2 csi f h f v f t 1 3 where f h v is the suitability value for each habitat variable hv here hv includes flow depth h velocity v and water temperature t the values of the csi range between zero and unity indicating the worst and optimal habitats respectively the wua is an index indicating the habitat potential for the target species in the study area bovee 1982 the wua can be estimated by the csi distribution over the study area using the following relationship 3 wua i 1 n csi i a i where n is the total number of cells c s i i is the csi of the i th cell and a i is the area of the i th cell the wua ratio is the wua divided by the wetted area of the study reach and is given by 4 wua ratio i 1 n csi i a i a total where a t o t a l is the total wetted area 2 3 experimental design various selective withdrawal scenarios were tested to assess the impact of selective withdrawal on downstream fish habitats in the present study three scenarios of water release from the dam were considered based on different selective withdrawal operations according to the elevation of water intake the selective withdrawal operations can largely be classified into three options namely surface layer withdrawal middle layer withdrawal and bottom layer withdrawal before the selective withdrawal structure was constructed the soyang gang dam released water at about 130 150 el m corresponding to the height of the middle layer the elevations of surface layer and bottom layer withdrawals were assumed to be 160 180 el m and 95 115 el m respectively annual variations of the temperature of the water released from the dam were obtained using the simulation results from the ce qual w2 model then hydrodynamic simulations were performed with the hec ras model and the distributions of the flow depth velocity and water temperature were obtained over the study area habitat simulations were carried out for the three selective withdrawal scenarios using the phs in the phs two metrics such as csi and wua were used to evaluate habitat quality of the target fish the spatial distribution of habitat suitability and quantity of available habitat in the study area were evaluated using the csi distribution and wua values respectively comparative analysis was conducted using the results from the phs and the impact of selective withdrawals on downstream fish habitats was evaluated 3 results 3 1 water temperature scenarios for selective withdrawal operations 3 1 1 validation of the ce qual w2 model for the validation of the ce qual w2 model computed water temperatures were compared with the measured data at hourly resolution in this study numerical simulations were carried out to compute the two dimensional distribution of the water temperature in the soyang reservoir in 2005 the model coefficients suggested by kim and kim 2006 were used in the ce qual w2 model and are listed in table 1 fig 6 shows spatial distributions of the water temperature in the reservoir on eight different days in 2005 it can be seen that the water temperature in march 2005 was nearly uniform in the vertical direction but increased from the water surface from may 2005 in july 2005 the water temperature near the water surface increased to 27 3 c and the thermocline was formed at 140 0 el m showing the thermal stratification of the reservoir in october the water temperature near the water surface started to decrease and a weak stratification was maintained in december 2005 fig 7 presents comparisons between the water temperature computed by the ce qual w2 model and the measured data at a station located upstream of the dam marked as a circle in fig 1 it can be seen that the computed water temperature compares favorably to measured data the ranges of the mean absolute error and the coefficient of determination were 0 15 0 93 c and 0 92 0 99 respectively indicating that the ce qual w2 model predicted successfully the annual change in the water temperature of the soyang reservoir 3 1 2 annual water temperature scenarios for selective withdrawal operations fig 8 shows simulated annual temperature changes in the water released from the dam for the various selective withdrawal operations for this calculation the simulation results from the ce qual w2 model were used in the present study the impact of withdrawal on the water temperature in the reservoir was neglected the symbols on the lines are values of the water temperature computed at 12 00 on 15 of each month at hourly resolution the measured water temperature obtained from previous discharges without the selective withdrawal structure was also given for comparison kim 2010 it can be seen that the water temperature changes significantly depending on the selective withdrawal operation when surface layer withdrawal was used the overall water temperature appeared to be high specifically the water temperature increased significantly from march to june and high water temperatures were maintained during june to august showing a maximum temperature of 24 7 c for middle layer withdrawal the water temperature increased rapidly from june to august and was high during september to october the highest water temperature in this period was 17 7 c interestingly the calculated water temperature for middle layer withdrawal was in good agreement with the measured data this is because as stated earlier before the construction of the selective withdrawal structure the soyang gang dam released water at about 130 150 el m which corresponds to the height of the middle layer the temperature difference between surface layer withdrawal and middle layer withdrawal increased from april showing a maximum value of 13 6 c in june and the difference decreased to 2 3 c in october compared to the water temperatures for both surface and middle layer withdrawals the water temperature for bottom layer withdrawal was more or less constant at about 6 c without great variation the release of water from the bottom layer was expected to negatively affect downstream fish habitats due to its seriously low water temperature throughout the year seasonal characteristics of the change in the water temperature can also be seen in fig 8 when surface layer withdrawal was used the highest water temperatures were maintained for all seasons specifically average values of the water temperature were 10 9 23 9 20 2 and 9 5 c for spring summer fall and winter respectively for middle layer withdrawal the respective water temperatures were 6 3 12 8 17 0 and 9 1 c it is interesting to note that the water temperature for surface layer withdrawal was highest in summer while the water temperature for middle layer withdrawal was highest in fall the differences in the water temperature between the surface layer and middle layer withdrawal operations were 10 4 and 0 5 c in summer and winter respectively these correspond to the maximum and minimum differences respectively in a year 3 2 impact of selective withdrawal operations on downstream fish habitats results from the previous section indicated that the difference in the water temperature for surface and middle layer withdrawals increased from spring to summer reaching a maximum in june specifically surface layer withdrawal might increase the water temperature over 20 c after june which greatly affects the growth and spawning of the target fish species fig 9 a and 9 b show csi distributions from phss for the peak flow during hydropower generation on june 28 2005 for adult and spawning z platypus respectively the csi distribution in the figures changes in the transverse direction although one dimensional hydraulic simulations were carried out this is because the cross section was divided into 20 40 sub sections by verticals and the value of csi is constant in each sub section the figure compared the csi distributions of the three withdrawals for the peak flow the overall csi of surface layer withdrawal appeared to be relatively high followed by the csi of middle and bottom layer withdrawals this is mainly due to the fact that the water temperature of surface layer withdrawal was most suitable for both adult and spawning z platypus in the downstream reach specifically the water temperature of surface layer withdrawal ranged between 23 7 and 25 1 c indicating that the water temperature which was 23 7 c immediately downstream of the dam increased along the downstream direction due to the surrounding air however the water temperature ranges of middle and bottom layer withdrawals were 11 1 14 1 c and 4 9 8 5 c respectively see fig s3 in supplementary material the water temperature of these withdrawals was not suitable for both adult and spawning z platypus as can be seen in fig 5 c fig 10 shows similar csi distributions for the base flow during the hydropower generation recession period overall the csis were relatively high compared to those of the peak flow during hydropower generation period shown in fig 9 this is because the base flow provided relatively a shallow water depth with moderate velocity which was suitable for habitats of the target fish species specifically the average values of the flow depth and velocity were 1 06 m and 0 95 m s for the peak flow while those for the base were 0 36 m and 0 34 m s respectively see figs s1 and s2 in supplementary material it is also noteworthy that the overall csi of surface layer withdrawal was higher than that of middle layer withdrawal under the base flow condition this is related to the fact that the water temperature in the reach downstream of the dam ranged between 23 8 and 23 9 c meaning that if the dam releases water from surface layer withdrawal it is good for habitats of z platypus in contrast middle and bottom layer withdrawals induced water temperatures in the range of 6 0 13 2 c which were too low for both the adult and spawning stages of z platypus see fig s4 in supplementary material fig 11 shows comparisons of the wua ratios computed from the csi distributions in figs 9 and 10 in general it can be seen that the wua ratios for the base flow were larger than those of the peak flow this is because the peak flow provided deep fast water which degraded habitat quality of the target fish species specifically for surface layer withdrawal the wua ratio of the base flow was about 4 1 times larger than that of the peak flow this is true for both adult and spawning z platypus for adult z platypus the wua ratio of surface layer withdrawal was highest followed by that of middle and bottom layer withdrawal regardless of the flow condition this is related to the water temperature of surface layer withdrawal which was ideal for maintaining the optimal condition of the downstream habitat of the target fish species a similar trend can be observed in the wua ratios of spawning z platypus that is the wua ratio of surface layer withdrawal was larger than that of middle layer withdrawal however the wua ratio of bottom layer withdrawal was zero for both peak flow and base flow the water temperature for bottom layer withdrawal was 4 7 c in june which provided zero suitability in terms of the water temperature for spawning z platypus as can be seen in fig 5 c in addition the figure indicated that spawning z platypus were more affected by the type of withdrawal released than were adult z platypus fig 12 shows the annual changes in the wua according to the three withdrawal operations in general the wua of all withdrawal operations was observed to change daily due to hydropeaking flows wua values showed the daily maximum and minimum for the base and peak flows during the periods of recession and hydropower generation respectively over a year a general feature seen in the figure was that the wua of surface layer withdrawal was the largest followed by those of middle and bottom layer withdrawal fig 12 a revealed that the wua for adult z platypus relating to surface layer withdrawal increased significantly from april to july for spawning z platypus the wuas of all withdrawal operations were zero from january to march fig 12 b indicating that the study area did not provide suitable habitats for spawning z platypus the wua of surface layer withdrawal which began to increase from april was highest from june to september the period of high wua includes the spawning season similarly for spawning z platypus the wuas of surface and bottom layer withdrawals were the largest and smallest respectively the seasonal change in the wua for adult z platypus is depicted in fig 13 to obtain the seasonal change wua values in fig 12 a were averaged over the four seasons for each season it can be seen that the average wua of surface layer withdrawal was largest followed by the average wuas of middle and bottom layer withdrawal the only exception was in the spring when the wuas of middle and bottom layer withdrawals were nearly the same this is due to the water temperature in the surface layer increasing in the spring when the water temperature in the middle layer was almost same as that in the bottom layer as can be seen in fig 8 it is also noteworthy that surface layer withdrawal improved habitat quality the most in the spring compared to the other seasons quantitatively the wua of surface layer withdrawal was 48 larger than that of middle layer withdrawal in the spring this is because the temperature of the water taken at the surface layer was significantly higher than that taken at the middle layer for surface layer withdrawal the wua in the summer was highest followed by the wuas in the fall spring and winter indicating that the study area provided the target fish species with the most suitable habitat in that order of seasons similarly the wua values for spawning z platypus were averaged over the spawning season it was found that the average wuas of middle and bottom layer withdrawals were about 35 and 5 respectively of the average wua of surface layer withdrawal this suggests that middle and bottom layer withdrawals can seriously degrade the quality of habitats of spawning z platypus especially during the spawning season particularly bottom layer withdrawal can deteriorate habitats of spawning z platypus to a fatal level 4 discussion the soyang gang dam released water from the hypolimnetic layer before the selective withdrawal structure was equipped simulation and monitoring results showed that the annual pattern of the water temperature in the reach downstream of the soyang gang dam was consistent in that cold water was discharged during the warm months from spring to summer and the delay of water from reaching its maximum temperature occurred for several weeks olden and naiman 2010 indicated that this phenomenon occurred all the way through in the reaches regulated by large hypolimnetic release dams over the world in addition simulation results indicated that middle layer and bottom layer withdrawals can degrade habitat quality of the target fish species in the reach downstream of the soyang gang dam it is because temperature of water released from these layers may not reach the suitable condition for the target fish species this result conforms to previous findings in the literature which reported negative impacts of cold water releases from the dam such as disruption of spawning cues preece and jones 2002 reduction in post spawning survival todd et al 2005 and decrease in the growth of fishes abdo et al 2018 song et al 2018 in korea kang et al 2017 studied the impact of cold water releases from the andong dam on gonad development of z platypus in the nakdong gang river basin kang et al found that the water temperature in the reach downstream of the andong dam was lower by 6 10 c than that of neighboring reaches they also confirmed that gonad development of z platypus was seriously delayed which can be attributed to the release of cold water from the dam kang et al s 2017 study suggests that z platypus in the downstream reach of the soyang gang dam can be damaged in gonad development if middle layer withdrawal or bottom layer withdrawal was used the reduced growth rate of fish caused by cold water releases from the dam from spring to fall might also decrease the survival rate of the fish in the winter as the water temperature decreases in the late fall fish experience reduced food availability and a decrease in swimming and feeding abilities beamish 1978 parsons and smiley 2003 then the fish start to minimize energy expenditure via inactivity and sustain low metabolic rates speers roesch et al 2018 in the winter small fish undergo higher rates of starvation and mortality because they exhaust reserves more rapidly than do larger fish post and evans 1989 schultz and conover 1999 a previous study by van de wolfshaar 2006 revealed that fish that are undergrown spring to fall struggle to survive during the winter the results from the present study suggest that surface layer withdrawal would increase the possibility of survival of the target fish species during the winter by increasing the growth rate of the fish from spring to fall the present study proposed selective withdrawal as an alternative to reduce the damage caused by cold water releases in a large dam it was shown that the release from surface layer withdrawal increased the water temperature significantly leading to the improvement of the quality of downstream habitat of z platypus this may positively affect habitat quality of other warm water fish species in the study area such as m yaluensis however it has also been reported that cold water fish species such as m oxycephalus and c splendidus also inhabit the soyang gang river basin warm water release might negatively affect habitat quality of cold water fish species as indicated by lessard and hayes 2003 and horne et al 2004 therefore it might be desirable to properly determine the withdrawal height that meets the requirements of a target fish community rather than of a single target fish species previous studies for example olden and naiman 2010 have pointed out the selective withdrawal structure can be used to improve downstream fish habitats even though the impact of selective withdrawal operations on downstream water temperatures has been studied yang et al 2012 rheinheimer et al 2015 the direct impact on the fish habitats has not been investigated therefore there has been a lack of understanding of specific spatial and temporal impacts of selective withdrawal operations on downstream fish habitats in the present study an ecohydraulic modeling framework was established to assess these impacts two quantitative indices csi and wua in the phs successfully showed spatial and seasonal impacts of the selective withdrawal operations on downstream fish habitats indicating that the phs an ecohydraulic model can be a suitable approach for the comparative analysis of various selective withdrawal operations this study can be used in decision making in the reservoir management for the protection of fish habitats in the downstream reach of the dam where cold water damages are serious due to the dam operation a complicated situation might occur leading the manager of the reservoir to face the tradeoffs between different uses of water for example if the selective withdrawal structure is used to release surface water in the reservoir to improve downstream fish habitats the discharge of turbid water from the dam can be limited especially during the rainy season then turbid water in the reservoir can last for a long time which can lead to the disruption of the public water supply chou and wu 2010 and the acceleration of fine sediment deposition in the reservoir schleiss et al 2016 in such case the selective withdrawal of warm water or clean water can be determined by assessing accurately the possible benefits of each discharge 5 conclusions this study investigated the impact of selective withdrawal operations in the soyang reservoir on downstream fish habitats using a coupled hydrodynamic and habitat modeling approach the study area was an approximately 11 km reach downstream of the soyang gang dam in the soyang gang river korea the average water depth near the dam exceeds 110 m almost every year the stored water is stratified from may to june and destratification occurs from september to the following february for the assessment of the impact of selective withdrawal in the soyang reservoir phss were carried out with both adult and spawning z platypus as the target fish species three different selective withdrawal operations namely surface layer withdrawal middle layer withdrawal and bottom layer withdrawal were considered to simulate the change of the water temperature in the soyang reservoir the ce qual w2 model was used it was found that the dam discharges water at different temperatures depending on the selective withdrawal operations specifically the dam released water at a maximum temperature of about 25 c using surface layer withdrawal but the maximum water temperature was about 18 c in october using middle layer withdrawal hydraulic simulations were performed using the hec ras model and the distributions of flow depth velocity and water temperature were obtained over the study area habitat simulations were carried out using hscs results from the phss indicated that habitats of both adult and spawning z platypus were most suitable when surface layer withdrawal was used followed by middle and bottom layer withdrawals for example surface layer withdrawal increased the average wua for adult z platypus by 48 in the spring when compared to middle layer withdrawal and by 33 in the summer this is due to the fact that neither adult nor spawning z platypus prefer cold water released by middle and bottom layer withdrawals in addition spawning z platypus were more affected by the selective withdrawal operations than were adult z platypus because they are more sensitive to the water temperature the present study indicated that fish habitats in the regulated streams can be seriously degraded due to cold water releases from the dam but its impact can be reduced significantly using a selective withdrawal operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

4988,studying the temporal dynamics and fluxes of riverine dissolved carbon is crucial in understanding the regional and global carbon cycles under various climatic conditions here we studied the behaviors and fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc responding to various hydrologic conditions in the min river originated from tibetan plateau the dic concentrations decreased with increasing runoff partially reflecting dilution effect which may be ascribed to the shortened fluid transit time and then the reduced contact time with rocks nevertheless doc concentrations were positively correlated with runoff which can be attributed to that a large amount of soil organic carbon flowed into the river as a result of the strong flushing effect the negative relationship between δ13cdic and runoff could be explained by soil co2 influx and organic matter degradation during the high flow season δdic the production of dic with changing hydrologic conditions had a strong positive correlation with water temperature due to the accelerated dic production rates by high temperature which always co varied with intense precipitation in asian monsoonal regions the mean dic doc ratio in the min river was 15 09 and the doc and dic fluxes were 1 1 and 15 2 t c km 2 yr 1 respectively for the studied year and the doc and dic fluxes varied dramatically with runoff changes suggesting that hydrologic conditions were critical factors for the variations in dissolved carbon export this study shows that carbon dynamics of rivers draining from the tibetan plateau are greatly affected by short term climatic variabilities which has implications for understanding global carbon cycle under future climate change keywords carbon dynamics hydrologic conditions carbon isotope tibetan plateau 1 introduction river networks have drawn increasing attention centered on regional and global carbon budgets marx et al 2017 schefuß et al 2016 as the riverine carbon cycle plays a significant role in providing feedbacks on future global climate change cox et al 2000 doctor et al 2008 riverine carbon transportation can be affected by multiple biogeochemical processes such as organic matter degradation co2 degassing and sediment deposition in the floodplains and continental shelf marwick et al 2015 these processes have a significant effect on carbon dynamics and budgets so the budgets of carbon from land to the inland waters are still unclear aufdenkampe et al 2011 cole et al 2007 marwick et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 dissolved forms of carbon include dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc both of which have profound influences on aquatic food web processes and ecosystem sustainability findlay 2010 tank et al 2010 tian et al 2015 and therefore play an important role in the global carbon cycle riverine carbon dynamics are highly shifted by changing hydrologic and temperature conditions bengtson and bengtsson 2007 romero mujalli et al 2018 tian et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 2020 for example dic and doc concentrations and fluxes are closely related to hydrologic conditions and sensitive to runoff variations strohmeier et al 2013 zhong et al 2020 the runoff is projected to increase as a result of increasing rainfall in the next few decades on the tibetan plateau li et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 as climate extremes are expected to become more frequent and intense due to global warming seneviratne et al 2012 therefore studying the mechanisms and impacts of short term climate variabilities on carbon dynamics can improve our understanding about the effects of future global climate change on the carbon budget reichstein et al 2013 using a coupled hydrological biogeochemical model ren et al 2015 reported that climate related changes and rising atmospheric co2 would be responsible for more than 90 of the increase in dic fluxes for the mississippi river throughout the 21st century which is similar to the findings of tian et al 2015 furthermore boano et al 2014 showed that stream pco2 dynamics are highly influenced by the hyporheic zone across different climate zones doc fluxes were highly controlled by hydrologic conditions climate patterns and episodic weather events in the south florida estuaries regier et al 2016 however the effects of short term climate variabilities on carbon dynamics and fluxes of tibetan rivers were still elusive the annual global exports of dic and doc transported by river systems into the ocean were estimated to be approximately 0 41 pg 1 pg 1015 g cai 2011 and 0 17 pg dai et al 2012 respectively accordingly the total dissolved carbon flux represents about 68 of the total carbon flux 0 85 pg bauer et al 2013 from rivers to estuaries making up a significant component of global oceanic carbon budgets as one of the most climate sensitive areas in the world more than 80 of the glaciers have retreated in the tibetan plateau altering the water supply for billions of people and atmospheric circulation chen et al 2013 qiu 2008 affecting hydrologic conditions and therefore change the riverine carbon export thus deciphering riverine dic and doc dynamics in the min river would shed a light on the dissolved carbon dynamics of the plateau rivers although anthropogenic activities in the lower reaches may also affect the riverine carbon additionally tibetan plateau plays an important role in global carbon cycles as a result of climate changes chen et al 2013 peng et al 2015 and considering the importance of chemical weathering on the tibetan plateau for the global cooling in the cenozoic is still in debate raymo and ruddiman 1992 xiao et al 2015 wolff boenisch et al 2009 the carbon budgets and dynamics should be re evaluated in order to better understand the carbon cycles in these riverine systems zhang et al 2013 especially in the tibetan plateau rivers this study presents a monthly to daily sampling dataset of dic doc concentrations and isotope ratios of dic δ13cdic in the min river originated from tibetan plateau the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate temporal carbon dynamics under various hydrologic and temperature conditions 2 to determine the factors controlling carbon dynamics in the min river 3 to evaluate the role of dic fluxes from tibetan plateau rivers on global riverine dic fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the min river originates from the eastern edge of the tibetan plateau with a drainage area of 133 500 km2 yoon et al 2008 the min river has three main tributaries fig 1 the dadu river the qingyi river and the min river itself which converge at the sichuan basin an industrialized and densely populated fluvial plain qin et al 2006 zhong et al 2017a while the upper dadu river region has a plateau climate the other region has a subtropical climate with mean annual precipitation of 500 800 mm on the eastern tibetan plateau and 1200 1500 mm in the sichuan basin yoon et al 2008 the underlying geology of the drainage basin is mainly granite terrigenous sediments quaternary fluvial deposits volcanic rocks high grade metamorphic rocks and carbonates carbonate rocks mainly outcrop at the source area of the min river basin and are scattered in the sichuan basin and adjacent surrounding mountainous areas detailed information about the topography and geology of this system is available in studies by the bureau of geology and mineral resources of sichuan province 1991 2 2 sampling and chemical analyses twenty seven river water samples were collected near the gaochang hydrological station fig 1 located at the outlet of the min river basin the water samples were collected monthly and additional samples were collected depending on variations in discharge from november of 2013 to october of 2014 the ph was measured in situ and the water samples were filtered using cellulose acetate membrane with 0 45 μm pore size for dic and doc analyses detailed information about the sampling strategies and field techniques were described in the relevant published work zhong et al 2017a alkalinity was determined by titration with 0 02 mol l 1 of hydrochloric acid being the dominant carbon specie in mildly alkaline waters hco3 concentrations can be assumed to be equal to the concentrations of alkalinity and dic clark and fritz 1997 δ13cdic values were pretreated using a headspace analysis approach on the vacuum line and measured by finnigan mat 252 mass spectrometer li et al 2010 2014 zhong et al 2018 the doc concentrations were analyzed by a total organic carbon analyzer elemental high toc ii n germany and the partial pressure of dissolved co2 pco2 was determined using equilibrium equations at corresponding thermodynamic constants and water temperatures clark and fritz 1997 2 3 methods load estimator and concentration discharge relationship the dic and doc concentrations with corresponding daily discharge were used to model the daily concentrations and fluxes of dic and doc by load estimator loadest runkel et al 2004 the best regression model was automatically selected from nine models based on akaike information criteria aic in loadest and the approximate maximum likelihood estimator amle was chosen for estimation and calibration of daily fluxes the model used to estimate daily dic loads is 1 ln l o a d a 0 a 1 l n q a 2 l n q 2 while the model used for doc loads estimation is 2 ln l o a d a 0 a 1 l n q a 2 l n q 2 a 3 s i n 2 π d t i m e a 4 c o s 2 π d t i m e a 5 d t i m e a

seasonality consideration and a0 to a6 are the model coefficients concentration discharge c q relationships are often used to decipher the solutes biogeochemical processes under different hydrologic

between solute concentrations and river runoff if b 0 the solute concentrations are independent of discharge if b 1 the solute concentrations are only controlled by dilution with deionized water godsey et al 2009 3 results the river discharge of the gaochang hydrological station showed a significant seasonal trend with low discharges from the late autumn to spring and a pronounced increase heading into the summer until early autumn fig 2 the discharge reached the minimum value at 715 m3 s 1 in may and peaked at 9560 m3 s 1 in july with an average of 2616 m3 s 1 for the whole year june to october of 2014 was defined as the high flow season and november of 2013 to may of 2014 was defined as the low flow season with various discharge fluctuations the minimum water temperatures for the water samples was 9 9 c in january of 2014 and the maximum value was 24 5 c in august of 2014 dic and doc concentrations δ13cdic and pco2 values varied largely in the studied year fig 2 the elevated doc concentrations of the river water occurred during the high flow season ranging from 1 3 to 2 5 mg l 1 averaging 1 8 0 4 mg l 1 and the doc concentrations were relatively low during the low flow season ranging from 1 1 to 1 6 mg l 1 averaging 1 3 0 2 mg l 1 fig 2b contrary to doc concentrations dic concentrations showed higher values 127 1 mg l 1 to 140 4 mg l 1 averaging 134 1 5 1 mg l 1 in the low flow season and lower values 107 3 mg l 1 to 128 6 mg l 1 averaging 117 1 3 9 mg l 1 in the high flow season fig 2a the δ13cdic values ranged from 10 4 to 6 0 in the min river with an average of 8 3 for the studied year fig 2c the dic showed a relatively 13c enriched state between 7 8 to 6 0 averaging 6 6 0 6 in the low flow season after which it showed 13c depleted state in the high flow season with a range of 10 4 to 7 6 averaging 8 9 0 7 in addition the mean pco2 value was 0 97 0 37 10 3 atm with a much higher value in the low flow season 1 45 0 15 10 3 atm than that in the high flow season 0 80 0 25 10 3 atm fig 2d 4 discussion 4 1 hydrologic regulations of dic doc pco2 and δ13cdic significant negative correlations were observed for dic δ13cdic and pco2 versus runoff changes fig 3 riverine dic behaviors are influenced by multiple biogeochemical processes including soil co2 influxes water atmosphere exchange carbonate mineral dissolution precipitation and aquatic photosynthesis or respiration mcclanahan et al 2016 shin et al 2011 the min river showed high dic concentrations and pco2 values during the low flow season fig 2 which could be ascribed to the higher portions of subsurface flow water influx with higher dic and pco2 values atkins et al 2013 li et al 2010 zhong et al 2018 than those in the surface flow water with the arrival of high flow season the intense precipitation would cause high runoff and be responsible for the decrease of both dic concentrations fig 3a ascribed to the shortened fluid transit time tipper et al 2006 torres et al 2015 zhong et al 2017b and 2020 although high amounts of soil co2 were produced in the high flow season accelerated chemical weathering reduced the pco2 in the river water in addition the proportion of surface flow water would increase under high runoff conditions which has low dic and pco2 values showing dilution effects of dic and pco2 however the reactive mineral surface area could increase with the increasing runoff eiriksdottir et al 2013 also resulting in the near chemostatic behaviors of dic under high runoff conditions zhong et al 2017a similar c q relationships of dic were also observed in the three main tributaries of the min river located at luding xuankou and duoyinping qin et al 2006 the three tributaries had lower dic concentrations than those in the gaochang hydrological station under the same runoff conditions which could be mainly ascribed to the high temperature conditions and intense anthropogenic activities in the downstream qin et al 2006 the other possible reason was the rapid weathering kinetic of sporadic carbonate rocks in and around the sichuan basin under warm climatic conditions fig 1 although carbonate rocks only account for a small proportion of the drainage area water chemistry in the min river is significantly affected by carbonate weathering zhong et al 2017a other studies have also highlighted the importance of carbonate contribution to dic in rivers such that even trace amounts of carbonate minerals can bear responsibility for the remarkable effects of carbonate weathering barth et al 2003 carbonate weathering is proved to be a significant source of dic in the min river as a result of the relatively rapid dissolution kinetics zhong et al 2017a the doc concentrations are positively correlated with runoff in the min river fig 3b matching the global patterns wolfgang et al 1996 during high flow conditions rapid runoff preferentially flows through surface soil horizons and brings soil organic matter into river eimers et al 2008 mcclain et al 2003 mei et al 2014 shih et al 2018 this can be confirmed by a strong flushing effect in most rivers consistent with increasing doc concentrations under increasing runoff conditions atkins et al 2013 clark and fritz 1997 lloret et al 2013 in addition the average concentration of soil organic carbon is 3 24 kg m 2 at the lower reaches of the min river lai et al 2016 according to study of gao et al 2011 the soil organic carbon contribution caused by water erosion in the min river basin is high in china and therefore explain the relative high doc concentrations in high flow season similar to the min river doc in the jialing river also showed characteristics of terrestrial sources in the high flow season yan et al 2015 while in the low flow season deep groundwater may be the main contributor of baseflow and result in lower doc concentrations mei et al 2014 shih et al 2018 it should be noticed that anthropogenic activities changed the concentrations and chemical characteristics of doc which has been reported in previous studies e g molinero and burke 2009 as industrial and agricultural activities are active in the sichuan basin which may lead to the high amounts of doc in the rivers because of high fluxes of anthropogenic nutrients and sewage inputs atmospheric deposition and land use changes fu et al 2012 monteith et al 2007 moreover isotopic evidence showed that the groundwater of min river was polluted li et al 2006 which further supports that part of the anthropogenic doc may input to the min river however human induced doc inputs into rivers would be strengthened in the high flow season when surface runoff largely increase and soil organic carbon export also increase the extent of anthropogenic activities effects on doc export needs to be further studied in the future δ13cdic has been widely and successfully used to investigate the riverine dic origin and biogeochemical processes brunet et al 2005 khadka et al 2014 the δ13c value of carbonate bedrock is 0 typically for marine limestone mcclanahan et al 2016 soil co2 originated from the plant root respiration and heterotrophic respiration of soil organic matter with δ13c values from 34 to 24 averaging 28 khadka et al 2014 and a 4 4 enrichment would be produced for diffusion of soil co2 compared with organic matter cerling et al 1991 during the co2 dissolution and succeeding formation of dissolved carbon species 13c fractionation would produce δ13cdic values of soil water ranging from 23 to 13 averaging 17 telmer and veizer 1999 in this way the δ13cdic value derived from silicate weathering by soil co2 would be close to 17 and carbonate weathering by soil co2 would produce a δ13cdic value of 8 5 because half of the dic originates from the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the other half derives from the soil co2 li et al 2014 the mean δ13cdic value of the min river was 8 3 which was close to the δ13cdic value of carbonate weathering by soil co2 but was much heavier than the δ13c value of silicate weathering derived dic and dissolved soil co2 sourced from organic matter respiration there are four main reasons for the enrichment of 13c aquatic photosynthesis sulfuric acid participation in carbonate weathering co2 degassing and metamorphic co2 influx 1 aquatic photosynthesis may be much stronger in the high flow season mainly in summer than in the low flow season mainly in winter due to high water temperature and strong solar radiation in the high flow season which will shift 13c riched values but photosynthesis can be weakened by shortened residence time he and xu 2017 and the reduced water clarity sun et al 2011 because of high suspended matter i e more than 90 of river sediments are concentrated in the high flow season in the min river calculated from international research and training center on erosion and sedimentation 2014 therefore photosynthesis played a less important role for δ13cdic changes evidences from the 13c depleted values in the high flow season 2 the δ13cdic produced by carbonate weathering using sulfuric acid are consistent with the previous work in southwestern china li et al 2008 sulfur and oxygen isotopes of dissolved sulfate analyses in the min river indicated that dissolved sulfate mainly originates from burning coal yoon et al 2008 zhao et al 2015 therefore sulfuric acid participation in carbonate weathering played an important role in 13c enriched values in the low flow season for the min river 3 another explanation of the enrichment of 13c in river water dic could be attributed to co2 degassing which would cause 13c enrichment downstream as a result of isotopic fractionation of dic in the low flow season doctor et al 2008 polsenaere and abril 2012 shin et al 2011 co2 will diffuse out of water when the pco2 of the surface water is higher than that of the ambient atmosphere ran et al 2017 which is the case of the min river because pco2 of river water samples exceeds twice the atmospheric co2 concentration in the low flow season co2 emission rate can be reduced in the high flow season due to the shortened transit time in the river channel inducing light δ13cdic in the high flow season 4 the last possible reason is metamorphic carbon input due to himalayan orogenic movement becker et al 2008 evans et al 2008 gaillardet and galy 2008 which have 13c enriched values galy and france lanord 1999 and these springs can shift 13c enriched values when they discharge into rivers the δ13cdic values of thermal springs varied from 3 6 to 2 8 in the kangding county fig 1 with up to 60 of the co2 from the springs discharged into the hydrosphere yang et al 1999 however considering that the low proportion of thermal springs discharge in the total discharge of min river and the long distance between locations of these thermal springs luo 1994 and the gaochang hydrological station metamorphic carbon contribution may not be important for the 13c enrichment which is consistent with li et al 2014 in this study a significant negative relationship between δ13cdic and runoff was observed in the min river fig 2c with increasing runoff carbonate weathering was accelerated by the increased reaction surface area eiriksdottir et al 2013 zhong et al 2020 in addition large amounts of soil co2 were produced in the high flow season because of the high temperature and intense precipitation li et al 2010 zhong et al 2018 the water with soil co2 of 13c depleted values flushed into the river during rain events shifting 13c depleted values with the increase of runoff 4 2 temperature regulations of dissolved carbon species the increasing temperature accelerated riverine dic production as a result of enhanced weathering rates zhong et al 2018 δdic was used in this study which was calculated as the measured dic value subtracting the theoretical dic value i e the value when dic concentration is diluted by deionized water which refers to b 1 in the power law function to represent the production of dic with changing hydrologic conditions and constrain the exogenous sources of dic zhong et al 2018 similar to the xijiang river δdic has a strong positive correlation with water temperature fig 4 a which is highly affected by air temperature consistent with that high temperatures accelerated the dissolution rate of minerals with high temperature in the warm season large amounts of soil co2 were produced accelerating the chemical weathering rates zhong et al 2018 in addition large amounts of soil organic matter within the surface flow flowed into the river induced by intense rainfall during the high flow season li et al 2010 which caused high doc concentrations in the high flow season fig 4b the degradation of both soil organic matter and in river organic carbon would increase caused by warming freeman et al 2001 also producing dic therefore carbonate weathering and biological carbon influx should be responsible for the dic dynamics taking water temperature into account is important when working with isotopes because isotope fractionation is inversely proportional to water temperature zhang et al 1995 both water temperature and δdic were negatively correlated with δ13cdic in the min river fig 5 a and b as highlighted above δdic derived mainly from carbonate dissolution and biological co2 influxes i e soil co2 and co2 produced in the river considering that the doc concentrations in the min river were low soil co2 influx can be identified as one of the main reasons for the 13c depleted values therefore water temperature plays an important role in dissolved carbon dynamics in the min river because of the increased biological co2 and accelerated chemical weathering 4 3 the response of dic doc ratios to hydrologic conditions investigating the dic doc ratios could improve the understanding of carbon biogeochemical processes in rivers brunet et al 2009 lloret et al 2013 shih et al 2018 the mean dic doc ratio in large rivers worldwide is about 1 86 which implies that dic averagely accounts for 2 3 of the total dissolved carbon in global rivers shih et al 2018 the mean dic doc ratio in the min river was 15 09 which is much higher than the global mean dic doc ratio similar to the subtropical mountainous rivers in taiwan 14 08 shih et al 2018 but much lower than the wujiang river with karst landscapes in southwest china 27 30 zhong et al 2017b the dic export fluxes constitute a high proportion of the total dissolved carbon fluxes in the asian monsoon rivers possible reasons are 1 limited dic consumption or a large dic supply in the carbonate rich catchment and 2 fast rates of dissolved organic matter degradation shih et al 2018 the dic doc ratio in the min river decreased as runoff increased fig 6 a which was mainly due to the decreased dic concentrations and increased doc concentrations with increasing runoff a negative correlation was also observed between dic doc ratios and water temperature fig 6b high temperature usually co varies with high precipitation in the asian monsoon regions causing large amounts of doc to be flushed into the river from the soil meanwhile although dic was diluted large amounts of dic were produced as a result of the increased reactive surface area between fluid and mineral surface with increasing runoff conditions producing high contents of δdic importantly δdic increased with runoff ascribing to the rapid dissolution of carbonate minerals under high flow conditions in addition the increases of doc and runoff were also synchronous therefore δdic and doc showed a positive correlation fig 6d the dic doc ratios and δ13cdic were also positively correlated in the min river fig 6c which was expected because of the biological carbon influx in the high flow season 4 4 dissolved carbon fluxes of the min river and comparisons with other rivers originating from the tibetan plateau the discharge weighted average concentrations of dic and doc were estimated by loadest and the results are shown in fig 7 the estimated annual doc and dic fluxes were 1 1 0 03 and 15 2 0 09 t c km 2 yr 1 respectively the doc flux is slightly lower than the global average 1 4 t c km 2 yr 1 but the dic flux is approximately six times higher than the global average 2 6 t c km 2 yr 1 shih et al 2018 the doc and dic fluxes reached the highest values during the high flow season indicating that changing runoff and temperature conditions were critical factors in the variations of dissolved carbon export in northern temperate rivers huntington and aiken 2013 shih et al 2018 the tibetan plateau region is the origin of many asian large rivers table 1 such as the yellow changjiang mekong salween brahmaputra ganges and indus rivers known as the asian water tower riverine dic fluxes of these rivers can provide information which helps us to understand the role of the tibetan plateau region in global weathering affecting the water quality and ecosystem stability downstream therefore the dic fluxes of large rivers derived from the tibetan plateau region are summarized in table 1 and the annual dic flux is 1 39 tmol yr 1 tmol 1012 mol cai 2011 have reported that global dic flux is 33 9 tmol yr 1 which means that riverine dic flux from the tibetan plateau region accounts for 4 1 of the global riverine dic fluxes the dic flux is not high because it was only the riverine dic that just flows through the tibetan plateau region not those points at the estuary the dic fluxes of this study is underestimated because there are no data reported from the western part of the tibetan plateau with regard to these compiled rivers in the tibetan plateau the yellow river jinsha jiang and nu jiang salween show high dic concentrations however the highest riverine dic flux occurs in the ganges and brahmaputra system because of their high runoff in contrast the irrawaddy and the tarim rivers have low dic fluxes because of their relatively low dic concentrations and low discharge respectively the dic concentrations in the rivers from the tibetan plateau show higher values varying over a wide range than those in most rivers worldwide fig 8 a the uplift of the tibetan plateau leads to the increased surface reactivity of minerals which can accelerate chemical weathering rates and thus produce high dic concentrations in tibetan plateau rivers however the dic generation rates defined as dic runoff the dashed lines in fig 8a and b in tibetan plateau rivers were not significantly higher than the global average fig 8a and b the highest dic generation rate was observed in the ganges and brahmaputra because of the high runoff fig 8a as a result of the heavy precipitation caused by the asian monsoon climate the lowest dic generation rate was found in the indus river which was mainly affected by the subtropical desert climate with inadequate rain throughout the year causing low runoff and low dic generation rate in general rivers with high runoff have high dic generation rates r2 0 77 for linear regression analysis fig 8a supporting the hypothesis that hydrology and temperature associated with climate conditions regulate global carbon dynamics however the dic generation rate of a large flux river is also closely related to the drainage area r2 0 63 for power regression analysis fig 8b with larger drainage area but producing lower dic generation rates which may be the result of increasing difficulties on exports of weathering products in lager basins because of their complicated terrain and longer average distance between souce regions of weathering products and outlet of basins 4 5 ecosystem implications for rivers originating from tibetan plateau the tibetan plateau region is sensitive to global climate change following runoff and temperature changes chen et al 2013 su et al 2016 which would affect the carbon production and transport the doc and dic fluxes in the min river and other tibetan plateau rivers may increase because of the discharge in the min river which may further increase as a result of increasing precipitation in the next few decades in the tibetan plateau li et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 therefore it is proposed that long term work on different forms of carbon and climate variabilities is needed to further investigate the riverine carbon dynamics in the tibetan plateau as shown in this study carbon dynamics are sensitive to changing runoff and temperature conditions and carbon behaviors would have profound implications for future climate change dic production and transport in the tibetan plateau rivers would affect the ecosystem stability in downstream and the ocean providing nutrients for gross primary production in aquatic systems as high amounts of dic were produced in the tibetan river systems under high flow conditions the tibetan rivers play an increasing important role in global carbon cycle the carbon dynamics would be more complicated in the future so researchers should pay more attention to the temporal carbon dynamics in the tibetan rivers under monsoon climate 5 conclusions this study highlighted the significance of dissolved carbon dynamics in response to various runoff and temperature conditions by investigating temporal variations of dic and doc concentrations and δ13cdic values in the min river originating from tibetan plateau there were distinct temporal variations in concentrations and fluxes of dic and doc which was mainly controlled by changing runoff and temperature conditions the negative c q relationships indicated that dic concentrations showed a dilution effect with increasing runoff while doc concentrations were positively related to changing runoff moreover intense meteorological events in the high flow season also played an important role in dic and doc dynamics which increased soil organic carbon and soil co2 influx because of the strong flushing effect and decreased fluid transit time the primary source of dic was carbonate weathering but soil co2 influx and organic matter degradation in the river significantly affect the δ13cdic values in the high flow season sulfuric acid participation in carbonate weathering and the co2 degassing could be responsible for 13c enrichment in the low flow season temperature is also an essential factor in controlling riverine dissolved carbon dynamics which can increase riverine dic production by accelerating the dissolution rates of minerals and organic matter degradation the mean dic doc ratio in the min river is 15 09 much higher than the global mean dic doc ratio suggesting that dic is the main component in the dissolved carbon exported from the min river the carbon exports of doc and dic were 1 1 0 03 and 15 2 0 09 t c km 2 yr 1 respectively and dic flux in the min river showed much higher values than global average furthermore to better estimate dissolved carbon export in river systems the effects of hydrology and temperature on the carbon dynamics should be considered carefully especially for the tibetan plateau region credit authorship contribution statement shuai chen formal analysis writing

4988,studying the temporal dynamics and fluxes of riverine dissolved carbon is crucial in understanding the regional and global carbon cycles under various climatic conditions here we studied the behaviors and fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc responding to various hydrologic conditions in the min river originated from tibetan plateau the dic concentrations decreased with increasing runoff partially reflecting dilution effect which may be ascribed to the shortened fluid transit time and then the reduced contact time with rocks nevertheless doc concentrations were positively correlated with runoff which can be attributed to that a large amount of soil organic carbon flowed into the river as a result of the strong flushing effect the negative relationship between δ13cdic and runoff could be explained by soil co2 influx and organic matter degradation during the high flow season δdic the production of dic with changing hydrologic conditions had a strong positive correlation with water temperature due to the accelerated dic production rates by high temperature which always co varied with intense precipitation in asian monsoonal regions the mean dic doc ratio in the min river was 15 09 and the doc and dic fluxes were 1 1 and 15 2 t c km 2 yr 1 respectively for the studied year and the doc and dic fluxes varied dramatically with runoff changes suggesting that hydrologic conditions were critical factors for the variations in dissolved carbon export this study shows that carbon dynamics of rivers draining from the tibetan plateau are greatly affected by short term climatic variabilities which has implications for understanding global carbon cycle under future climate change keywords carbon dynamics hydrologic conditions carbon isotope tibetan plateau 1 introduction river networks have drawn increasing attention centered on regional and global carbon budgets marx et al 2017 schefuß et al 2016 as the riverine carbon cycle plays a significant role in providing feedbacks on future global climate change cox et al 2000 doctor et al 2008 riverine carbon transportation can be affected by multiple biogeochemical processes such as organic matter degradation co2 degassing and sediment deposition in the floodplains and continental shelf marwick et al 2015 these processes have a significant effect on carbon dynamics and budgets so the budgets of carbon from land to the inland waters are still unclear aufdenkampe et al 2011 cole et al 2007 marwick et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 dissolved forms of carbon include dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc both of which have profound influences on aquatic food web processes and ecosystem sustainability findlay 2010 tank et al 2010 tian et al 2015 and therefore play an important role in the global carbon cycle riverine carbon dynamics are highly shifted by changing hydrologic and temperature conditions bengtson and bengtsson 2007 romero mujalli et al 2018 tian et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 2020 for example dic and doc concentrations and fluxes are closely related to hydrologic conditions and sensitive to runoff variations strohmeier et al 2013 zhong et al 2020 the runoff is projected to increase as a result of increasing rainfall in the next few decades on the tibetan plateau li et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 as climate extremes are expected to become more frequent and intense due to global warming seneviratne et al 2012 therefore studying the mechanisms and impacts of short term climate variabilities on carbon dynamics can improve our understanding about the effects of future global climate change on the carbon budget reichstein et al 2013 using a coupled hydrological biogeochemical model ren et al 2015 reported that climate related changes and rising atmospheric co2 would be responsible for more than 90 of the increase in dic fluxes for the mississippi river throughout the 21st century which is similar to the findings of tian et al 2015 furthermore boano et al 2014 showed that stream pco2 dynamics are highly influenced by the hyporheic zone across different climate zones doc fluxes were highly controlled by hydrologic conditions climate patterns and episodic weather events in the south florida estuaries regier et al 2016 however the effects of short term climate variabilities on carbon dynamics and fluxes of tibetan rivers were still elusive the annual global exports of dic and doc transported by river systems into the ocean were estimated to be approximately 0 41 pg 1 pg 1015 g cai 2011 and 0 17 pg dai et al 2012 respectively accordingly the total dissolved carbon flux represents about 68 of the total carbon flux 0 85 pg bauer et al 2013 from rivers to estuaries making up a significant component of global oceanic carbon budgets as one of the most climate sensitive areas in the world more than 80 of the glaciers have retreated in the tibetan plateau altering the water supply for billions of people and atmospheric circulation chen et al 2013 qiu 2008 affecting hydrologic conditions and therefore change the riverine carbon export thus deciphering riverine dic and doc dynamics in the min river would shed a light on the dissolved carbon dynamics of the plateau rivers although anthropogenic activities in the lower reaches may also affect the riverine carbon additionally tibetan plateau plays an important role in global carbon cycles as a result of climate changes chen et al 2013 peng et al 2015 and considering the importance of chemical weathering on the tibetan plateau for the global cooling in the cenozoic is still in debate raymo and ruddiman 1992 xiao et al 2015 wolff boenisch et al 2009 the carbon budgets and dynamics should be re evaluated in order to better understand the carbon cycles in these riverine systems zhang et al 2013 especially in the tibetan plateau rivers this study presents a monthly to daily sampling dataset of dic doc concentrations and isotope ratios of dic δ13cdic in the min river originated from tibetan plateau the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate temporal carbon dynamics under various hydrologic and temperature conditions 2 to determine the factors controlling carbon dynamics in the min river 3 to evaluate the role of dic fluxes from tibetan plateau rivers on global riverine dic fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the min river originates from the eastern edge of the tibetan plateau with a drainage area of 133 500 km2 yoon et al 2008 the min river has three main tributaries fig 1 the dadu river the qingyi river and the min river itself which converge at the sichuan basin an industrialized and densely populated fluvial plain qin et al 2006 zhong et al 2017a while the upper dadu river region has a plateau climate the other region has a subtropical climate with mean annual precipitation of 500 800 mm on the eastern tibetan plateau and 1200 1500 mm in the sichuan basin yoon et al 2008 the underlying geology of the drainage basin is mainly granite terrigenous sediments quaternary fluvial deposits volcanic rocks high grade metamorphic rocks and carbonates carbonate rocks mainly outcrop at the source area of the min river basin and are scattered in the sichuan basin and adjacent surrounding mountainous areas detailed information about the topography and geology of this system is available in studies by the bureau of geology and mineral resources of sichuan province 1991 2 2 sampling and chemical analyses twenty seven river water samples were collected near the gaochang hydrological station fig 1 located at the outlet of the min river basin the water samples were collected monthly and additional samples were collected depending on variations in discharge from november of 2013 to october of 2014 the ph was measured in situ and the water samples were filtered using cellulose acetate membrane with 0 45 μm pore size for dic and doc analyses detailed information about the sampling strategies and field techniques were described in the relevant published work zhong et al 2017a alkalinity was determined by titration with 0 02 mol l 1 of hydrochloric acid being the dominant carbon specie in mildly alkaline waters hco3 concentrations can be assumed to be equal to the concentrations of alkalinity and dic clark and fritz 1997 δ13cdic values were pretreated using a headspace analysis approach on the vacuum line and measured by finnigan mat 252 mass spectrometer li et al 2010 2014 zhong et al 2018 the doc concentrations were analyzed by a total organic carbon analyzer elemental high toc ii n germany and the partial pressure of dissolved co2 pco2 was determined using equilibrium equations at corresponding thermodynamic constants and water temperatures clark and fritz 1997 2 3 methods load estimator and concentration discharge relationship the dic and doc concentrations with corresponding daily discharge were used to model the daily concentrations and fluxes of dic and doc by load estimator loadest runkel et al 2004 the best regression model was automatically selected from nine models based on akaike information criteria aic in loadest and the approximate maximum likelihood estimator amle was chosen for estimation and calibration of daily fluxes the model used to estimate daily dic loads is 1 ln l o a d a 0 a 1 l n q a 2 l n q 2 while the model used for doc loads estimation is 2 ln l o a d a 0 a 1 l n q a 2 l n q 2 a 3 s i n 2 π d t i m e a 4 c o s 2 π d t i m e a 5 d t i m e a

seasonality consideration and a0 to a6 are the model coefficients concentration discharge c q relationships are often used to decipher the solutes biogeochemical processes under different hydrologic

between solute concentrations and river runoff if b 0 the solute concentrations are independent of discharge if b 1 the solute concentrations are only controlled by dilution with deionized water godsey et al 2009 3 results the river discharge of the gaochang hydrological station showed a significant seasonal trend with low discharges from the late autumn to spring and a pronounced increase heading into the summer until early autumn fig 2 the discharge reached the minimum value at 715 m3 s 1 in may and peaked at 9560 m3 s 1 in july with an average of 2616 m3 s 1 for the whole year june to october of 2014 was defined as the high flow season and november of 2013 to may of 2014 was defined as the low flow season with various discharge fluctuations the minimum water temperatures for the water samples was 9 9 c in january of 2014 and the maximum value was 24 5 c in august of 2014 dic and doc concentrations δ13cdic and pco2 values varied largely in the studied year fig 2 the elevated doc concentrations of the river water occurred during the high flow season ranging from 1 3 to 2 5 mg l 1 averaging 1 8 0 4 mg l 1 and the doc concentrations were relatively low during the low flow season ranging from 1 1 to 1 6 mg l 1 averaging 1 3 0 2 mg l 1 fig 2b contrary to doc concentrations dic concentrations showed higher values 127 1 mg l 1 to 140 4 mg l 1 averaging 134 1 5 1 mg l 1 in the low flow season and lower values 107 3 mg l 1 to 128 6 mg l 1 averaging 117 1 3 9 mg l 1 in the high flow season fig 2a the δ13cdic values ranged from 10 4 to 6 0 in the min river with an average of 8 3 for the studied year fig 2c the dic showed a relatively 13c enriched state between 7 8 to 6 0 averaging 6 6 0 6 in the low flow season after which it showed 13c depleted state in the high flow season with a range of 10 4 to 7 6 averaging 8 9 0 7 in addition the mean pco2 value was 0 97 0 37 10 3 atm with a much higher value in the low flow season 1 45 0 15 10 3 atm than that in the high flow season 0 80 0 25 10 3 atm fig 2d 4 discussion 4 1 hydrologic regulations of dic doc pco2 and δ13cdic significant negative correlations were observed for dic δ13cdic and pco2 versus runoff changes fig 3 riverine dic behaviors are influenced by multiple biogeochemical processes including soil co2 influxes water atmosphere exchange carbonate mineral dissolution precipitation and aquatic photosynthesis or respiration mcclanahan et al 2016 shin et al 2011 the min river showed high dic concentrations and pco2 values during the low flow season fig 2 which could be ascribed to the higher portions of subsurface flow water influx with higher dic and pco2 values atkins et al 2013 li et al 2010 zhong et al 2018 than those in the surface flow water with the arrival of high flow season the intense precipitation would cause high runoff and be responsible for the decrease of both dic concentrations fig 3a ascribed to the shortened fluid transit time tipper et al 2006 torres et al 2015 zhong et al 2017b and 2020 although high amounts of soil co2 were produced in the high flow season accelerated chemical weathering reduced the pco2 in the river water in addition the proportion of surface flow water would increase under high runoff conditions which has low dic and pco2 values showing dilution effects of dic and pco2 however the reactive mineral surface area could increase with the increasing runoff eiriksdottir et al 2013 also resulting in the near chemostatic behaviors of dic under high runoff conditions zhong et al 2017a similar c q relationships of dic were also observed in the three main tributaries of the min river located at luding xuankou and duoyinping qin et al 2006 the three tributaries had lower dic concentrations than those in the gaochang hydrological station under the same runoff conditions which could be mainly ascribed to the high temperature conditions and intense anthropogenic activities in the downstream qin et al 2006 the other possible reason was the rapid weathering kinetic of sporadic carbonate rocks in and around the sichuan basin under warm climatic conditions fig 1 although carbonate rocks only account for a small proportion of the drainage area water chemistry in the min river is significantly affected by carbonate weathering zhong et al 2017a other studies have also highlighted the importance of carbonate contribution to dic in rivers such that even trace amounts of carbonate minerals can bear responsibility for the remarkable effects of carbonate weathering barth et al 2003 carbonate weathering is proved to be a significant source of dic in the min river as a result of the relatively rapid dissolution kinetics zhong et al 2017a the doc concentrations are positively correlated with runoff in the min river fig 3b matching the global patterns wolfgang et al 1996 during high flow conditions rapid runoff preferentially flows through surface soil horizons and brings soil organic matter into river eimers et al 2008 mcclain et al 2003 mei et al 2014 shih et al 2018 this can be confirmed by a strong flushing effect in most rivers consistent with increasing doc concentrations under increasing runoff conditions atkins et al 2013 clark and fritz 1997 lloret et al 2013 in addition the average concentration of soil organic carbon is 3 24 kg m 2 at the lower reaches of the min river lai et al 2016 according to study of gao et al 2011 the soil organic carbon contribution caused by water erosion in the min river basin is high in china and therefore explain the relative high doc concentrations in high flow season similar to the min river doc in the jialing river also showed characteristics of terrestrial sources in the high flow season yan et al 2015 while in the low flow season deep groundwater may be the main contributor of baseflow and result in lower doc concentrations mei et al 2014 shih et al 2018 it should be noticed that anthropogenic activities changed the concentrations and chemical characteristics of doc which has been reported in previous studies e g molinero and burke 2009 as industrial and agricultural activities are active in the sichuan basin which may lead to the high amounts of doc in the rivers because of high fluxes of anthropogenic nutrients and sewage inputs atmospheric deposition and land use changes fu et al 2012 monteith et al 2007 moreover isotopic evidence showed that the groundwater of min river was polluted li et al 2006 which further supports that part of the anthropogenic doc may input to the min river however human induced doc inputs into rivers would be strengthened in the high flow season when surface runoff largely increase and soil organic carbon export also increase the extent of anthropogenic activities effects on doc export needs to be further studied in the future δ13cdic has been widely and successfully used to investigate the riverine dic origin and biogeochemical processes brunet et al 2005 khadka et al 2014 the δ13c value of carbonate bedrock is 0 typically for marine limestone mcclanahan et al 2016 soil co2 originated from the plant root respiration and heterotrophic respiration of soil organic matter with δ13c values from 34 to 24 averaging 28 khadka et al 2014 and a 4 4 enrichment would be produced for diffusion of soil co2 compared with organic matter cerling et al 1991 during the co2 dissolution and succeeding formation of dissolved carbon species 13c fractionation would produce δ13cdic values of soil water ranging from 23 to 13 averaging 17 telmer and veizer 1999 in this way the δ13cdic value derived from silicate weathering by soil co2 would be close to 17 and carbonate weathering by soil co2 would produce a δ13cdic value of 8 5 because half of the dic originates from the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the other half derives from the soil co2 li et al 2014 the mean δ13cdic value of the min river was 8 3 which was close to the δ13cdic value of carbonate weathering by soil co2 but was much heavier than the δ13c value of silicate weathering derived dic and dissolved soil co2 sourced from organic matter respiration there are four main reasons for the enrichment of 13c aquatic photosynthesis sulfuric acid participation in carbonate weathering co2 degassing and metamorphic co2 influx 1 aquatic photosynthesis may be much stronger in the high flow season mainly in summer than in the low flow season mainly in winter due to high water temperature and strong solar radiation in the high flow season which will shift 13c riched values but photosynthesis can be weakened by shortened residence time he and xu 2017 and the reduced water clarity sun et al 2011 because of high suspended matter i e more than 90 of river sediments are concentrated in the high flow season in the min river calculated from international research and training center on erosion and sedimentation 2014 therefore photosynthesis played a less important role for δ13cdic changes evidences from the 13c depleted values in the high flow season 2 the δ13cdic produced by carbonate weathering using sulfuric acid are consistent with the previous work in southwestern china li et al 2008 sulfur and oxygen isotopes of dissolved sulfate analyses in the min river indicated that dissolved sulfate mainly originates from burning coal yoon et al 2008 zhao et al 2015 therefore sulfuric acid participation in carbonate weathering played an important role in 13c enriched values in the low flow season for the min river 3 another explanation of the enrichment of 13c in river water dic could be attributed to co2 degassing which would cause 13c enrichment downstream as a result of isotopic fractionation of dic in the low flow season doctor et al 2008 polsenaere and abril 2012 shin et al 2011 co2 will diffuse out of water when the pco2 of the surface water is higher than that of the ambient atmosphere ran et al 2017 which is the case of the min river because pco2 of river water samples exceeds twice the atmospheric co2 concentration in the low flow season co2 emission rate can be reduced in the high flow season due to the shortened transit time in the river channel inducing light δ13cdic in the high flow season 4 the last possible reason is metamorphic carbon input due to himalayan orogenic movement becker et al 2008 evans et al 2008 gaillardet and galy 2008 which have 13c enriched values galy and france lanord 1999 and these springs can shift 13c enriched values when they discharge into rivers the δ13cdic values of thermal springs varied from 3 6 to 2 8 in the kangding county fig 1 with up to 60 of the co2 from the springs discharged into the hydrosphere yang et al 1999 however considering that the low proportion of thermal springs discharge in the total discharge of min river and the long distance between locations of these thermal springs luo 1994 and the gaochang hydrological station metamorphic carbon contribution may not be important for the 13c enrichment which is consistent with li et al 2014 in this study a significant negative relationship between δ13cdic and runoff was observed in the min river fig 2c with increasing runoff carbonate weathering was accelerated by the increased reaction surface area eiriksdottir et al 2013 zhong et al 2020 in addition large amounts of soil co2 were produced in the high flow season because of the high temperature and intense precipitation li et al 2010 zhong et al 2018 the water with soil co2 of 13c depleted values flushed into the river during rain events shifting 13c depleted values with the increase of runoff 4 2 temperature regulations of dissolved carbon species the increasing temperature accelerated riverine dic production as a result of enhanced weathering rates zhong et al 2018 δdic was used in this study which was calculated as the measured dic value subtracting the theoretical dic value i e the value when dic concentration is diluted by deionized water which refers to b 1 in the power law function to represent the production of dic with changing hydrologic conditions and constrain the exogenous sources of dic zhong et al 2018 similar to the xijiang river δdic has a strong positive correlation with water temperature fig 4 a which is highly affected by air temperature consistent with that high temperatures accelerated the dissolution rate of minerals with high temperature in the warm season large amounts of soil co2 were produced accelerating the chemical weathering rates zhong et al 2018 in addition large amounts of soil organic matter within the surface flow flowed into the river induced by intense rainfall during the high flow season li et al 2010 which caused high doc concentrations in the high flow season fig 4b the degradation of both soil organic matter and in river organic carbon would increase caused by warming freeman et al 2001 also producing dic therefore carbonate weathering and biological carbon influx should be responsible for the dic dynamics taking water temperature into account is important when working with isotopes because isotope fractionation is inversely proportional to water temperature zhang et al 1995 both water temperature and δdic were negatively correlated with δ13cdic in the min river fig 5 a and b as highlighted above δdic derived mainly from carbonate dissolution and biological co2 influxes i e soil co2 and co2 produced in the river considering that the doc concentrations in the min river were low soil co2 influx can be identified as one of the main reasons for the 13c depleted values therefore water temperature plays an important role in dissolved carbon dynamics in the min river because of the increased biological co2 and accelerated chemical weathering 4 3 the response of dic doc ratios to hydrologic conditions investigating the dic doc ratios could improve the understanding of carbon biogeochemical processes in rivers brunet et al 2009 lloret et al 2013 shih et al 2018 the mean dic doc ratio in large rivers worldwide is about 1 86 which implies that dic averagely accounts for 2 3 of the total dissolved carbon in global rivers shih et al 2018 the mean dic doc ratio in the min river was 15 09 which is much higher than the global mean dic doc ratio similar to the subtropical mountainous rivers in taiwan 14 08 shih et al 2018 but much lower than the wujiang river with karst landscapes in southwest china 27 30 zhong et al 2017b the dic export fluxes constitute a high proportion of the total dissolved carbon fluxes in the asian monsoon rivers possible reasons are 1 limited dic consumption or a large dic supply in the carbonate rich catchment and 2 fast rates of dissolved organic matter degradation shih et al 2018 the dic doc ratio in the min river decreased as runoff increased fig 6 a which was mainly due to the decreased dic concentrations and increased doc concentrations with increasing runoff a negative correlation was also observed between dic doc ratios and water temperature fig 6b high temperature usually co varies with high precipitation in the asian monsoon regions causing large amounts of doc to be flushed into the river from the soil meanwhile although dic was diluted large amounts of dic were produced as a result of the increased reactive surface area between fluid and mineral surface with increasing runoff conditions producing high contents of δdic importantly δdic increased with runoff ascribing to the rapid dissolution of carbonate minerals under high flow conditions in addition the increases of doc and runoff were also synchronous therefore δdic and doc showed a positive correlation fig 6d the dic doc ratios and δ13cdic were also positively correlated in the min river fig 6c which was expected because of the biological carbon influx in the high flow season 4 4 dissolved carbon fluxes of the min river and comparisons with other rivers originating from the tibetan plateau the discharge weighted average concentrations of dic and doc were estimated by loadest and the results are shown in fig 7 the estimated annual doc and dic fluxes were 1 1 0 03 and 15 2 0 09 t c km 2 yr 1 respectively the doc flux is slightly lower than the global average 1 4 t c km 2 yr 1 but the dic flux is approximately six times higher than the global average 2 6 t c km 2 yr 1 shih et al 2018 the doc and dic fluxes reached the highest values during the high flow season indicating that changing runoff and temperature conditions were critical factors in the variations of dissolved carbon export in northern temperate rivers huntington and aiken 2013 shih et al 2018 the tibetan plateau region is the origin of many asian large rivers table 1 such as the yellow changjiang mekong salween brahmaputra ganges and indus rivers known as the asian water tower riverine dic fluxes of these rivers can provide information which helps us to understand the role of the tibetan plateau region in global weathering affecting the water quality and ecosystem stability downstream therefore the dic fluxes of large rivers derived from the tibetan plateau region are summarized in table 1 and the annual dic flux is 1 39 tmol yr 1 tmol 1012 mol cai 2011 have reported that global dic flux is 33 9 tmol yr 1 which means that riverine dic flux from the tibetan plateau region accounts for 4 1 of the global riverine dic fluxes the dic flux is not high because it was only the riverine dic that just flows through the tibetan plateau region not those points at the estuary the dic fluxes of this study is underestimated because there are no data reported from the western part of the tibetan plateau with regard to these compiled rivers in the tibetan plateau the yellow river jinsha jiang and nu jiang salween show high dic concentrations however the highest riverine dic flux occurs in the ganges and brahmaputra system because of their high runoff in contrast the irrawaddy and the tarim rivers have low dic fluxes because of their relatively low dic concentrations and low discharge respectively the dic concentrations in the rivers from the tibetan plateau show higher values varying over a wide range than those in most rivers worldwide fig 8 a the uplift of the tibetan plateau leads to the increased surface reactivity of minerals which can accelerate chemical weathering rates and thus produce high dic concentrations in tibetan plateau rivers however the dic generation rates defined as dic runoff the dashed lines in fig 8a and b in tibetan plateau rivers were not significantly higher than the global average fig 8a and b the highest dic generation rate was observed in the ganges and brahmaputra because of the high runoff fig 8a as a result of the heavy precipitation caused by the asian monsoon climate the lowest dic generation rate was found in the indus river which was mainly affected by the subtropical desert climate with inadequate rain throughout the year causing low runoff and low dic generation rate in general rivers with high runoff have high dic generation rates r2 0 77 for linear regression analysis fig 8a supporting the hypothesis that hydrology and temperature associated with climate conditions regulate global carbon dynamics however the dic generation rate of a large flux river is also closely related to the drainage area r2 0 63 for power regression analysis fig 8b with larger drainage area but producing lower dic generation rates which may be the result of increasing difficulties on exports of weathering products in lager basins because of their complicated terrain and longer average distance between souce regions of weathering products and outlet of basins 4 5 ecosystem implications for rivers originating from tibetan plateau the tibetan plateau region is sensitive to global climate change following runoff and temperature changes chen et al 2013 su et al 2016 which would affect the carbon production and transport the doc and dic fluxes in the min river and other tibetan plateau rivers may increase because of the discharge in the min river which may further increase as a result of increasing precipitation in the next few decades in the tibetan plateau li et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 therefore it is proposed that long term work on different forms of carbon and climate variabilities is needed to further investigate the riverine carbon dynamics in the tibetan plateau as shown in this study carbon dynamics are sensitive to changing runoff and temperature conditions and carbon behaviors would have profound implications for future climate change dic production and transport in the tibetan plateau rivers would affect the ecosystem stability in downstream and the ocean providing nutrients for gross primary production in aquatic systems as high amounts of dic were produced in the tibetan river systems under high flow conditions the tibetan rivers play an increasing important role in global carbon cycle the carbon dynamics would be more complicated in the future so researchers should pay more attention to the temporal carbon dynamics in the tibetan rivers under monsoon climate 5 conclusions this study highlighted the significance of dissolved carbon dynamics in response to various runoff and temperature conditions by investigating temporal variations of dic and doc concentrations and δ13cdic values in the min river originating from tibetan plateau there were distinct temporal variations in concentrations and fluxes of dic and doc which was mainly controlled by changing runoff and temperature conditions the negative c q relationships indicated that dic concentrations showed a dilution effect with increasing runoff while doc concentrations were positively related to changing runoff moreover intense meteorological events in the high flow season also played an important role in dic and doc dynamics which increased soil organic carbon and soil co2 influx because of the strong flushing effect and decreased fluid transit time the primary source of dic was carbonate weathering but soil co2 influx and organic matter degradation in the river significantly affect the δ13cdic values in the high flow season sulfuric acid participation in carbonate weathering and the co2 degassing could be responsible for 13c enrichment in the low flow season temperature is also an essential factor in controlling riverine dissolved carbon dynamics which can increase riverine dic production by accelerating the dissolution rates of minerals and organic matter degradation the mean dic doc ratio in the min river is 15 09 much higher than the global mean dic doc ratio suggesting that dic is the main component in the dissolved carbon exported from the min river the carbon exports of doc and dic were 1 1 0 03 and 15 2 0 09 t c km 2 yr 1 respectively and dic flux in the min river showed much higher values than global average furthermore to better estimate dissolved carbon export in river systems the effects of hydrology and temperature on the carbon dynamics should be considered carefully especially for the tibetan plateau region credit authorship contribution statement shuai chen formal analysis writing

4989,the vulnerable karst water systems and the serious pollution issues in southwest china have been facing tremendous challenges especially when controlling processes of transformation in rainfall surface and groundwater sw and gw are poorly understood in such areas in this study transformation processes have been identified based on physical chemical indicators t do ec hco3 2 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 δ 2h and δ 18o isotopes and 222rn activities in different water forms the δ 2h and δ 18o isotopic signals of the river are depleted in the upstream non karst area due to the altitude effect the karst aquifers are dominantly recharged by local rainfall in summer and by river water from the non karst area in winter indicated by the seasonal variation of stable isotopic compositions a 222rn mass balance model was constructed to estimate gw sw exchange during the autumn period net gaining and net losing sections including a segment of conduit flow were identified to be fluxes of 3 6 10 3 and 4 0 10 3 m3 s 1 m 1 respectively the bank storage water contributed critically in the net gaining section deduced by the inconsistent responses of stable isotopic and chemical tracers to the gw influent which resulted in a relative identical amount of influent and effluent water 5 0 10 3 and 1 4 10 3 m3 s 1 m 1 respectively in the net losing section influent and effluent are 2 8 10 4 and 4 2 10 3 m3 s 1 m 1 respectively interactions through the segment of surface flow are sluggish which is standing in stark contrast to the well mixed flow in the conduit segment the results reveal various signs of sulfides oxidation from the mine and tailings along with liberated metals could be introduced and travelled across in the transformations of rainfall sw gw it needs to put more efforts into the

et al 2019 aghili et al 2018 the contaminated aquifers can be responsible for acting as long term significant pollution sources to the surrounding environment wang et al 2019 the transformations from rainfall to surface and ground water and the interactions between surface and ground water are principally controlled by geomorphologic hydrogeologic and climatic conditions tóth 1970 sophocleous 2002 water in karst aquifers is fast diffusive and sometimes the infiltration is concentrated depends on the distribution of conduits development of the heterogeneity and anisotropy parise et al 2018 it is highly vulnerable to contamination and difficult to manage because of the unique hydrogeological characteristics contaminants such as metals move along and spread across water forms in karst areas having chemical physical and biological reactions with the surroundings under a highly dynamic and heterogeneous framework which can affect the mobility persistence and potential exposure of humans

karst reservoirs has been poorly understood in contrast to other porous medium aquifers bailly comte et al 2009 it still has great challenges and uncertainty when trying to trace transportation implement remedial actions and manage contaminated systems padilla and vesper 2018 in order to develop protection strategies against water pollution it is necessary to identify the different processes of transformation in rainfall gw sw environmental tracers have become powerful and well developed tools for investigating the governing processes of rainfall sw gw transformation in the karst water

evaluate the pollution level in the different land use type of soil the effect on the microbial enzymatic activity of soil microorganisms jin et al 2015 li et al 2015 kong et al 2018 however few studies has been carried out for evaluating the quality of surface and ground water and migration of heavy metals in the hydraulic system which has been threatened by the contaminated soil and the upstream mine and tailing pond qin et al 2019 in order to further ascertain the migration of toxic metals in the water system this study aims to trace the transformation processes of rainfall surface water groundwater by using of δ 18o δ 2h 222rn isotopes and other basic chemical physical indicators the objectives of this study are i to decipher the controlling processes during rainfall to the surface and groundwater transformations both in the non karst and karst area ii to evaluate and quantify the exchange between river water and karst groundwater at different flow sections of the karst valley and iii to propose a conceptual model of the rainfall surface water groundwater transformation processes for the study area and analyze the potential transport pathways of the pollutants it can provide fundamental knowledge of the water cycle framework for further tracing toxic metals transportation and support the water resources management for local authorities 2 study area the study area is located in the southeastern of guilin city guangxi zhuang autonomous region southwest china it is a karst valley surrounded by the range of haiyang mountains to the east elevation varies from 900 to 1500 m and karst hills 500 600 m height to the west fig 1 sidi river originates from haiyang mountain in which the pb zn mine located and flows westward down to the villages of baihualing and sidi then turns to the southward to villages of dabiao and jiaotian fig 1 the villages s elevation varies in 100 200 m the sidi river flows into a karst conduit at jiaotian village turns to an underground river with a runoff modulus around 6 l s km2 and flows out at 1 km distance to the north fig 1 the length of the upper reach east to west reach is around 7 3 km and area of the downstream valley south to north reach is around 5 km2 the study area belongs to the guilin yangshuo basin which is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with two distinct periods of a cold dry season from september to march and a hot rainy season from april to august the average annual temperature and rainfall are around 18 9 c and 1886 mm year almost 70 of the total precipitation occurs in the rainy season the average monthly precipitation varies from 50 mm in december to 359 mm in june while the average temperature per month ranges from 7 9 c in january to 28 2 c in july guo et al 2015 the lithology of the study area consists of cambrian devonian є d sandstone and clastic rocks to the east haiyang mountain range also simplified as non karst area in this study devonian to carboniferous d c carbonate rocks and devonian d carbonates discontinuity covered by quaternary q clay and clay loam to the west represented by karst area fig 1 institute of karst geology 2015 the relatively impervious formations of the non karst area suggest that its recharge to the lowland karst area is mainly contributed by a focused surface water i e the sidi river fig 1 groundwater in the karst area generally flows from south to north and buried in depth within 10 m karst springs with discharges larger than 10 l s during dry seasons are widely distributed the overlying soil cover varies from 0 to 2 m in the valley area and mainly consists of calcareous clay and clay loam with limited permeability yaji experimental site in guilin with the similar geology and lithology setting and close distance about 38 km to the study area has been built to explore the karst hydrology processes since the 1990s yuan et al 1990 previous soil water movement experiments in around 45 cm depth in 10 cm interval on the yaji experimental site showed the hydraulic conductivities of barren land vary in 0 0043 0 17 m day with an average value of 0 06 m day in grasslands the hydraulic conductivities are between 0 01 and 0 13 m day with an average value of 0 05 m day while in shrublands the hydraulic conductivities range in 0 04 0 32 m day with an average value of 0 07 m day deng et al 2017 the study area has long suffered from heavy metals pollution mainly pb zn cd and cu in soils due to the exploration of the pb zn mine since the 1950s fig 1 the collapse of the tailings dam happened in the 1970s which poured tailings sands and waste rocks directly down to the farmland of the sidi village efforts including mining cessation investigation and restoration of the soil pollution have been made and significantly decreases the concentration of metals in soil however the remains metals are still threatening the environment e g the total cd content of the soil is 40 mg kg on average according to recent research li et al 2015 which is still higher than 0 3 mg kg the level ii of soil environmental quality standard of china gb15618 1995 national standard of the people s republic of china 2015 lin 1997 1995 moreover the sidi river continuously transports heavy metals to the downstream karst area presented by the previous study qin et al 2019 3 material and methods 3 1 water sampling and analysis previous investigations have been carried out in winter december 2015 and summer june 2016 in order to understand the general hydraulic and hydrogeology regime and effects of the abandoned pb zn mine on water quality of the study area qin et al 2019 it is better to conduct the field investigation between previous seasons as a complementary under limit research conditions moreover it is important to implement the sw gw interaction survey during also before and after period without heavy precipitation to simplify the process of data collection and computation as a result of above considerations field measurement and sampling campaigns were conducted in the study area during the period of 23rd to 30th september 2018 besides hydrochemical and δ 2h and δ 18o data for surface and groundwater collected from the previous research by qin et al 2019 on the study area in december 2015 and june 2016 have been compiled and compared with the data collected during september 2018 in this study through exactly the same analysis methods and data processing at the same lab twenty six water samples were collected including 11 groundwater samples and 15 river water samples seven gw samples were taken from shallow domestic wells drilled in the karst aquifer with well depths ranging from 2 to 10 m groundwater sampling was performed using either a submersible pump or a hand pump that was pumping water at least 10 and 20 min respectively before sampling to obtain fresh groundwater the rest 4 gw samples were collected from karst springs there are 11 sw samples were taken from the sidi river and one of them r08 were sampled from a tributary of the sidi river on the non karst area fig 1 the remaining 4 were sampled from the karst spring or gw fed streams spring and other surface water were sampled about 30 cm below the water surface or in the middle of depth if the total depth is lower than 60 cm the principle of surface and groundwater sampling campaigns is following the flow direction of karst gw and the sidi river samples for water chemistry analysis were infiltrated through 0 45 μm filter immediately in situ collected in three 100 ml hdpe bottles which were overflowed and tightly capped protect from air contact and stored at 4 c fridge after sealed with parafilm all samples were immediately transported to the laboratory for further analysis with the restriction of accessibility r05 r04 and r01 sampling points are set as cross sections in the exploration of sw gw interaction as their well representativity velocity area method was applied in determining the discharge of each cross section herschy 1998 a portable propeller current meter ls10 china with a detection range between 0 10 and 4 0 m s with a precision of 1 5 was used in river

closed loop with a portable 222rn detector system aqua kit alpha pump alpha guard pq2000pro germany via α decay accounts 222rn activities were measured over four 10 minute intervals with a detection range of 2 2 000 000 bq m3 and the accuracy of 3 more than three 10 minute intervals of air 222rn activities were measured between two water samples measurement to ensure the equipment reached the background value taking the average value of readouts for each sample and converted to 222rn activities in water according to rößler and villert 2017 1 c water c readout v system v sample v sample k c

standard mean ocean water v smow with precisions of 1 and 0 1 respectively 3 2 mass balance of water flow and 222rn 3 2 1 flow mass balance rainfall and evaporation need to be considered in the balance of flow mass the average annual evaporation rate in the guilin area is 1378 3 mm deng et al 2017 i e 3 78 mm d with a 5 day mean life of 222rn the evaporation loss could be 18 8 mm which is around 2 5 2 7 of the river depth about 0 76 0 7 m along the calculated sections of the sidi river table 3 therefore considering that the runoff times within the river sections are both less than one day evaporation loss can be neglected in the mass balance equation there was rarely precipitation in the study area before and after the sampling campaign hence precipitation and evaporation can be neglected in the mass balance basic mass balance equations between the upstream and downstream reaches can be expressed by equations 2 and 3 for river water flow 2 q d q u q n l 3 q n q g q r qu m3 s and qd m3 s are the discharge of the upstream downstream respectively while qg and qr theoretically represent the rate of groundwater inflow to the river and river water outflow to aquifer per unit length of river reach m3 s m and qn is the net value of qg and qr a positive qn means more groundwater recharge to the river compare with river water outflow and vice versa only qn can be calculated according to this river flow mass balance instead of the specific qg and qr 3 2 2 222rn isotope mass balance as an inert naturally occurring radioactive gas 3 8 days of half life produced by the radioactive decay of 226ra 222rn diffuses into pore water and becomes concentrated in the aqueous phase ellins et al 1990 222rn in surface water derives from upstream flow groundwater recharge radioactive decay of 226ra and hyporheic exchange of riverbed sediments once the sources and sinks of radon reach equilibrium in a unit water body i e a steady state of environmental condition been reached the radon activity does not change with time the immediately increased 222rn activity in surface water can be considered as a signal of groundwater recharge subsequently due to degas and radioactive decay the elevated 222rn activity will gradually decrease to the equilibrium value yang et al 2020 it is also assumed that both in longitudinal and vertical radon in the water is instantaneously mixed and reach a stable state water collected in the downstream is the same part that collected in the upstream and can represent the average value of the section cook 2013 hyporheic exchange can increase the 222rn activity in the flow of the river without adding discharge which could lead to the overestimation of the groundwater inflow cook et al 2006 cook 2013 an elaborate investigation of hyporheic exchange requires meticulous research of the riverbed including a series of complex experiments cook 2013 however access to collect enough river sediments for the estimation of radon production also for accurately measuring the porosity of the river sediments is limited due to the steep topography following the previous studies su et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 yang et al 2020 for an area with sparse hydraulic data tests the hyporheic exchange is not considered in this study according to the mass conservation theory that take both gas exchange and radioactive decay processes into account danckwerts 1951 o connor and dobbins 1958 su et al 2015 developed a method to calculate the gw sw exchange in three different exchange processes case a only gw recharge to sw 4

samples most close to the two river sections fig 1 sample s03 and g02 for section r05 r04 and s03 g02 and g07 for the section r04 r01 the total loss coefficient α refers to the arithmetic sum of decay constant corrected for the average river velocity β and the loss coefficient γ caused by gas exchange ellins et al 1990 10 α β γ the decay constant corrected for the average river velocity β can be expressed as ellins et al 1990 11 β λ v where v average velocity of river water m s λ coefficient of 222rn radioactive decay λ 2 08 10 6 s 1 there are two models for estimating 222rn gas exchange the surface renewal theory danckwerts 1951 o connor and dobbins 1958 and the stagnant film model broecker 1982 lewis and whitman 1924 the latter model assumes that a stagnant film of water separates the stream and the air above it which is inapplicable in the study area as the sidi river is mainly turbulent when the gas exchange in a stream is mostly determined by turbulence the renewal theory can be applied to estimate 222rn concentration loss stellato et al 2008 therefore loss coefficient γ caused by gas exchange is danckwerts 1951 o connor and dobbins 1958 stellato et al 2008 12 γ d 1 2 h 1 2 v

2 h 1 2 v 3 2 the 222rn model is based on constant value parameters which fluctuates along the river therefore it is necessary to examine the errors caused by variation of parameters lenhart et al 2002 sensitivity analysis of parameters was applied to obtain the level of accuracy if various parameters used in the calculation and to reduce the uncertainty based on a better consideration of the 222rn mass balance equations su et al 2015 eq 14 can be used to evaluate the relative error δ of calculation results due to different levels δx 1 1 5 10 20 35 50 of uncertainties of each parameter 14

parameters of water samples including water temperature ph do ec and orp are presented in table 1 water temperature measured for surface and groundwater samples ranged between 19 9 and 26 4 c and 20 7 25 1 c with average values of 22 4 and 22 3 c respectively values of ph have a range of 7 6 8 5 with an average value of 8 0 for surface water and slightly acid 6 7 7 9 with an average value of 7 3 for groundwater apparently do in the sidi river varied between 4 5 and 8 mg l with an average value of 6 9 mg l is larger than that in groundwater varied in 1 2 6 2 mg l with an average value of 4 mg l ec values ranged from 82 9 to 467 2 μs cm in the surface water with an average value of 244 1 μs cm karst groundwater samples have relatively higher ec with a range of 213 631 6 μs cm and an average value of 457 9 μs cm major chemical components of surface and ground water samples and the water types can be seen from table 2 and 5 and piper plot fig 2 the data collected from the previous research december 2015 and june 2016 are also compiled in fig 2 most of surface and groundwater were dominated by ca hco3 type except for those taken from the sidi river with a higher percentage of sulfate and dominated by ca so4 or ca hco3 so4 type the discharge of the sidi river significantly increased from 0 34 m3 s at r07 to 3 77 m3 s at r04 then decreased to 0 02 m3 s at r01 the outlet of the conduit fig 5 variations of ec hco3 2 so4 2 ca2 mg2 do and temperature along the sw and gw flow are shown in figs 4 and 7 water from the upstream of the sidi river is characterized by relative lower chemical constituents except for so4 2 4 2 isotopes δ2h δ18o and 222rn in surface water and groundwater the statistical results of δ 18o and δ 2h and the plot of δ 18o versus δ 2h for surface water and karst groundwater are shown in table 2 and fig 3 respectively the δ 18o values in surface water samples ranges from 7 4 to 5 8 average value of 6 6 and δ 2h values from 43 to 33 average value of 38 δ 18o values in groundwater ranged from 6 1 to 5 2 with an average of 5 8 and δ 2h values from 38 to 30 with an average of 34 respectively table 2 most of the samples taken from the upstream of the sidi river are characterized by lighter δ 18o and δ 2h isotopic signals thus located in the bottom left corner of the blue area in fig 3 while δ 18o and δ 2h are heavier in karst groundwater in the downstream area including karst spring water karst spring fed streams and well water from karst aquifer thus located in the red circle of the relative upper right corner the variations of δ 18o δ 2h and ec along the sw and gw flow are shown in fig 4 water from the upstream of the sidi river characterized with a relative depleted isotopic signal δ 2h is around 40 and δ 18o is around 7 0 until it flew into the conduit at sampling point r13 δ 2h is 34 and δ 18o is 5 9 tributary of the sidi river like r08 δ 2h is 34 and δ 18o is 6 0 are at relatively lower elevation thus carried with δ 18o and δ 2h composition which is close to the enriched karst groundwater while δ 18o and δ 2h composition in karst streams like r09 and r14 are relatively depleted similar to that in the sidi river fig 4 similar to δ 18o and δ 2h ec varied around 150 μs cm in the sidi river which is significantly lower than that in the karst groundwater and increased at the outlet of the conduit a relatively distinct difference between sw and gw can be identified by the measured 222rn activities except for the peak value at r05 in the sidi river 222rn activities in gw ranged from 2216 7 to 21 000 bq m3 with an average value of 8190 2 bq m3 while for surface water it varied from 159 5 to 12 150 bq m3 with an average value of 3232 8 bq m3 the variations of the 222rn activities along the sidi river and the karst groundwater flow direction can be seen from fig 5 222rn activities in groundwater are relatively low e g sample g03 is 3770 bq m3 at the south part of the study area increased to the peak value of 21 000 bq m3 at the sample point s02 and dropped to 2390 at g02 gw flows from the south to north compared with karst groundwater there are less 222rn activities in the tailings pond 1565 bq m3 sample r11 as well as in the upstream of the sidi river 222rn activities in the sidi river reached the peak value of 12 150 bq m3 at the sampling site r05 and decreased to lower than 1000 bq m3 in the conduit flow fig 5 4 3 estimation of sw gw exchange 222rn activities and flow discharge were applied to determine the relationship of sw gw interaction and quantify the net exchange and gross exchange in specific directions in sections r05 r04 and r04 r01 the net exchange of sw and gw was obtained according to the flow mass balance equation 2 the endmember of gw for the section r05 r04 was the average value of 222rn activities in the karst groundwater along the river flow s03 and g02 the same as the calculation of section r04 r01 s03 g02 and g07 in the section r05 r04 the 222rn concentration of the downstream sampling site r04 is lower than at the upstream sampling site r05 and the river discharge of the downstream sampling site is higher than that of the upstream sampling site therefore it was assumed that inflow from gw to river occurs in conjunction with river water outflow i e case c the same as the calculation of section r04 r01 the gross influent from groundwater qg and gross effluent from the river qr were estimated based on eq 9 parameters and results for river sections are shown on table 3 the net exchange qn in section r05 r04 is 3 58 10 3 m3 s 1 m 1 the gross flux of inflow from groundwater qg is 5 05 10 3 m3 s 1 m 1 and the outflow from river qr is 1 43 10 3 m3 s 1 m 1 while the net exchange qn in section r04 r01 is 3 95 m3 s 1 m 1 with the qg of 2 80 10 4 m3 s 1 m 1 and qr of 4 23 10 3 of m3 s 1 m 1 table 3 the sensitivity analysis of parameters was conducted the relative errors of the two river sections are shown in table 4 and fig 6 the relative errors of calculation results are less than 10 if the measurement errors are remaining 1 and 5 for all parameters when the measurement errors are 10 and 20 the relative errors of calculation results are less than 27 when the measurement error is 35 and 50 the relative error is mostly less than 50 the maximum relative error is caused by 50 of the measurement error in this case the upstream flow rate cu and river length l can cause 120 7 and 97 2 of relative error therefore cu and l can be concluded as sensitive parameters which coincide with previous studies su et al 2015 yang et al 2020 5 discussion 5 1 transformation of rainfall to gw and sw stable isotopes δ 18o and δ 2h are natural indicators for understanding the hydrological mechanisms and pathways by which water travels

2014 because guilin city and the study area are in about 35 km distance and both belong to the guilin yangshuo basin with the similar monsoon climate conditions the lmwl is slightly offset higher than the global meteoric water line gmwl δ 2h 8 δ 18o 10 craig 1961 compared with the gmwl the steeper slope and higher y intercept of the lmwl mat be resulted from the relative warm and rainy subtropic climate of the area and less secondary evaporation wu et al 2014 without the effect of rainfall amount the δ 18o and δ 2h values of rainfall are seasonally changed depleted to 102 for δ 2h and 13 0 for δ 18o in summer enriched to 43 for δ 2h and 2 5 for δ 18o in winter due to the different predominant moisture masses sources wu et al 2014 similar to what observed in a mountain catchment of oregon usa the variation of δ 18o was primarily related to elevation which is affected by the prior precipitation segura et al 2019 the depleted δ 18o and δ 2h compositions in the sidi river are likely attributed by the local altitude effect of rainfall in the upstream area as it was originated from the eastern high mountainous region with almost 800 m elevation difference clark and fritz 1997 as shown in the blue area of fig 3 the δ 18o and δ 2h isotopic values in the sidi river have less variability in different seasons the enriched stable isotopic compositions of karst groundwater plotted close to the lmwl indicating that the groundwater may be originated from local rainfall of the downstream karst area fig 3 however due to the rainfall decreased from summer to winter the water from the mountainous area carried with depleted signal transports through the sidi river and becomes more and more prevailing as part of recharge to the karst groundwater it can be indicated by that the δ 18o and δ 2h compositions of karst groundwater get closer to that in winter fig 3 and enriched in summer depleted in winter it is opposite to the seasonal pattern of δ 18o and δ 2h in rainfall wu et al 2014 guo et al 2015 moreover due to the relatively lower hydraulic conductivity the possibility that the infiltrated rainwater mixed and diffusional exchanged with water stored in the epi karst from the last season could not be excluded it results in the different characteristics of δ 18o and δ 2h isotopic compositions in rainfall and groundwater a similar phenomenon was also observed by previous studies conducted in the yaji experimental site a similar karst depression 38 km from the north of the study area guo et al 2015 chen et al 2017a 2017b 5 2 surface water groundwater exchange the discharge of the river is sensitive to the net groundwater influent inflow minus outflow whereas environmental tracers are sensitive to the gross influent and effluent mccallum et al 2012 the radon mass balance shows that the influent from groundwater to river occurs in conjunction with river water effluent in both sections net gaining and losing sections can be defined based on the variations of river discharge and the radon mass balance 5 2 1 net gaining section r05 r04 the dramatical increase of flow discharge and the drop of 222rn activities from 12 150 at r05 to 159 5 bq m3 at r04 with an inflow endmember of 2303 4 bq m3 can be identified as a signal of groundwater influent fig 5 and table 3 however stable isotopic values kept in a same level in this section fig 4 the possibility of converging from tributaries was ruled out due to such a growth of flow discharge because the inflow of tributaries e g sample r08 can result in isotopic enrichment as they are featured by an elevated signal due to the low elevation no obvious response for ec values and other major water chemical constituents such as hco3 2 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 was observed figs 4 and 7 the temperature was also decreased with groundwater inflow while the do values slightly increased probably due to the equilibrium with oxygen in the air fig 7 after a wet season with abundant rainfall the portion of water stored in the riverbank is characterized by the depleted stable isotopic and ec values of water from the sidi river whereas 222rn activities are increased in the water of riverbank storage due to the relatively higher solubility in water with a henry coefficient ratio of the 222rn activity bq l in water versus gas phase of about 0 35 at 10 c clever 1979 it is sufficiently supplied by surrounding rocks and soils ortega et al 2017 the pre stored water was squeezed out to the river driven by the hydraulic gradient from aquifer towards the sidi river in the section r05 r04 consequently only 222rn activities reacted to the inflow in this section although a partial or full contribution of pre stored water to the increase of flow discharge in section r05 r04 was inferred the endmember of inflow water can be assumed to be average value of the samples g02 and s03 as there is a lack of the values from the bank storage water inevitably this part of water contributes to the increase in river discharge could be misinterpreted as groundwater discharge therefore the exchange flux of the section r05 r04 is probably overestimated nevertheless the endmember value obtained from gw samples g02 and s03 can be acceptable due to the following reasons 1 the well depth of sample g02 is around 1 8 m which is close to the shallow unsaturated zone suggesting similar 222rn activities levels batiot guilhe et al 2007 222rn activities in s03 is also close to that of the g02 2 it is well known that 222rn in the soils is higher than that in limestone tadolini and spizzico 1998 laubenstein and magaldi 2008 water in the riverbank contains more 222rn than that in gw however khadka et al 2017 revealed a similar and relatively lower 222rn activities in pore water and small karst springs it may be resulted from that the diffuse flow through the porous medium is slow enough allowing 222rn to decay hence it can be assumed the similar 222rn activities of the bank storage water with that in the shallow gw the resulting exchange flux qg represents the water contributed both by the bank storage and the karst aquifer the relative error of inflow endmember will be discussed in the following section it is basically equivalent for the fluxes in both directions qg and qr as they are in the same order of magnitude in the section r05 r04 generally such recharge from the riverbank storage is taking place when there are rise and subsequent fall in the river stage cranswick and cook 2015 frequently surface water loses to its bank reducing the flood level and recharging the aquifer during flood event when a dry season comes the pre stored bank storage water releases to compensate the decrease of river flow sophocleous 2002 sometimes under the baseflow conditions the amount of bank storage water can even surpass the discharge of groundwater brunke and gonser 1997 karst area usually are considered as relatively poor systems of regulation but strong systems of amplification or generation of floods and flash floods bailly comte et al 2012 in which epi karst exerts a strong control on run off generation fu et al 2016 poulain et al 2018 observed that the diffuse flow dominates most of the storage water in the low permeability epi karst zones in this study the variations of ec δ 18o and δ 2h and 222rn activities corresponding to the increase of river flow can be resulted from the of antecedent stored water discharge deng et al 2017 5 2 2 net losing section r04 r01 over 99 of river flow is lost in section r04 r01 when it flows through the section r04 r01 therefore qr is relative dominant as it is one order of magnitude larger than qg in the section r04 r01 table 3 the segment of conduit r13 r01 potentially plays a critical role in the loss of a large amount of water as it accounts for almost half of the section and with a higher hydraulic conductivity fig 1 tracers vary in the segment from r04 to r13 and in the segment of the conduit from r13 to r01 the enriched δ 18o and δ 2h values in the sidi river relative to the stable isotopic levels of gw indicate the inflow of gw in r04 to r13 and remain the values in r13 to r01 as mentioned above in section 3 2 2 the total evaporation loss accounts for about 2 of the river depth within around 5 days besides in fig 3 both surface and ground water are close to the lmwl or slightly higher than it usually presenting a signal of evaporation the distance from r04 to r13 is around 500 m with an average flow rate of 0 72 m s table 3 the river water allows to stay less than half an hour as a result of the stable isotopic values enrichment from r04 to r13 the effect of evaporation could be neglected except for the stable isotopic values no obvious variation has been observed for chemicals ec hco3 2 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 t and do in the segment from r04 to r13 it might be resulted from the short residence time thus the chemical physical indexes could not be evenly distributed in contrast the mixing of different waters can be seen from a dramatically declined temperature and being close to the similar hydrochemical levels with those in karst groundwater fig 7 the inconsistent responses of different tracers at different parts of the section r04 r01 reflect the intensity and complexity of the conduit in sw gw interaction of karst areas 5 3 conceptual model of rainfall sw gw transformation processes the quality of surface and ground water of the study area has been threatened by the upstream pb zn mine and its tailings kong et al 2018 qin et al 2019 it is essential to obtain the knowledge of water transformations from rainfall to surface and ground water as well as accurately quantify the interaction between surface and ground water based on above observations a conceptual model of the rainfall sw gw transformation regime is constructed in the subtropical karst area of southwest china this model presents several major processes responsible for transformations in different water forms in the study area these are as follows 1 an obvious altitude effect on the δ 18o and δ 2h isotopic values in the upstream non karst area has been observed 2 for the recharge of karst groundwater in the downstream valley water originated from the upstream non karst area with the depleted stable isotopic signal and transported through the sidi river is dominant in winter the local rainfall water characterized by the elevated stable isotopic signal is more important during summertime 3 in the gaining section of the karst area the bank storage water superimposed on karst groundwater contributes to the increase of flow discharge and the quantities of inflow and outflow are in the same order of magnitude 4 in the following losing section a well mixing process between river water and groundwater has been observed in the segment of conduit which indicates the different variations of tracers relative to the segment of surface flow the amount of outflow is one order of magnitude larger than that of inflow 5 4 environmental implications abandoned metal s mines and their related tailings are widely distributed in southwest china kun et al 2016 chen et al 2017a 2017b lu et al 2019 which is one of the most developed karst landscapes in the world the study area has long suffered from heavy metals in soil however there is less attention has been paid to the quality of surface water and groundwater qin et al 2019 previous research on the effect of the abandoned pb zn mine on the karst water showing there is potentially transport of heavy metals such as pb zn cd and as through the sidi river qin et al 2019 among all the three seasons so4 2 is the most dominant in winter dec 2015 as it accounts for more than 40 of total anions in three of surface water samples and it accounts for 78 of the total anions in the mine drainage water fig 2 qin et al 2019 the so4 2 ion varies in an inverse characteristic higher in the sidi river and lower in gw fig 6 compared with other hydrochemicals it may be resulted from sulfides oxidation from the mine and tailings the sulfides oxygenation can release large quantities of metals to the downstream karst valley transported by the sidi river qin et al 2019 during the bank storage water intrusion the transported organic matter can induce carbonate dissolution alters redox state and impacts trace metal mobility brown et al 2014 2019 metals thus are introduced into gw through sw gw interaction especially through conduit flow in which water could exchange back and forth directly a study in a similar mountain area of south china the dabaoshan mine area manifested that hydraulic transportation can be the most important driving force for metallic elements migration in both dissolved phase and fine suspended particle phase chen et al 2018 actually river water recharge could transport heavy metals into the surrounding aquifers as well in both dry and wet seasons wang et al 2019 in the dabaoshan mine area the contaminated aquifer due to the discharge of acid mine drainage is in turn acting as long term significant pollution sources to the surrounding gaining rivers wang et al 2019 therefore it is urgent to put more efforts on the study of water quality and transport of metals in the presented karst water system 6 conclusions transformations of rainfall surface water groundwater are important for water resources regulation and further tracing the transport of potential contaminations such as pb zn cd and gu in the historical polluted karst system the transformation processes have been identified based on the δ 2h and δ 18o isotopic compositions physical and chemical indexes t do ec hco3 2 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 and 222rn activities in different water forms δ 18o and δ 2h in rainfall on the upstream non karst area and downstream karst area are characterized with different values due to the altitude effect which makes the sidi river from the upstream carrying a depleted signal the δ 18o and δ 2h levels in karst gw vary during summer autumn winter seasons showing the dominant recharge from the river to the karst groundwater in winter and less dominant during summer interaction between the sidi river and gw in the downstream karst area was estimated according to the 222rn mass balance model superimposed on the information obtained from river flow gauging δ 18o and δ 2h stable isotope values and the physical chemical items in autumn a net gaining section qn 3 58 10 3 m3 s m and a net losing section qn 3 95 10 3 m3 s m have been delineated and quantified the bank storage water contributed in the net gaining section reflected by the inconsistent of spatial responses of stable isotopic and chemical tracers to the gw influent which resulted in a relative identical amount of groundwater inflow and river water outflow qg and qr are 3 58 10 3 and 1 43 10 3 m3 s m respectively the outflow of river water qr 4 23 10 3 m3 s m is one order of magnitude larger than the inflow of groundwater qg 2 80 10 4 in the net losing section in which a well mixing process can be observed in the conduit segment toxic metals both in dissolved phase and suspended particle phase may be introduced to the water system along with the processes of rainfall to sw and gw and easily transported throughout the system as the intense sw gw interaction both this and the previous study have revealed the unusual variation characteristic of so4 2 ion which probably is a result of sulfides oxygenation from the mine and tailings we recommend continued monitoring of sw and gw quality and further evaluating the transport of metals in the rainfall sw gw processes as well as duly reinforce of the tailings dam and remediation of contaminated soil to prevent the continual

4989,the vulnerable karst water systems and the serious pollution issues in southwest china have been facing tremendous challenges especially when controlling processes of transformation in rainfall surface and groundwater sw and gw are poorly understood in such areas in this study transformation processes have been identified based on physical chemical indicators t do ec hco3 2 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 δ 2h and δ 18o isotopes and 222rn activities in different water forms the δ 2h and δ 18o isotopic signals of the river are depleted in the upstream non karst area due to the altitude effect the karst aquifers are dominantly recharged by local rainfall in summer and by river water from the non karst area in winter indicated by the seasonal variation of stable isotopic compositions a 222rn mass balance model was constructed to estimate gw sw exchange during the autumn period net gaining and net losing sections including a segment of conduit flow were identified to be fluxes of 3 6 10 3 and 4 0 10 3 m3 s 1 m 1 respectively the bank storage water contributed critically in the net gaining section deduced by the inconsistent responses of stable isotopic and chemical tracers to the gw influent which resulted in a relative identical amount of influent and effluent water 5 0 10 3 and 1 4 10 3 m3 s 1 m 1 respectively in the net losing section influent and effluent are 2 8 10 4 and 4 2 10 3 m3 s 1 m 1 respectively interactions through the segment of surface flow are sluggish which is standing in stark contrast to the well mixed flow in the conduit segment the results reveal various signs of sulfides oxidation from the mine and tailings along with liberated metals could be introduced and travelled across in the transformations of rainfall sw gw it needs to put more efforts into the

et al 2019 aghili et al 2018 the contaminated aquifers can be responsible for acting as long term significant pollution sources to the surrounding environment wang et al 2019 the transformations from rainfall to surface and ground water and the interactions between surface and ground water are principally controlled by geomorphologic hydrogeologic and climatic conditions tóth 1970 sophocleous 2002 water in karst aquifers is fast diffusive and sometimes the infiltration is concentrated depends on the distribution of conduits development of the heterogeneity and anisotropy parise et al 2018 it is highly vulnerable to contamination and difficult to manage because of the unique hydrogeological characteristics contaminants such as metals move along and spread across water forms in karst areas having chemical physical and biological reactions with the surroundings under a highly dynamic and heterogeneous framework which can affect the mobility persistence and potential exposure of humans

karst reservoirs has been poorly understood in contrast to other porous medium aquifers bailly comte et al 2009 it still has great challenges and uncertainty when trying to trace transportation implement remedial actions and manage contaminated systems padilla and vesper 2018 in order to develop protection strategies against water pollution it is necessary to identify the different processes of transformation in rainfall gw sw environmental tracers have become powerful and well developed tools for investigating the governing processes of rainfall sw gw transformation in the karst water

evaluate the pollution level in the different land use type of soil the effect on the microbial enzymatic activity of soil microorganisms jin et al 2015 li et al 2015 kong et al 2018 however few studies has been carried out for evaluating the quality of surface and ground water and migration of heavy metals in the hydraulic system which has been threatened by the contaminated soil and the upstream mine and tailing pond qin et al 2019 in order to further ascertain the migration of toxic metals in the water system this study aims to trace the transformation processes of rainfall surface

surface and groundwater transformations both in the non karst and karst area ii to evaluate and quantify the exchange between river water and karst groundwater at different flow sections of the karst valley and iii to propose a conceptual model of the rainfall surface water groundwater transformation processes for the study area and analyze the potential transport pathways of the pollutants it can provide fundamental knowledge of the water cycle framework for further tracing toxic metals transportation and support the water resources management for local authorities 2 study area the study area is located in the southeastern of guilin city guangxi zhuang autonomous region southwest china it is a karst valley surrounded by the range of haiyang mountains to the east elevation varies from 900 to 1500 m and karst hills 500 600 m height to the west fig 1 sidi river originates from haiyang mountain in which the pb zn mine located and flows westward down to the villages of baihualing and sidi then turns to the southward to villages of dabiao and jiaotian fig 1 the villages s elevation varies in 100 200 m the sidi river flows into a karst conduit at jiaotian village turns to an underground river with a runoff modulus around 6 l s km2 and flows out at 1 km distance to the north fig 1 the length of the upper reach east to west reach is around 7 3 km and area of the downstream valley south to north reach is around 5 km2 the study area belongs to the guilin yangshuo basin which is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with two distinct periods of a cold dry season from september to march and a hot rainy season from april to august the average annual temperature and rainfall are around 18 9 c and 1886 mm year almost 70 of the total precipitation occurs in the rainy season the average monthly precipitation varies from 50 mm in december to 359 mm in june while the average temperature per month ranges from 7 9 c in january to 28 2 c in july guo et al 2015 the lithology of the study area consists of cambrian devonian є d sandstone and clastic rocks to the east haiyang mountain range also simplified as non karst area in this study devonian to carboniferous d c carbonate rocks and devonian d carbonates discontinuity covered by quaternary q clay and clay loam to the west represented by karst area fig 1 institute of karst geology 2015 the relatively impervious formations of the non karst area suggest that its recharge to the lowland karst area is mainly contributed by a focused surface water i e the sidi river fig 1 groundwater in the karst area generally flows from south to north and buried in depth within 10 m karst springs with discharges larger than 10 l s during dry seasons are widely distributed the overlying soil cover varies from 0 to 2 m in the valley area and mainly consists of calcareous clay and clay loam with limited permeability yaji experimental site in guilin with the similar geology and lithology setting and close distance about 38 km to the study area has been built to explore the karst hydrology processes since the 1990s yuan et al 1990 previous soil water movement experiments in around 45 cm depth in 10 cm interval on the yaji experimental site showed the hydraulic conductivities of barren land vary in 0 0043 0 17 m day with an average value of 0 06 m day in grasslands the hydraulic conductivities are between 0 01 and

suffered from heavy metals pollution mainly pb zn cd and cu in soils due to the exploration of the pb zn mine since the 1950s fig 1 the collapse of the tailings dam happened in the 1970s which poured tailings sands and waste rocks directly down to the farmland of the sidi village efforts including mining cessation investigation and restoration of the soil pollution have been made and significantly decreases the concentration of metals in soil however the remains metals are still threatening the environment e g the total cd content of the soil is 40 mg kg on average according to recent research

investigations have been carried out in winter december 2015 and summer june 2016 in order to understand the general hydraulic and hydrogeology regime and effects of the abandoned pb zn mine on water quality of the study area qin et al 2019 it is better to conduct the field investigation between previous seasons as a complementary under limit research conditions moreover it is important to implement the sw gw interaction survey during also before and after period without heavy precipitation to simplify the process of data collection and computation as a result of above considerations field measurement and sampling campaigns were conducted in the study area during the period of 23rd to 30th september 2018 besides hydrochemical and δ 2h and δ 18o data for surface and groundwater collected from the previous research by qin et al 2019 on the study area in december 2015 and june 2016 have been compiled and compared with the data collected during september 2018 in this study through exactly the same analysis methods and data processing at the same lab twenty six water samples were collected including 11 groundwater samples and 15 river water samples seven gw samples were taken from shallow domestic wells drilled in the karst aquifer with well depths ranging from 2 to 10 m groundwater sampling was performed using either a submersible pump or a hand pump that was pumping water at least 10 and 20 min respectively before sampling to obtain fresh groundwater the rest 4 gw samples were collected from karst springs there are 11 sw samples were taken from the sidi river and one of them r08 were sampled from a tributary of the sidi river on the non karst area fig 1 the remaining 4 were sampled from the karst spring or gw fed streams spring and other surface water were sampled about 30 cm below the water surface or in the middle of depth if the total depth is lower than 60 cm the principle of surface and groundwater sampling campaigns is following the flow direction of karst gw and the sidi river samples for water chemistry analysis were infiltrated through 0 45 μm filter immediately in situ collected in three 100 ml hdpe bottles which were overflowed and tightly capped protect from air contact and stored at 4 c fridge after sealed with parafilm all samples were immediately transported to the laboratory for further analysis with the restriction of accessibility r05 r04 and r01 sampling points are set as cross sections in the exploration of sw gw interaction as their well representativity velocity area method was applied in

standard mean ocean water v smow with precisions of 1 and 0 1 respectively 3 2 mass balance of water flow and 222rn 3 2 1 flow mass balance rainfall and evaporation need to be considered in the balance of flow mass the average annual evaporation rate in the guilin area is 1378 3 mm deng et al 2017 i e 3 78 mm d with a 5 day mean life of 222rn the evaporation loss could be 18 8 mm which is around 2 5 2 7 of the river depth about 0 76 0 7 m along the calculated sections of the sidi river table 3 therefore considering that the runoff times within the river sections are both less than one day evaporation loss can be neglected in the mass balance equation there was rarely precipitation in the study area before and after the sampling campaign hence precipitation and evaporation can be neglected in the mass balance basic mass balance equations between the upstream and downstream reaches can be expressed by equations 2 and 3 for river water flow 2 q d q u q n l 3 q n q g q r qu m3 s and qd m3 s are the discharge of the upstream downstream respectively while qg and qr theoretically represent the rate of groundwater inflow to the river and river water outflow to aquifer per unit

radioactive decay of 226ra and hyporheic exchange of riverbed sediments once the sources and sinks of radon reach equilibrium in a unit water body i e a steady state of environmental condition been reached the radon activity does not change with time the immediately increased 222rn activity in surface water can be considered as a signal of groundwater recharge subsequently due to degas and radioactive decay the elevated 222rn activity will gradually decrease to the equilibrium value yang et al 2020 it is also assumed that both in longitudinal and vertical radon in the water is instantaneously mixed and reach a stable state water collected in the downstream is the same part that collected in the upstream and can represent the average value of the section cook 2013 hyporheic exchange can increase the 222rn activity in the flow of the river without adding discharge which could lead to the overestimation of the groundwater inflow cook et al 2006 cook 2013 an elaborate investigation of hyporheic exchange requires meticulous research of the riverbed including a series of complex experiments cook 2013 however access to collect enough river sediments for the estimation of radon production also for accurately measuring the porosity of the river sediments is limited due to the steep topography following the previous studies su et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 yang et al 2020 for an area with sparse hydraulic data tests the hyporheic exchange is not considered in this study according to the mass conservation theory that take both gas exchange and radioactive decay

surface renewal theory danckwerts 1951 o connor and dobbins 1958 and the stagnant film model broecker 1982 lewis and whitman 1924 the latter model assumes that a stagnant film of water separates the stream and the air above it which is inapplicable in the study area as the sidi river is mainly turbulent when the gas exchange in a stream is mostly determined by turbulence the renewal theory can be applied to estimate 222rn concentration loss stellato et al 2008 therefore loss coefficient γ caused by gas exchange is danckwerts 1951 o connor and dobbins 1958 stellato et al 2008 12 γ d 1 2 h 1 2 v

2 h 1 2 v 3 2 the 222rn model is based on constant value parameters which fluctuates along the river therefore it is necessary to examine the errors caused by variation of parameters lenhart et al 2002 sensitivity analysis of parameters was applied to obtain the level of accuracy if various parameters used in the calculation and to reduce the uncertainty based on a better consideration of the

parameters of water samples including water temperature ph do ec and orp are presented in table 1 water temperature measured for surface and groundwater samples ranged between 19 9 and 26 4 c and 20 7 25 1 c with average values of 22 4 and 22 3 c respectively values of ph have a range of 7 6 8 5 with an average value of 8 0 for surface water and slightly acid 6 7 7 9 with an average value of 7 3 for groundwater apparently do in the sidi river varied between 4 5 and 8 mg l with an average value of 6 9 mg l is larger than that in groundwater varied in 1 2 6 2 mg l with an average value of 4 mg l ec values ranged from 82 9 to 467 2 μs cm in the surface water with an average value of 244 1 μs cm karst groundwater samples have relatively higher ec with a range of 213 631 6 μs cm and an average value of 457 9 μs cm major chemical components of surface and ground water samples and the water types can be seen from table 2 and 5 and piper plot fig 2 the data collected from the previous research december 2015 and june 2016 are also compiled in fig 2 most of surface and groundwater were dominated by ca hco3 type except for those taken from the sidi river with a higher percentage of sulfate and dominated by ca so4 or ca hco3 so4 type the discharge of the sidi river significantly increased from 0 34 m3 s at r07 to 3 77 m3 s at r04 then decreased to 0 02 m3 s at r01 the outlet of the conduit fig 5 variations of ec hco3 2 so4 2 ca2 mg2 do and temperature along the sw and gw flow are shown in figs 4 and 7 water from the upstream of the sidi river is characterized by relative lower chemical constituents except for so4 2 4 2 isotopes δ2h δ18o and 222rn in surface water and groundwater the statistical results of δ 18o and δ 2h and the plot of δ 18o versus δ 2h for surface water and karst groundwater are shown in table 2 and fig 3 respectively the δ 18o values in surface water samples ranges from 7 4 to 5 8 average value of 6 6 and δ 2h values from 43 to 33 average value of 38 δ 18o values in groundwater ranged from 6 1 to 5 2 with an average of 5 8 and δ 2h values from 38 to 30 with an average of 34 respectively table 2 most of the samples taken from the upstream of the sidi river are characterized by lighter δ 18o and δ 2h isotopic signals thus located in the bottom left corner of the blue area in fig 3 while δ 18o and δ 2h are heavier in karst groundwater in the downstream area including karst spring water karst spring fed streams and well water from karst aquifer thus located in the red circle of the relative upper right corner the variations of δ 18o δ 2h and ec along the sw and gw flow are shown in fig 4 water from the upstream of the sidi river characterized with a relative depleted isotopic signal δ 2h is around 40 and δ 18o is around 7 0 until it flew into the conduit at sampling point r13 δ 2h is 34 and δ 18o is 5 9 tributary of the sidi river like r08 δ 2h is 34 and δ 18o is 6 0 are at relatively lower elevation thus carried with δ 18o and δ 2h composition which is close to the enriched karst groundwater while δ 18o and δ 2h composition in karst streams like r09 and r14 are relatively depleted similar to that in the sidi river fig 4 similar to δ 18o and δ 2h ec varied around 150 μs cm in the sidi river which is significantly lower than that in the karst groundwater and increased at the outlet of the conduit a relatively distinct difference between sw and gw can be identified by the measured 222rn activities except for the peak value at r05 in the sidi river 222rn activities in gw ranged from 2216 7 to 21 000 bq m3 with an average value of 8190 2 bq m3 while for surface water it varied from 159 5 to 12 150 bq m3 with an average value of 3232 8 bq m3 the variations of the 222rn activities along the sidi river and the karst groundwater flow direction can be seen from fig 5 222rn activities in groundwater are relatively low e g sample g03 is 3770 bq m3 at the south part of the study area increased to the peak value of 21 000 bq m3 at the sample point s02 and dropped to 2390 at g02 gw flows from the south to north compared with karst groundwater there are less 222rn activities in the tailings pond 1565 bq m3 sample r11 as well as in the upstream of the sidi river 222rn activities in the sidi river reached the peak value of 12 150 bq m3 at the sampling site r05 and decreased to lower than 1000 bq m3 in the conduit flow fig 5 4 3 estimation of sw gw exchange 222rn activities and flow discharge were applied to determine the relationship of sw gw interaction and quantify the net exchange and gross exchange in specific directions in sections r05 r04 and r04 r01 the net exchange of sw and gw was obtained according to the flow mass balance equation 2 the endmember of gw for the section r05 r04 was the average value of 222rn activities in the karst groundwater along the river flow s03 and g02 the same as the calculation of section r04 r01 s03 g02 and g07 in the section r05 r04 the 222rn concentration of the downstream sampling site r04 is lower than at the upstream sampling site r05 and the river discharge of the downstream sampling site is higher than that of the upstream sampling site therefore it was assumed that inflow from gw to river occurs in conjunction with river water outflow i e case c the same as the calculation of section r04 r01 the gross influent from groundwater qg and gross effluent from the river qr were estimated based on eq 9 parameters and results for river sections are shown on table 3 the net exchange qn in section r05 r04 is 3 58 10 3 m3 s 1 m 1 the gross flux of inflow from groundwater qg is 5 05 10 3 m3 s 1 m 1 and the outflow from river qr is 1 43 10 3 m3 s 1 m 1 while the net exchange qn in section r04 r01 is 3 95 m3 s 1 m 1 with the qg of 2 80 10 4 m3 s 1 m 1 and qr of 4 23 10 3 of m3 s 1 m 1 table 3 the sensitivity analysis of parameters was conducted the relative errors of the two river sections are shown in table 4 and fig 6 the relative errors of calculation results are less than 10 if the measurement errors are remaining 1 and 5 for all parameters when the measurement errors are 10 and 20 the relative errors of calculation results are less than 27 when the measurement error is 35 and 50 the relative error is mostly less than 50 the maximum relative error is caused by 50 of the measurement error in this case the upstream flow rate cu and river length l can cause 120 7 and 97 2 of relative error therefore cu and l can be concluded as sensitive parameters which coincide with previous studies su et al 2015 yang et al 2020 5 discussion 5 1 transformation of rainfall to gw and sw stable isotopes δ 18o and δ 2h are natural indicators for understanding the hydrological mechanisms and pathways by which water travels through the complex system binet et al 2017 especially for transformations in different water forms stable isotope values of meteoric waters can be used to trace hydrological processes at different spatial scales zhao et al 2020 the local meteoric water line lmwl δ 2h 8 8 δ 18o 17 6 r2 0 97 fig 3 can be obtained from 126 rainfall samples during 2012 from the guilin station reported by wu et al 2014 because guilin city and the study area are in about 35 km distance and both belong to the guilin yangshuo basin with the similar monsoon climate conditions the lmwl is slightly offset higher than the global meteoric water line gmwl δ 2h 8 δ 18o 10 craig 1961 compared with the gmwl the steeper slope and higher y intercept of the lmwl mat be resulted from the relative warm and rainy subtropic climate of the area and less secondary evaporation wu et al 2014 without the effect of rainfall amount the δ 18o and δ 2h values of rainfall are seasonally changed depleted to 102 for δ 2h and 13 0 for δ 18o in summer enriched to 43 for δ 2h and 2 5 for δ 18o in winter due to the different predominant moisture masses sources wu et al 2014 similar to what observed in a mountain catchment of oregon usa the variation of δ 18o was primarily related to elevation which is affected by the prior precipitation segura et al 2019 the depleted δ 18o and δ 2h compositions in the sidi river are likely attributed by the local altitude effect of rainfall in the upstream area as it was originated from the eastern high mountainous region with almost 800 m elevation difference clark and fritz 1997 as shown in the blue area of fig 3 the δ 18o and δ 2h isotopic values in the sidi river have less variability in different seasons the enriched stable isotopic compositions of karst groundwater plotted close to the lmwl indicating that the groundwater may be originated from local rainfall of the downstream karst area fig 3 however due to the rainfall decreased from summer to winter the water from the mountainous area carried with depleted signal transports through the sidi river and becomes more and more prevailing as part of recharge to the karst groundwater it can be indicated by that the δ 18o and δ 2h compositions of karst groundwater get closer to that in winter fig 3 and enriched in summer depleted in winter it is opposite to the seasonal pattern of δ 18o and δ 2h in rainfall wu et al 2014 guo et al 2015 moreover due to the relatively lower hydraulic conductivity the possibility that the infiltrated rainwater mixed and diffusional exchanged with water stored in the epi karst from the last season could not be excluded it results in the different characteristics of δ 18o and δ 2h isotopic compositions in rainfall and groundwater a similar phenomenon was also observed by previous studies conducted in the yaji experimental site a similar karst depression 38 km from the north of the study area guo et al 2015 chen et al 2017a 2017b 5 2 surface water groundwater exchange the discharge of the river is sensitive to the net groundwater influent inflow minus outflow whereas environmental tracers are sensitive to the gross influent and effluent mccallum et al 2012 the radon mass balance shows that the influent from groundwater to river occurs in conjunction with river water effluent in both sections net gaining and losing sections can be defined based on the variations of river discharge and the radon mass balance 5 2 1 net gaining section r05 r04 the dramatical increase of flow discharge and the drop of 222rn activities from 12 150 at r05 to 159 5 bq m3 at r04 with an inflow endmember of 2303 4 bq m3 can be identified as a signal of groundwater influent fig 5 and table 3 however stable isotopic values kept in a same level in this section fig 4 the possibility of converging from tributaries was ruled out due to such a growth of flow discharge because the inflow of tributaries e g sample r08 can result in isotopic enrichment as they are featured by an elevated signal due to the low elevation no obvious response for ec values and other major water chemical constituents such as hco3 2 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 was observed figs 4 and 7 the temperature was also decreased with groundwater inflow while the do values slightly increased probably due to the equilibrium with oxygen in the air fig 7 after a wet season with abundant rainfall the portion of water stored in the riverbank is characterized by the depleted stable isotopic and ec values of water from the sidi river whereas 222rn activities are increased in the water of riverbank storage due to the relatively higher solubility in water with a henry coefficient ratio of the 222rn activity bq l in water versus gas phase of about 0 35 at 10 c clever 1979 it is sufficiently supplied by surrounding rocks and soils ortega et al 2017 the pre stored water was squeezed out to the river driven by the hydraulic gradient from aquifer towards the sidi river in the section r05 r04 consequently only 222rn activities reacted to the inflow in this section although a partial or full contribution of pre stored water to the increase of flow discharge in section r05 r04 was inferred the endmember of inflow water can be assumed to be average value of the samples g02 and s03 as there is a lack of the values from the bank storage water inevitably this part of water contributes to the increase in river discharge could be misinterpreted as groundwater discharge therefore the exchange flux of the section r05 r04 is probably overestimated nevertheless the endmember value obtained from gw samples g02 and s03 can be acceptable due to the following reasons 1 the well depth of sample g02 is around 1 8 m which is close to the shallow unsaturated zone suggesting similar 222rn activities levels batiot guilhe et al 2007 222rn activities in s03 is also close to that of the g02 2 it is well known that 222rn in the soils is higher than that in limestone tadolini and spizzico 1998 laubenstein and magaldi 2008 water in the riverbank contains more 222rn than that in gw however khadka et al 2017 revealed a similar and relatively lower 222rn activities in pore water and small karst springs it may be resulted from that the diffuse flow through the porous medium is slow enough allowing 222rn to decay hence it can be assumed the similar 222rn activities of the bank storage water with that in the shallow gw the resulting exchange flux qg represents the water contributed both by the bank storage and the karst aquifer the relative error of inflow endmember will be discussed in the following section it is basically equivalent for the fluxes in both directions qg and qr as they are in the same order of magnitude in the section r05 r04 generally such recharge from the riverbank storage is taking place when there are rise and subsequent fall in the river stage cranswick and cook 2015 frequently surface water loses to its bank reducing the flood level and recharging the aquifer during flood event when a dry season comes the pre stored bank storage water releases to compensate the decrease of river flow sophocleous 2002 sometimes under the baseflow conditions the amount of bank storage water can even surpass the discharge of groundwater brunke and gonser 1997 karst area usually are considered as relatively poor systems of regulation but strong systems of amplification or generation of floods and flash floods bailly comte et al 2012 in which epi karst exerts a strong control on run off generation fu et al 2016 poulain et al 2018 observed that the diffuse flow dominates most of the storage water in the low permeability epi karst zones in this study the variations of ec δ 18o and δ 2h and 222rn activities corresponding to the increase of river flow can be resulted from the of antecedent stored water discharge deng et al 2017 5 2 2 net losing section r04 r01 over 99 of river flow is lost in section r04 r01 when it flows through the section r04 r01 therefore qr is relative dominant as it is one order of magnitude larger than qg in the section r04 r01 table 3 the segment of conduit r13 r01 potentially plays a critical role in the loss of a large amount of water as it accounts for almost half of the section and with a higher hydraulic conductivity fig 1 tracers vary in the segment from r04 to r13 and in the segment of the conduit from r13 to r01 the enriched δ 18o and δ 2h values in the sidi river relative to the stable isotopic levels of gw indicate the inflow of gw in r04 to r13 and remain the values in r13 to r01 as mentioned above in section 3 2 2 the total evaporation loss accounts for about 2 of the river depth within around 5 days besides in fig 3 both surface and ground water are close to the lmwl or slightly higher than it usually presenting a signal of evaporation the distance from r04 to r13 is around 500 m with an average flow rate of 0 72 m s table 3 the river water allows to stay less than half an hour as a result of the stable isotopic values enrichment from r04 to r13 the effect of evaporation could be neglected except for the stable isotopic values no obvious variation has been observed for chemicals ec hco3 2 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 t and do in the segment from r04 to r13 it might be resulted from the short residence time thus the chemical physical indexes could not be evenly distributed in contrast the mixing of different waters can be seen from a dramatically declined temperature and being close to the similar hydrochemical levels with those in karst groundwater fig 7 the inconsistent responses of different tracers at different parts of the section r04 r01 reflect the intensity and complexity of the conduit in sw gw interaction of karst areas 5 3 conceptual model of rainfall sw gw transformation processes the quality of surface and ground water of the study area has been threatened by the upstream pb zn mine and its tailings kong et al 2018 qin et al 2019 it is essential to obtain the knowledge of water transformations from rainfall to surface and ground water as well as accurately quantify the interaction between surface and ground water based on above observations a conceptual model of the rainfall sw gw transformation regime is constructed in the subtropical karst area of southwest china this model presents several major processes responsible for transformations in different water forms in the study area these are as follows 1 an obvious altitude effect on the δ 18o and δ 2h isotopic values in the upstream non karst area has been observed 2 for the recharge of karst groundwater in the downstream valley water originated from the upstream non karst area with the depleted stable isotopic signal and transported through the sidi river is dominant in winter the local rainfall water characterized by the elevated stable isotopic signal is more important during summertime 3 in the gaining section of the karst area the bank storage water superimposed on karst groundwater contributes to the increase of flow discharge and the quantities of inflow and outflow are in the same order of magnitude 4 in the following losing section a well mixing process between river water and groundwater has been observed in the segment of conduit which indicates the different variations of tracers relative to the segment of surface flow the amount of outflow is one order of magnitude larger than that of inflow 5 4 environmental implications abandoned metal s mines and their related tailings are widely distributed in southwest china kun et al 2016 chen et al 2017a 2017b lu et al 2019 which is one of the most developed karst landscapes in the world the study area has long suffered from heavy metals in soil however there is less attention has been paid to the quality of surface water and groundwater qin et al 2019 previous research on the effect of the abandoned pb zn mine on the karst water showing there is potentially transport of heavy metals such as pb zn cd and as through the sidi river qin et al 2019 among all the three seasons so4 2 is the most dominant in winter dec 2015 as it accounts for more than 40 of total anions in three of surface water samples and it accounts for 78 of the total anions in the mine drainage water fig 2 qin et al 2019 the so4 2 ion varies in an inverse characteristic higher in the sidi river and lower in gw fig 6 compared with other hydrochemicals it may be resulted from sulfides oxidation from the mine and tailings the sulfides oxygenation can release large quantities of metals to the downstream karst valley transported by the sidi river qin et al 2019 during the bank storage water intrusion the transported organic matter can induce carbonate dissolution alters redox state and impacts trace metal mobility brown et al 2014 2019 metals thus are introduced into gw through sw gw interaction especially through conduit flow in which water could exchange back and forth directly a study in a similar mountain area of south china the dabaoshan mine area manifested that hydraulic transportation can be the most important driving force for metallic elements migration in both dissolved phase and fine suspended particle phase chen et al 2018 actually river water recharge could transport heavy metals into the surrounding aquifers as well in both dry and wet seasons wang et al 2019 in the dabaoshan mine area the contaminated aquifer due to the discharge of acid mine drainage is in turn acting as long term significant pollution sources to the surrounding gaining rivers wang et al 2019 therefore it is urgent to put more efforts on the study of water quality and transport of metals in the presented karst water system 6 conclusions transformations of rainfall surface water groundwater are important for water resources regulation and further tracing the transport of potential contaminations such as pb zn cd and gu in the historical polluted karst system the transformation processes have been identified based on the δ 2h and δ 18o isotopic compositions physical and chemical indexes t do ec hco3 2 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 and 222rn activities in different water forms δ 18o and δ 2h in rainfall on the upstream non karst area and downstream karst area are characterized with different values due to the altitude effect which makes the sidi river from the upstream carrying a depleted signal the δ 18o and δ 2h levels in karst gw vary during summer autumn winter seasons showing the dominant recharge from the river to the karst groundwater in winter and less dominant during summer interaction between the sidi river and gw in the downstream karst area was estimated according to the 222rn mass balance model superimposed on the information obtained from river flow gauging δ 18o and δ 2h stable isotope values and the physical chemical items in autumn a net gaining section qn 3 58 10 3 m3 s m and a net losing section qn 3 95 10 3 m3 s m have been delineated and quantified the bank storage water contributed in the net gaining section reflected by the inconsistent of spatial responses of stable isotopic and chemical tracers to the gw influent which resulted in a relative identical amount of groundwater inflow and river water outflow qg and qr are 3 58 10 3 and 1 43 10 3 m3 s m respectively the outflow of river water qr 4 23 10 3 m3 s m is one order of magnitude larger than the inflow of groundwater qg 2 80 10 4 in the net losing section in which a well mixing process can be observed in the conduit segment toxic metals both in dissolved phase and suspended particle phase may be introduced to the water system along with the processes of rainfall to sw and gw and easily transported throughout the system as the intense sw gw interaction both this and the previous study have revealed the unusual variation characteristic of so4 2 ion which probably is a result of sulfides oxygenation from the mine and tailings we recommend continued monitoring of sw and gw quality and further evaluating the transport of metals in the rainfall sw gw processes as well as duly reinforce of the tailings dam and remediation of contaminated soil to prevent the continual
