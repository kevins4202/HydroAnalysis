20745,to extend the knowledge on ship manoeuvring and predict ship s behaviour accurately from medium deep to very shallow water this paper comprehensively investigates water depth and speed effects on ship s manoeuvrability steering model and motion control through experimental studies free running model tests at four water depths and six speeds were conducted using a scaled ship model in the towing tank at flanders hydraulics research fhr the influence of under keel clearance and speed on the acceleration tests and zigzag manoeuvres were firstly analysed secondly the shallow water effect on ship steering model was discussed via theoretical analysis and experimental validation then the investigation of the effects of speed and under keel clearance on the ship motion controller s parameters and performance was executed and a novel adaptive controller was proposed to improve controller s performance in shallow water a scheme was proposed to optimize its parameters the results indicate that both speed and water depth have considerable influence on ship s manoeuvrability and controllability especially water depth restrictions change the hydrodynamic forces reduce the propulsion efficiency and manoeuvreability the ship becomes more difficult to manoeuvre and control in shallow water these impacts on ship manoeuvring modelling and motion control cannot be neglected

derivative pianc the world association for waterborne transport infrastructure ukc under keel clearance 1 introduction the disparity between the existing harbour infrastructures fairway dimensions and the increasing ship dimensions has attracted more attention to investigating the ship s behaviour in shallow and confined water when a ship navigates in a port or along narrow channels it will encounter a more complex environment governed by low speed manoeuvring shallow water effects horizontal restrictions etc an accurate evaluation of the ship s manoeuvrability is required to guarantee the safety of the ship a ship s manoeuvrability relies on the water depth h of the navigation area in relation to the draft t m of the ship according to the definition of limited water depths in pianc 1992 the water depth can be classified into four main groups fig 1 deep water h t m 3 0 medium deep water 1 5 h t m 3 0 shallow water 1 2 h t m 1 5 very shallow water h t m 1 2 the impact of depth limitations can be noticed in medium deep water is very significant in shallow water and dominates the ship s behaviour in very shallow water vantorre et al 2017 forward speed is another especially important influence factor for ship manoeuvreability and controllability and the effects of shallow water and speed make it difficult to manoeuvre and control the ship when sailing in confined areas therefore it is essential to investigate the ship manoeuvring behaviour and control performance and improve related knowledge in finite water the study on ship manoeuvring in confined water has recently received more attention in literature several works addressing this problem can be found in fujino 1968 lee 2003 vantorre et al 2003 lee and lee 2008 and more recent works of eloot and vantorre 2011 eloot et al 2015 mucha 2017 vantorre et al 2017 lataire et al 2018 mucha et al 2019 hinostroza et al 2019 and tello ruiz et al 2019 moreover the criteria for manoeuvring in shallow and restricted water was introduced by the 27th ittc manoeuvring committee ittc 2017 the simman workshop organized related research activities to predict ship manoeuvring and provide benchmark data simman 2014 the mashcon conferences have been held to discuss the developments of ship manoeuvring in shallow and confined water mashcon 2016 2019 nevertheless the data in literature are quite limited most data concern the shallow water and medium deep water ranges but results obtained from very shallow water conditions are rather rare this very shallow water range is extremely crucial for ship manoeuvring in harbour areas canals and access channels for instance the minimum requirement for ships sailing in the access channels to the belgian harbours exposed to the sea is a gross under keel clearance ukc of 15 of draft in more sheltered conditions such as the dock of antwerp harbour or the sea canal connecting ghent with the river scheldt the value is even reduced to 10 vantorre 2003 the research about the ship s manoeuvrability considering the finite water depth can provide data support for the development of manoeuvring mathematical models and the design of motion controllers the simulation of the ship s manoeuvring behaviour depends on accurate knowledge of the hydrodynamic coefficients in the equations of motion these coefficients are easily calculated in deep water but are much more difficult to be determined in shallow water inoue 1969 adopted the wing theory to calculate the derivatives of forces on a turning ship in shallow water a mathematical model considering side wall and water depth limitations was introduced by norrbin 1971 clarke 1997 discussed linear derivatives taking account of shallow water corrections vantorre 2001 reviewed and evaluated the semi empirical approaches for formulating the manoeuvring mathematical model in shallow and very shallow water conditions a 6 dof shallow water manoeuvring model was proposed by delefortrie et al 2016 the sensitivity analysis of the hydrodynamic derivatives in shallow water was presented in kim et al 2017 the effect of water depth on the ship s mathematical model was studied in xu et al 2020 the mathematical models in literature were mostly established in deep water a limited number of studies concentrated on the problem in very shallow water the model describing the ship s manoeuvring behaviour in confined water is not only more complex owing to the occurrence of additional parameters e g water depth to draft ratio or bank distance but also because of the fact that many parameters determining the ship s kinematics e g drift angle forward speed and control propeller rate rudder deflection which belong to a more extended range vantorre 2003 hence the comprehensive investigation of these impacts on modelling the manoeuvring behaviour in shallow water is deemed necessary to characterize ship manoeuvreability and controllability with the development of autonomous ships and the improvement of automation control theory has been applied to manoeuvring problems such as automatic berthing the control algorithms include course control path following control and speed control etc ship motion controls are very important for marine autonomous surface ships mass when sailing and manoeuvring in harbours and access channels where the ship demands more control actions however the manoeuvring capability is challenged in finite water depth and the local under keel clearance heavily affects this challenge owing to the change of forces and moments around the ship in such scenarios the requirement of ship speed is stricter which is significantly different compared to the open sea moreover the performance of the controller is determined by its parameters which vary with speed and water depth the relationship between the controller s parameters and influencing factors should be further studied in literature although some researchers used numerical simulations to discuss the ship s heading control problem in shallow water such as zhang et al 2005 and lee et al 2009 to the authors best knowledge very few studies concentrated on the experimental investigation of the shallow water and speed effects on the controller s performance and parameter changes especially with respect to the path following control problem motivated by the above analysis the main aim of the present work is to study the effects of forward speed and water depth on the ship s manoeuvreability steering model and motion control based on free running model tests the main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 free running model tests have been performed at six forward speeds and four water depths focusing on the study of the ship s manoeuvring performance in medium deep and very shallow water 2 the impact of forward speed and finite water depth on acceleration tests and zigzag manoeuvres were investigated 3 theoretical analysis and experimental validation were combined to study the change of the ship s steering model at various speeds and under keel clearances 4 the speed and water depth dependency problem of the pid controller s parameters was solved through a relationship between the pid values and the propeller rate and water depth yielding a novel adaptive controller 5 shallow water effects on the parameters and the path following performance of controllers were discussed while the approach of optimizing the controllers tracking capacity in shallow water was introduced 2 theory considerations 2 1 ship mathematical model a 6 degrees of freedom dof dynamic model can be expressed as fossen 2011 1 m r b m a ν c r b ν c a ν ν d ν ν g η τ τ e x t where m r b is the rigid body inertia matrix m a is the added mass matrix c r b ν is the rigid body coriolis and centripetal matrix c a ν is the added coriolis and centripetal matrix d ν is the damping matrix g η is the effect of buoyancy interaction with gravity τ represents forces and moments generated by the propulsion system and the rudder deflection τ e x t refers to the external disturbances ν u v w p q r t represents the linear and angular velocities η x y z ϕ θ ψ t represents the positions and euler angles the full nonlinear model is too complex for designing the controller and testing its performance it is necessary to choose a simple mathematical model with certain accuracy nomoto et al 1957 proposed a linear manoeuvring model by decoupling the surge motion from the other degrees of freedom and the ship s dynamic equation accounting only for the sway and the yaw motions can be expressed 2 m ν n u v b δ where 3 m m y v m x g y r m x g n v i z z n r 4 ν v r t 5 n u y v m u y r n v m x g u n r 6 b y δ n δ where m is the mass of ship y v n v refer to the hydrodynamic derivatives x g is the longitudinal centre of gravity u v and r are the surge sway and yaw speeds respectively δ is the rudder angle the well known 2nd order nomoto model can be obtained by eliminating the sway velocity from eq 2 nomoto et al 1957 7 t 1 t 2 r t 1 t 2 r r k δ k t 3 δ where t 1 t 2 and t 3 are the time constants k represents the gain application of the laplace transformation to eq 7 yields 8 r s δ s k 1 t 3 s 1 t 1 s 1 t 2 s where s represents the laplace operator assume the time constant t t 1 t 2 t 3 then the 1st order nomoto model is obtained as 9 r s δ s k 1 t s eq 9 can be expressed in the form to illustrate the relationship between rudder angle and heading angle by virtue of r s s ψ s 10 ψ s δ s k s 1 t s where ψ is the heading angle the time domain expression of eq 10 is written as 11 t ψ ψ k δ the nomoto model eq 11 is widely applied to design ship autopilot because of its compromise between simplicity and accuracy 2 2 internal model control the structure of the internal model control imc approach is shown in fig 2 morari and zafiriou 1989 where ψ d is the system input desired course angle ψ is the system output actual heading angle ψ e is the error between the system input and output heading angle error δ is the control input rudder angle q is the design transfer function g is the plant to be controlled g ˆ is the plant model the actual controller is described in the orange box the plant model g ˆ is embedded in the controller thus it is named as the internal model controller after some simplification the imc controller is transformed into a classical feedback structure fig 3 the imc controller c in fig 3 is formulated as 12 c q 1 q g ˆ where q is the design transfer function which is expressed as 13 q f g ˆ i n v where g ˆ i n v is the inverse model of the plant model g ˆ the modulating filter f is given by 14 f s 1 1 β c s m where β c is the designed parameter used to determine the close loop system response speed m is a positive integer according to the research in lee et al 2010 and saari and djemai 2012 the plant model g ˆ is considered as the 1st order nomoto model 15 g ˆ ψ s δ s k s 1 t s meanwhile the q in eq 12 is considered as 16 q s 3 β c s 1 1 β c s 3 s 1 t s k inserting eq 15 and eq 16 in eq 12 yields 17 c s 3 β c t s 2 3 β c t s 1 β c 3 k s 2 3 β c 2 k s eq 17 can be rewritten into a pid format 18 c s k p k i s k d s γ s 1 where γ s 1 is used to eliminate the unwanted differentiating influence in the high frequency region equating eq 17 to eq 18 leads to the following pid controller coefficients 19 k p 8 3 β c t 3 β c 2 k 20 k i 1 3 β c 2 k 21 k d 8 3 β c t 8 9 β c 2 3 β c 2 k 22 γ β c 3 in order to determine the coefficients of imc first the gain k and time constant t of the nomoto model should be obtained in the present research the k and t were determined from zigzag tests by a system identification algorithm chen et al 2019b the parameter β c was determined by testing different options and a value that led to satisfactory results was directly used in further studies during towing tank tests a value of the β c between 1 10 was used 3 experimental program experiments have been performed at the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water at flanders hydraulics research fhr in cooperation with ghent university in antwerp belgium the tank is 87 5 m in length 7 0 m wide and its water depth can be adjusted up to 0 5 m due to the existence of the wave maker and the harbour the useful length is limited to 68 0 m the layout of the towing tank is shown in fig 4 model tests were carried out in free running mode with a 1 75 scale model of a liquefied natural gas lng carrier and its main particulars are listed in table 1 the ship model and its line plan are presented in fig 5 and fig 6 the model was equipped with twin propellers and twin rudders fig 5 each rudder could be operated separately but the coupled mode was used in this work the maximum rudder angle and rudder rate allowed were set as 35 deg and 22 5 deg s model scale respectively two coordinate systems were used in the towing tank to describe the ship s behaviour fig 7 a ship fixed coordinate system o x y z and an earth fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 in both systems the longitudinal axis points forward the transverse axis is positive towards the starboard and the vertical axis is downward model tests were performed at four water depths from 176 0 mm to 320 mm model scale corresponding to the ukcs from 10 to 100 table 2 a sample photo for different experimental water depths is exhibited in fig 8 one can observe that the space between the bottom of the ship model and the towing tank floor decreases significantly with the decrease of ukc especially for the 10 ukc test condition experiments were executed at an approach speed from 4 knots up to 16 knots full scale table 3 presents the speed changes and corresponding propeller rates in different water depths ukcs in very shallow water 10 ukc the ship model was tested at 4 6 and 8 knots full scale in shallow water 20 ukc and 35 ukc tests at 11 knots and 13 knots were added to the experimental program in medium deep water 100 ukc tests at 16 knots were also added it can be seen from table 3 that the maximum test speeds decrease with decreasing water depth owing to larger grounding risk and poorer propulsion efficiency at lower water depths mind that all tests described in this work were conducted in calm water and the propeller revolution rate kept constant for each test condition 4 results and discussion 4 1 acceleration tests the acceleration self propulsion tests were carried out for the purpose of determining the relationship between the propeller rate and the forward speed the scale model was controlled to sail on a straight line using a default pid controller with coefficients k p 10 k i 0 1 k d 25 the propeller rates were fixed percentages of the propeller rate corresponding to the telegraph position full ahead fig 9 show the relationship between the propeller rates and the forward speeds in different water depths from fig 9 one can observe that in the same water depth ukc the propeller rate is proportional to the forward speed in other words the propeller rate self propulsion point should be increased in order to achieve a higher speed for the ship sailing in shallower water a given propeller rate resulted in a lower speed fig 10 shows the effect of water depth on the propeller rate it can be found from fig 10 that the propeller rates increased with decreasing water depths in order to reach the same speed taking the results at speed of 4 kn as examples the propeller rate in medium deep water h t m 2 0 was 197 0 rpm which was increased by 20 to 236 4 rpm in shallow water h t m 1 35 and increased by 36 8 to 269 5 rpm in very shallow water h t m 1 1 the effect is not only caused by increased resistance at a lower water depth but also by the reduced propulsive efficiency hence a larger propeller rate is needed to reach the same speed in a lower water depth 4 2 zigzag tests the zigzag manoeuvre tests executed in this work are slightly different from the standard ones 10 10 or 20 20 as defined by imo 2002 due to the limitation of size and vicinity of the tank wall in the test facility of flanders hydraulics research there will be a collision danger between the ship model and the tank walls if the standard zigzag tests are performed or the width is not even sufficient to be able to perform them hence zigzag manoeuvres were chosen as 20 5 which is an alternative of a standard zigzag such modified zigzags are supported by the simman workshops as well and are acceptable for ittc see 2 2 3 in the ittc procedure 7 5 02 06 01 ittc 2005 as they can also capture ship dynamic characteristics accurately and effectively to illustrate the effect of water depth on zigzag manoeuvres fig 11 and fig 12 present the trajectories and the motion response of 20 5 zigzag manoeuvres at 8 kn in different water depths from fig 11 one can observe that in very shallow water 10 20 and 35 ukcs the lateral displacement during zigzag tests was smaller compared to the medium deep case 100 ukc moreover it can be seen from fig 12 a and b that the overshoot angle and yaw rate presented a nonlinear decrease with decreasing water depth ukc meanwhile the ship model took a smaller drift angle at a smaller ukc fig 12 c forward speed loss was more obvious at larger ukc s fig 12 d while sinkage became smaller with increasing ukc fig 12 e in shallower water overshoot angles yaw rates and drift angles are generally smaller owing to the increase of hydrodynamic forces and ship s resistance on the contrary the variation and magnitude of sinkage are generally larger due to flow blockage and the hydrodynamic interactions become evident through changes in the pressure field around the ship squat fig 13 shows the phase plot of yaw rate r over rudder angle δ and heading angle ψ to provide further insight into the hydrodynamic damping characteristics during zigzag manoeuvres it is obvious that the phase trajectories expanded as the water depth h t m increased one can observe from fig 13 a d that when the same rudder was used in very shallow water the yaw rate r was significantly smaller compared to the medium deep water case this is caused by smaller hydrodynamic damping during zigzag manoeuvres in deeper water table 4 quantitively compares the overshoot angles during zigzag tests in different water depths one can note that the first and second overshoot angles presented a decreasing trend as decreasing water depths due to larger hydrodynamic damping in the sway direction according to zigzag results it can be confirmed that the water depth has an effect on the ship s course checking ability which is reduced as the water depth increases this effect can be seen in the increase of the overshoot angles from 10 ukc to 100 ukc in other words the ship s heading stability becomes better in shallower water 4 3 effects on manoeuvring indices k and t 4 3 1 effect of the forward speed the time constant t and the gain k are very important indices to predict the ship s manoeuvrability and derive the parameters of model based controllers in the present work the t and k were identified from the 20 5 zigzag experimental data using a novel machine learning algorithm and the effectiveness and accuracy of the identification algorithm have already been proven in previous research chen et al 2019a 2019b to demonstrate the influence of forward speed on the ship steering model in very shallow and medium water the ship manoeuvring indices t and k at different forward speeds and ukcs are presented in fig 14 taking the results at 100 ukc as an example it is not difficult to find in fig 14 a that the time constant t tends to decrease with increasing forward speed while a larger forward speed gives a greater gain k fig 14 b similar results can be observed for 35 ukc 20 ukc see fig 14 c f this phenomenon is attributed to the effect of forward speed on the response of the rudder and more specifically the increased propeller rate which is needed to achieve a higher velocity has a direct influence on the inflow to the rudder and thus the resulting control force hence a higher speed or propeller rate will deliver a smaller response time t and a larger gain k in other words 23 t n 1 o r t u 1 24 k n o r k u where t and k are the time constant and gain n represents the propeller rate u is the forward speed 4 3 2 effect of the water depth to study the shallow water effect on the ship steering model the following equations should be considered the origin of the 1st nomoto model is the uncoupled linear yaw motion model 25 i z z n r r n r r n δ δ where i z z is the yaw moment of inertia around the principal axis z n r n r and n δ are the derivatives of yaw moment with respect to yaw acceleration yaw velocity and rudder angle respectively r is the yaw rate δ is the rudder angle eq 25 can be rewritten in the format 26 i z z n r n r r r n δ n r δ or 27 t r t i r t i k δ t i then the time constant t and the gain k of the nomoto model are derived as 28 t i z z n r n r 29 k n δ n r with decreasing water depth n r and n r will increase because the water depth effect on n r is stronger and i z z is constant the value of t is likely to decrease with decreasing water depth due to that n r tends to be larger at a lower water depth but n δ not necessarily owing to the forward shift of the application point of the lateral rudder force with decreasing water depth delefortrie and vantorre 2007 therefore k will have a smaller value at a lower water depth to verify the above theoretical analysis experimental validation was executed the t and k obtained from the 20 5 zigzag tests in different water depths are presented in table 5 and fig 15 one can observe that both the time constant t and the gain k are smaller in lower water depth which is consistent with the above theoretical analysis and the research in fujino 1968 it is worth mentioning that towing tank tests were carried out in medium deep and very shallow water conditions corresponding to 1 1 h t m 2 0 due to limited experimental time model tests in deep water were not executed thus in present research the effects of the water depth on parameters t and k were only investigated in medium deep and very shallow water 4 4 effects on controller parameters 4 4 1 effect of the forward speed in this section the effects of speed or the related propulsion and water depth on the imc controller s parameters will be presented more specifically on the related pid values k p k i and k d see eqs 19 21 table 6 shows that the pid coefficients at different propeller rates for four water depths the found values for the proportional integral and derivative coefficients are plotted in function of the propeller rate they correspond with and a trendline is added for each of the controller parameters figs 16 18 the relationships between the pid coefficients and propeller rates are summarized in table 7 from figs 16 18 and table 7 one can find that at the same ukc the proportional coefficient k p was constant which was not dependent on the propeller rate mind that in fig 16 constant approximation was obtained for the proportional coefficient k p rather than trying to fit a higher order polynomial furthermore the integral coefficient k i was proportional to the propeller rate namely k i increased with increasing propeller rate the derivative coefficient k d was inversely proportional to the propeller rate within the bound of the results in table 7 the following relationships can be obtained 30 k p k p n n 0 31 k i k i n n 1 32 k d k d n n 1 where k p k i and k d are the proportional integral and derivative coefficients k p n k i n and k d n are the speed dependent proportional integral and derivative coefficients n is the propeller rate by realizing this optimal pid values only need to be determined for one sailing speed other pid values can be determined according to the relationship in eqs 30 32 which is named the adaptive pid controller in this work the new development of adaptive pid controller can save time by not having to determine the optimal values for all sailing speeds and more model tests can be carried out in addition the speed dependency guarantees proper track keeping behaviour in case speed changes are induced during manoeuvring 4 4 2 effect of the water depth to investigate the effect of water depth on pid controller coefficients k p k i and k d table 8 and fig 19 present the relationship between the pid values and water depths ukcs for the speed of 4 6 and 8 knots one can observe from fig 19 that the proportional k p integral k i and derivative k d coefficients present descending trends with decreasing water depth according to experimental results it seems that smaller pid coefficients delivered better results for the lower under keel clearances 4 5 effect on controller performance 4 5 1 effect of the water depth 4 5 1 1 introduction to study the effect of water depth on the controllers performance free running model tests with the adaptive pid and imc control algorithms were conducted in fhr towing tank the performance of controllers was evaluated according to their capacity of tracking a curve path and avoiding obstacles in different test water depths the planned curve path in the towing tank and its waypoints are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 the path consists of 29 waypoints fig 21 which were generated by a path planning algorithm liu et al 2017 to provide quantitative analysis four evaluation indexes were used to evaluate the tracking performance of studied controllers they are mean track error integral mtei maximum track error mte mean heading error integral mhei mean rudder integral mri 33 mtei 1 t t 0 t 0 t t e t d t 34 mte max t e t 35 mhei 1 t t 0 t 0 t ψ e t d t 36 mri 1 t t 0 t 0 t δ t d t where t e is the cross track error δ is the rudder angle ψ e is the heading angle error mtei and mte are employed to describe the mean and maximum of cross track error mhei represents the mean heading angle error mri is adopted to illustrate the amplitude of rudder deflection in the following sections the results for four different water depths 10 20 35 and 100 ukcs and two speeds 8 and 11 kn are presented to elaborate the shallow water effect on controllers performance 4 5 1 2 constant controller parameters for all water depths here the same parameters were used for all water depths namely the ones derived at 100 ukc table 9 lists the parameters of adaptive pid and imc controllers fig 22 and fig 23 present the performance of the adaptive pid controller at 8 kn under different water depths one can observe from fig 22 that the ship could follow the reference path and avoid obstacles although the same parameters were used in different water depths nevertheless the tracking error increased as the water depth decreased especially near bends see fig 23 a and b for better illustration furthermore it can be found in fig 23 c that the ship used bigger rudders in order to change the heading in the shallower water similar results for the imc can be seen in fig 24 and fig 25 to provide further quantification the evaluation indexes mtei mte mhei and mri were employed to assess the tracking capacity of controllers table 10 and fig 26 give a quantitative comparison of the adaptive pid and imc controllers performance in different water depths it is noted that the average and maximal cross track errors mtei mte showed an increase with decreasing ukc for instance the mtei of adaptive pid controller at 100 ukc was 0 0437 m which was increased to 0 0936 m 0 0842 m 0 1018 m at 35 ukc 20 ukc and 10 ukc respectively it can be attributed to that the water depth limitations changed the pressure distribution around the ship and caused an increase of hydrodynamic forces in addition to an increase in ship s resistance the propulsive efficiency and manoeuvrability of the ship were reduced when sailing at a small ukc thus the ship was not able to arrive at the desired speed and position leading to the tracking error increased moreover in shallower water the directional stability of the ship became better hence the heading deviation mhei was smaller owing to the variations of hydrodynamic forces and propulsive efficiency a greater rudder mri was needed to change the ship s heading for following the desired trajectory fig 27 and fig 28 show the effect of water depth on adaptive pid and imc controllers performance at the speed of 11 kn including trajectories cross track error and rudder angle table 11 and fig 29 present their quantitative comparison according to the controllers performance in different water depths at 11 kn similar conclusions to the speed of 8 kn can be drawn 4 5 1 3 improvement of controllers performance based on the above analysis if the same parameters were used in different water depths the controllers could not achieve satisfactory performance thus the parameters of controllers should vary in different ukcs in order to improve the adaptive pid and imc controllers performance different parameters were used in different depths in this work see tables 6 and 7 for values of these table 12 fig 30 and fig 31 compare the performance of adaptive pid controller using the constant and optimized parameters in different water depths at the speed of 8 kn and 11 kn where constant means the same controllers parameters were used in different water depths same with 100 ukc optimized represents the different parameters were used in different water depths under optimized conditions the trajectories were closer to the desired one figs 30 and 31 especially when sailing near bends from table 12 one can observe that the mean and maximum cross track errors mtei mte obtained using the optimized parameters were generally smaller than that from constant parameters see figs 30 and 31 for better illustration for instance at 8 kn and 10 ukc the mtei and mte were 0 1018 m and 0 3167 m obtained using the constant parameters the optimized values were 0 0783 m and 0 2341 m the tracking errors mtei and mte were reduced by 23 1 and 26 1 respectively on the other hand the heading angle error mhei was also reduced table 12 in addition one can observe from figs 30 and 31 that the frequency of rudder deflection was less and the rudder angle was smoother under optimized conditions therefore the performance of controller was improved using the optimized parameters it is confirmed that the varying controllers parameters should be adopted in different water depths table 13 presents quantitative comparisons for the performance of the imc controller using the constant and optimized parameters in different water depths at the speed of 8 kn and 11 kn fig 32 and fig 33 compare the trajectories cross track error and rudder deflection according to the imc controller s performance similar conclusions to the adaptive pid controller can be obtained in order to further improve the adaptability of the controller to different water depths within the bound of the results in table 6 to table 8 the following relation can be established between deep water 100 ukc and 20 ukc 37 k p k p n d e e p k p n h t m h t m n 0 38 k i k i n d e e p k i n h t m h t m n 1 39 k d k d n d e e p k d n h t m h t m n 1 where k p n d e e p k p n h are the adaptive proportional coefficients in deep water and specified water depth k i n d e e p k i n h are the adaptive integral coefficients k d n d e e p k d n h are the adaptive derivative coefficients t m is the draft at midship h is the water depth n is the propeller rate according to the parameters k p n k i n and k d n at 100 ukc and 20 ukc in table 7 the 6 regression terms in eq 37 eq 39 can be obtained k p n d e e p 7 1865 k p n h 0 6958 k i n d e e p 0 0759 k i n h 0 0087 k d n d e e p 142 9433 k d n h 19 9533 based on the above 6 coefficients the values of k p n k i n and k d n in different water depths can be obtained table 14 compares the experimental parameters and the parameters derived from eq 37 eq 39 adaptive parameters mind that eq 37 eq 39 should be applied until 20 ukc and then the parameters remain constant for lower ukcs one can observe in table 14 that the adaptive parameters are similar to the experimental parameters to test the developed control algorithm numerical simulations were conducted using the same ship model in a manoeuvring simulator simulations were executed at 6 kn and 35 ukc using the experimental and adaptive parameters respectively table 15 fig 34 and fig 35 compare their performance and control effects it can be seen from table 15 the mean and maximum tracking errors were smaller than 50 b according to the safety criteria of the ship sailing in the restricted water pianc 2014 the maximum track deviation from the desired trajectory should not be greater than 50 of the own ship s breadth thus both cases meet above requirement compared with the simulation results using the experimental parameters the mean track error increased by 1 1 b for the proposed adaptive algorithm but the maximum track error was slightly reduced although there were slight differences the overall performance and control effects of the two cases were similar see figs 34 and 35 for better illustration finally to validate the effectiveness of the designed speed and water depth adaptive algorithm numerical simulations were executed at 6 kn and 50 ukc which is a new water depth and was not investigated before simulation results are presented in fig 36 the designed controller could control the ship following the desired path and avoid obstacles and satisfactory performance can be observed in fig 36 the mean and maximum track errors were 0 0842 m 12 6 b and 0 2377 m 35 7 b respectively which still meet the safety criteria 50 b by realizing this only 6 parameters are needed to control the ship in different water depths and speeds 5 conclusions in the present research the manouvering modelling and motion control problems in finite water depth were investigated for an lng ship based on experimental results from free running model tests hydrodynamic forces motion response and parameter changes with forward speeds and water depths were discussed to conclude the study confirmed the expected change in manoeuvring behaviour of acceleration tests and zigzag tests in finite water depth where water depth restrictions changed considerably the pressure distribution around the ship increased the hydrodynamic forces and resistance and reduced the ship s manoeuvrability compared to the same manoeuvre in deeper water the ship is much more difficult to be manoeuvred and controlled in very shallow water the shallow water effect on ship manoeuvring cannot be neglected the forward speed and water depth have a significant influence on manoeuvring indices k and t and the pid controller s parameters the effects on parameters will provide a reference for future researchers the experimental results show that the path following capacity of the imc and adaptive pid controllers was satisfactory the tracking error was small the rudder deflection was reasonable and the designed controllers presented good performance in shallow water to achieve better performance in different water depths the controllers parameters should change as water depths credit authorship contribution statement changyuan chen conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis investigation data curation

20745,to extend the knowledge on ship manoeuvring and predict ship s behaviour accurately from medium deep to very shallow water this paper comprehensively investigates water depth and speed effects on ship s manoeuvrability steering model and motion control through experimental studies free running model tests at four water depths and six speeds were conducted using a scaled ship model in the towing tank at flanders hydraulics research fhr the influence of under keel clearance and speed on the acceleration tests and zigzag manoeuvres were firstly analysed secondly the shallow water effect on ship steering model was discussed via theoretical analysis and experimental validation then the investigation of the effects of speed and under keel clearance on the ship motion controller s parameters and performance was executed and a novel adaptive controller was proposed to improve controller s performance in shallow water a scheme was proposed to optimize its parameters the results indicate that both speed and water depth have considerable influence on ship s manoeuvrability and controllability especially water depth restrictions change the hydrodynamic forces reduce the propulsion efficiency and manoeuvreability the ship becomes more difficult to manoeuvre and control in shallow water these impacts on ship manoeuvring modelling and motion control cannot be neglected

derivative pianc the world association for waterborne transport infrastructure ukc under keel clearance 1 introduction the disparity between the existing harbour infrastructures fairway dimensions and the increasing ship dimensions has attracted more attention to investigating the ship s behaviour in shallow and confined water when a ship navigates in a port or along narrow channels it will encounter a more complex environment governed by low speed manoeuvring shallow water effects horizontal restrictions etc an accurate evaluation of the ship s manoeuvrability is required to guarantee the safety of the ship a ship s manoeuvrability relies on the water depth h of the navigation area in relation to the draft t m of the ship according to the definition of limited water depths in pianc 1992 the water depth can be classified into four main groups fig 1 deep water h t m 3 0 medium deep water 1 5 h t m 3 0 shallow water 1 2 h t m 1 5 very shallow water h t m 1 2 the impact of depth limitations can be noticed in medium deep water is very significant in shallow water and dominates the ship s behaviour in very shallow water vantorre et al 2017 forward speed is another especially important influence factor for ship manoeuvreability and controllability and the effects of shallow water and speed make it difficult to manoeuvre and control the ship when sailing in confined areas therefore it is essential to investigate the ship manoeuvring behaviour and control performance and improve related knowledge in finite water the study on ship manoeuvring in confined water has recently received more attention in literature several works addressing this problem can be found in fujino 1968 lee 2003 vantorre et al 2003 lee and lee 2008 and more recent works of eloot and vantorre 2011 eloot et al 2015 mucha 2017 vantorre et al 2017 lataire et al 2018 mucha et al 2019 hinostroza et al 2019 and tello ruiz et al 2019 moreover the criteria for manoeuvring in shallow and restricted water was introduced by the 27th ittc manoeuvring committee ittc 2017 the simman workshop organized related research activities to predict ship manoeuvring and provide benchmark data simman 2014 the mashcon conferences have been held to discuss the developments of ship manoeuvring in shallow and confined water mashcon 2016 2019 nevertheless the data in literature are quite limited most data concern the shallow water and medium deep water ranges but results obtained from very shallow water conditions are rather rare this very shallow water range is extremely crucial for ship manoeuvring in harbour areas canals and access channels for instance the minimum requirement for ships sailing in the access channels to the belgian harbours exposed to the sea is a gross under keel clearance ukc of 15 of draft in more sheltered conditions such as the dock of antwerp harbour or the sea canal connecting ghent with the river scheldt the value is even reduced to 10 vantorre 2003 the research about the ship s manoeuvrability considering the finite water depth can provide data support for the development of manoeuvring mathematical models and the design of motion controllers the simulation of the ship s manoeuvring behaviour depends on accurate knowledge of the hydrodynamic coefficients in the equations of motion these coefficients are easily calculated in deep water but are much more difficult to be determined in shallow water inoue 1969 adopted the wing theory to calculate the derivatives of forces on a turning ship in shallow water a mathematical model considering side wall and water depth limitations was introduced by norrbin 1971 clarke 1997 discussed linear derivatives taking account of shallow water corrections vantorre 2001 reviewed and evaluated the semi empirical approaches for formulating the manoeuvring mathematical model in shallow and very shallow water conditions a 6 dof shallow water manoeuvring model was proposed by delefortrie et al 2016 the sensitivity analysis of the hydrodynamic derivatives in shallow water was presented in kim et al 2017 the effect of water depth on the ship s mathematical model was studied in xu et al 2020 the mathematical models in literature were mostly established in deep water a limited number of studies concentrated on the problem in very shallow water the model describing the ship s manoeuvring behaviour in confined water is not only more complex owing to the occurrence of additional parameters e g water depth to draft ratio or bank distance but also because of the fact that many parameters determining the ship s kinematics e g drift angle forward speed and control propeller rate rudder deflection which belong to a more extended range vantorre 2003 hence the comprehensive investigation of these impacts on modelling the manoeuvring behaviour in shallow water is deemed necessary to characterize ship manoeuvreability and controllability with the development of autonomous ships and the improvement of automation control theory has been applied to manoeuvring problems such as automatic berthing the control algorithms include course control path following control and speed control etc ship motion controls are very important for marine autonomous surface ships mass when sailing and manoeuvring in harbours and access channels where the ship demands more control actions however the manoeuvring capability is challenged in finite water depth and the local under keel clearance heavily affects this challenge owing to the change of forces and moments around the ship in such scenarios the requirement of ship speed is stricter which is significantly different compared to the open sea moreover the performance of the controller is determined by its parameters which vary with speed and water depth the relationship between the controller s parameters and influencing factors should be further studied in literature although some researchers used numerical simulations to discuss the ship s heading control problem in shallow water such as zhang et al 2005 and lee et al 2009 to the authors best knowledge very few studies concentrated on the experimental investigation of the shallow water and speed effects on the controller s performance and parameter changes especially with respect to the path following control problem motivated by the above analysis the main aim of the present work is to study the effects of forward speed and water depth on the ship s manoeuvreability steering model and motion control based on free running model tests the main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 free running model tests have been performed at six forward speeds and four water depths focusing on the study of the ship s manoeuvring performance in medium deep and very shallow water 2 the impact of forward speed and finite water depth on acceleration tests and zigzag manoeuvres were investigated 3 theoretical analysis and experimental validation were combined to study the change of the ship s steering model at various speeds and under keel clearances 4 the speed and water depth dependency problem of the pid controller s parameters was solved through a relationship between the pid values and the propeller rate and water depth yielding a novel adaptive controller 5 shallow water effects on the parameters and the path following performance of controllers were discussed while the approach of optimizing the controllers tracking capacity in shallow water was introduced 2 theory considerations 2 1 ship mathematical model a 6 degrees of freedom dof dynamic model can be expressed as fossen 2011 1 m r b m a ν c r b ν c a ν ν d ν ν g η τ τ e x t where m r b is the rigid body inertia matrix m a is the added mass matrix c r b ν is the rigid body coriolis and centripetal matrix c a ν is the added coriolis and centripetal matrix d ν is the damping matrix g η is the effect of buoyancy interaction with gravity τ represents forces and moments generated by the propulsion system and the rudder deflection τ e x t refers to the external disturbances ν u v w p q r t represents the linear and angular velocities η x y z ϕ θ ψ t represents the positions and euler angles the full nonlinear model is too complex for designing the controller and testing its performance it is necessary to choose a simple mathematical model with certain accuracy nomoto et al 1957 proposed a linear manoeuvring model by decoupling the surge motion from the other degrees of freedom and the ship s dynamic equation accounting only for the sway and the yaw motions can be expressed 2 m ν n u v b δ where 3 m m y v m x g y r m x g n v i z z n r 4 ν v r t 5 n u y v m u y r n v m x g u n r 6 b y δ n δ where m is the mass of ship y v n v refer to the hydrodynamic derivatives x g is the longitudinal centre of gravity u v and r are the surge sway and yaw speeds respectively δ is the rudder angle the well known 2nd order nomoto model can be obtained by eliminating the sway velocity from eq 2 nomoto et al 1957 7 t 1 t 2 r t 1 t 2 r r k δ k t 3 δ where t 1 t 2 and t 3 are the time constants k represents the gain application of the laplace transformation to eq 7 yields 8 r s δ s k 1 t 3 s 1 t 1 s 1 t 2 s where s represents the laplace operator assume the time constant t t 1 t 2 t 3 then the 1st order nomoto model is obtained as 9 r s δ s k 1 t s eq 9 can be expressed in the form to illustrate the relationship between rudder angle and heading angle by virtue of r s s ψ s 10 ψ s δ s k s 1 t s where ψ is the heading angle the time domain expression of eq 10 is written as 11 t ψ ψ k δ the nomoto model eq 11 is widely applied to design ship autopilot because of its compromise between simplicity and accuracy 2 2 internal model control the structure of the internal model control imc approach is shown in fig 2 morari and zafiriou 1989 where ψ d is the system input desired course angle ψ is the system output actual heading angle ψ e is the error between the system input and output heading angle error δ is the control input rudder angle q is the design transfer function g is the plant to be controlled g ˆ is the plant model the actual controller is described in the orange box the plant model g ˆ is embedded in the controller thus it is named as the internal model controller after some simplification the imc controller is transformed into a classical feedback structure fig 3 the imc controller c in fig 3 is formulated as 12 c q 1 q g ˆ where q is the design transfer function which is expressed as 13 q f g ˆ i n v where g ˆ i n v is the inverse model of the plant model g ˆ the modulating filter f is given by 14 f s 1 1 β c s m where β c is the designed parameter used to determine the close loop system response speed m is a positive integer according to the research in lee et al 2010 and saari and djemai 2012 the plant model g ˆ is considered as the 1st order nomoto model 15 g ˆ ψ s δ s k s 1 t s meanwhile the q in eq 12 is considered as 16 q s 3 β c s 1 1 β c s 3 s 1 t s k inserting eq 15 and eq 16 in eq 12 yields 17 c s 3 β c t s 2 3 β c t s 1 β c 3 k s 2 3 β c 2 k s eq 17 can be rewritten into a pid format 18 c s k p k i s k d s γ s 1 where γ s 1 is used to eliminate the unwanted differentiating influence in the high frequency region equating eq 17 to eq 18 leads to the following pid controller coefficients 19 k p 8 3 β c t 3 β c 2 k 20 k i 1 3 β c 2 k 21 k d 8 3 β c t 8 9 β c 2 3 β c 2 k 22 γ β c 3 in order to determine the coefficients of imc first the gain k and time constant t of the nomoto model should be obtained in the present research the k and t were determined from zigzag tests by a system identification algorithm chen et al 2019b the parameter β c was determined by testing different options and a value that led to satisfactory results was directly used in further studies during towing tank tests a value of the β c between 1 10 was used 3 experimental program experiments have been performed at the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water at flanders hydraulics research fhr in cooperation with ghent university in antwerp belgium the tank is 87 5 m in length 7 0 m wide and its water depth can be adjusted up to 0 5 m due to the existence of the wave maker and the harbour the useful length is limited to 68 0 m the layout of the towing tank is shown in fig 4 model tests were carried out in free running mode with a 1 75 scale model of a liquefied natural gas lng carrier and its main particulars are listed in table 1 the ship model and its line plan are presented in fig 5 and fig 6 the model was equipped with twin propellers and twin rudders fig 5 each rudder could be operated separately but the coupled mode was used in this work the maximum rudder angle and rudder rate allowed were set as 35 deg and 22 5 deg s model scale respectively two coordinate systems were used in the towing tank to describe the ship s behaviour fig 7 a ship fixed coordinate system o x y z and an earth fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 in both systems the longitudinal axis points forward the transverse axis is positive towards the starboard and the vertical axis is downward model tests were performed at four water depths from 176 0 mm to 320 mm model scale corresponding to the ukcs from 10 to 100 table 2 a sample photo for different experimental water depths is exhibited in fig 8 one can observe that the space between the bottom of the ship model and the towing tank floor decreases significantly with the decrease of ukc especially for the 10 ukc test condition experiments were executed at an approach speed from 4 knots up to 16 knots full scale table 3 presents the speed changes and corresponding propeller rates in different water depths ukcs in very shallow water 10 ukc the ship model was tested at 4 6 and 8 knots full scale in shallow water 20 ukc and 35 ukc tests at 11 knots and 13 knots were added to the experimental program in medium deep water 100 ukc tests at 16 knots were also added it can be seen from table 3 that the maximum test speeds decrease with decreasing water depth owing to larger grounding risk and poorer propulsion efficiency at lower water depths mind that all tests described in this work were conducted in calm water and the propeller revolution rate kept constant for each test condition 4 results and discussion 4 1 acceleration tests the acceleration self propulsion tests were carried out for the purpose of determining the relationship between the propeller rate and the forward speed the scale model was controlled to sail on a straight line using a default pid controller with coefficients k p 10 k i 0 1 k d 25 the propeller rates were fixed percentages of the propeller rate corresponding to the telegraph position full ahead fig 9 show the relationship between the propeller rates and the forward speeds in different water depths from fig 9 one can observe that in the same water depth ukc the propeller rate is proportional to the forward speed in other words the propeller rate self propulsion point should be increased in order to achieve a higher speed for the ship sailing in shallower water a given propeller rate resulted in a lower speed fig 10 shows the effect of water depth on the propeller rate it can be found from fig 10 that the propeller rates increased with decreasing water depths in order to reach the same speed taking the results at speed of 4 kn as examples the propeller rate in medium deep water h t m 2 0 was 197 0 rpm which was increased by 20 to 236 4 rpm in shallow water h t m 1 35 and increased by 36 8 to 269 5 rpm in very shallow water h t m 1 1 the effect is not only caused by increased resistance at a lower water depth but also by the reduced propulsive efficiency hence a larger propeller rate is needed to reach the same speed in a lower water depth 4 2 zigzag tests the zigzag manoeuvre tests executed in this work are slightly different from the standard ones 10 10 or 20 20 as defined by imo 2002 due to the limitation of size and vicinity of the tank wall in the test facility of flanders hydraulics research there will be a collision danger between the ship model and the tank walls if the standard zigzag tests are performed or the width is not even sufficient to be able to perform them hence zigzag manoeuvres were chosen as 20 5 which is an alternative of a standard zigzag such modified zigzags are supported by the simman workshops as well and are acceptable for ittc see 2 2 3 in the ittc procedure 7 5 02 06 01 ittc 2005 as they can also capture ship dynamic characteristics accurately and effectively to illustrate the effect of water depth on zigzag manoeuvres fig 11 and fig 12 present the trajectories and the motion response of 20 5 zigzag manoeuvres at 8 kn in different water depths from fig 11 one can observe that in very shallow water 10 20 and 35 ukcs the lateral displacement during zigzag tests was smaller compared to the medium deep case 100 ukc moreover it can be seen from fig 12 a and b that the overshoot angle and yaw rate presented a nonlinear decrease with decreasing water depth ukc meanwhile the ship model took a smaller drift angle at a smaller ukc fig 12 c forward speed loss was more obvious at larger ukc s fig 12 d while sinkage became smaller with increasing ukc fig 12 e in shallower water overshoot angles yaw rates and drift angles are generally smaller owing to the increase of hydrodynamic forces and ship s resistance on the contrary the variation and magnitude of sinkage are generally larger due to flow blockage and the hydrodynamic interactions become evident through changes in the pressure field around the ship squat fig 13 shows the phase plot of yaw rate r over rudder angle δ and heading angle ψ to provide further insight into the hydrodynamic damping characteristics during zigzag manoeuvres it is obvious that the phase trajectories expanded as the water depth h t m increased one can observe from fig 13 a d that when the same rudder was used in very shallow water the yaw rate r was significantly smaller compared to the medium deep water case this is caused by smaller hydrodynamic damping during zigzag manoeuvres in deeper water table 4 quantitively compares the overshoot angles during zigzag tests in different water depths one can note that the first and second overshoot angles presented a decreasing trend as decreasing water depths due to larger hydrodynamic damping in the sway direction according to zigzag results it can be confirmed that the water depth has an effect on the ship s course checking ability which is reduced as the water depth increases this effect can be seen in the increase of the overshoot angles from 10 ukc to 100 ukc in other words the ship s heading stability becomes better in shallower water 4 3 effects on manoeuvring indices k and t 4 3 1 effect of the forward speed the time constant t and the gain k are very important indices to predict the ship s manoeuvrability and derive the parameters of model based controllers in the present work the t and k were identified from the 20 5 zigzag experimental data using a novel machine learning algorithm and the effectiveness and accuracy of the identification algorithm have already been proven in previous research chen et al 2019a 2019b to demonstrate the influence of forward speed on the ship steering model in very shallow and medium water the ship manoeuvring indices t and k at different forward speeds and ukcs are presented in fig 14 taking the results at 100 ukc as an example it is not difficult to find in fig 14 a that the time constant t tends to decrease with increasing forward speed while a larger forward speed gives a greater gain k fig 14 b similar results can be observed for 35 ukc 20 ukc see fig 14 c f this phenomenon is attributed to the effect of forward speed on the response of the rudder and more specifically the increased propeller rate which is needed to achieve a higher velocity has a direct influence on the inflow to the rudder and thus the resulting control force hence a higher speed or propeller rate will deliver a smaller response time t and a larger gain k in other words 23 t n 1 o r t u 1 24 k n o r k u where t and k are the time constant and gain n represents the propeller rate u is the forward speed 4 3 2 effect of the water depth to study the shallow water effect on the ship steering model the following equations should be considered the origin of the 1st nomoto model is the uncoupled linear yaw motion model 25 i z z n r r n r r n δ δ where i z z is the yaw moment of inertia around the principal axis z n r n r and n δ are the derivatives of yaw moment with respect to yaw acceleration yaw velocity and rudder angle respectively r is the yaw rate δ is the rudder angle eq 25 can be rewritten in the format 26 i z z n r n r r r n δ n r δ or 27 t r t i r t i k δ t i then the time constant t and the gain k of the nomoto model are derived as 28 t i z z n r n r 29 k n δ n r with decreasing water depth n r and n r will increase because the water depth effect on n r is stronger and i z z is constant the value of t is likely to decrease with decreasing water depth due to that n r tends to be larger at a lower water depth but n δ not necessarily owing to the forward shift of the application point of the lateral rudder force with decreasing water depth delefortrie and vantorre 2007 therefore k will have a smaller value at a lower water depth to verify the above theoretical analysis experimental validation was executed the t and k obtained from the 20 5 zigzag tests in different water depths are presented in table 5 and fig 15 one can observe that both the time constant t and the gain k are smaller in lower water depth which is consistent with the above theoretical analysis and the research in fujino 1968 it is worth mentioning that towing tank tests were carried out in medium deep and very shallow water conditions corresponding to 1 1 h t m 2 0 due to limited experimental time model tests in deep water were not executed thus in present research the effects of the water depth on parameters t and k were only investigated in medium deep and very shallow water 4 4 effects on controller parameters 4 4 1 effect of the forward speed in this section the effects of speed or the related propulsion and water depth on the imc controller s parameters will be presented more specifically on the related pid values k p k i and k d see eqs 19 21 table 6 shows that the pid coefficients at different propeller rates for four water depths the found values for the proportional integral and derivative coefficients are plotted in function of the propeller rate they correspond with and a trendline is added for each of the controller parameters figs 16 18 the relationships between the pid coefficients and propeller rates are summarized in table 7 from figs 16 18 and table 7 one can find that at the same ukc the proportional coefficient k p was constant which was not dependent on the propeller rate mind that in fig 16 constant approximation was obtained for the proportional coefficient k p rather than trying to fit a higher order polynomial furthermore the integral coefficient k i was proportional to the propeller rate namely k i increased with increasing propeller rate the derivative coefficient k d was inversely proportional to the propeller rate within the bound of the results in table 7 the following relationships can be obtained 30 k p k p n n 0 31 k i k i n n 1 32 k d k d n n 1 where k p k i and k d are the proportional integral and derivative coefficients k p n k i n and k d n are the speed dependent proportional integral and derivative coefficients n is the propeller rate by realizing this optimal pid values only need to be determined for one sailing speed other pid values can be determined according to the relationship in eqs 30 32 which is named the adaptive pid controller in this work the new development of adaptive pid controller can save time by not having to determine the optimal values for all sailing speeds and more model tests can be carried out in addition the speed dependency guarantees proper track keeping behaviour in case speed changes are induced during manoeuvring 4 4 2 effect of the water depth to investigate the effect of water depth on pid controller coefficients k p k i and k d table 8 and fig 19 present the relationship between the pid values and water depths ukcs for the speed of 4 6 and 8 knots one can observe from fig 19 that the proportional k p integral k i and derivative k d coefficients present descending trends with decreasing water depth according to experimental results it seems that smaller pid coefficients delivered better results for the lower under keel clearances 4 5 effect on controller performance 4 5 1 effect of the water depth 4 5 1 1 introduction to study the effect of water depth on the controllers performance free running model tests with the adaptive pid and imc control algorithms were conducted in fhr towing tank the performance of controllers was evaluated according to their capacity of tracking a curve path and avoiding obstacles in different test water depths the planned curve path in the towing tank and its waypoints are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 the path consists of 29 waypoints fig 21 which were generated by a path planning algorithm liu et al 2017 to provide quantitative analysis four evaluation indexes were used to evaluate the tracking performance of studied controllers they are mean track error integral mtei maximum track error mte mean heading error integral mhei mean rudder integral mri 33 mtei 1 t t 0 t 0 t t e t d t 34 mte max t e t 35 mhei 1 t t 0 t 0 t ψ e t d t 36 mri 1 t t 0 t 0 t δ t d t where t e is the cross track error δ is the rudder angle ψ e is the heading angle error mtei and mte are employed to describe the mean and maximum of cross track error mhei represents the mean heading angle error mri is adopted to illustrate the amplitude of rudder deflection in the following sections the results for four different water depths 10 20 35 and 100 ukcs and two speeds 8 and 11 kn are presented to elaborate the shallow water effect on controllers performance 4 5 1 2 constant controller parameters for all water depths here the same parameters were used for all water depths namely the ones derived at 100 ukc table 9 lists the parameters of adaptive pid and imc controllers fig 22 and fig 23 present the performance of the adaptive pid controller at 8 kn under different water depths one can observe from fig 22 that the ship could follow the reference path and avoid obstacles although the same parameters were used in different water depths nevertheless the tracking error increased as the water depth decreased especially near bends see fig 23 a and b for better illustration furthermore it can be found in fig 23 c that the ship used bigger rudders in order to change the heading in the shallower water similar results for the imc can be seen in fig 24 and fig 25 to provide further quantification the evaluation indexes mtei mte mhei and mri were employed to assess the tracking capacity of controllers table 10 and fig 26 give a quantitative comparison of the adaptive pid and imc controllers performance in different water depths it is noted that the average and maximal cross track errors mtei mte showed an increase with decreasing ukc for instance the mtei of adaptive pid controller at 100 ukc was 0 0437 m which was increased to 0 0936 m 0 0842 m 0 1018 m at 35 ukc 20 ukc and 10 ukc respectively it can be attributed to that the water depth limitations changed the pressure distribution around the ship and caused an increase of hydrodynamic forces in addition to an increase in ship s resistance the propulsive efficiency and manoeuvrability of the ship were reduced when sailing at a small ukc thus the ship was not able to arrive at the desired speed and position leading to the tracking error increased moreover in shallower water the directional stability of the ship became better hence the heading deviation mhei was smaller owing to the variations of hydrodynamic forces and propulsive efficiency a greater rudder mri was needed to change the ship s heading for following the desired trajectory fig 27 and fig 28 show the effect of water depth on adaptive pid and imc controllers performance at the speed of 11 kn including trajectories cross track error and rudder angle table 11 and fig 29 present their quantitative comparison according to the controllers performance in different water depths at 11 kn similar conclusions to the speed of 8 kn can be drawn 4 5 1 3 improvement of controllers performance based on the above analysis if the same parameters were used in different water depths the controllers could not achieve satisfactory performance thus the parameters of controllers should vary in different ukcs in order to improve the adaptive pid and imc controllers performance different parameters were used in different depths in this work see tables 6 and 7 for values of these table 12 fig 30 and fig 31 compare the performance of adaptive pid controller using the constant and optimized parameters in different water depths at the speed of 8 kn and 11 kn where constant means the same controllers parameters were used in different water depths same with 100 ukc optimized represents the different parameters were used in different water depths under optimized conditions the trajectories were closer to the desired one figs 30 and 31 especially when sailing near bends from table 12 one can observe that the mean and maximum cross track errors mtei mte obtained using the optimized parameters were generally smaller than that from constant parameters see figs 30 and 31 for better illustration for instance at 8 kn and 10 ukc the mtei and mte were 0 1018 m and 0 3167 m obtained using the constant parameters the optimized values were 0 0783 m and 0 2341 m the tracking errors mtei and mte were reduced by 23 1 and 26 1 respectively on the other hand the heading angle error mhei was also reduced table 12 in addition one can observe from figs 30 and 31 that the frequency of rudder deflection was less and the rudder angle was smoother under optimized conditions therefore the performance of controller was improved using the optimized parameters it is confirmed that the varying controllers parameters should be adopted in different water depths table 13 presents quantitative comparisons for the performance of the imc controller using the constant and optimized parameters in different water depths at the speed of 8 kn and 11 kn fig 32 and fig 33 compare the trajectories cross track error and rudder deflection according to the imc controller s performance similar conclusions to the adaptive pid controller can be obtained in order to further improve the adaptability of the controller to different water depths within the bound of the results in table 6 to table 8 the following relation can be

20 ukc and then the parameters remain constant for lower ukcs one can observe in table 14 that the adaptive parameters are similar to the experimental parameters to test the developed control algorithm numerical simulations were conducted using the same ship model in a manoeuvring simulator simulations were executed at 6 kn and 35 ukc using the experimental and adaptive parameters respectively table 15 fig 34 and fig 35 compare their performance and control effects it can be seen from table 15 the mean and maximum tracking errors were smaller than 50 b according to the safety criteria of the ship sailing in the restricted water pianc 2014 the maximum track deviation from the desired trajectory should not be greater than 50 of the own ship s breadth thus both cases meet above requirement compared with the simulation results using the experimental parameters the mean track error increased by 1 1 b for the proposed adaptive algorithm but the maximum track error was slightly reduced although there were slight differences the overall performance and control effects of the two cases were similar see figs 34 and 35 for better illustration finally to validate the effectiveness of the designed speed and water depth adaptive algorithm numerical simulations were executed at 6 kn and 50 ukc which is a new water depth and was not investigated before simulation results are presented in fig 36 the designed controller could control the ship following the desired path and avoid obstacles and satisfactory performance can be observed in fig 36 the mean and maximum track errors were 0 0842 m 12 6 b and 0 2377 m 35 7 b respectively which still meet the safety criteria 50 b by realizing this only 6 parameters are needed to control the ship in different water depths and speeds 5 conclusions in the present research the manouvering modelling and motion control problems in finite water depth were investigated for an lng ship based on experimental results from free running model tests hydrodynamic forces motion response and parameter changes with forward speeds and water depths were discussed to conclude the study confirmed the expected change in manoeuvring behaviour of acceleration tests and zigzag tests in finite water depth where water depth restrictions changed considerably the pressure distribution around the ship increased the hydrodynamic forces and resistance and reduced the ship s manoeuvrability compared to the same manoeuvre in deeper water the ship is much more difficult to be manoeuvred and controlled in very shallow water the shallow water effect on ship manoeuvring cannot be neglected the forward speed and water depth have a significant influence on manoeuvring indices k and t and the pid controller s parameters the effects on parameters will provide a reference for future researchers the experimental results show that the path following capacity of the imc and adaptive pid controllers was satisfactory the tracking error was small the rudder deflection was reasonable and the designed controllers presented good performance in shallow water to achieve better performance in different water depths the controllers parameters should change as water depths credit authorship contribution statement changyuan chen conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis investigation data curation

20746,probability of rogue wave occurrence due to modulational instability in unidirectional jonswap sea states are investigated this investigation has been conducted based on the quantitative indicators of benjamin feir index b f i π number and kurtosis which are used to represent instability in wave trains evolution of wavefields is simulated using the fully nonlinear phase resolving numerical model of chalikov sheinin cs and the high order spectral model of hos ocean effects of the high frequency end tail of the spectrum on modulational instability and rogue wave evolution are discussed considering four different tail lengths according to our simulation results indicators considered for both model results perform as proxy for the occurrence of extreme events therefore it is possible to define a certain interval for the indicators where the probability of rogue wave occurrence is the highest nonlinearity described in terms of steepness is the dominant parameter on probability of rogue wave occurrence since it is related to various active physical processes in sea states both modulational instability and breaking rogue wave occurrence increases with increased nonlinearity until it is restricted again by high nonlinearity which causes waves to reach breaking onset earlier keywords phase resolving model fully nonlinear model high order spectral model modulational instability rogue waves surface gravity waves 1 introduction precise and accurate predictions of rogue or freak waves are of significant importance for the offshore structures design navigation purposes and various offshore applications rogue waves are believed to have caused many accidents which have resulted in ship damage and human casualties kharif and pelinovsky 2003 besides such extremity of rogue waves also poses a significant threat to floating offshore platforms where damages or operation delays would also likely result in substantial financial loses hence there has been a great effort in the industry such as crest and shortcrest jips projects for better and more precise predictions of rogue events that could be encountered during the platforms lifetime buchner et al 2011 hennig et al 2015 therefore the design methodologies for loading and response of the offshore floating platform and associated risks could be comprehensively estimated buchner et al 2011 hennig et al 2015 the statistical properties of rogue waves are not very well known due to their rare occurrence and lack of available measurements moreover scarcity of the evidence of rogue events renders to build a statistical relationship challenging haver 2001 therefore rogue waves are usually predicted from the extrapolation of distributions that are initially obtained for regular waves e g toffoli et al 2007 linear theory suggests that the distribution of sea surface elevation should follow gaussian statistics thus wave heights should be represented by the rayleigh distribution longuet higgins 1952 nevertheless nonlinear effects have significant impacts on wave crest shape and their statistical properties as waves become steeper increasing nonlinearity deviations from gaussian statistics also increase ochi 1997 therefore tayfun 1980 made modifications to rayleigh distributions to represent missing second order effects on crest distribution statistics furthermore forristall 2000 suggested a two parameter weibull distribution where the parameters depend on the wave spectrum and water depth which better represents the crest and the wave height distributions according to both of those second order corrected distributions occurrence of rogue waves is more likely than suggested by the linear theory although tayfun 1980 and forristall 2000 distributions approximate the occurrence of rogue events better than linear theory there are certain sea states which cannot be represented by second order distributions in third order dynamic effects come into existence such as nonlinear energy exchange resonances and modulational instability benjamin and feir 1967 yuen and lake 1982 zakharov 1966 1967 1968 among others the instabilities often lead to occurrences of rare transient events of high waves which cannot be depicted through the geometric quasi stationary approach due to their transience besides those rare transient extreme waves are very unlikely to be included in observations or simulations unless the simulations specifically target such events thus those individual extreme events cannot be pinpointed by extrapolations of the bulk observations modelling and by focusing on the low probability tail of the wave crest height distributions therefore it is crucial to understand which nonlinear wave trains and fields are stable and which are unstable the stable wave trains can be treated in terms of the superposition approach but the approach should be different for the unstable wave trains babanin 2013 babanin and rogers 2014 the presence of modulational instability that causes dynamic nonlinear exchanges and instabilities among wave trains can have a definite impact on short term wave statistics babanin 2013 it is expected that probability functions of unstable wavefields differ from the stable probability functions therefore babanin 2013 and babanin and rogers 2014 suggested that unstable wave field probability distributions should be examined separately from the stable ones in this study the occurrences of extreme waves and their relation to modulational instability in the unidirectional jonswap sea states are investigated this is done by simulating the temporal evolution of different wavefields and the statistical analysis based on indicator parameters which are designed to define instability of wave trains using spectral characteristics here we aim to determine the practical stability conditions based on the shape of the unidirectional spectrum and justify the effect of the various factors or parameters on the occurrence of extreme events in unstable wave fields accordingly the relation between short term wave statistics and the spectral characteristics such as steepness bandwidth and tail length and the physical properties such as high frequency modulation are investigated rigorously the evolution of the free surface is simulated using the 1d fully nonlinear model cs model thereafter developed by chalikov and sheinin 1996 2005 and high order spectral method hosm thereafter based hos ocean model developed by ducrozet et al 2016 the basis of the hosm is the expansion of surface potential into taylor series the accuracy of the method is dependent on the order of taylor expansion the common approach is using the hosm with a typical order of solution 3 5 nevertheless the applicability of the hosm approach for broad wave spectrum is criticised by chalikov 2016 stating that the order of taylor series should be significantly larger to reproduce high frequency waves here we considered cs model and hosm numerical schemes to demonstrate the effect of high frequency waves on stability and to test the models ability therefore our rigorous assessment of the cs model and hosm enables us to identify potential shortcomings related to the phase resolving models in addition this study also includes discussions of the limiting effect of wave breaking on the wave growth and the wave statistics since the limits of wave growth due to breaking is a significantly important aspect of rogue wave studies it should be handled with utmost care numerical modelling of wave breaking is one of the most difficult and challenging physical phenomena of ocean waves and its impacts on rogue waves are essential slunyaev and kokorina 2019 numerical instability caused by breaking has a physical nature and can be eliminated by parameterization of breaking onset and breaking dissipation chalikov 2016 the typical approach to determine wave breaking dissipation is based on introducing a viscous diffusion term liu and zhang 2019 seiffert et al 2017 using the eddy viscosity term such as described by tian et al 2012 however such algorithms were not considered here as they would affect the statistics of free waves chalikov 2016 and potentially introduce further uncertainty to the results here the statistics are taken until the breaking onset therefore testing the model ability to simulate waves that are close to breaking onset is of great importance in this study as well as the general application of the phase resolving models one of the novel points of this study is the further investigation of the effect of spectrum tail length on modulational instability and rogue wave occurrence the modulations at the high frequency tail have a significant impact on the stability of the wavefield gramstad 2017 and correspondingly on the breaking process babanin et al 2010 2011 hence the information on the spectrum tail is essential for the investigation on the occurrence of rogue waves and the statistics of the wave field moreover gramstad 2017 showed that broader spectrum bandwidth definition provided a better parametrization of the unstable growth rate due to modulational instability here we demonstrated the impact of the high frequency modes on the evolution of the free surface by simulating the jonswap spectrum with various tail lengths using fully nonlinear cs model section 2 briefly describes phase resolving models and the initial conditions of numerical simulations section 3 is devoted to indicator parameters that are designed to quantify or point out instabilities due to nonlinear interactions the results and the related discussions can be found in section 4 the final remarks of this study are given in section 5 2 numerical model configurations the full dynamics of fluid flow can be numerically complex the common approach for simplicity is to use potential theory where viscous effects of fluid are disregarded hence the system of euler equations can be employed to define the flow the nonlinear schröndinger equation nls which was derived from euler equations assuming that the waves are weakly nonlinear zakharov 1968 has been a widely used tool for investigation of nonlinear waves chalikov 2009 however nls based numerical models have limitations due to narrowband assumptions and they are only valid up to a certain degree of nonlinearity bitner gregersen and gramstad 2015 therefore more advanced numerical methods were developed to solve the system of high order euler equations in the recent years hosm has become significantly popular in nonlinear wave modelling and computational rogue wave studies due to their accuracy in higher orders and lesser computational demand compared to its counterparts ducrozet et al 2016 toffoli et al 2008 based on the zakharov equations zakharov 1968 and mode coupling approach dommermuth and yue 1987 and west et al 1987 developed the direct numerical approach for the computation of nonlinear waves up to an arbitrary order m in wave steepness appendix b different hosm schemes were developed and applied in order to investigate rogue waves bitner gregersen and toffoli 2012 ducrozet et al 2007 fujimoto et al 2019 gramstad and bitner gregersen 2019 liu and zhang 2019 xiao et al 2013 modulational instability fernandez et al 2014 toffoli et al 2010 and nonlinear energy transfers tanaka 2001 both in deep water and in varying bathymetry ducrozet and gouin 2017 nevertheless the applicability of the hosm approach for relatively broad banded spectrum is not well clarified chalikov 2016 hosm provides an approximate solution depending on the selected order typically m 3 5 hosm ability to reproduce high frequency waves decreases if the selected order is not sufficient which reduces the nonlinearity of the model chalikov 2016 on the other hand selection of higher orders 10 15 in the model requires substantially increased computational cost and numerical schemes become more prone to numerical instability due to the occasional amplification of high wavenumber modes chalikov 2016 therefore 1 d fully nonlinear model cs model developed by chalikov and sheinin 1996 2005 based on nonstationary conformal mapping to surface following coordinate system is also considered here appendix a the numerical scheme is based on the direct hydrodynamical modelling of the 1 d potential periodic surface waves the cs model was developed for the simulation of wave evolution with different initial conditions chalikov 2016 this model was tested with a wide variety of applications from the monochromatic wave trains to more complex conditions such as waves with extreme steepness bichromatic waves with very close wavenumbers and the simulation of full spectrum model results were validated against the known solutions and compared the results obtained with various spatial resolutions chalikov 2016 since the cs model is fully nonlinear the effects of higher order cumulants are present in simulation results jonswap spectrum is used for the definition of irregular wavefield in both models initial sea state is defined using amplitude values for each mode obtained from the jonswap spectrum and randomly assigned initial phases in the cs model fourier coefficients of free surface η x are defined as in eq 1 chalikov 2009 1 h k 2 s k δ k 1 2 η k h k sin ϕ η k h k cos ϕ k 1 2 3 k m here h k is the amplitude at kth mode and η k and η k are fourier coefficients in the cartesian coordinates phases of modes ϕ are assigned with a random number so that they are uniformly distributed in the interval 0 2π in eq 1 s k is the jonswap spectrum as a function of wavenumber eq 2a 2a s k α 2 k 3 exp 5 4 k p k 2 γ exp k k p 1 2 2 σ 0 2 2b s ω α j h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω ω p 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 σ σ a 0 007 ω ω p o r k k p σ b 0 009 ω ω p o r k k p where α is philips parameter energy scale and γ is peak enhancement factor ω and ω p are the angular frequency and angular peak frequency k and k p are wavenumber and peak wavenumber hos ocean defines the amplitude of each component as in eq 3 similar to the cs model based on the jonswap spectrum with randomly assigned phase values distributed over the range 0 2π ducrozet et al 2016 nevertheless ducrozet et al 2016 consider the frequency version of the jonswap spectrum given in eq 2b for initial spectrum then the dispersion relation in deep water gk ω2 is used to obtain wavenumber information where necessary note that α j in eq 2b is not equal to α in eq 2a and calculated according to h s 3 h x t m b m h t 0 exp i k m x here h x t is the surface elevation and b m h is the fourier coefficients amplitudes at mth mode another important physical process which has a significant effect on wave statistics is the wave breaking numerical simulation of deep water wave breaking is one of the most complex physical fluid mechanics phenomena not only for being a strongly nonlinear intermittent random process but also due to its very rapid progress compared to other physical ocean processes babanin 2011 babanin et al 2010 hos ocean and cs models assume that free surface is a single valued function which means the models cannot explicitly simulate the breaking in progress waves in other words either model does not solve breaking in cs model simulations terminate by breaking instability when the surface is no longer single valued in hos ocean simulations terminate when the surface slope becomes too high despite the differences both numerical schemes were found to be accurate until the termination of runs due to numerical instability chalikov 2016 ducrozet et al 2016 cs model was tested for the evolution of monochromatic waves where the model was able to successfully produce the breaking onset until the surface becomes a multivalued function of the horizontal coordinate chalikov and sheinin 2005 additional tests with cs model also were conducted with various cases including extremely steep waves and long term evolutions babanin et al 2007 2010 chalikov and sheinin 2005 where the model manages to continue almost up to the moment when exact solutions collapse due to breaking on the other hand hos ocean code was evaluated as very accurate for the simulation of very steep waves k a 0 4 ducrozet et al 2016 chalikov and babanin 2012 stated that no dynamical and geometrical characteristics steepness wave height asymmetry could be used as a clear predictor of breaking hence no additional criterion to estimate breaking onset is considered here following the breaking onset the energy loss due to breaking also needs to be accounted for the breaking dissipation is beyond the scope of this study even though there are robust and promising attempts to approximate the breaking dissipation liu and zhang 2019 seiffert et al 2017 those attempts are validated on the basis of laboratory experiments which have their limitations when scaled to the ocean their extent and applicability to breaking in natural conditions are unknown hence including any parametrization would alter the free wave statistics it should also be noted that the breaking dissipation term for cs model has already been implemented based on smoothing made locally in physical space for breaking waves however this term is not activated for the compatibility of this study in this study both models are applied for the long term simulations of the evolution of one dimensional wave fields nevertheless runs are often terminated due to instabilities here assumed as breaking onset for both models especially for the sea states with high initial steepness in cs model only cases with initial integral steepness s in eq 5 which is used to explain the lifetime of waves less than 0 11 smallest corresponding value of ε a o k 0 0 07 are able to finish the simulation without termination lifetime of waves decreases exponentially with increasing integral steepness for s 0 11 when s is in the order of 0 20 ε 0 12 termination takes place in less than one peak period of waves chalikov 2007 4 s 0 m k 2 s k dk 1 2 on the other hand terminations of simulations due to numerical instability are also observed in hos ocean numerical instabilities cause excessive growth of surface elevation and slopes which leads to termination of simulations these terminations commonly observed for cases with high initial steepness ε 0 10 approximately corresponds to s 0 14 with the used resolution initial sea surface is controlled with varying spectral shape parameters α and γ and random initial phases shape parameters α and γ vary within the intervals of 0 001 0 020 and 1 00 7 00 respectively the incremental step size for α is chosen as 0 001 and 0 1 for γ in the corresponding intervals set of nearly 1250 different cases are compared between both models moreover to test the impact of tail length on the probability of rogue wave occurrence jonswap sea states are simulated with four different spectral tail lengths which are chosen according to the ratio of cut off frequency to the peak of the spectrum k c u t k p as 3 5 5 0 6 5 8 0 simulations with different tail lengths are carried out using only fully nonlinear cs model which corresponds to additional 3750 cases in cs model high wavenumber end of the spectral space is set as 100 times the peak wavenumber of the spectrum k e n d k p 100 a large number of modes m 2000 and the specification of the location of spectral peak provides sufficient resolution and abounding length of spectral space for simulations in cs model therefore higher wave frequency modes are considered in the simulations even though the initial spectra tails are cut at k c u t k p 5 all runs are produced up to 250000 time steps with a step size of δ τ 0 002 which corresponds approximately to 350 periods of peak waves in order to include the effect of the random initial phase at least 50 realizations are simulated for each case termination of runs due to the early breaking of waves made it challenging to obtain enough data for cases with comparably higher initial steepness extreme α a n d γ values therefore the number of realizations for highly steep cases reached up to 600 in hos ocean model the resolution is chosen as n x 2048 for the unidirectional simulations after various trials with other resolutions n x 512 1024 4096 see appendix b and k e n d k p ratios the duration of hos ocean simulations is selected as 310 t p the first ten periods are the relaxation periods so that simulations are statistically compatible with the cs model the duration is long enough to represent the slow growth of the waves with moderately small steepness t ε 2 wave periods slunyaev and kokorina 2019 and the rogue wave lifetimes sergeeva and slunyaev 2013 and slunyaev et al 2016 stated that the deep water rogue wave lifetimes in numerical simulations could reach 60 wave periods the number of realizations for hos ocean model varies between 50 and 100 depending on the steepness of the initial cases the simulation domain length is selected as 50 peak wavelengths the hos ocean simulations are compiled with varying orders of the solution between m 2 5 to investigate the impact of higher order solutions on statistics appendix b for all the other settings default configurations of the hos ocean is kept where the initial spectral cut is also at k c u t k p 5 and k e n d k p corresponds to 20 when the above settings are chosen the full dealiasing is used appendix b as suggested by ducrozet et al 2016 3 indicator parameters several mechanisms are acknowledged to be responsible for the formation of rogue waves mori et al 2011 such as local intercrossing of a large number of monochromatic waves with appropriate phases and direction kharif and pelinovsky 2003 wave and opposing current interaction peregrine 1976 modulational instability in crossing sea states onorato et al 2006a and modulational instability nevertheless physical nature and exact mechanisms causing rogue waves in real ocean have not been fully understood despite the increase in the number of studies toffoli and bitner gregersen 2011 one of the most comprehensive studies on rogue statistics in the real ocean was christou and ewans 2014 where numerous rogue wave incidents were observed from the single point measurements nevertheless no clear connection was found between the rare extreme events and sea state parameters 3 1 benjamin feir index bfi deviations from periodic waveform lead to the generation of spectral sideband which could lead to the focusing of wave energy in space and time benjamin and feir 1967 mclean 1982 zakharov 1966 1967 instability of a uniform narrowband wave train resulting in sideband modulations is an example of a nonlinear modulation which is called modulational instability or benjamin feir instability benjamin and feir 1967 introduced the stability condition of periodic wave trains to sideband modulations using the wavenumber and the amplitude of the perturbed wave train stokes waves are unstable to small amplitude long perturbations onorato et al 2005b as stoke wave becomes unstable a single wave in the middle of the group begins to grow at the expense of surrounding waves giving rise to a large amplitude wave onorato et al 2006b janssen 2003 showed that rogue waves occur when waves are sufficiently steep because nonlinear focusing may overcome the spreading of energy by linear dispersion the steepness and the spectral bandwidth which are the measures of nonlinearity and dispersion respectively are generally accepted as essential parameters in the formation of extreme events mori et al 2011 janssen 2003 named the stability criterion as the benjamin feir index b f i and showed that the modulational instability occurs when b f i 1 5 b f i ε 2 δω ω 0 a o k 0 2 δk k 0 here ε is spectral steepness that equals to a o k 0 where a o is the wave amplitude defined as a o h s 2 ω 0 and k 0 are the peak frequency and peak wavenumbers δω and δk are the frequency bandwidth and wavenumber bandwidth respectively the factor of 1 2 is introduced in the definition to satisfy the commonly used theoretical limit of b f i 1 for the stability for random wave train the theory of modulational instability benjamin and feir 1967 zakharov 1966 1967 was initially based on monochromatic wave trains real waves are neither monochromatic nor linear however the instability is still present for them where the ratio between the wave steepness and bandwidth is restricted to certain limits babanin et al 2019 it has been supported both theoretically and experimentally that if wave steepness is large enough and spectral bandwidth is sufficiently small modulational instability may also take place in random spectra onorato et al 2006b janssen 2003 showed that non resonant four wave interactions could result in nonlinear focusing of energy janssen 2003 also showed the relation between b f i and higher order cumulants such as kurtosis since then b f i has been commonly used as parametrization of modulational instability in wind seas gramstad 2017 b f i has been considered as an indicator for occurrence of extreme events since the dependence between b f i and rogue waves were shown both experimentally and numerically onorato et al 2001 2005a there are two main drawbacks of b f i utilization for wind seas firstly the active mechanisms in full spectrum are much more complex than the slow growth of new wave components as in the monochromatic cases in continuous spectrum trains the sidebands and the primary waves become indistinguishable babanin et al 2019 onorato et al 2002 chalikov 2007 disapproved the applicability of the benjamin feir instability to the finite amplitude fast wave evolution controlled by conservation of energy and strong nonlinearity chalikov 2007 showed that instability develops in two stages an initial slow process followed by a faster development the initial slow development can be represented by modulational instability perfectly for small steepness however following faster growth does not agree with the benjamin feir instability theory chalikov 2007 hence the application of b f i is also questionable for developed spectrum chalikov 2009 the second drawback is related to the qualitative definition of spectral bandwidth in the conventional approach spectral bandwidth is taken as half spectral width on half maximum of the spectrum appendix c which makes spectral bandwidth not robust especially when the noisy spectra are considered moreover this bandwidth definition is heavily criticized due to mostly focusing on peak of the spectrum and not including the tail gramstad 2017 updated the definition of spectral bandwidth in b f i to put a weight on the tail of spectrum by introducing parameter r which makes possible to adjust spectral width close to peak or base heaviness of spectral tail eq 6 the new definition shows that broader spectral bandwidth provides a better parameterization of the unstable growth rate due to modulational instability 6 b f i r ε ω p δ r here δ r is equal to r times the spectral width at r times the spectral maximum appendix c for instance r 0 5 becomes equal to the conventional bandwidth definition of half spectral width on half maximum of the spectrum gramstad 2017 suggested taking r 0 2 where the highest correlation with the maximum growth rate was observed numerically 3 2 π number b f i definition becomes ambiguous when applied to the full spectrum same b f i values may correspond to significantly different spectral shapes thus different physical conditions in 2013 ribal et al discussed the instability of homogeneous wave fields mentioned in alber 1978 and states that alber s findings are the stochastic counterpart of deterministic benjamin feir instability based on the alber equation and jonswap spectrum ribal et al 2013 suggested that instability depended on the energy scale α and peak enhancement factor γ of jonswap spectra as both parameters influence steepness of waves and γ influences spectral bandwidth dimensionless width parameter π suggested by ribal et al 2013 shows the detailed description of the ratio of wave steepness to wave bandwidth in the spectral context eq 7 hence π number can be used as instability criteria for jonswap spectrum and more generally for wind wave spectra 7 π α γ ε π is a b f i like parameter however it is different from b f i separation of parameters α and γ into total steepness and the bandwidth of waves with continuous spectrum identify physical differences between wave fields with full spectrum and quasi monochromatic wave trains ribal et al 2013 in other words π can be defined as a spectral analogue of b f i while removing the ambiguity described above in spectral environment same steepness and same bandwidth can be achieved by varying different parameters which imply different physical meanings ribal et al 2013 in ribal et al 2013 π number was introduced as the inverse of the definition given in eq 7 and jonswap spectrum is found to be stable when π number inverse of eq 7 is greater than 1 later gramstad 2017 used the inverse version of π and updated the stability condition as α γ ε 0 77 considering the cases very close to the stable region in this study the inverse definition of π is applied as it is more appropriate for comparison against the b f i stability condition by gramstad 2017 is implemented here whilst the stability limit is adjusted as α γ ε 0 54 according to steepness definition used in this study a o k 0 4 m 0 k 0 alber equation is derived from the cubic nonlinear schrodinger equation and assumes weak nonlinear and narrow banded wave spectrum this condition does not necessarily coincide with all the ocean spectra as broad banded spectra are typical in real ocean conditions rather than the narrow banded ones this condition is one of the main drawbacks of the π number application 3 3 kurtosis kurtosis is the fourth order moment of the water surface which is a measure of the peakedness of the surface distribution hatori 1984 as an indicator of the extreme sea state in wind waves the parameter is widespread among the related studies in gaussian sea states kurtosis should be equal to 3 and larger values may indicate higher wave heights and higher order effects in the sea state e g babanin and polnikov 1995 longuet higgins 1963 stated that the fourth order moment of surface elevation is related to a third order nonlinear interaction formulation of kurtosis as a function of spectral wave action density was derived by onorato et al 2005 which leads to the expression of kurtosis as a sum of three contributors pure gaussian system the contributions from free modes and bound modes similar theoretical studies also show that this parameter is related not only to wave steepness but also to spectral bandwidth fedele 2015 janssen and janssen 2019 mori et al 2011 hence excess kurtosis which is the excess part related to bound waves and dynamic nonlinear modulation can be explained as the nonlinear correction to the rayleigh distribution for maximum wave height distribution function mori et al 2011 kurtosis is not a spectral parameter hence derivation of this parameter from the spectrum requires some statistical assumptions nevertheless kurtosis can be parameterized using spectral information janssen 2009 mori and janssen 2006 kurtosis parametrization is given in eq 8 which is based on gaussian spectrum and considering the enhanced peak of the spectrum 8 κ 4 3 κ 4 b o u n d κ 4 d y n κ 4 b o u n d 9 2 ε 2 κ 4 d y n π 3 b f i 2 bound wave contribution part in eq 8 κ 4 b o u n d is estimated based on janssen 2009 which express the bound waves in terms of free waves using the zakharov equation nevertheless this definition of the bound contributor is based on narrow banded waves where the applicability of this contributor to all spectra is uncertain dynamical nonlinear contribution κ 4 d y n to sea surface kurtosis which is associated with third order interactions can be expressed using b f i mori and janssen 2006 stated that the main kurtosis contributor was the dynamic one for unidirectional waves and rogue wave occurrence probability was significantly enhanced by kurtosis increase due to four wave interactions therefore the relation between the κ 4 d y n and rogue wave occurrence probability can be related to modulational instability spectral parametrizations of kurtosis should always be considered carefully even though this study is unidirectional hatori 1984 showed that four wave nonlinear interaction might also result in negative contributor values for directional sea states therefore high order nonlinear interactions do not always correspond to kurtosis larger than 3 4 numerical simulation results 4 1 hos ocean model vs cs model here both hos ocean and cs model results are presented using dimensionless crest height the ratio of surface elevation to significant wave height η h s the rogue wave occurrence probability p r w hereafter of each case is calculated as the ratio of the number of rogue wave occurrences for all realizations over the number of waves for all realizations in figs 1 4 and 6 7 blue triangles represent cs model results while green circles represent hos ocean model with m 5 each point stands for a different parameterization controlled by shape variables α and γ of the jonswap spectrum correlation between the selected indicator parameters and p r w obtained from both numerical models are presented in fig 1 in figs 1 3 the cyan line represents rogue wave probability according to the rayleigh distribution which is same for all cases while grey hatched part represents all forristall 2000 distributions with all the different configurations the red line represents the probability of 10 3 1 rogue wave for every 1000 waves which will be referred as the high risk part in terms of rogue wave occurrence rogue wave formation is observed in almost all cases except for low steepness and extremely high steepness cases in the cs model furthermore p r w for the majority the cases exceed their corresponding forristall 2000 distributions fig 1 so that rogue waves occur more frequently than the estimates provided by second order correction for most of the cases these findings support babanin and rogers 2014 such that second order corrections to the crest distributions are not representative of the unstable unidirectional wave trains maximum normalized crest heights c r m a x h s obtained from simulations vary between 1 1 and 2 1 for cs and 1 15 to 2 60 for hos ocean the wave growth and maximum height of crest are physically limited by the wave breaking babanin 2013 babanin et al 2007 2010 the maximal possible relative crest heights using amplitude η a 0 was estimated to be approximately 3 5 babanin 2011 which corresponds to 1 75 for η h s a 0 is the half of significant wave height in case of monochromatic laboratory waves therefore upper limits of dimensionless crest height η h s obtained from both models are unrealistic this behaviour can be associated with the model s performance to simulate breaking onset it can be interpreted from the number of extra ordinary occurrences in hos ocean the breaking limiter used in hos ocean is not quite successful in terms of preventing waves from growing unrealistically high on the other hand cs model performance is found to be more successful in terms of limiting the wave height through the breaking compared to hos ocean note that c r m a x h s values presented here represent one wave out of millions in many realizations which are very likely to be resultant of numerical instability parametrization of breaking onset and breaking dissipation could prevent the occurrence of those unrealistic waves nevertheless parametrization of breaking could bring another uncertainty on results those rare occurrences do not impact the probability of occurrence distributions fig 1 or the bin averaged c r m a x h s values fig 2 col 2 in general three different trends are observed between the indicator parameters and p r w which are found to be mutual between the two models for all indicators except bound kurtosis the first trend is associated with low indicator and steepness values b f i 0 35 b f i 0 2 1 5 and π 0 2 where a rapid increase in probability levels are observed with an increase of indicator values hereby the second order distributions perform well and probabilities of rogue wave occurrence usually do not exceed 2e 4 moreover the accordance between the two models is significantly high the second trend mainly belongs to the cases with moderate steepness or low steepness but narrower bandwidths where crest distributions start to deviate from second order distribution obviously due to high order interactions probabilities obtained from both models reach and occasionally exceed 1 in 1000 waves in this part modulational instability can take place mainly due to increased steepness and also due to narrowing of spectral bandwidth in general both model results show parallel trends of p r w compared to each other however the agreement among results is not as good as in the previous part the discrepancy gets stronger with the increasing b f i and π fig 1 1st column while the cs model estimates higher probabilities than hos ocean especially for the cases with high γ values the conspicuous behaviour of the hos ocean model is that results do not significantly vary with changes of the indicator parameters while its probabilities are steady after b f i 0 35 and π 0 2 meanwhile in the cs results notable increasing and decreasing trends arise concerning changes of indicator parameters and probability whilst probability levels get less scattered in the final part which corresponds to extremely steep sea states ε 0 12 with narrow spectral bandwidth both high γ and α values different behaviour of numerical models becomes even more apparent hos ocean model follows its previous trend i e no significant changes in p r w on the other hand rogue wave occurrence decreases substantially with increasing values of indicator parameters in the cs model which can be explained by breaking of waves due to high nonlinearity some cases were not even able to run past ten peak period duration with the cs model due to early breaking similarly early terminations due to breaking onset were frequently observed in hos ocean model nevertheless for the highly nonlinear sea states breaking onset does not happen as early and as frequent as the cs model with the considered resolutions changes of maximal non dimensional crest height against indicator parameters are parallel to the changes of p r w as in fig 1 similar increasing and decreasing trends affected by the nonlinearity of the surface are also observed between maximal normalized crest heights and indicator parameters model results agree well except for the high values of indicator parameters b f i 1 0 b f i 0 2 3 5 π 0 54 κ 4 bound 0 07 and κ 4 dyn 4 fig 2 the impact of modulational instability on rogue wave formation can be indicated with the correlation observed between p r w and selected parameters moreover the stability of the jonswap spectrum in short wave modulations can also be interpreted using the spectral parameters rogue wave probabilities do not show significant variance or any behavioural difference among the different selection criteria i e b f i b f i 0 2 and π however the interdependence of kurtosis and the occurrence of extreme events slightly differ from other indicator parameters for the kurtosis parameter with only bound wave contribution figs 1 3 d rogue wave occurrence is significantly less scattered especially when it is smaller than 3 05 which is a very convenient representation of the effects of bound waves on the extreme wave occurrence nevertheless κ 4 bound gets more scattered towards extreme steepness values where higher order interactions and breaking also become effective in terms of rogue wave occurrence the dynamic contributor of kurtosis definition used here does not show good conformity with p r w the results are highly scattered fig 1e and 2e initially p r w increases with increasing κ 4 t o t a l as expected up to κ 4 t o t a l 4 nevertheless p r w showed a decreasing trend with increasing kurtosis κ 4 t o t a l 4 this condition arises due to consideration of single kurtosis value calculated from initial spectra for a simulation of 300 t p no time dependent kurtosis change is considered here this is a common issue for all considered indicator parameters hence it is more apparent for the kurtosis parametrization used here this condition does not interpret the fact that free wave modulation is not correlated with rogue wave occurrence but only shows that the κ 4 d y n parametrization and the way it is considered here does not appropriate to represents p r w the reduction of p r w is also a result of high order effects which leads waves to become more prone to breaking and that limits the wave growth even though p r w decreases for large values of κ 4 t o t a l the formation of rogue waves due to modulational instability is still commonly observed kurtosis is known to be a very good indicator for rogue wave occurrence however the findings indicate that κ 4 t o t a l considered here is not a reliable predictor to estimate p r w for fast evolving highly nonlinear sea states the effects of steepness and bandwidth on p r w are also investigated separately in fig 3 steepness behaviour fig 3 2a is found to be highly similar to the b f i and π indicators meaning that the steepness dominates the behaviour of the indicators bandwidth appears to be more subsidiary parameter in definition even though narrowing of the spectral bandwidth also enhances the p r w one of the aims of this study is to define practical threshold values for criteria for rogue wave occurrence both b f i s b f i 1 0 janssen 2003 and π s π 0 54 gramstad 2017 ribal et al 2013 theoretical stability limits for modulational instability do not show full conformity with the p r w obtained from both models nevertheless those theoretical limits are associated with modulational instability and not the rogue wave occurrence rogue wave formation can take place due to different mechanisms and modulational instability does not always lead to rogue wave occurrence therefore the connection between indicator parameters and p r w is not straightforward defining a strict threshold value of any indicator to point out significant p r w would not be precise this argument can be supported with the numerical model results here showing that no strict threshold value can be determined for any indicator parameters fig 1 however the probability of the occurrence of rogue waves significantly decreases when b f i 0 35 and π 0 2 the stability limit calculated from alber equation for π 0 54 or π 0 77 with steepness definition as given in gramstad 2017 appears to be too strict which is implied in gramstad 2017 as well the similar implication is also true for commonly used stability limit of b f i 1 in fig 4 four different cases are selected for further representation of the performance of second order crest distribution functions and the impact of breaking on crest distribution for highly nonlinear cases plot i represents the general behaviour of cases with very low steepness b f i and π values here tayfun 1980 and forristall 2000 distributions provide a good estimation to model data which are also located close to rayleigh distribution due to low steepness deviations from the second order distributions become significant for plots ii and iii of fig 4 which indicates the effect of higher order nonlinearity the extreme wave statistics of long crested waves are underestimated by one order of magnitude compared to second order corrections for plots ii and iii this difference is due to disregarded high order effects onorato et al 2009 in plot iv the effect of high nonlinearity and breaking on the existence of extreme waves can be observed both models deviate from the given distributions in fig 4 up to η h s 1 0 however this deviation attenuates in the cs model due to the waves reaching breaking onset the cs distribution curve falls towards forristall 2000 and tayfun 1980 distribution and gets very close to second order guesses here p r w approximately coincides to 1e 4 for the cs model on the other hand deviation from the second order is still present for hos ocean model p r w values are usually 4 5 times higher than second order guesses such a deviation is found to be unrealistic when simulation results are compared to the laboratory results of onorato et al 2009 for the nonlinear jonswap sea states a decrease in the deviation from the second order distributions was observed experimentally for unidirectional waves in onorato et al 2009 numerically in socquet juglard et al 2005 this behaviour can be associated with the effect of high order interactions on spectral evolution in high steepness sea states it is known that third order resonant interactions can be responsible for local and rapid spectral changes which affect the crest height statistics gibson and swan 2007 finally for the better understanding of the stability of the jonswap spectrum the difference caused due to different models and practical use of simulation results in terms of the jonswap shape parameters p r w are also presented on α γ planes fig 5 modulational instability curves of jonswap spectra were calculated by onorato et al 2003 and gramstad 2017 based on different approaches and solvers marginal stability limits are presented in α γ plane of our probability results fig 5 stability limit of onorato et al 2003 is found to be more conservative compared to gramstad 2017 stability limits π 0 54 line on α γ plane even though obtained results shows resemblance probability levels do not show full compatibility with stability levels high levels of p r w are also observed in fig 5 before reaching to the stability limits in simulations the initial location of the peak wave number is always constant meaning that the spectral bandwidth is only affected by the changes in γ while steepness is affected by the changes in both α and γ as shown in our results figs 4 5 increase in γ enhances rogue wave occurrence probability as expected meanwhile the steepness is more sensitive to changes in α which initiates breaking after certain values therefore low rogue wave occurrence is observed for high values of α α 0 13 the difference in models responses can also be observed from α γ planes fig 5 hos ocean has shown a homogeneous distribution of p r w which is in accordance with the unvarying trend observed for p r w vs indicator parameters in fig 1 meanwhile an apparent increase and decrease trends of p r w with increasing α γ can be seen from the top plot of fig 5 4 2 effect of tail length b f i for continuous spectra is introduced by analogy i e janssen 2003 onorato et al 2001 where the choice of the bandwidth is flexible and does not have strict analytical constraints usually some property of the spectrum peak width is employed for this purpose therefore bandwidth definition is heavily related to the spectral peak however gramstad 2017 showed that wider spectral bandwidth up to a certain width represents the unstable growth rate better than the standard half width at half maximum bandwidth definition therefore information on the tail of the spectrum is also crucial for the investigation of the stability of the sea state in this part the impact of tail length of jonswap spectrum on p r w and its correlation with indicator parameters b f i b f i r and π are examined using the only the fully nonlinear cs model highly similar trends with small discrepancies are observed among the selected indicators fig 6 although the differences are mostly indistinguishable among cases with different tail lengths it is clear that cases associated with higher rogue wave probabilities are the ones with the shortest tail green dots this result contradicts with our initial assumptions that the presence of high frequency modes in spectra is expected to contribute to rogue wave occurrence however adverse effect of increasing tail length on rogue wave probability is observed regardless of the indicator parameter this adverse behaviour between p r w and nonlinearity might be better understood with the relationship between initial spectral steepness ε and p r w histogram plots of steepness bin width of 0 005 and corresponding average rogue wave probabilities for each tail lengths are given in fig 7 the common behaviour observed for all tail lengths is that average p r w increases with increasing steepness until reaching its maximum turning point p r w demonstrates a decreasing trend with a further increase of steepness where high nonlinearity causes waves to reach breaking onset earlier nonlinearity works in a paradoxical way chalikov 2009 that either it can enhance p r w by increasing the wave wave interactions before turning point or it works as a limiting factor to the wave growth which would eventually result in a decrease of p r w after turning point the main difference among varying tail lengths stands out as the location of this turning point kirezci and babanin 2019 p r w values of the longest tailed spectra are observed to start decreasing at a smaller steepness fig 7 similar to the indicator parameters fig 6 the following decrease in p r w is observed for the spectra with the relatively shorter tail until finally the shortest tail reaches its turning point figs 6 7 in simulations this behaviour corresponds to longer survival time for the spectra with the shortest tail before breaking this argument is also related to the higher probabilities of rogue wave occurrence discrepancies among probability levels due to different tail lengths become more distinct at higher steepness after ε 0 11 it is stated by christou et al 2008 that increase in nonlinearity results in an increase in high frequency amplitudes moreover chalikov and babanin 2012 showed that short waves were effective on breaking when unidirectional full spectrum was considered here simulation results with various tail lengths also validate the presence of high frequency mode contribution to wave breaking furthermore the same mechanism also affects extreme wave statistics by decreasing rogue wave probabilities in the absence of wave breaking integral steepness s 0 11 high frequency modes contribute to the rogue wave occurrence probability therefore spectra with a longer tail resulted in higher p r w nevertheless rogue wave probability for non breaking cases simulation without termination is not as significant as cases with breaking altering the tail lengths resulted in the same rogue wave occurrence probabilities for ε 0 1 highlighting the ineffectiveness of the tail lengths for around this particular steepness value as this range of steepness values are widespread in real sea states our results here are presumably a suitable indicator in practical applications kirezci and babanin 2019 the impact of the tail length can also be easily identified from scatter probability plots fig 8 which are biased towards the shorter tail the probabilities become more scattered in fig 8 iii which shows the comparison of the longest and the shortest tailed cases breaking and freaking processes can be both initiated by modulational instability and are strongly affected by the initial steepness probability distribution on α γ planes and related two stability limits onorato et al 2003 gramstad 2017 were investigated for a variety of tail lengths fig 9 although stability limits do not show full conformity with our simulation results here we find that the stability limit is better represented by onorato et al 2003 regardless of the tail length the tail length has a greater impact on cases with γ 5 00 and 0 005 α 0 010 where spectra with longer tails are already significantly altered by breaking 5 conclusion rogue wave formation is dependent on two opposing processes those which make the waves higher and those which limit the wave height for stationary conditions i e wind input is balanced by dissipation at the time scales of interest the growth of waves can either be due to linear or nonlinear wave superpositions or due to instabilities within the wave system meanwhile the limiting factors of wave heights are wave breaking and nonlinear wave wave interactions leads to early breaking note that we do not consider wind forcing where the dynamics balance of source terms where evolution of wave fields are different which is beyond the scope of this study steepness and bandwidth stand out as two controlling parameters in rogue wave formation it has been found that spectral bandwidth in combination with the steepness further instigates or limit the modulational instability conditions nevertheless no prominent effect of spectral bandwidth on p r w is observed from a statistical point of view note that the findings here are limited to unidirectional jonswap spectrum hence the impact of spectral bandwidth on more complex bi model or directional spectrum would differ from the unidirectional spectra on the other hand nonlinearity defined by wave steepness is found to be the dominant spectral feature on rogue wave occurrence probability due to its relation to various physical processes active in sea states i e both to modulational instability and superposition in stable wind fields and the breaking rogue wave occurrence increases with enhanced nonlinearity until it is restricted again by very high nonlinearity gramstad and bitner gregersen 2019 also stated that steepness is a key parameter for the estimation of extreme sea states after examining the relation between spectral parameters h s t p steepness bandwidth and kurtosis similar conclusions can also be drawn from the tail length differences the effect of tail length on rogue wave occurrence is also found to be relevant with the nonlinearity of the total wave field in cases with respectively lower steepness no breaking a longer tail contributes to the freaking process nonetheless when breaking is present high nonlinearity cases with shorter tail results in higher rogue wave occurrence this study offers one of the most extensive statistical application for the rogue wave occurrence probability sea surfaces of nearly 1250 different jonswap spectrum with steepness ranging from 0 03 to 0 20 are investigated with two different phase resolving models and many realizations our results highlight that after certain steepness limits are reached increased nonlinear interactions are more prone to take part in breaking process than freaking process this phenomenon was explained by chalikov 2009 as for high steepness nonlinearity works opposite to what is expected since in highly nonlinear fields wave wave interactions lead to the breaking faster than cases with low steepness in other words very energetic wave wave interactions extremely nonlinear sea states devastate the growth of waves before they reach larger wave heights chalikov 2009 rogue wave occurrence also increases with increased nonlinearity instability until it is restricted again by very high nonlinearity it is observed here that modulational instability results in either freaking or breaking of waves babanin et al 2011 however the fate of waves in modulational instability is highly dependent on the spectral steepness in the one dimensional simulation rogue wave occurrence is found to be greater than 1 over 1000 waves when 0 3 π 0 55 0 9 b f i 1 4 and 3 0 b f i 0 2 5 0 those intervals can be interpreted as high risk sea states along with consideration of the h s of the sea states moreover according to α γ planes high risk sea states are more concentrated where γ 5 0 and 0 005 α 0 015 even though p r w affected by the high frequency modes dangerous sea states can still be defined as the same regardless of tail length the various jonswap spectra considered in this study are shown to be unstable for high α and γ parameters jonswap stability curve suggested by onorato et al 2003 which is based on theoretical results from a wigner approach on the nls equations has shown a better correlation with our p r w statistics it is initially expected that application of b f i 0 2 could be better representing maximum unstable growth rate as given in gramstad 2017 nevertheless in terms of rogue wave occurrence probability no practical advantage over conventional b f i is observed as given in fig 6 the behaviours of b f i 0 2 and b f i are almost identical the model performances are also evaluated under different conditions during low and moderate values of indicator parameters models show high conformity and no significant differences arise between hos ocean and cs models obtained results are also consistent with the theoretical and experimental findings nevertheless for high values of indicator parameters and highly nonlinear cases fully nonlinear scheme of the cs model is found to more reliable with its exact solution and realistic results figs 1 4 this discrepancy in performance between models can be due to differences in consideration of high frequency modes and the breaking onset consequently these factors significantly affect the rogue wave occurrence probability it should be noted that differences in the applied numerical methods such as dealising technique used in hos ocean also impacts the results and causes discrepancies between models the computational cost of hos ocean is less than the cs model when m 3 but computational demand exceeds cs when m 5 even so both models are appropriate for operational usage for unidirectional cases due to their low computational demand another remark can be made on the breaking of rogue waves it has been stated before that nonlinear focusing either goes in freaking or breaking process however this does not mean that all rogue waves also end up breaking it has been observed that on the contrary most of the extreme cases continue evolving and result in shrinking in height to become medium or small size waves the same observation was also made by chalikov 2009 with a different initial setup lastly it should be noted that the present study is restricted to unidirectional waves while realistic ocean waves are directional directionality has a significant effect on both the modulational instability onorato et al 2009 and the limiting steepness of the breaking wave toffoli et al 2010 moreover there are other mechanisms involved in rogue wave occurrence such as crossing sea states under such conditions onset and breaking mechanism are also found to be affected by crossing mcallister et al 2018 hence probability levels presented here would be significantly different if the directional properties were considered nevertheless the main purpose of this study is to test the indicators using both fully nonlinear numerical and hosm scheme the unidirectional approach considered here contributes to the understanding of the rogue wave occurrence probability hence findings here could be beneficial for the future attempts on forecasting of rogue waves meanwhile the operational application is challenging for directional cases due to significant growth of computational demand of phase resolving models either fully nonlinear or hosm credit authorship contribution statement cagil kirezci conceptualization

20746,probability of rogue wave occurrence due to modulational instability in unidirectional jonswap sea states are investigated this investigation has been conducted based on the quantitative indicators of benjamin feir index b f i π number and kurtosis which are used to represent instability in wave trains evolution of wavefields is simulated using the fully nonlinear phase resolving numerical model of chalikov sheinin cs and the high order spectral model of hos ocean effects of the high frequency end tail of the spectrum on modulational instability and rogue wave evolution are discussed considering four different tail lengths according to our simulation results indicators considered for both model results perform as proxy for the occurrence of extreme events therefore it is possible to define a certain interval for the indicators where the probability of rogue wave occurrence is the highest nonlinearity described in terms of steepness is the dominant parameter on probability of rogue wave occurrence since it is related to various active physical processes in sea states both modulational instability and breaking rogue wave occurrence increases with increased nonlinearity until it is restricted again by high nonlinearity which causes waves to reach breaking onset earlier keywords phase resolving model fully nonlinear model high order spectral model modulational instability rogue waves surface gravity waves 1 introduction precise and accurate predictions of rogue or freak waves are of significant importance for the offshore structures design navigation purposes and various offshore applications rogue waves are believed to have caused many accidents which have resulted in ship damage and human casualties kharif and pelinovsky 2003 besides such extremity of rogue waves also poses a significant threat to floating offshore platforms where damages or operation delays would also likely result in substantial financial loses hence there has been a great effort in the industry such as crest and shortcrest jips projects for better and more precise predictions of rogue events that could be encountered during the platforms lifetime buchner et al 2011 hennig et al 2015 therefore the design methodologies for loading and response of the offshore floating platform and associated risks could be comprehensively estimated buchner et al 2011 hennig et al 2015 the statistical properties of rogue waves are not very well known due to their rare occurrence and lack of available measurements moreover scarcity of the evidence of rogue events renders to build a statistical relationship challenging haver 2001 therefore rogue waves are usually predicted from the extrapolation of distributions that are initially obtained for regular waves e g toffoli et al 2007 linear theory suggests that the distribution of sea surface elevation should follow gaussian statistics thus wave heights should be represented by the rayleigh distribution longuet higgins 1952 nevertheless nonlinear effects have significant impacts on wave crest shape and their statistical properties as waves become steeper increasing nonlinearity deviations from gaussian statistics also increase ochi 1997 therefore tayfun 1980 made modifications to rayleigh distributions to represent missing second order effects on crest distribution statistics furthermore forristall 2000 suggested a two parameter weibull distribution where the parameters depend on the wave spectrum and water depth which better represents the crest and the wave height distributions according to both of those second order corrected distributions occurrence of rogue waves is more likely than suggested by the linear theory although tayfun 1980 and forristall 2000 distributions approximate the occurrence of rogue events better than linear theory there are certain sea states which cannot be represented by second order distributions in third order dynamic effects come into existence such as nonlinear energy exchange resonances and modulational instability benjamin and feir 1967 yuen and lake 1982 zakharov 1966 1967 1968 among others the instabilities often lead to occurrences of rare transient events of high waves which cannot be depicted through the geometric quasi stationary approach due to their transience besides those rare transient extreme waves are very unlikely to be included in observations or simulations unless the simulations specifically target such events thus those individual extreme events cannot be pinpointed by extrapolations of the bulk observations modelling and by focusing on the low probability tail of the wave crest height distributions therefore it is crucial to understand which nonlinear wave trains and fields are stable and which are unstable the stable wave trains can be treated in terms of the superposition approach but the approach should be different for the unstable wave trains babanin 2013 babanin and rogers 2014 the presence of modulational instability that causes dynamic nonlinear exchanges and instabilities among wave trains can have a definite impact on short term wave statistics babanin 2013 it is expected that probability functions of unstable wavefields differ from the stable probability functions therefore babanin 2013 and babanin and rogers 2014 suggested that unstable wave field probability distributions should be examined separately from the stable ones in this study the occurrences of extreme waves and their relation to modulational instability in the unidirectional jonswap sea states are investigated this is done by simulating the temporal evolution of different wavefields and the statistical analysis based on indicator parameters which are designed to define instability of wave trains using spectral characteristics here we aim to determine the practical stability conditions based on the shape of the unidirectional spectrum and justify the effect of the various factors or parameters on the occurrence of extreme events in unstable wave fields accordingly the relation between short term wave statistics and the spectral characteristics such as steepness bandwidth and tail length and the physical properties such as high frequency modulation are investigated rigorously the evolution of the free surface is simulated using the 1d fully nonlinear model cs model thereafter developed by chalikov and sheinin 1996 2005 and high order spectral method hosm thereafter based hos ocean model developed by ducrozet et al 2016 the basis of the hosm is the expansion of surface potential into taylor series the accuracy of the method is dependent on the order of taylor expansion the common approach is using the hosm with a typical order of solution 3 5 nevertheless the applicability of the hosm approach for broad wave spectrum is criticised by chalikov 2016 stating that the order of taylor series should be significantly larger to reproduce high frequency waves here we considered cs model and hosm numerical schemes to demonstrate the effect of high frequency waves on stability and to test the models ability therefore our rigorous assessment of the cs model and hosm enables us to identify potential shortcomings related to the phase resolving models in addition this study also includes discussions of the limiting effect of wave breaking on the wave growth and the wave statistics since the limits of wave growth due to breaking is a significantly important aspect of rogue wave studies it should be handled with utmost care numerical modelling of wave breaking is one of the most difficult and challenging physical phenomena of ocean waves and its impacts on rogue waves are essential slunyaev and kokorina 2019 numerical instability caused by breaking has a physical nature and can be eliminated by parameterization of breaking onset and breaking dissipation chalikov 2016 the typical approach to determine wave breaking dissipation is based on introducing a viscous diffusion term liu and zhang 2019 seiffert et al 2017 using the eddy viscosity term such as described by tian et al 2012 however such algorithms were not considered here as they would affect the statistics of free waves chalikov 2016 and potentially introduce further uncertainty to the results here the statistics are taken until the breaking onset therefore testing the model ability to simulate waves that are close to breaking onset is of great importance in this study as well as the general application of the phase resolving models one of the novel points of this study is the further investigation of the effect of spectrum tail length on modulational instability and rogue wave occurrence the modulations at the high frequency tail have a significant impact on the stability of the wavefield gramstad 2017 and correspondingly on the breaking process babanin et al 2010 2011 hence the information on the spectrum tail is essential for the investigation on the occurrence of rogue waves and the statistics of the wave field moreover gramstad 2017 showed that broader spectrum bandwidth definition provided a better parametrization of the unstable growth rate due to modulational instability here we demonstrated the impact of the high frequency modes on the evolution of the free surface by simulating the jonswap spectrum with various tail lengths using fully nonlinear cs model section 2 briefly describes phase resolving models and the initial conditions of numerical simulations section 3 is devoted to indicator parameters that are designed to quantify or point out instabilities due to nonlinear interactions the results and the related discussions can be found in section 4 the final remarks of this study are given in section 5 2 numerical model configurations the full dynamics of fluid flow can be numerically complex the common approach for simplicity is to use potential theory where viscous effects of fluid are disregarded hence the system of euler equations can be employed to define the flow the nonlinear schröndinger equation nls which was derived from euler equations assuming that the waves are weakly nonlinear zakharov 1968 has been a widely used tool for investigation of nonlinear waves chalikov 2009 however nls based numerical models have limitations due to narrowband assumptions and they are only valid up to a certain degree of nonlinearity bitner gregersen and gramstad 2015 therefore more advanced numerical methods were developed to solve the system of high order euler equations in the recent years hosm has become significantly popular in nonlinear wave modelling and computational rogue wave studies due to their accuracy in higher orders and lesser computational demand compared to its counterparts ducrozet et al 2016 toffoli et al 2008 based on the zakharov equations zakharov 1968 and mode coupling approach dommermuth and yue 1987 and west et al 1987 developed the direct numerical approach for the computation of nonlinear waves up to an arbitrary order m in wave steepness appendix b different hosm schemes were developed and applied in order to investigate rogue waves bitner gregersen and toffoli 2012 ducrozet et al 2007 fujimoto et al 2019 gramstad and bitner gregersen 2019 liu and zhang 2019 xiao et al 2013 modulational instability fernandez et al 2014 toffoli et al 2010 and nonlinear energy transfers tanaka 2001 both in deep water and in varying bathymetry ducrozet and gouin 2017 nevertheless the applicability of the hosm approach for relatively broad banded spectrum is not well clarified chalikov 2016 hosm provides an approximate solution depending on the selected order typically m 3 5 hosm ability to reproduce high frequency waves decreases if the selected order is not sufficient which reduces the nonlinearity of the model chalikov 2016 on the other hand selection of higher orders 10 15 in the model requires substantially increased computational cost and numerical schemes become more prone to numerical instability due to the occasional amplification of high wavenumber modes chalikov 2016 therefore 1 d fully nonlinear model cs model developed by chalikov and sheinin 1996 2005 based on nonstationary conformal mapping to surface following coordinate system is also considered here appendix a the numerical scheme is based on the direct hydrodynamical modelling of the 1 d potential periodic surface waves the cs model was developed for the simulation of wave evolution with different initial conditions chalikov 2016 this model was tested with a wide variety of applications from the monochromatic wave trains to more complex conditions such as waves with extreme steepness bichromatic waves with very close wavenumbers and the simulation of full spectrum model results were validated against the known solutions and compared the results obtained with various spatial resolutions chalikov 2016 since the cs model is fully nonlinear the effects of higher order cumulants are present in simulation results jonswap spectrum is used for the definition of irregular wavefield in both models initial sea state is defined using amplitude values for each mode obtained from the jonswap spectrum and randomly assigned initial phases in the cs model fourier coefficients of free surface η x are defined as in eq 1 chalikov 2009 1 h k 2 s k δ k 1 2 η k h k sin ϕ η k h k cos ϕ k 1 2 3 k m here h k is the amplitude at kth mode and η k and η k are fourier coefficients in the cartesian coordinates phases of modes ϕ are assigned with a random number so that they are uniformly distributed in the interval 0 2π in eq 1 s k is the jonswap spectrum as a function of wavenumber eq 2a 2a s k α 2 k 3 exp 5 4 k p k 2 γ exp k k p 1 2 2 σ 0 2 2b s ω α j h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω ω p 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 σ σ a 0 007 ω ω p o r k k p σ b 0 009 ω ω p o r k k p where α is philips parameter energy scale and γ is peak enhancement factor ω and ω p are the angular frequency and angular peak frequency k and k p are wavenumber and peak wavenumber hos ocean defines the amplitude of each component as in eq 3 similar to the cs model based on the jonswap spectrum with randomly assigned phase values distributed over the range 0 2π ducrozet et al 2016 nevertheless ducrozet et al 2016 consider the frequency version of the jonswap spectrum given in eq 2b for initial spectrum then the dispersion relation in deep water gk ω2 is used to obtain wavenumber information where necessary note that α j in eq 2b is not equal to α in eq 2a and calculated according to h s 3 h x t m b m h t 0 exp i k m x here h x t is the surface elevation and b m h is the fourier coefficients amplitudes at mth mode another important physical process which has a significant effect on wave statistics is the wave breaking numerical simulation of deep water wave breaking is one of the most complex physical fluid mechanics phenomena not only for being a strongly nonlinear intermittent random process but also due to its very rapid progress compared to other physical ocean processes babanin 2011 babanin et al 2010 hos ocean and cs models assume that free surface is a single valued function which means the models cannot explicitly simulate the breaking in progress waves in other words either model does not solve breaking in cs model simulations terminate by breaking instability when the surface is no longer single valued in hos ocean simulations terminate when the surface slope becomes too high despite the differences both numerical schemes were found to be accurate until the termination of runs due to numerical instability chalikov 2016 ducrozet et al 2016 cs model was tested for the evolution of monochromatic waves where the model was able to successfully produce the breaking onset until the surface becomes a multivalued function of the horizontal coordinate chalikov and sheinin 2005 additional tests with cs model also were conducted with various cases including extremely steep waves and long term evolutions babanin et al 2007 2010 chalikov and sheinin 2005 where the model manages to continue almost up to the moment when exact solutions collapse due to breaking on the other hand hos ocean code was evaluated as very accurate for the simulation of very steep waves k a 0 4 ducrozet et al 2016 chalikov and babanin 2012 stated that no dynamical and geometrical characteristics steepness wave height asymmetry could be used as a clear predictor of breaking hence no additional criterion to estimate breaking onset is considered here following the breaking onset the energy loss due to breaking also needs to be accounted for the breaking dissipation is beyond the scope of this study even though there are robust and promising attempts to approximate the breaking dissipation liu and zhang 2019 seiffert et al 2017 those attempts are validated on the basis of laboratory experiments which have their limitations when scaled to the ocean their extent and applicability to breaking in natural conditions are unknown hence including any parametrization would alter the free wave statistics it should also be noted that the breaking dissipation term for cs model has already been implemented based on smoothing made locally in physical space for breaking waves however this term is not activated for the compatibility of this study in this study both models are applied for the long term simulations of the evolution of one dimensional wave fields nevertheless runs are often terminated due to instabilities here assumed as breaking onset for both models especially for the sea states with high initial steepness in cs model only cases with initial integral steepness s in eq 5 which is used to explain the lifetime of waves less than 0 11 smallest corresponding value of ε a o k 0 0 07 are able to finish the simulation without termination lifetime of waves decreases exponentially with increasing integral steepness for s 0 11 when s is in the order of 0 20 ε 0 12 termination takes place in less than one peak period of waves chalikov 2007 4 s 0 m k 2 s k dk 1 2 on the other hand terminations of simulations due to numerical instability are also observed in hos ocean numerical instabilities cause excessive growth of surface elevation and slopes which leads to termination of simulations these terminations commonly observed for cases with high initial steepness ε 0 10 approximately corresponds to s 0 14 with the used resolution initial sea surface is controlled with varying spectral shape parameters α and γ and random initial phases shape parameters α and γ vary within the intervals of 0 001 0 020 and 1 00 7 00 respectively the incremental step size for α is chosen as 0 001 and 0 1 for γ in the corresponding intervals set of nearly 1250 different cases are compared between both models moreover to test the impact of tail length on the probability of rogue wave occurrence jonswap sea states are simulated with four different spectral tail lengths which are chosen according to the ratio of cut off frequency to the peak of the spectrum k c u t k p as 3 5 5 0 6 5 8 0 simulations with different tail lengths are carried out using only fully nonlinear cs model which corresponds to additional 3750 cases in cs model high wavenumber end of the spectral space is set as 100 times the peak wavenumber of the spectrum k e n d k p 100 a large number of modes m 2000 and the specification of the location of spectral peak provides sufficient resolution and abounding length of spectral space for simulations in cs model therefore higher wave frequency modes are considered in the simulations even though the initial spectra tails are cut at k c u t k p 5 all runs are produced up to 250000 time steps with a step size of δ τ 0 002 which corresponds approximately to 350 periods of peak waves in order to include the effect of the random initial phase at least 50 realizations are simulated for each case termination of runs due to the early breaking of waves made it challenging to obtain enough data for cases with comparably higher initial steepness extreme α a n d γ values therefore the number of realizations for highly steep cases reached up to 600 in hos ocean model the resolution is chosen as n x 2048 for the unidirectional simulations after various trials with other resolutions n x 512 1024 4096 see appendix b and k e n d k p ratios the duration of hos ocean simulations is selected as 310 t p the first ten periods are the relaxation periods so that simulations are statistically compatible with the cs model the duration is long enough to represent the slow growth of the waves with moderately small steepness t ε 2 wave periods slunyaev and kokorina 2019 and the rogue wave lifetimes sergeeva and slunyaev 2013 and slunyaev et al 2016 stated that the deep water rogue wave lifetimes in numerical simulations could reach 60 wave periods the number of realizations for hos ocean model varies between 50 and 100 depending on the steepness of the initial cases the simulation domain length is selected as 50 peak wavelengths the hos ocean simulations are compiled with varying orders of the solution between m 2 5 to investigate the impact of higher order solutions on statistics appendix b for all the other settings default configurations of the hos ocean is kept where the initial spectral cut is also at k c u t k p 5 and k e n d k p corresponds to 20 when the above settings are chosen the full dealiasing is used appendix b as suggested by ducrozet et al 2016 3 indicator parameters several mechanisms are acknowledged to be responsible for the formation of rogue waves mori et al 2011 such as local intercrossing of a large number of monochromatic waves with appropriate phases and direction kharif and pelinovsky 2003 wave and opposing current interaction peregrine 1976 modulational instability in crossing sea states onorato et al 2006a and modulational instability nevertheless physical nature and exact mechanisms causing rogue waves in real ocean have not been fully understood despite the increase in the number of studies toffoli and bitner gregersen 2011 one of the most comprehensive studies on rogue statistics in the real ocean was christou and ewans 2014 where numerous rogue wave incidents were observed from the single point measurements nevertheless no clear connection was found between the rare extreme events and sea state parameters 3 1 benjamin feir index bfi deviations from periodic waveform lead to the generation of spectral sideband which could lead to the focusing of wave energy in space and time benjamin and feir 1967 mclean 1982 zakharov 1966 1967 instability of a uniform narrowband wave train resulting in sideband modulations is an example of a nonlinear modulation which is called modulational instability or benjamin feir instability benjamin and feir 1967 introduced the stability condition of periodic wave trains to sideband modulations using the wavenumber and the amplitude of the perturbed wave train stokes waves are unstable to small amplitude long perturbations onorato et al 2005b as stoke wave becomes unstable a single wave in the middle of the group begins to grow at the expense of surrounding waves giving rise to a large amplitude wave onorato et al 2006b janssen 2003 showed that rogue waves occur when waves are sufficiently steep because nonlinear focusing may overcome the spreading of energy by linear dispersion the steepness and the spectral bandwidth which are the measures of nonlinearity and dispersion respectively are generally accepted as essential parameters in the formation of extreme events mori et al 2011 janssen 2003 named the stability criterion as the benjamin feir index b f i and showed that the modulational instability occurs when b f i 1 5 b f i ε 2 δω ω 0 a o k 0 2 δk k 0 here ε is spectral steepness that equals to a o k 0 where a o is the wave amplitude defined as a o h s 2 ω 0 and k 0 are the peak frequency and peak wavenumbers δω and δk are the frequency bandwidth and wavenumber bandwidth respectively the factor of 1 2 is introduced in the definition to satisfy the commonly used theoretical limit of b f i 1 for the stability for random wave train the theory of modulational instability benjamin and feir 1967 zakharov 1966 1967 was initially based on monochromatic wave trains real waves are neither monochromatic nor linear however the instability is still present for them where the ratio between the wave steepness and bandwidth is restricted to certain limits babanin et al 2019 it has been supported both theoretically and experimentally that if wave steepness is large enough and spectral bandwidth is sufficiently small modulational instability may also take place in random spectra onorato et al 2006b janssen 2003 showed that non resonant four wave interactions could result in nonlinear focusing of energy janssen 2003 also showed the relation between b f i and higher order cumulants such as kurtosis since then b f i has been commonly used as parametrization of modulational instability in wind seas gramstad 2017 b f i has been considered as an indicator for occurrence of extreme events since the dependence between b f i and rogue waves were shown both experimentally and numerically onorato et al 2001 2005a there are two main drawbacks of b f i utilization for wind seas firstly the active mechanisms in full spectrum are much more complex than the slow growth of new wave components as in the monochromatic cases in continuous spectrum trains the sidebands and the primary waves become indistinguishable babanin et al 2019 onorato et al 2002 chalikov 2007 disapproved the applicability of the benjamin feir instability to the finite amplitude fast wave evolution controlled by conservation of energy and strong nonlinearity chalikov 2007 showed that instability develops in two stages an initial slow process followed by a faster development the initial slow development can be represented by modulational instability perfectly for small steepness however following faster growth does not agree with the benjamin feir instability theory chalikov 2007 hence the application of b f i is also questionable for developed spectrum chalikov 2009 the second drawback is related to the qualitative definition of spectral bandwidth in the conventional approach spectral bandwidth is taken as half spectral width on half maximum of the spectrum appendix c which makes spectral bandwidth not robust especially when the noisy spectra are considered moreover this bandwidth definition is heavily criticized due to mostly focusing on peak of the spectrum and not including the tail gramstad 2017 updated the definition of spectral bandwidth in b f i to put a weight on the tail of spectrum by introducing parameter r which makes possible to adjust spectral width close to peak or base heaviness of spectral tail eq 6 the new definition shows that broader spectral bandwidth provides a better parameterization of the unstable growth rate due to modulational instability 6 b f i r ε ω p δ r here δ r is equal to r times the spectral width at r times the spectral maximum appendix c for instance r 0 5 becomes equal to the conventional bandwidth definition of half spectral width on half maximum of the spectrum gramstad 2017 suggested taking r 0 2 where the highest correlation with the maximum growth rate was observed numerically 3 2 π number b f i definition becomes ambiguous when applied to the full spectrum same b f i values may correspond to significantly different spectral shapes thus different physical conditions in 2013 ribal et al discussed the instability of homogeneous wave fields mentioned in alber 1978 and states that alber s findings are the stochastic counterpart of deterministic benjamin feir instability based on the alber equation and jonswap spectrum ribal et al 2013 suggested that instability depended on the energy scale α and peak enhancement factor γ of jonswap spectra as both parameters influence steepness of waves and γ influences spectral bandwidth dimensionless width parameter π suggested by ribal et al 2013 shows the detailed description of the ratio of wave steepness to wave bandwidth in the spectral context eq 7 hence π number can be used as instability criteria for jonswap spectrum and more generally for wind wave spectra 7 π α γ ε π is a b f i like parameter however it is different from b f i separation of parameters α and γ into total steepness and the bandwidth of waves with continuous spectrum identify physical differences between wave fields with full spectrum and quasi monochromatic wave trains ribal et al 2013 in other words π can be defined as a spectral analogue of b f i while removing the ambiguity described above in spectral environment same steepness and same bandwidth can be achieved by varying different parameters which imply different physical meanings ribal et al 2013 in ribal et al 2013 π number was introduced as the inverse of the definition given in eq 7 and jonswap spectrum is found to be stable when π number inverse of eq 7 is greater than 1 later gramstad 2017 used the inverse version of π and updated the stability condition as α γ ε 0 77 considering the cases very close to the stable region in this study the inverse definition of π is applied as it is more appropriate for comparison against the b f i stability condition by gramstad 2017 is implemented here whilst the stability limit is adjusted as α γ ε 0 54 according to steepness definition used in this study a o k 0 4 m 0 k 0 alber equation is derived from the cubic nonlinear schrodinger equation and assumes weak nonlinear and narrow banded wave spectrum this condition does not necessarily coincide with all the ocean spectra as broad banded spectra are typical in real ocean conditions rather than the narrow banded ones this condition is one of the main drawbacks of the π number application 3 3 kurtosis kurtosis is the fourth order moment of the water surface which is a measure of the peakedness of the surface distribution hatori 1984 as an indicator of the extreme sea state in wind waves the parameter is widespread among the related studies in gaussian sea states kurtosis should be equal to 3 and larger values may indicate higher wave heights and higher order effects in the sea state e g babanin and polnikov 1995 longuet higgins 1963 stated that the fourth order moment of surface elevation is related to a third order nonlinear interaction formulation of kurtosis as a function of spectral wave action density was derived by onorato et al 2005 which leads to the expression of kurtosis as a sum of three contributors pure gaussian system the contributions from free modes and bound modes similar theoretical studies also show that this parameter is related not only to wave steepness but also to spectral bandwidth fedele 2015 janssen and janssen 2019 mori et al 2011 hence excess kurtosis which is the excess part related to bound waves and dynamic nonlinear modulation can be explained as the nonlinear correction to the rayleigh distribution for maximum wave height distribution function mori et al 2011 kurtosis is not a spectral parameter hence derivation of this parameter from the spectrum requires some statistical assumptions nevertheless kurtosis can be parameterized using spectral information janssen 2009 mori and janssen 2006 kurtosis parametrization is given in eq 8 which is based on gaussian spectrum and considering the enhanced peak of the spectrum 8 κ 4 3 κ 4 b o u n d κ 4 d y n κ 4 b o u n d 9 2 ε 2 κ 4 d y n π 3 b f i 2 bound wave contribution part in eq 8 κ 4 b o u n d is estimated based on janssen 2009 which express the bound waves in terms of free waves using the zakharov equation nevertheless this definition of the bound contributor is based on narrow banded waves where the applicability of this contributor to all spectra is uncertain dynamical nonlinear contribution κ 4 d y n to sea surface kurtosis which is associated with third order interactions can be expressed using b f i mori and janssen 2006 stated that the main kurtosis contributor was the dynamic one for unidirectional waves and rogue wave occurrence probability was significantly enhanced by kurtosis increase due to four wave interactions therefore the relation between the κ 4 d y n and rogue wave occurrence probability can be related to modulational instability spectral parametrizations of kurtosis should always be considered carefully even though this study is unidirectional hatori 1984 showed that four wave nonlinear interaction might also result in negative contributor values for directional sea states therefore high order nonlinear interactions do not always correspond to kurtosis larger than 3 4 numerical simulation results 4 1 hos ocean model vs cs model here both hos ocean and cs model results are presented using dimensionless crest height the ratio of surface elevation to significant wave height η h s the rogue wave occurrence probability p r w hereafter of each case is calculated as the ratio of the number of rogue wave occurrences for all realizations over the number of waves for all realizations in figs 1 4 and 6 7 blue triangles represent cs model results while green circles represent hos ocean model with m 5 each point stands for a different parameterization controlled by shape variables α and γ of the jonswap spectrum correlation between the selected indicator parameters and p r w obtained from both numerical models are presented in fig 1 in figs 1 3 the cyan line represents rogue wave probability according to the rayleigh distribution which is same for all cases while grey hatched part represents all forristall 2000 distributions with all the different configurations the red line represents the probability of 10 3 1 rogue wave for every 1000 waves which will be referred as the high risk part in terms of rogue wave occurrence rogue wave formation is observed in almost all cases except for low steepness and extremely high steepness cases in the cs model furthermore p r w for the majority the cases exceed their corresponding forristall 2000 distributions fig 1 so that rogue waves occur more frequently than the estimates provided by second order correction for most of the cases these findings support babanin and rogers 2014 such that second order corrections to the crest distributions are not representative of the unstable unidirectional wave trains maximum normalized crest heights c r m a x h s obtained from simulations vary between 1 1 and 2 1 for cs and 1 15 to 2 60 for hos ocean the wave growth and maximum height of crest are physically limited by the wave breaking babanin 2013 babanin et al 2007 2010 the maximal possible relative crest heights using amplitude η a 0 was estimated to be approximately 3 5 babanin 2011 which corresponds to 1 75 for η h s a 0 is the half of significant wave height in case of monochromatic laboratory waves therefore upper limits of dimensionless crest height η h s obtained from both models are unrealistic this behaviour can be associated with the model s performance to simulate breaking onset it can be interpreted from the number of extra ordinary occurrences in hos ocean the breaking limiter used in hos ocean is not quite successful in terms of preventing waves from growing unrealistically high on the other hand cs model performance is found to be more successful in terms of limiting the wave height through the breaking compared to hos ocean note that c r m a x h s values presented here represent one wave out of millions in many realizations which are very likely to be resultant of numerical instability parametrization of breaking onset and breaking dissipation could prevent the occurrence of those unrealistic waves nevertheless parametrization of breaking could bring another uncertainty on results those rare occurrences do not impact the probability of occurrence distributions fig 1 or the bin averaged c r m a x h s values fig 2 col 2 in general three different trends are observed between the indicator parameters and p r w which are found to be mutual between the two models for all indicators except bound kurtosis the first trend is associated with low indicator and steepness values b f i 0 35 b f i 0 2 1 5 and π 0 2 where a rapid increase in probability levels are observed with an increase of indicator values hereby the second order distributions perform well and probabilities of rogue wave occurrence usually do not exceed 2e 4 moreover the accordance between the two models is significantly high the second trend mainly belongs to the cases with moderate steepness or low steepness but narrower bandwidths where crest distributions start to deviate from second order distribution obviously due to high order interactions probabilities obtained from both models reach and occasionally exceed 1 in 1000 waves in this part modulational instability can take place mainly due to increased steepness and also due to narrowing of spectral bandwidth in general both model results show parallel trends of p r w compared to each other however the agreement among results is not as good as in the previous part the discrepancy gets stronger with the increasing b f i and π fig 1 1st column while the cs model estimates higher probabilities than hos ocean especially for the cases with high γ values the conspicuous behaviour of the hos ocean model is that results do not significantly vary with changes of the indicator parameters while its probabilities are steady after b f i 0 35 and π 0 2 meanwhile in the cs results notable increasing and decreasing trends arise concerning changes of indicator parameters and probability whilst probability levels get less scattered in the final part which corresponds to extremely steep sea states ε 0 12 with narrow spectral bandwidth both high γ and α values different behaviour of numerical models becomes even more apparent hos ocean model follows its previous trend i e no significant changes in p r w on the other hand rogue wave occurrence decreases substantially with increasing values of indicator parameters in the cs model which can be explained by breaking of waves due to high nonlinearity some cases were not even able to run past ten peak period duration with the cs model due to early breaking similarly early terminations due to breaking onset were frequently observed in hos ocean model nevertheless for the highly nonlinear sea states breaking onset does not happen as early and as frequent as the cs model with the considered resolutions changes of maximal non dimensional crest height against indicator parameters are parallel to the changes of p r w as in fig 1 similar increasing and decreasing trends affected by the nonlinearity of the surface are also observed between maximal normalized crest heights and indicator parameters model results agree well except for the high values of indicator parameters b f i 1 0 b f i 0 2 3 5 π 0 54 κ 4 bound 0 07 and κ 4 dyn 4 fig 2 the impact of modulational instability on rogue wave formation can be indicated with the correlation observed between p r w and selected parameters moreover the stability of the jonswap spectrum in short wave modulations can also be interpreted using the spectral parameters rogue wave probabilities do not show significant variance or any behavioural difference among the different selection criteria i e b f i b f i 0 2 and π however the interdependence of kurtosis and the occurrence of extreme events slightly differ from other indicator parameters for the kurtosis parameter with only bound wave contribution figs 1 3 d rogue wave occurrence is significantly less scattered especially when it is smaller than 3 05 which is a very convenient representation of the effects of bound waves on the extreme wave occurrence nevertheless κ 4 bound gets more scattered towards extreme steepness values where higher order interactions and breaking also become effective in terms of rogue wave occurrence the dynamic contributor of kurtosis definition used here does not show good conformity with p r w the results are highly scattered fig 1e and 2e initially p r w increases with increasing κ 4 t o t a l as expected up to κ 4 t o t a l 4 nevertheless p r w showed a decreasing trend with increasing kurtosis κ 4 t o t a l 4 this condition arises due to consideration of single kurtosis value calculated from initial spectra for a simulation of 300 t p no time dependent kurtosis change is considered here this is a common issue for all considered indicator parameters hence it is more apparent for the kurtosis parametrization used here this condition does not interpret the fact that free wave modulation is not correlated with rogue wave occurrence but only shows that the κ 4 d y n parametrization and the way it is considered here does not appropriate to represents p r w the reduction of p r w is also a result of high order effects which leads waves to become more prone to breaking and that limits the wave growth even though p r w decreases for large values of κ 4 t o t a l the formation of rogue waves due to modulational instability is still commonly observed kurtosis is known to be a very good indicator for rogue wave occurrence however the findings indicate that κ 4 t o t a l considered here is not a reliable predictor to estimate p r w for fast evolving highly nonlinear sea states the effects of steepness and bandwidth on p r w are also investigated separately in fig 3 steepness behaviour fig 3 2a is found to be highly similar to the b f i and π indicators meaning that the steepness dominates the behaviour of the indicators bandwidth appears to be more subsidiary parameter in definition even though narrowing of the spectral bandwidth also enhances the p r w one of the aims of this study is to define practical threshold values for criteria for rogue wave occurrence both b f i s b f i 1 0 janssen 2003 and π s π 0 54 gramstad 2017 ribal et al 2013 theoretical stability limits for modulational instability do not show full conformity with the p r w obtained from both models nevertheless those theoretical limits are associated with modulational instability and not the rogue wave occurrence rogue wave formation can take place due to different mechanisms and modulational instability does not always lead to rogue wave occurrence therefore the connection between indicator parameters and p r w is not straightforward defining a strict threshold value of any indicator to point out significant p r w would not be precise this argument can be supported with the numerical model results here showing that no strict threshold value can be determined for any indicator parameters fig 1 however the probability of the occurrence of rogue waves significantly decreases when b f i 0 35 and π 0 2 the stability limit calculated from alber equation for π 0 54 or π 0 77 with steepness definition as given in gramstad 2017 appears to be too strict which is implied in gramstad 2017 as well the similar implication is also true for commonly used stability limit of b f i 1 in fig 4 four different cases are selected for further representation of the performance of second order crest distribution functions and the impact of breaking on crest distribution for highly nonlinear cases plot i represents the general behaviour of cases with very low steepness b f i and π values here tayfun 1980 and forristall 2000 distributions provide a good estimation to model data which are also located close to rayleigh distribution due to low steepness deviations from the second order distributions become significant for plots ii and iii of fig 4 which indicates the effect of higher order nonlinearity the extreme wave statistics of long crested waves are underestimated by one order of magnitude compared to second order corrections for plots ii and iii this difference is due to disregarded high order effects onorato et al 2009 in plot iv the effect of high nonlinearity and breaking on the existence of extreme waves can be observed both models deviate from the given distributions in fig 4 up to η h s 1 0 however this deviation attenuates in the cs model due to the waves reaching breaking onset the cs distribution curve falls towards forristall 2000 and tayfun 1980 distribution and gets very close to second order guesses here p r w approximately coincides to 1e 4 for the cs model on the other hand deviation from the second order is still present for hos ocean model p r w values are usually 4 5 times higher than second order guesses such a deviation is found to be unrealistic when simulation results are compared to the laboratory results of onorato et al 2009 for the nonlinear jonswap sea states a decrease in the deviation from the second order distributions was observed experimentally for unidirectional waves in onorato et al 2009 numerically in socquet juglard et al 2005 this behaviour can be associated with the effect of high order interactions on spectral evolution in high steepness sea states it is known that third order resonant interactions can be responsible for local and rapid spectral changes which affect the crest height statistics gibson and swan 2007 finally for the better understanding of the stability of the jonswap spectrum the difference caused due to different models and practical use of simulation results in terms of the jonswap shape parameters p r w are also presented on α γ planes fig 5 modulational instability curves of jonswap spectra were calculated by onorato et al 2003 and gramstad 2017 based on different approaches and solvers marginal stability limits are presented in α γ plane of our probability results fig 5 stability limit of onorato et al 2003 is found to be more conservative compared to gramstad 2017 stability limits π 0 54 line on α γ plane even though obtained results shows resemblance probability levels do not show full compatibility with stability levels high levels of p r w are also observed in fig 5 before reaching to the stability limits in simulations the initial location of the peak wave number is always constant meaning that the spectral bandwidth is only affected by the changes in γ while steepness is affected by the changes in both α and γ as shown in our results figs 4 5 increase in γ enhances rogue wave occurrence probability as expected meanwhile the steepness is more sensitive to changes in α which initiates breaking after certain values therefore low rogue wave occurrence is observed for high values of α α 0 13 the difference in models responses can also be observed from α γ planes fig 5 hos ocean has shown a homogeneous distribution of p r w which is in accordance with the unvarying trend observed for p r w vs indicator parameters in fig 1 meanwhile an apparent increase and decrease trends of p r w with increasing α γ can be seen from the top plot of fig 5 4 2 effect of tail length b f i for continuous spectra is introduced by analogy i e janssen 2003 onorato et al 2001 where the choice of the bandwidth is flexible and does not have strict analytical constraints usually some property of the spectrum peak width is employed for this purpose therefore bandwidth definition is heavily related to the spectral peak however gramstad 2017 showed that wider spectral bandwidth up to a certain width represents the unstable growth rate better than the standard half width at half maximum bandwidth definition therefore information on the tail of the spectrum is also crucial for the investigation of the stability of the sea state in this part the impact of tail length of jonswap spectrum on p r w and its correlation with indicator parameters b f i b f i r and π are examined using the only the fully nonlinear cs model highly similar trends with small discrepancies are observed among the selected indicators fig 6 although the differences are mostly indistinguishable among cases with different tail lengths it is clear that cases associated with higher rogue wave probabilities are the ones with the shortest tail green dots this result contradicts with our initial assumptions that the presence of high frequency modes in spectra is expected to contribute to rogue wave occurrence however adverse effect of increasing tail length on rogue wave probability is observed regardless of the indicator parameter this adverse behaviour between p r w and nonlinearity might be better understood with the relationship between initial spectral steepness ε and p r w histogram plots of steepness bin width of 0 005 and corresponding average rogue wave probabilities for each tail lengths are given in fig 7 the common behaviour observed for all tail lengths is that average p r w increases with increasing steepness until reaching its maximum turning point p r w demonstrates a decreasing trend with a further increase of steepness where high nonlinearity causes waves to reach breaking onset earlier nonlinearity works in a paradoxical way chalikov 2009 that either it can enhance p r w by increasing the wave wave interactions before turning point or it works as a limiting factor to the wave growth which would eventually result in a decrease of p r w after turning point the main difference among varying tail lengths stands out as the location of this turning point kirezci and babanin 2019 p r w values of the longest tailed spectra are observed to start decreasing at a smaller steepness fig 7 similar to the indicator parameters fig 6 the following decrease in p r w is observed for the spectra with the relatively shorter tail until finally the shortest tail reaches its turning point figs 6 7 in simulations this behaviour corresponds to longer survival time for the spectra with the shortest tail before breaking this argument is also related to the higher probabilities of rogue wave occurrence discrepancies among probability levels due to different tail lengths become more distinct at higher steepness after ε 0 11 it is stated by christou et al 2008 that increase in nonlinearity results in an increase in high frequency amplitudes moreover chalikov and babanin 2012 showed that short waves were effective on breaking when unidirectional full spectrum was considered here simulation results with various tail lengths also validate the presence of high frequency mode contribution to wave breaking furthermore the same mechanism also affects extreme wave statistics by decreasing rogue wave probabilities in the absence of wave breaking integral steepness s 0 11 high frequency modes contribute to the rogue wave occurrence probability therefore spectra with a longer tail resulted in higher p r w nevertheless rogue wave probability for non breaking cases simulation without termination is not as significant as cases with breaking altering the tail lengths resulted in the same rogue wave occurrence probabilities for ε 0 1 highlighting the ineffectiveness of the tail lengths for around this particular steepness value as this range of steepness values are widespread in real sea states our results here are presumably a suitable indicator in practical applications kirezci and babanin 2019 the impact of the tail length can also be easily identified from scatter probability plots fig 8 which are biased towards the shorter tail the probabilities become more scattered in fig 8 iii which shows the comparison of the longest and the shortest tailed cases breaking and freaking processes can be both initiated by modulational instability and are strongly affected by the initial steepness probability distribution on α γ planes and related two stability limits onorato et al 2003 gramstad 2017 were investigated for a variety of tail lengths fig 9 although stability limits do not show full conformity with our simulation results here we find that the stability limit is better represented by onorato et al 2003 regardless of the tail length the tail length has a greater impact on cases with γ 5 00 and 0 005 α 0 010 where spectra with longer tails are already significantly altered by breaking 5 conclusion rogue wave formation is dependent on two opposing processes those which make the waves higher and those which limit the wave height for stationary conditions i e wind input is balanced by dissipation at the time scales of interest the growth of waves can either be due to linear or nonlinear wave superpositions or due to instabilities within the wave system meanwhile the limiting factors of wave heights are wave breaking and nonlinear wave wave interactions leads to early breaking note that we do not consider wind forcing where the dynamics balance of source terms where evolution of wave fields are different which is beyond the scope of this study steepness and bandwidth stand out as two controlling parameters in rogue wave formation it has been found that spectral bandwidth in combination with the steepness further instigates or limit the modulational instability conditions nevertheless no prominent effect of spectral bandwidth on p r w is observed from a statistical point of view note that the findings here are limited to unidirectional jonswap spectrum hence the impact of spectral bandwidth on more complex bi model or directional spectrum would differ from the unidirectional spectra on the other hand nonlinearity defined by wave steepness is found to be the dominant spectral feature on rogue wave occurrence probability due to its relation to various physical processes active in sea states i e both to modulational instability and superposition in stable wind fields and the breaking rogue wave occurrence increases with enhanced nonlinearity until it is restricted again by very high nonlinearity gramstad and bitner gregersen 2019 also stated that steepness is a key parameter for the estimation of extreme sea states after examining the relation between spectral parameters h s t p steepness bandwidth and kurtosis similar conclusions can also be drawn from the tail length differences the effect of tail length on rogue wave occurrence is also found to be relevant with the nonlinearity of the total wave field in cases with respectively lower steepness no breaking a longer tail contributes to the freaking process nonetheless when breaking is present high nonlinearity cases with shorter tail results in higher rogue wave occurrence this study offers one of the most extensive statistical application for the rogue wave occurrence probability sea surfaces of nearly 1250 different jonswap spectrum with steepness ranging from 0 03 to 0 20 are investigated with two different phase resolving models and many realizations our results highlight that after certain steepness limits are reached increased nonlinear interactions are more prone to take part in breaking process than freaking process this phenomenon was explained by chalikov 2009 as for high steepness nonlinearity works opposite to what is expected since in highly nonlinear fields wave wave interactions lead to the breaking faster than cases with low steepness in other words very energetic wave wave interactions extremely nonlinear sea states devastate the growth of waves before they reach larger wave heights chalikov 2009 rogue wave occurrence also increases with increased nonlinearity instability until it is restricted again by very high nonlinearity it is observed here that modulational instability results in either freaking or breaking of waves babanin et al 2011 however the fate of waves in modulational instability is highly dependent on the spectral steepness in the one dimensional simulation rogue wave occurrence is found to be greater than 1 over 1000 waves when 0 3 π 0 55 0 9 b f i 1 4 and 3 0 b f i 0 2 5 0 those intervals can be interpreted as high risk sea states along with consideration of the h s of the sea states moreover according to α γ planes high risk sea states are more concentrated where γ 5 0 and 0 005 α 0 015 even though p r w affected by the high frequency modes dangerous sea states can still be defined as the same regardless of tail length the various jonswap spectra considered in this study are shown to be unstable for high α and γ parameters jonswap stability curve suggested by onorato et al 2003 which is based on theoretical results from a wigner approach on the nls equations has shown a better correlation with our p r w statistics it is initially expected that application of b f i 0 2 could be better representing maximum unstable growth rate as given in gramstad 2017 nevertheless in terms of rogue wave occurrence probability no practical advantage over conventional b f i is observed as given in fig 6 the behaviours of b f i 0 2 and b f i are almost identical the model performances are also evaluated under different conditions during low and moderate values of indicator parameters models show high conformity and no significant differences arise between hos ocean and cs models obtained results are also consistent with the theoretical and experimental findings nevertheless for high values of indicator parameters and highly nonlinear cases fully nonlinear scheme of the cs model is found to more reliable with its exact solution and realistic results figs 1 4 this discrepancy in performance between models can be due to differences in consideration of high frequency modes and the breaking onset consequently these factors significantly affect the rogue wave occurrence probability it should be noted that differences in the applied numerical methods such as dealising technique used in hos ocean also impacts the results and causes discrepancies between models the computational cost of hos ocean is less than the cs model when m 3 but computational demand exceeds cs when m 5 even so both models are appropriate for operational usage for unidirectional cases due to their low computational demand another remark can be made on the breaking of rogue waves it has been stated before that nonlinear focusing either goes in freaking or breaking process however this does not mean that all rogue waves also end up breaking it has been observed that on the contrary most of the extreme cases continue evolving and result in shrinking in height to become medium or small size waves the same observation was also made by chalikov 2009 with a different initial setup lastly it should be noted that the present study is restricted to unidirectional waves while realistic ocean waves are directional directionality has a significant effect on both the modulational instability onorato et al 2009 and the limiting steepness of the breaking wave toffoli et al 2010 moreover there are other mechanisms involved in rogue wave occurrence such as crossing sea states under such conditions onset and breaking mechanism are also found to be affected by crossing mcallister et al 2018 hence probability levels presented here would be significantly different if the directional properties were considered nevertheless the main purpose of this study is to test the indicators using both fully nonlinear numerical and hosm scheme the unidirectional approach considered here contributes to the understanding of the rogue wave occurrence probability hence findings here could be beneficial for the future attempts on forecasting of rogue waves meanwhile the operational application is challenging for directional cases due to significant growth of computational demand of phase resolving models either fully nonlinear or hosm credit authorship contribution statement cagil kirezci conceptualization

20747,archimedes screw turbines asts can become a popular device to generate electricity from hydraulic power at very low head or nearly zero head places in this article the performance of asts is numerically investigated using computational fluid dynamics cfd to assess different screw rotation speeds volume flow rates and inclination angles the numerical model is validated using experimental data showing that the results computed using 5 million mesh cells lead to a relative error of 0 69 for a volume flow rate of 1 13 l s a rotation speed of 10 rad s and an inclination angle of 24 9ᵒ simulations are used to assess how mechanical torque and efficiency change with volume flow rate and inclination angle based on the results cfd is a reliable tool for ast behavior study predicting its performance and visualizing pressure and velocity fields keywords ast efficiency power generation simulation 1 introduction fossil fuel limitations and sustainability concerns require a change in the way that energy is created and used different kinds of renewable energy resources exist worldwide such as solar wind geothermal and hydropower accounting for 22 8 of global electricity production lavrič et al 2018 du et al 2017 khan et al 2015 tasdemiroglu 1993 although large scale hydropower opportunities have already been exhausted issac and markose 2018 hydropower plants are a primary renewable energy resource there is strong potential for small scale hydropower production in small rivers irrigation systems drinking water networks wastewater networks cooling systems etc many countries have recently started installing small scale hydropower plants as reported in lashofer et al 2012 however their production is only 3 4 of the total required energy ren21 and renewables 2013 i e a tiny fraction of existing potential there are different types of small scale water turbines e g ast kaplan and francis this article focuses on asts which have traditionally been used for pumping water from a lower level to a higher one or conveying water in horizontal or inclined planes kozyn et al 2015 besides being environmentally and fish friendly structures for power generation with simple installation and low civil works lisdiyanti et al 2012 a comparison between an ast and a kaplan turbine for small scale hydropower generation showed that asts produce more energy 15 with lower cost 10 ren21 and renewables 2013 likewise asts can be used in combination with other power sources such as the sun as investigated in shahverdi et al 2019 different theoretical models have been developed to design and optimize its performance based on ast geometry and flow conditions and some of them have been calibrated using real data part of these models focuses on asts working as pumps for example rorres derived relationships for water levels flow rates and leakages as a function of inner radius and pitch with optimization purposes rorres 2000 also the effect of water levels within the upper and lower basins and screw rotation were investigated and validated using a laboratory scale screw pump in lyons et al 2020 many different models have also been developed for its use as a turbine based on various assumptions for instance a two dimensional simplified theoretical model of an ast with hydrostatic pressure assumption was introduced in müller and senior 2009 without considering losses in the screw system in lubitz et al 2014 a frictionless prediction model of ast ignoring the effect of the inlet and outlet of the screw was proposed and assessed using experiments this model was enhanced by kozyn and lubitz in kozyn and lubitz 2017 who developed a complete theoretical model of power losses to predict efficiency based on the hydrostatic pressure analysis ast s theoretical numerical model was developed and programmed with matlab in shahverdi et al 2020 to replace a drop structure with an ast in a simulated irrigation canal the resulting ast was designed to minimize civil changes on the canal resulting in maximum efficiency of 90 83 for a 1 bladed screw and inclination angle 20ᵒ another remarkable work was performed by dellinger et al in dellinger et al 2016a they developed a theoretical model in which screw performance was investigated as a function of its geometry and flow the flow leakage friction and outlet submersion losses were all included and the fill factor was variable they installed a laboratory scale experimental device and conducted some experiments showing a good agreement between the theoretical model and empirical results for the torque and efficiency in addition to theoretical models studies based on computational fluid dynamics cfd have also been considered for example the performance of a non uniform archimedean spiral rotor was numerically investigated for different values of volume flow rates and rotation speeds in schleicher et al 2014 finding a maximum efficiency of 72 stergiopoulou and kalkani 2015 studied screw performance with horizontal vertical and inclined axes using the flow3d cfd software in stergiopoulou and kalkani 2015 but did not present any performance evaluation of the screw dellinger et al 2018 also investigated screw performance with the openfoam cfd software using different flow conditions and screw rotation speeds reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the k ω sst model were used the volume of fluid vof method was also employed to determine the position of the free surface of the water obtaining a maximum efficiency of 80 however they concluded that more studies for different inclination angles and flow conditions should be done cfd tools have also helped to study the influence of the inclination angle and blade numbers for instance different inclination angles 10 38ᵒ and blade numbers 3 4 and 5 were investigated in dellinger et al 2019 using openfoam the optimal inclination angles were found 15 5ᵒ 20ᵒ and 24 5ᵒ for 3 4 and 5 bladed screws respectively also screw efficiency was augmented with increasing blade numbers the highest efficiency obtained was 87 for 4 and 5 bladed screws the maximum relative error in efficiency between numerical and experimental results was 2 in maulana et al 2018 ast s performance with different blade numbers 1 4 at a flow rate of 2 m3 s and a head of 1 m was numerically investigated using fluent it was found that 2 bladed screws lead to more stability in pressure distribution in khan et al 2019 archimedean screw turbines performance with 1 10 blades was investigated for a specific site at shadra islamabad pakistan using ansys the obtained efficiencies ranged between 75 and 87 showing the maximum efficiency for the 5 bladed screw some works have also studied the specific topic of electricity generation dedić jandrek and nižetić experimentally evaluated a small scale ast for power generation in varying parameters such as inclination angle flow rate and rotation speed dedić jandrek and nižetić 2019 they found that the maximum efficiency was 64 with an inclination angle of 21ᵒ and a flow rate of 10 l s in durrani et al 2019 an ast was designed and simulated for a sewage water location and finally was implemented in practice the performance of a ductless archimedes screw that exploits kinetic energy rather than potential one in both aligned and inclined configurations was numerically and experimentally investigated in zitti et al 2020 the archimedes screw turbine was used as a hydrokinetic turbine inclining the blades slightly toward the inflow fluent software was used for simulations and comparative results with other hydrokinetic turbines were reported although the use of asts to generate electricity is growing there are still few studies examining its performance and authors agree that it is necessary to keep studying ast to obtain technical knowledge and guidance design model based designs are more efficient in terms of cost and time if accurate numerical models are available since cfd simulations of asts are relatively scarce this research demonstrates the first steps in the development of a cfd model to this end a cfd fluent model of an ast was provided to assess its performance and pressure and velocity fields under different rotation speeds inclination angles and flow conditions in particular a numerical model of ast based on three dimensional navier stokes equations with the k ω sst turbulence model in fluent is provided and validated using experimental data 2 material and methods the main goal of the current research was the cfd simulation of an ast for power generation parameters such as volume flow rate q screw inclination angle β and screw rotation speed ω were considered 2 1 ast components asts are located in places with low heads and moderate flow rates for converting hydraulic power into mechanical power a generator coupled to the screw converts the mechanical energy into electricity locations with 1 m 6 5 m head and 200 l s to 6500 l s volume flow rate are the most common for ast installation issac and markose 2018 loots et al 2015 although flow rates up to 14 5 m3 s have been reported at linton lock in york uk yoosefdoost and lubitz 2020 as shown in fig 1 water from the upper reservoir comes into the inlet of the screw and exits through the lower reservoir s outlet the water moves down along the screw entrapped between adjacent screw blades comprising discrete volumes namely water buckets the water level difference between the proceeding and leading helical plane of each blade creates a pressure force that generates a torque making the screw to be rotated the hydraulic and mechanical parameters of this system can be used for computing the ast power and efficiency the central core is a screw which rotates freely inside a fixed trough to avoid friction therefore there is a gap width g w between the blades and trough which causes a gap leakage g l the main environmental parameters are the head h the volume flow rate through the screw q and the screw rotation speed ω the screw geometry is defined by its outer diameter d o inner diameter d i screw pitch s total length l blade number n and screw inclination angle β fig 1 2 2 power calculation in an ast system the available hydraulic power of water p h y d with specific weight γ could be calculated using the volume flow rate and head with equation 1 as the screw rotates due to the exerted hydrostatic pressure a torque t is generated mechanical power p m e c h is equal to the torque multiplied by the rotation speed as given by equation 2 1 p h y d γ q h 2 p m e c h ω t mechanical efficiency η is the ratio of mechanical power to hydraulic power defined as 3 η p m e c h p h y d ω t γ q h due to the complex interaction between the screw and the water flow the utilization of cfd is inevitable having q and h values one could use a cfd software to calculate the torque generated for the considered rotation speed the software fluent 15 0 4 ansys inc canonsburg 2013 was used to this end compared to the experimental study cfd reduces the cost and time and shows velocity and pressure fields 2 3 ast governing equations flow through an ast has two phases namely water and air the physical properties of a fluid and its motion within an ast which is mostly unsteady and turbulent are described with non linear transient second order partial differential equations that can be numerically solved using cfd in particular cfd is a method of simulating a flow process in which standard flow equations the navier stokes and continuity equations are discretized and solved for each computational mesh cell the flow in an ast could be solved by the well known continuity and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations dellinger et al 2019 i e 4 u 0 5 u t u u p ν ν t u the rans equations are solved using cfd software with an accuracy similar to the experimental laboratory setup according to dellinger et al 2018 one of the most common turbulence models is a k ω k omega model with the type of sst shear stress transport it takes k ε in the free stream and k ω in domains near the wall with low reynolds numbers this model was selected in this research because it has widely been used in literature e g zitti et al 2020 dellinger et al 2018 and simmons 2018a spatial discretization of momentum and turbulent kinetic energy were made using second order upwind and first order upwind methods also the transient formulation was made using the first order implicit method the solver was selected as a pressure based solver so that the volume of fluid vof method was employed multiphase flows can numerically be calculated using the euler euler approach the vof method is a type of the euler euler approach in which a surface tracking technique is used if there are two immiscible fluids like water and air where the interface position is important in the vof method a volume fraction α indicating the phase type is defined for each mesh cell representing the ratio of water volume to the total volume of the cell in particular the cell contains air if α 0 and is full of water if α 1 there is a free surface inside the cell if α becomes between 0 and 1 in a two phase flow problem the density ρ and viscosity μ of the fluid within the solution domain calculated using the vof method defined as versteeg and malalasekera 2007 6 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r 7 μ α μ w a t e r 1 α μ a i r the solution method was pressure velocity coupling with a coupled scheme also the initialization method for simulations was hybrid with averaged turbulent parameters the screw mesh generated using ansys meshing tool was defined as a moving mesh with a constant screw speed in each simulation the screw rotation was around its longitudinal axis and special attention was paid to the screw surface and gap region by refining the mesh see fig 2 in particular the maximum and minimum size of mesh cells were 1 87 10 2 and 10 4 respectively finding a maximum dimensionless wall distance of 4 2 y 5 was suggested in andersson et al 2011 for the k ω sst type turbulence model 2 4 providing the model inputs the experimental setup of lubitz et al 2014 was used in our simulation model in particular the geometrical values were employed to validate the numerical model and assess the results in the experiments the upper reservoir was supplied by a pump whereas the lower reservoir had a controllable depth the torque was measured using a load cell more details on the experimental device can be found in lubitz et al 2014 the specification of the screw is given in table 1 three inclination angles 20 24 9 and 30 two volume flow rates 1 13 and 1 5 l s and three rotation speeds 5 10 and 15 rad s have been considered to investigate the performance of the screw in this research it should be noticed that all rotation speeds considered here were investigated in the experiments with an inclination of 24 9 and the volume flow rate of 1 13 l s also inclination angles were chosen based on common values used in the literature dellinger et al 2018 the combinations of the investigated parameter values are given in table 2 as can be seen 18 different simulations were performed 2 5 boundary and initial conditions water at a temperature of 20 ᵒc density of 1000 kg m3 and kinematic viscosity of 10 6 m 2 s 1 were used in this research the material of the screw trough and reservoirs was considered as smooth steel since the upper and lower reservoirs in this study are open channels a pressure boundary condition was defined at the lower pool which had a rectangular weir at the downstream end controlling its water level a specific flow boundary condition was determined at the upper reservoir the canal sides and beds were defined as a wall boundary condition in all simulations a constant prescribed rotation speed for the screw was defined and the corresponding torque was simulated to reduce the computational burden the upper and lower reservoirs were reduced to the trough width 2 6 convergence criteria regarding the convergence of the numerical model three criteria were imposed i the difference between the two successive values of the averaged torques must become less than 1 ii the normalized residuals of pressure and velocity less than 10 5 and iii flow entering the screw should be equal to the flow exiting a maximum simulation time step of 3 7 10 3 s was used in the simulations and the convergence time total simulation time was variable according to the parameters affecting the screw performance for example the convergence of mechanical power for 5 million mesh cells during the simulation time is shown in fig 3 note that similar fluctuations of power during the time is reported in the literature e g zitti et al 2020 finally courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition was held regarding the time step and the optimum mesh cell size in all simulations note that for the pressure based solver with vof model used in this research the courant number s maximum default value is 200 and was reduced below 5 to make the solution more stable according to the imposed criteria 2 7 validation to validate the model the experimental results obtained by lubitz et al were used lubitz et al 2014 to this end the numerical model parameter values were taken from the experimental setup four values of mesh cells were selected to be investigated to reduce the computation burden in this regard note that testing a larger number of mesh cells is too time consuming due to the complex geometry of ast and the gap existing between screw and trough considering the experimental data the rotation speed of 10 rad s is the optimum one hence finding the best mesh cell values was made for this rotation speed with its corresponding experimental torque and mechanical power of 0 2187 n m and 2 187 w respectively the numerical and experimental results for mechanical power for a number of mesh cells ranging between 2 and 6 5 millions are given in table 3 as shown in table 3 the numerical mechanical power value for the cell number of 5 and 6 5 million is 2 178 w and 2 183 w respectively one can see that an increasing in number of cells from 5 to 6 5 million caused the numerical mechanical power to be increased from 2 178 w to 2 183 w improving the relative error by 0 41 since 5 million mesh cells provide a relative error of 0 69 which is lower than 1 this value was preferred to minimize computation burden and simulation time relative errors below 1 were used and reported in dellinger et al 2016a and dellinger et al 2019 for the rotation speed of 15 rad s in this research a relative error of 8 7 was obtained as rotation speed increases the numerical model overestimates the mechanical power because some power losses are not included such as the inlet and outlet ones indeed up to 8 97 overprediction was reported in simmons 2018b finally note that the relative error is calculated as the difference between the numerical mechanical power and the corresponding experimental power dividing by the latter 3 results and discussion 3 1 analyzing parameters variations all of the results given and discussed hereafter correspond to the optimum number of mesh cells 5 million variations of mechanical power vs screw rotation speed for different inclination angles and for the flow rates 1 13 l s and 1 5 l s are shown in fig 4 a and b as previously mentioned the rotation speed of 10 rad s is optimal this value is lower than the muysken limit muysken 1932 which becomes 18 8 rad s for the screw considered and can be calculated as 8 ω m 50 d 0 2 3 where d 0 is the external diameter of the screw in meters as shown in the figure the mechanical power increases with increasing the rotation speed until the optimal rotation speed after that it decreases with increasing the rotation speed this behavior was shown for the two considered flows in asts hydrostatic pressure creates the torque and consequently is the source of mechanical power in the optimal rotation speed water depth is at the top point of the screw s inner diameter resulting in maximum mechanical power increasing water depth and overflowing from the top point of the inner diameter in a specific rotation speed causes an overflow leakage reducing efficiency for lower rotation speeds i e non optimal water overflows from the top point reducing mechanical power likewise water depth is decreased for higher rotation speeds and hydrostatic pressure is reduced note that the water surface profile within each individual bucket is assumed to be similar therefore the total net pressure created corresponds to each individual bucket s contribution similar behaviors have been reported in the literature lubitz et al 2014 kozyn and lubitz 2017 for a specific rotation speed mechanical power increases with the inclination angle the highest mechanical power was found for 30ᵒ because the net water pressure i e water level difference between upstream and downstream of the blades which is equal to 20 cm exerted to the blades was the highest at this inclination angle in the same conditions similar flow rate and rotation speed pressure and torque increase with the net water level difference generating more mechanical power however too much increase in the inclination angle leads to overfilling and power loss that reduces mechanical power as shown in dellinger et al 2019 where it can be seen that the inclination angle of 33ᵒ is the optimal one efficiency variation vs screw rotation speed is shown in fig 5 a and b for the flow rates considered as shown efficiency increases with increasing rotation speed for all inclination angles the efficiency curves are bell shaped as usual although the full shape of the bell for the curve related to the inclination angle of 20ᵒ and flow rate of 1 13 l s could be seen if the rotation speed axis starts from zero rather than five note that overflow leakage occurs at lower rotation speeds reducing efficiency and at higher rotation speeds the efficiency decreases due to friction losses arising on the blades the power loss due to friction on the blades is proportional to the cube of the screw rotation kozyn and lubitz 2017 i e p l f r i c t i o n ω 3 one reason that why the efficiency at the inclination angle of 20ᵒ is greater could be described as follows according to equation 3 the efficiency of an ast rotating with hydrostatic pressure and constant rotation speed flow rate and geometry depends on the geodetic head h the geodetic head decreases with the inclination angle causing the efficiency to be increased see fig 6 in other words since the same screw having the same geometry including length is used for each inclination angle the head of the hydraulic power decreases as the inclination angle decreases and the efficiency therefore increases according to fig 5 maximum efficiencies were 80 and 83 in the inclination angle of 24 9ᵒ for q 1 13 l s and q 1 5 l s in the optimal rotation speed therefore the inclination angle of 24 9ᵒ is considered as the optimal one note that a 30 increase in flow rate leads only a 3 increase in the efficiency which is consistent with dellinger et al 2016b where it was found that an ast could keep the efficiency nearly constant around the optimal efficiency for a flow rate variation of 20 around the optimum flow the relationship between the torque and rotation speed of the screw for different discharge values is depicted in fig 7 as can be seen the generated torque decreases as the rotation speed increases likewise for any specific rotation speed the generated torque increases with flow rate thus reducing rotation speed 3 2 investigating velocity and pressure fields unlike experimental research the velocity and pressure field could be studied using cfd the 3d pressure distributions are illustrated in fig 8 for q 1 13 l s β 30 and ω 10 r a d s as expected the pressure becomes zero at the water surface and is distributed nearly linearly from the surface to the bottom note that the pressure distribution in all buckets is equal because the water level difference between upstream and downstream of each blade is nearly constant as reported in lubitz et al 2014 kozyn and lubitz 2017 thus the mechanical power predicted for a single bucket could generally be multiplied by the number of buckets to calculate the total mechanical power generated simmons 2018b although the overflow in this case is to some extent small so that it could be ignored it shows the accuracy of our numerical model in calculating related parameters and visualizing the complex flow occurring within the screw as the flow becomes high enough for a given screw rotation speed more overflow can occur fig 9 shows water velocity distribution for q 1 13 l s β 30 and ω 10 r a d s as can be seen the velocity ranges between 0 and 1 5 m s being high near the trough and at the point where the water exits in this figure the arrow shows the high flow velocity on the trough that corresponds to the gap leakage which becomes a major source of power loss to illustrate the effect of pressure and velocity the numerical model results for the two parameters on a vertical plane along the screw axis passing the center of the screw a transect parallel to the screw axis located in the gap region between blades and trough is provided in fig 10 in this figure the free water surface is horizontal within each bucket and water depth increases along the screw due to its inclination water depth suddenly decreases with a sharp gradient as it reaches the gap region the velocity decreases as pressure increases along with a bucket for a given flow rate at the gap region water velocity suddenly increases due to a high water surface difference d h at the upstream and downstream of one blade which can also theoretically be calculated with the torricelli equation i e v t 2 g d h this result is consistent with the three dimensional plots previously shown the created pressure gradient causes the screw to be rotated 4 conclusions this research examined the performance of asts using fluent to this end a three dimensional numerical model using a k ω sst reynolds averaged navier stokes model has been provided and validated using experimental data then the effect of different rotation speeds inclination angles and flow conditions on power output and efficiency were assessed the optimal number of mesh cells was 5 million which generated a relative error of less than 1 0 69 for a rotation speed of 10 rad s a volume flow rate of 1 13 l s and an inclination angle of 24 9ᵒ however the numerical model overpredicts mechanical power as screw rotation speed increases because some power losses are not considered the maximum mechanical power output was obtained for the rotation speed of 10 rad s in particular the mechanical power increased with the screw rotation from 5 rad s to 10 rad s and then decreased for rotation speeds between 10 rad s and 15 rad s power losses due to overfilling and friction explain this reduction for rotation speeds different than the optimum

20747,archimedes screw turbines asts can become a popular device to generate electricity from hydraulic power at very low head or nearly zero head places in this article the performance of asts is numerically investigated using computational fluid dynamics cfd to assess different screw rotation speeds volume flow rates and inclination angles the numerical model is validated using experimental data showing that the results computed using 5 million mesh cells lead to a relative error of 0 69 for a volume flow rate of 1 13 l s a rotation speed of 10 rad s and an inclination angle of 24 9ᵒ simulations are used to assess how mechanical torque and efficiency change with volume flow rate and inclination angle based on the results cfd is a reliable tool for ast behavior study predicting its performance and visualizing pressure and velocity fields keywords ast efficiency power generation simulation 1 introduction fossil fuel limitations and sustainability concerns require a change in the way that energy is created and used different kinds of renewable energy resources exist worldwide such as solar wind geothermal and hydropower accounting for 22 8 of global electricity production lavrič et al 2018 du et al 2017 khan et al 2015 tasdemiroglu 1993 although large scale hydropower opportunities have already been exhausted issac and markose 2018 hydropower plants are a primary renewable energy resource there is strong potential for small scale hydropower production in small rivers irrigation systems drinking water networks wastewater networks cooling systems etc many countries have recently started installing small scale hydropower plants as reported in lashofer et al 2012 however their production is only 3 4 of the total required energy ren21 and renewables 2013 i e a tiny fraction of existing potential there are different types of small scale water turbines e g ast kaplan and francis this article focuses on asts which have traditionally been used for pumping water from a lower level to a higher one or conveying water in horizontal or inclined planes kozyn et al 2015 besides being environmentally and fish friendly structures for power generation with simple installation and low civil works lisdiyanti et al 2012 a comparison between an ast and a kaplan turbine for small scale hydropower generation showed that asts produce more energy 15 with lower cost 10 ren21 and renewables 2013 likewise asts can be used in combination with other power sources such as the sun as investigated in shahverdi et al 2019 different theoretical models have been developed to design and optimize its performance based on ast geometry and flow conditions and some of them have been calibrated using real data part of these models focuses on asts working as pumps for example rorres derived relationships for water levels flow rates and leakages as a function of inner radius and pitch with optimization purposes rorres 2000 also the effect of water levels within the upper and lower basins and screw rotation were investigated and validated using a laboratory scale screw pump in lyons et al 2020 many different models have also been developed for its use as a turbine based on various assumptions for instance a two dimensional simplified theoretical model of an ast with hydrostatic pressure assumption was introduced in müller and senior 2009 without considering losses in the screw system in lubitz et al 2014 a frictionless prediction model of ast ignoring the effect of the inlet and outlet of the screw was proposed and assessed using experiments this model was enhanced by kozyn and lubitz in kozyn and lubitz 2017 who developed a complete theoretical model of power losses to predict efficiency based on the hydrostatic pressure analysis ast s theoretical numerical model was developed and programmed with matlab in shahverdi et al 2020 to replace a drop structure with an ast in a simulated irrigation canal the resulting ast was designed to minimize civil changes on the canal resulting in maximum efficiency of 90 83 for a 1 bladed screw and inclination angle 20ᵒ another remarkable work was performed by dellinger et al in dellinger et al 2016a they developed a theoretical model in which screw performance was investigated as a function of its geometry and flow the flow leakage friction and outlet submersion losses were all included and the fill factor was variable they installed a laboratory scale experimental device and conducted some experiments showing a good agreement between the theoretical model and empirical results for the torque and efficiency in addition to theoretical models studies based on computational fluid dynamics cfd have also been considered for example the performance of a non uniform archimedean spiral rotor was numerically investigated for different values of volume flow rates and rotation speeds in schleicher et al 2014 finding a maximum efficiency of 72 stergiopoulou and kalkani 2015 studied screw performance with horizontal vertical and inclined axes using the flow3d cfd software in stergiopoulou and kalkani 2015 but did not present any performance evaluation of the screw dellinger et al 2018 also investigated screw performance with the openfoam cfd software using different flow conditions and screw rotation speeds reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the k ω sst model were used the volume of fluid vof method was also employed to determine the position of the free surface of the water obtaining a maximum efficiency of 80 however they concluded that more studies for different inclination angles and flow conditions should be done cfd tools have also helped to study the influence of the inclination angle and blade numbers for instance different inclination angles 10 38ᵒ and blade numbers 3 4 and 5 were investigated in dellinger et al 2019 using openfoam the optimal inclination angles were found 15 5ᵒ 20ᵒ and 24 5ᵒ for 3 4 and 5 bladed screws respectively also screw efficiency was augmented with increasing blade numbers the highest efficiency obtained was 87 for 4 and 5 bladed screws the maximum relative error in efficiency between numerical and experimental results was 2 in maulana et al 2018 ast s performance with different blade numbers 1 4 at a flow rate of 2 m3 s and a head of 1 m was numerically investigated using fluent it was found that 2 bladed screws lead to more stability in pressure distribution in khan et al 2019 archimedean screw turbines performance with 1 10 blades was investigated for a specific site at shadra islamabad pakistan using ansys the obtained efficiencies ranged between 75 and 87 showing the maximum efficiency for the 5 bladed screw some works have also studied the specific topic of electricity generation dedić jandrek and nižetić experimentally evaluated a small scale ast for power generation in varying parameters such as inclination angle flow rate and rotation speed dedić jandrek and nižetić 2019 they found that the maximum efficiency was 64 with an inclination angle of 21ᵒ and a flow rate of 10 l s in durrani et al 2019 an ast was designed and simulated for a sewage water location and finally was implemented in practice the performance of a ductless archimedes screw that exploits kinetic energy rather than potential one in both aligned and inclined configurations was numerically and experimentally investigated in zitti et al 2020 the archimedes screw turbine was used as a hydrokinetic turbine inclining the blades slightly toward the inflow fluent software was used for simulations and comparative results with other hydrokinetic turbines were reported although the use of asts to generate electricity is growing there are still few studies examining its performance and authors agree that it is necessary to keep studying ast to obtain technical knowledge and guidance design model based designs are more efficient in terms of cost and time if accurate numerical models are available since cfd simulations of asts are relatively scarce this research demonstrates the first steps in the development of a cfd model to this end a cfd fluent model of an ast was provided to assess its performance and pressure and velocity fields under different rotation speeds inclination angles and flow conditions in particular a numerical model of ast based on three dimensional navier stokes equations with the k ω sst turbulence model in fluent is provided and validated using experimental data 2 material and methods the main goal of the current research was the cfd simulation of an ast for power generation parameters such as volume flow rate q screw inclination angle β and screw rotation speed ω were considered 2 1 ast components asts are located in places with low heads and moderate flow rates for converting hydraulic power into mechanical power a generator coupled to the screw converts the mechanical energy into electricity locations with 1 m 6 5 m head and 200 l s to 6500 l s volume flow rate are the most common for ast installation issac and markose 2018 loots et al 2015 although flow rates up to 14 5 m3 s have been reported at linton lock in york uk yoosefdoost and lubitz 2020 as shown in fig 1 water from the upper reservoir comes into the inlet of the screw and exits through the lower reservoir s outlet the water moves down along the screw entrapped between adjacent screw blades comprising discrete volumes namely water buckets the water level difference between the proceeding and leading helical plane of each blade creates a pressure force that generates a torque making the screw to be rotated the hydraulic and mechanical parameters of this system can be used for computing the ast power and efficiency the central core is a screw which rotates freely inside a fixed trough to avoid friction therefore there is a gap width g w between the blades and trough which causes a gap leakage g l the main environmental parameters are the head h the volume flow rate through the screw q and the screw rotation speed ω the screw geometry is defined by its outer diameter d o inner diameter d i screw pitch s total length l blade number n and screw inclination angle β fig 1 2 2 power calculation in an ast system the available hydraulic power of water p h y d with specific weight γ could be calculated using the volume flow rate and head with equation 1 as the screw rotates due to the exerted hydrostatic pressure a torque t is generated mechanical power p m e c h is equal to the torque multiplied by the rotation speed as given by equation 2 1 p h y d γ q h 2 p m e c h ω t mechanical efficiency η is the ratio of mechanical power to hydraulic power defined as 3 η p m e c h p h y d ω t γ q h due to the complex interaction between the screw and the water flow the utilization of cfd is inevitable having q and h values one could use a cfd software to calculate the torque generated for the considered rotation speed the software fluent 15 0 4 ansys inc canonsburg 2013 was used to this end compared to the experimental study cfd reduces the cost and time and shows velocity and pressure fields 2 3 ast governing equations flow through an ast has two phases namely water and air the physical properties of a fluid and its motion within an ast which is mostly unsteady and turbulent are described with non linear transient second order partial differential equations that can be numerically solved using cfd in particular cfd is a method of simulating a flow process in which standard flow equations the navier stokes and continuity equations are discretized and solved for each computational mesh cell the flow in an ast could be solved by the well known continuity and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations dellinger et al 2019 i e 4 u 0 5 u t u u p ν ν t u the rans equations are solved using cfd software with an accuracy similar to the experimental laboratory setup according to dellinger et al 2018 one of the most common turbulence models is a k ω k omega model with the type of sst shear stress transport it takes k ε in the free stream and k ω in domains near the wall with low reynolds numbers this model was selected in this research because it has widely been used in literature e g zitti et al 2020 dellinger et al 2018 and simmons 2018a spatial discretization of momentum and turbulent kinetic energy were made using second order upwind and first order upwind methods also the transient formulation was made using the first order implicit method the solver was selected as a pressure based solver so that the volume of fluid vof method was employed multiphase flows can numerically be calculated using the euler euler approach the vof method is a type of the euler euler approach in which a surface tracking technique is used if there are two immiscible fluids like water and air where the interface position is important in the vof method a volume fraction α indicating the phase type is defined for each mesh cell representing the ratio of water volume to the total volume of the cell in particular the cell contains air if α 0 and is full of water if α 1 there is a free surface inside the cell if α becomes between 0 and 1 in a two phase flow problem the density ρ and viscosity μ of the fluid within the solution domain calculated using the vof method defined as versteeg and malalasekera 2007 6 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r 7 μ α μ w a t e r 1 α μ a i r the solution method was pressure velocity coupling with a coupled scheme also the initialization method for simulations was hybrid with averaged turbulent parameters the screw mesh generated using ansys meshing tool was defined as a moving mesh with a constant screw speed in each simulation the screw rotation was around its longitudinal axis and special attention was paid to the screw surface and gap region by refining the mesh see fig 2 in particular the maximum and minimum size of mesh cells were 1 87 10 2 and 10 4 respectively finding a maximum dimensionless wall distance of 4 2 y 5 was suggested in andersson et al 2011 for the k ω sst type turbulence model 2 4 providing the model inputs the experimental setup of lubitz et al 2014 was used in our simulation model in particular the geometrical values were employed to validate the numerical model and assess the results in the experiments the upper reservoir was supplied by a pump whereas the lower reservoir had a controllable depth the torque was measured using a load cell more details on the experimental device can be found in lubitz et al 2014 the specification of the screw is given in table 1 three inclination angles 20 24 9 and 30 two volume flow rates 1 13 and 1 5 l s and three rotation speeds 5 10 and 15 rad s have been considered to investigate the performance of the screw in this research it should be noticed that all rotation speeds considered here were investigated in the experiments with an inclination of 24 9 and the volume flow rate of 1 13 l s also inclination angles were chosen based on common values used in the literature dellinger et al 2018 the combinations of the investigated parameter values are given in table 2 as can be seen 18 different simulations were performed 2 5 boundary and initial conditions water at a temperature of 20 ᵒc density of 1000 kg m3 and kinematic viscosity of 10 6 m 2 s 1 were used in this research the material of the screw trough and reservoirs was considered as smooth steel since the upper and lower reservoirs in this study are open channels a pressure boundary condition was defined at the lower pool which had a rectangular weir at the downstream end controlling its water level a specific flow boundary condition was determined at the upper reservoir the canal sides and beds were defined as a wall boundary condition in all simulations a constant prescribed rotation speed for the screw was defined and the corresponding torque was simulated to reduce the computational burden the upper and lower reservoirs were reduced to the trough width 2 6 convergence criteria regarding the convergence of the numerical model three criteria were imposed i the difference between the two successive values of the averaged torques must become less than 1 ii the normalized residuals of pressure and velocity less than 10 5 and iii flow entering the screw should be equal to the flow exiting a maximum simulation time step of 3 7 10 3 s was used in the simulations and the convergence time total simulation time was variable according to the parameters affecting the screw performance for example the convergence of mechanical power for 5 million mesh cells during the simulation time is shown in fig 3 note that similar fluctuations of power during the time is reported in the literature e g zitti et al 2020 finally courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition was held regarding the time step and the optimum mesh cell size in all simulations note that for the pressure based solver with vof model used in this research the courant number s maximum default value is 200 and was reduced below 5 to make the solution more stable according to the imposed criteria 2 7 validation to validate the model the experimental results obtained by lubitz et al were used lubitz et al 2014 to this end the numerical model parameter values were taken from the experimental setup four values of mesh cells were selected to be investigated to reduce the computation burden in this regard note that testing a larger number of mesh cells is too time consuming due to the complex geometry of ast and the gap existing between screw and trough considering the experimental data the rotation speed of 10 rad s is the optimum one hence finding the best mesh cell values was made for this rotation speed with its corresponding experimental torque and mechanical power of 0 2187 n m and 2 187 w respectively the numerical and experimental results for mechanical power for a number of mesh cells ranging between 2 and 6 5 millions are given in table 3 as shown in table 3 the numerical mechanical power value for the cell number of 5 and 6 5 million is 2 178 w and 2 183 w respectively one can see that an increasing in number of cells from 5 to 6 5 million caused the numerical mechanical power to be increased from 2 178 w to 2 183 w improving the relative error by 0 41 since 5 million mesh cells provide a relative error of 0 69 which is lower than 1 this value was preferred to minimize computation burden and simulation time relative errors below 1 were used and reported in dellinger et al 2016a and dellinger et al 2019 for the rotation speed of 15 rad s in this research a relative error of 8 7 was obtained as rotation speed increases the numerical model overestimates the mechanical power because some power losses are not included such as the inlet and outlet ones indeed up to 8 97 overprediction was reported in simmons 2018b finally note that the relative error is calculated as the difference between the numerical mechanical power and the corresponding experimental power dividing by the latter 3 results and discussion 3 1 analyzing parameters variations all of the results given and discussed hereafter correspond to the optimum number of mesh cells 5 million variations of mechanical power vs screw rotation speed for different inclination angles and for the flow rates 1 13 l s and 1 5 l s are shown in fig 4 a and b as previously mentioned the rotation speed of 10 rad s is optimal this value is lower than the muysken limit muysken 1932 which becomes 18 8 rad s for the screw considered and can be calculated as 8 ω m 50 d 0 2 3 where d 0 is the external diameter of the screw in meters as shown in the figure the mechanical power increases with increasing the rotation speed until the optimal rotation speed after that it decreases with increasing the rotation speed this behavior was shown for the two considered flows in asts hydrostatic pressure creates the torque and consequently is the source of mechanical power in the optimal rotation speed water depth is at the top point of the screw s inner diameter resulting in maximum mechanical power increasing water depth and overflowing from the top point of the inner diameter in a specific rotation speed causes an overflow leakage reducing efficiency for lower rotation speeds i e non optimal water overflows from the top point reducing mechanical power likewise water depth is decreased for higher rotation speeds and hydrostatic pressure is reduced note that the water surface profile within each individual bucket is assumed to be similar therefore the total net pressure created corresponds to each individual bucket s contribution similar behaviors have been reported in the literature lubitz et al 2014 kozyn and lubitz 2017 for a specific rotation speed mechanical power increases with the inclination angle the highest mechanical power was found for 30ᵒ because the net water pressure i e water level difference between upstream and downstream of the blades which is equal to 20 cm exerted to the blades was the highest at this inclination angle in the same conditions similar flow rate and rotation speed pressure and torque increase with the net water level difference generating more mechanical power however too much increase in the inclination angle leads to overfilling and power loss that reduces mechanical power as shown in dellinger et al 2019 where it can be seen that the inclination angle of 33ᵒ is the optimal one efficiency variation vs screw rotation speed is shown in fig 5 a and b for the flow rates considered as shown efficiency increases with increasing rotation speed for all inclination angles the efficiency curves are bell shaped as usual although the full shape of the bell for the curve related to the inclination angle of 20ᵒ and flow rate of 1 13 l s could be seen if the rotation speed axis starts from zero rather than five note that overflow leakage occurs at lower rotation speeds reducing efficiency and at higher rotation speeds the efficiency decreases due to friction losses arising on the blades the power loss due to friction on the blades is proportional to the cube of the screw rotation kozyn and lubitz 2017 i e p l f r i c t i o n ω 3 one reason that why the efficiency at the inclination angle of 20ᵒ is greater could be described as follows according to equation 3 the efficiency of an ast rotating with hydrostatic pressure and constant rotation speed flow rate and geometry depends on the geodetic head h the geodetic head decreases with the inclination angle causing the efficiency to be increased see fig 6 in other words since the same screw having the same geometry including length is used for each inclination angle the head of the hydraulic power decreases as the inclination angle decreases and the efficiency therefore increases according to fig 5 maximum efficiencies were 80 and 83 in the inclination angle of 24 9ᵒ for q 1 13 l s and q 1 5 l s in the optimal rotation speed therefore the inclination angle of 24 9ᵒ is considered as the optimal one note that a 30 increase in flow rate leads only a 3 increase in the efficiency which is consistent with dellinger et al 2016b where it was found that an ast could keep the efficiency nearly constant around the optimal efficiency for a flow rate variation of 20 around the optimum flow the relationship between the torque and rotation speed of the screw for different discharge values is depicted in fig 7 as can be seen the generated torque decreases as the rotation speed increases likewise for any specific rotation speed the generated torque increases with flow rate thus reducing rotation speed 3 2 investigating velocity and pressure fields unlike experimental research the velocity and pressure field could be studied using cfd the 3d pressure distributions are illustrated in fig 8 for q 1 13 l s β 30 and ω 10 r a d s as expected the pressure becomes zero at the water surface and is distributed nearly linearly from the surface to the bottom note that the pressure distribution in all buckets is equal because the water level difference between upstream and downstream of each blade is nearly constant as reported in lubitz et al 2014 kozyn and lubitz 2017 thus the mechanical power predicted for a single bucket could generally be multiplied by the number of buckets to calculate the total mechanical power generated simmons 2018b although the overflow in this case is to some extent small so that it could be ignored it shows the accuracy of our numerical model in calculating related parameters and visualizing the complex flow occurring within the screw as the flow becomes high enough for a given screw rotation speed more overflow can occur fig 9 shows water velocity distribution for q 1 13 l s β 30 and ω 10 r a d s as can be seen the velocity ranges between 0 and 1 5 m s being high near the trough and at the point where the water exits in this figure the arrow shows the high flow velocity on the trough that corresponds to the gap leakage which becomes a major source of power loss to illustrate the effect of pressure and velocity the numerical model results for the two parameters on a vertical plane along the screw axis passing the center of the screw a transect parallel to the screw axis located in the gap region between blades and trough is provided in fig 10 in this figure the free water surface is horizontal within each bucket and water depth increases along the screw due to its inclination water depth suddenly decreases with a sharp gradient as it reaches the gap region the velocity decreases as pressure increases along with a bucket for a given flow rate at the gap region water velocity suddenly increases due to a high water surface difference d h at the upstream and downstream of one blade which can also theoretically be calculated with the torricelli equation i e v t 2 g d h this result is consistent with the three dimensional plots previously shown the created pressure gradient causes the screw to be rotated 4 conclusions this research examined the performance of asts using fluent to this end a three dimensional numerical model using a k ω sst reynolds averaged navier stokes model has been provided and validated using experimental data then the effect of different rotation speeds inclination angles and flow conditions on power output and efficiency were assessed the optimal number of mesh cells was 5 million which generated a relative error of less than 1 0 69 for a rotation speed of 10 rad s a volume flow rate of 1 13 l s and an inclination angle of 24 9ᵒ however the numerical model overpredicts mechanical power as screw rotation speed increases because some power losses are not considered the maximum mechanical power output was obtained for the rotation speed of 10 rad s in particular the mechanical power increased with the screw rotation from 5 rad s to 10 rad s and then decreased for rotation speeds between 10 rad s and 15 rad s power losses due to overfilling and friction explain this reduction for rotation speeds different than the optimum efficiency remains almost constant for flow variations around the design flow maximum water velocity took place in the gap region where water escapes from the screw and has a strong pressure gradient the pressure was zero at the surface and increased along with depth the results reveal that the numerical model has reasonable accuracy in predicting the performance of an ast the results of this research in which difference in water head is used to generate power can be used with opportune infrastructure in oceans and seas one way in this regard includes the exploitation of the water head provided by an overtopping wave energy converters another way is the exploitation of tides by tidal range technologies that harness tidal power through dam like structures this structure trap rising

20748,the blade cavitation in a waterjet pump presents highly dynamic behaviors under the inflow non uniformities and unsteadiness this work designs a pair of tandem obstacles attached on the blade suction surface to control blade cavitation within the waterjet pump the unsteady simulations and experimental observation of the cavitating flow in a water tunnel are jointly carried out to study the control mechanism and control effects of obstacles it is observed that the blade leading edge regimes before the obstacle are nearly free of cavities at the incipient moderate developing and fully developed cavitation stages whereas the shear cavitation is triggered after each obstacle the cavitation control mechanism of obstacles is substantially attributable to the raised absolute pressure and the flow deceleration imposed by the adverse pressure gradient apg alternations in particular the position shifted cavitation effectively weakens the interactions of inlet guide vanes igvs wake and blade cavitation and hence to avoid the dynamic loading impingement around the leading edge regimes although a 5 6 hydraulic efficiency reduction is introduced as a result the root mean square rms of 10 300 hz of the obstacle thrust spectra is degraded with a pronounced amount in the following work the geometries and positions of obstacles will be further optimized to improve the cavitation control effects keywords waterjet pump blade cavitation cavitation control obstacles experiments numerical simulation 1 introduction it is well known that cavitation happens on propellers or pumps would give rise to undesirable propulsive performance deterioration blade erosion vibration and noise kuiper 1981 van wijngaarden 2011 chen et al 2020 usually above the critical condition the global performance of waterjet pumps changes few whereas the cavitation is already present even through small amount of cavities produce in the incipient stage the erosion and noise emission have occurred prior to the performance breakdown due to unsteady nature of cavities ardnt 1981 brennen 1994 2006 the developed sheet and tip cavitation that commonly occurs on the propeller or waterjet pump would also interact with the hull and systems to bring about global surge instabilities duttweiler and brennen 2002 meanwhile the interactions between flow perturbations and blade cavitation would also introduce severe cavity and pressure oscillations for a pump such as the turbulent inflow and non uniform wakes korkut and atlar 2002 ji et al 2012 pereira et al 2016 in such a context cavitation control has increasingly received much attention to minimize these undesirable damages and improve the cavitation performance including the cavitation inception delay and vibration and noise performance improvement in particular various control methods have ever been developed to control dynamic pump cavitation such as the j grooves inducer choi et al 2006 polymer injection chahine et al 1993 flexible thread lee et al 2018 propeller optimization vesting and bensow 2011 air filled membrane lee at al 2015 biomimetic blade shi et al 2016 and blade roughness asnaghi at al 2021 although there are many solutions proposed to eliminate the cavitation damages a practical and targeted control approach is still substantially inadequate and under developed this work makes an attempt to employ the obstacle application to stabilize the blade cavitation that has been observed to present highly dynamic behaviors under the wake perturbations of inlet guide vanes igvs the obstacle method was originally proposed to hold back the re entrant jet flow to depress the cloud cavitation kawanami et al 1997 experimentally confirmed that the obstacles could efficiently block the re entrant jet and found that the spanwise obstacle ranging at 0 37 times chord length presented notable effects on the drag and noise reduction rather than streamwise arrangement subsequently pham et al 1999 sato et al 2002 zhao et al 2010 and zhang et al 2018 re examined the cloud cavitation mechanism and the control effects of obstacles with respect to cavity patterns noise emission lift drag oscillations and cavity strength etc experimentally or numerically and their results also provided further geometrical optimization of obstacle inside a pump apart from the re entrant jet prevention the pressure alternations triggered by obstacle have also been proved to be physically favorable to cavitation suppression li et al 2009 found that the cavities attached around the head of a revolution body could be depressed by the multiple grooves implementation which was attributable to the groove induced high pressure waves propagating towards upstream recently che et al 2019 studied the control mechanisms of obstacle bar for both attached and cloud cavitation on naca0015 by high speed video and dynamic pressure measurement their results illuminated that for the attached cavitation in absence of re entrant jet flow the increased upstream pressure excited by the obstacle could also suppress the leading edge cavitation it can be seen that the obstacle with appropriate arrangement would play multiple roles to control cavitation in terms of different mechanisms correspondingly the effects of obstacle re entrant jet prevention or pressure enhancement are believed to be equally effective to control cloud or attached cavitation occurred in pumps the blade cavitation within this pump has been observed to present a thin attached pattern and perform highly dynamic behaviors under the inflow non uniform condition alternatively by utilizing the excited high pressures the obstacles is tentatively designed to control the blade cavitation in this waterjet pump in this work the experimental and numerical approaches are jointly conducted to examine the control mechanism of obstacles on blade cavitation in the waterjet pump with igvs the body of this work is organized as follows in section 2 the experimental facilities and techniques adopted by this work are described including the measurement uncertainty assessment meanwhile combined with the observation of blade cavitation characteristics in this pump the implementation of obstacle proposal and design concept are introduced and hence preliminarily determines the basic geometrical parameters section 3 presents the mesh generation and numerical validation in detail for the original and obstacle pump section 4 comparatively examines the blade cavitation evolutions inside the pumps by high speed video and simulation pressure and velocity distributions and loading instabilities to elaborate on the cavitation control mechanism and effects of the obstacles finally the conclusions are summarized and drawn 2 experiment setup and test model 2 1 experiment setup the experiments are carried out in a water tunnel in the unit shanghai ship and shipping research institute the layout of the experimental system

degrade the turbulent intensity a nozzle shaped conduit is mounted before the test section to organize the flow with a contraction ratio of 5 96 a vacuum pump equipped downstream is used to adjust the tunnel pressure to create a cavitation environment before the experiments a degassing process is conducted to maintain the dissolved oxygen content at a stable value of 0 6 saturation about 5 ppm in the standard temperature and pressure condition two high speed cameras memrecam hx canon japan and motion pro y3 idt u s are used to capture cavitation images at a phase angle of 45 some lamps are placed to illuminate the test objective to produce uniform lights two high speed videos are simultaneously triggered to capture the dynamic pump cavitation with a sampling frequency of 15 k frames per second the focuses of two cameras are concentrating on the leading edge hx and tip of pump blade idt with respect to front and side views the images captured by camera 1 hx are used to analyze the typical blade cavitation patterns the performance data and cavitation images are acquired when the pump is stably operating for a while three typical cavitation stages are eventually selected for subsequent analysis as described in section 4 1 2 2 test model the basic parameters and operating conditions of this pump are listed in table 1 the obstacles are implemented on the original impeller without any other geometrical modifications as shown in fig 2 a the blade cavitation at the design point that is subject to a low angle of attack aoa presents as a thinner vapor filed pattern that initiates from the leading edge different from the typical cloud cavitation on hydrofoil the roller type behaviors associated with large scale shedding is not identified thus the idea to inhibit transient re entrant flow seems not that available in this waterjet pump an alternative to control cavitation is to enhance the pressures around the blade leading edge which might be also feasible to control the onset and development of cavitating flow referred to the obstacle arrangements on hydrofoil in kawanami et al 1997 pham et al 1999 sato et al 2002 zhao et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 che et al 2019 a pair of tandem obstacles are tentatively designed considering the local cavity extent and thickness on the pump blade the former obstacle close to the leading edge is conceived to enhance the pressures to depress the blade cavitation development the latter one is preliminarily designated to stabilize the wake flow induced by the former one as sketched in fig 2b the spanwise obstacles are supposed to arrange in the region where the cavitation is developing and the height of the obstacles could not exceed the local cavity thickness to break the normal internal flow thus the latter obstacle is slightly higher than that of the former one considering the thicker cavity thickness there the profile of obstacles is designed as a triangle with rounded edges to avoid steep gradients and strong shear stress with these considerations the basic geometrical parameters for this pump are given in table 2 and the sketch of obstacle profile is shown in fig 3 for simplicity the pump with obstacles is denoted as obs to distinguish it from the original impeller ori in the following sections the impeller is fabricated from aluminum material on a five axis computerized numerical control machine as shown in fig 4 the basic pump parameters are defined as follows to represent the operating conditions and the pump performance conveniently with the water tunnel experiments 1 q v i n π d 2

the formal analysis during the experiments the variations of temperature and density of water medium tw ρ and the diameter of impeller d are insignificantly varied thus these variables could be safely

numerical methodology 3 1 turbulence model and cavitation model the turbulent model and cavitation model employed by this work is unsteady sst and z g b respectively the unsteady shear stress transport sst k ω model with curvature correction and local turbulence viscosity correction is adopted to capture the dynamic cavitating flow the calculations are performed using the commercial package ansys cfx 18 0 the sst k ω model proposed by menter 1994 is a robust and reliable tool to predict separation and strong adverse pressure gradient of industrial flows accurately which combines the advantages of k ω near the wall with k ε model in the far field in addition the flows in a pump are sensitive to the rotating system thus an empirical method suggested by spalart and shur 1997 is embedded to constrain the production term the unsteady sst k ω turbulent model with curvature correction is well documented in ansys help 2017 and has been enabled in this study for the case of two phase flow simulation the regular sst k ω model usually over predicts the turbulence eddy viscosity and is therefore insufficient to capture the cavitation shedding behaviors accurately following the work of coutier delgosha et al 2003 a density function f ρ m is introduced to replace the mixture density ρ m to degrade the turbulence eddy viscosity μ t in the mixture regime the replace term is defined as 9 f ρ m ρ v ρ m ρ v n ρ l ρ v n 1 n 1 10 μ t f ρ m a 1 k max a 1 ω s f 2 where n is 10 while k and ω is the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent frequency respectively a 1 s and f 2 are the model coefficients based on the homogenous assumption zgb cavitation model zwart et al 2004 is developed from a simplified rayleigh plesset equation a cavitation process is governed by a continuity equation with the mass source term of vapor and given as 11 ρ m f v t ρ m u i f v x i m m where f v is the vapor mass fraction m is the liquid vaporization rate m is the vapor condensation rate the simplified rayleigh plesset equation rpe is utilized to characterize the condensation and vaporization process and thus to derive the respective cavitation rate by negating the second order terms in the rpe the equation is reduced as 12 3 2 d r b d t 2 p v p ρ l where r b is the simplified bubble radius p v is the saturated vapor pressure and p is the pressure at infinity therefore the deduced cavitation transfer rate can be written as 13 d m b d t ρ v d v b d t ρ v d d t 4 3 π r b 3 4 π ρ v r b 2 2 3 p v p ρ l where ρv is the vapor density and vb is the bubble volume assuming that there are nb bubbles per unit volume the volume fraction αv can be expressed as 14 α v v b n b 4 3 π r b 3 n b therefore the total mass transfer cavitation rate per unit volume is derived as 15 m 3 α v ρ v r b 2 3 p v p ρ l p p v the number of nucleation sites must decrease since there is the vapor volume fraction increases for the process of vaporization α v can be replaced by α nuc 1 α v eq 15 can be rewritten as follows 16 m c e 3 α n u c 1 α v ρ v r b 2 3 p v p ρ l p p v for the process of condensation it can be deduced as 17 m c c 3 α v ρ v r b 2 3 p v p ρ l p p v where α nuc is the volume fraction of nuclei c e and c c are empirical factors for the vaporization and the condensation processes with recommended values of 50 and 0 01 p v is the saturated vapor pressure at 25 c and evaluates as 3169 pa according to the nist table α nuc has the value of 5 10 4 and r b is the typical bubble size with the value of 1 10 6 3 2 numerical settings and validation the blockage ε a d c where a d is the disk area of propeller and c is the area of test section cross section for current water tunnel is 0 0872 that is less than the empirical criterion 0 1 as suggested by wilson 1994 hence the centered pump flows can be assumed to be negligibly affected by the confinement effects in light of this the computational domain of this work is safely constructed as an enlarged cylinder to completely preclude the wall effects and the results reliability for similar configurations with water tunnel experiment has been validated by kumar and mahesh 2017 and yu et al 2019 as shown in fig 5 the computational domain comprises three main parts i e a cylinder with a length of 16d and diameter of 8d a stator domain and a rotor domain for the sst model the automatic wall function is implemented in cfx solver which implies that the near wall resolution completely depends on the local grid distributions therefore the all hexahedral element meshes are generated for these domains as shown by the clipped middle plane and impeller surface as shown in fig 6 these meshes have the benefits of well suited node distributions and grid orthogonality the non dimensional distance y is evaluated to examine to the boundary layer resolution of near wall mesh the overall y on the obstacle impeller is below 100 except that on the local twisted faces regarding to about 200 due to the complex geometry as shown in fig 7 menter et al 2003a 2003b argued that for the order of y 100 the shifts of automatic wall function can guarantee that all solutions follow the logarithm profile with variations of less than 2 compared with the resolved case y 0 2 for the obstacle case the near wall mesh treatments even for a local high y satisfy the requirements of sst to simulate such a complex flow the grid independency study is provided in table 3 and fig 8 h cfd and h efd represent the experimental and numerical results respectively it is shown that the head error validated by the experiment data is gradually decreased with total mesh increment and the predicting results are converging at g3 case that is consequently selected as the final grid in terms of 6905912 and 7495074 hexahedra elements for the ori and obs model respectively the cfx solver uses an element based finite volume method which employs finite element shape functions to approximate the integration nodes the advection and diffusion terms for this calculation are discretized by high resolution scheme and the transient term is solved by the second order backward euler scheme these schemes enable the second order accuracy of the solutions for the temporal spatial discretization the boundary condition setups are shown in fig 5 wherein a uniform velocity profile with turbulent intensity 2 is set at the inlet that is consistent with the measured data the free slip wall is given on the outer domain and no slip wall condition is specified on the igvs impeller and duct walls the sliding mesh technology is adopted to simulate the rotor stator interference effects the transient frozen rotor model is employed to accomplish the interface data transfer between rotating and static domains the time step is required to ensure temporal discretion accuracy which directly corresponds with the courant number considering the compromise between robust accuracy and computational efficiency the time step is selected as time discretized interval corresponding to 1 passing for each time iteration loop with respect to a mean courant number of 5 68 the residual of velocity components and pressure term is below 10 5 and that of turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent frequency equation is below 10 4 in each time iteration the duration of this calculation lasts 11 rotating cycles and the first cycle is abandoned with the consideration of numerical instabilities the last 10 cycles are employed to analyze the flow characteristics for the cases of obstacle cavitation simulation we found that the cavitation patterns are always overestimated that could not accurately match with the experimental observations the deep reason is owing to that the obstacle cavitation is intimately correlated with the turbulent coherent structures that however have been averaged by current rans model in order to overcome this issue we empirically rematch the cavitation patterns within the obstacle pump by adjusting the ambient pressures eventually the cavitation index involved is corrected towards a high value with a constant gap of 0 9 4 results and discussion 4 1 pump performance hydraulic and cavitation performances are measured in the cavitation tunnel as presented in fig 9 and fig 10 in comparison with smooth original blade the spanwise obstacles are non streamlined and almost perpendicular to the inflow which unavoidably introduces extra hydraulic loss and reflects as performance penalty as shown in fig 9 compared with ori model the head of obs model drops approximately 6 at various flow rates the pump efficiency gap increases with the increment of flow rates with respect to 5 6 degradation at the design point for most of passive control methods the good cavitation performance and high hydraulic efficiency are usually contradictory such as the unloading design to improve the cavitation performance in the case of cavitation condition the head gap remains a nearly constant amount at different cavitation stages this phenomenon manifests that the global performance is less influenced by the obstacles under cavitation condition therefore for an integrated blade design the head compensation should consider before the obstacles designing the head drop point of ori and obs models is around the cavitation number 2 5 in general the critical npsh with respect to 3 head drop is widely employed to assess the pump suction performance however this work pays more attention on the control of cavitation instability that occurs before the head drops on the other hand it is observed that the bubbles would come out in the oncoming flow when the ambient pressure further decrease thus three equivalent stages for both models before the head drops are selected to study the control effects namely incipient moderate developing and developed stages as circled in fig 10 it should be noted that the obstacle cavitation that is strongly correlated to the turbulent vortices usually occurs earlier than the attached cavitation on original pump therefore in order to present a fair comparison there is a slight deviation of cavitation index for the inception stage 4 2 cavitation patterns for the pump flow at design point it is observed that the blade cavitation presents a form of sheet cavitation and develop to a patch cavitation pattern when the ambient pressure drops to a sufficient level this attached pattern is mainly attributable to the low aoa distributions at the design point based on the research on the leading edge cavitation dynamics of 2 hydrofoil farhat et al 2002 the sustainment of leading edge cavities can be assumed as the continuous feeding of explode nuclei rather than a shelter formed by laminar separation bubble in such framework the blade cavitation inception can be thought to be largely depending on the minimum pressure around the blade leading edge 18 σ vi c p min 19 c p min p min p 0 5 ρ n d 2 where σ vi is the incipient cavitation index and cp min is the minimum pressure coefficient around the blade leading edge once the cavitation incepts the cavities would inertially grow and develop downstream and finally collapse in the high pressure regimes the unsteady bubbles shedding at the end of cavities could trigger a local loading instability at the closure regimes what s more for this waterjet pump the blade cavitation is invariably disturbed by the periodic unsteady igvs wakes which would additionally lead to drastic cavity volume oscillations and then to induce dynamic blade loading this global instabilities with forced modulation actually contribute more to the blade vibrations these dynamic behaviors of blade cavitation could be demonstrated as a result of the inflow non uniformities and unsteadiness which are commonly happening on the propeller or pump with igvs or other obstructers upstream such as rudder of boat basically an effective way to depress the cavitation dynamic behaviors is to enlarge the axial gap between the igvs and rotor blades with the pressure alternations these instabilities are believed to be controlled by positioning obstacles on cavitation regime specifically the design of obstacles have been described in the test model section with accounting of cavitation characteristics of this pump this work equivalently selects three cavitation stages in terms of incipient developing moderate developing and fully developed stages to compare with respective stages on original pump figs 11 13 present the cavitation patterns captured by high speed video and unsteady numerical simulation at different instants regarding to 10 phase lag for adjacent images the abbreviations exp and num refer to the experimental and numerical results respectively for the cavitation stage ⅰ and ⅱ the cavitation predicted by the numerical method agrees well with the experiments except a slight overprediction around the blade root and the leading edge regime before the former obstacle is nearly free of cavities as the cavitation developing in contrast for the design point of ori blade the blade cavitation is observed to initiate from the leading edge and spatially uneven developing due to the spanwise difference of loading sensitivities besides the igvs wake would periodically impinge on the blade cavitation to induce severe cavity oscillations after the obstacle implemented the obstacle cavitation is observed to be more stable at different instants than the blade cavitation in original pump for the case of stage ⅲ as shown in fig 13 the cavitation on the ori nearly covers the blade middle and upper parts and large scale cavitation is observed to shed as a whole patch and to collapse downstream comparatively even at such a sufficient low cavitation number σ 2 432 the blade cavitation with obstacles is still hard to develop from the leading edge from the prospective of cavitation appearance the turbulent bubbly flows are consistently present behind each obstacle and the small scale cavities are partially shedding at the end of the bubbly cavities whereas the vapor filled cavitation attaches the leading edge of original blade by comparing the cavitation position and extension it is seen that the blade cavitation could be substantially suppressed by the obstacles although the shear cavitation are independently triggered after each obstacle as a result the cavitation induced instabilities such as the pressure and thrust fluctuations caused by the uneven and dynamic loading could be presumably controlled to some degree as the blade cavitation depression these aspects would be examined subsequently in addition the shear cavitation induced by the obstacles is found to be coherently present in the turbulent shear layers and its inception closely correlates to the local reynolds number in terms of the obstacle height and velocity magnitude franc and micheal 2005 for this reason the obstacle cavitation inception is usually earlier than that of blade cavitation the obstacle cavitation is a typical vortex cavitation that involves multi physical realizations and a high fidelity simulation usually requires access to a resolved turbulent model such as detach eddy simulation or large eddy simulation for which there has to be an empirical pressure adjustment to accommodate the experimental observations as mentioned previously currently the urans method has been validated to be able to capture the dynamic behaviors of pump cavitation which is reliable to elaborate on the cavitation control effects as well although the leading edge cavitation could be substantially controlled by raising the pressure and decelerating the flow turbulent wake cavitation is undesirably introduced by the obstacles a strong shear layer would be triggered as the flow encounters each obstacle locally this shear instability are further amplified by the perturbations upstream and then the flows evolves into turbulence associated with fertile vortices production with the ambient pressure decreasing the shear cavitation usually occurs in these low pressure cores of coherent vortices according to studies on shear cavitation both minimum pressure and pressure fluctuations are equally contribute to the shear cavitation inception franc and micheal 2005 these facts on shear cavitation technically implies the difficulties on its modelling by the urans model considering the nature of turbulent vortices the shear cavitation is much energetic and aggressive as presented in figs 11 13 the obstacle cavitation that performs with a frothy appearance is constructed by massive vapor filaments that will be subsequently entrained by the main flow and finally experiences severe collapsing in the high pressure regimes here non dimensional vorticity based on the obstacle height is defined as 20 ω z ω z h v t i p where ω z is the vorticity in the z direction h is the obstacle height and v tip is the velocity at blade tip fig 14 a presents the superimposition of non dimensional vorticity at non cavitating case and iso lines of 10 vapor volume fraction at σ 5 043 it is seen that the obstacle cavitation nearly initiate at the arc apex wherein the high sheared vortices produces fig 14b presents the superimposition of tke at non cavitating case and iso lines of 10 vapor volume fraction the cavitation regime approximately coincides with the high tke region which manifests that the obstacle cavitation development mainly rely on the turbulent level namely the fluid inertia basically the cavity behind the latter obstacle is longer than that of former one because the corresponding height although there appears to be a shelter provided by former one the high pressures and apg established by the later obstacle does not perform the expected effects to control the turbulent cavitation triggered by former one conversely the obstacle cavitation would give rise to significant damage when collapsing in the apg regime franc and micheal 2005 therefore in order to minimize the disadvantages of obstacle cavitation the turbulent structures will be resolved with the help of high fidelity cfd techniques to provide more optimization information on the obstacle height as a whole the obstacles design should reasonably consider the tradeoff between the blade cavitation control effects and the obstacle induced cavitation itself 4 3 pressure enhancement for the case of design point the pump flows are subjected to a low aoa condition that imply the blade cavitation inception and development largely depends on the minimum pressure and pressure distributions on the leading edge rather than the flow separation the research on the obstacle hydrofoil has experimentally demonstrated the pressure raising effects on the attached cavitation control che et al 2019 thus in order to shed light on the control mechanism in this pump the minimum pressure and statistical blade loadings are numerically examined fig 15 gives the minimum pressure coefficient cp min at initial phase angle around the leading edge at the spans of obstacles arranged it is seen that the cp min on the obs spans are globally higher than that of ori spans where the obstacle is placed the cp min gap is gradually reduced as closing to the blade tip regimes the reason responsible for this phenomenon is attributable to the spanwise loading sensitivities of perturbations that are determined by the loading specifications at the initial design stage basically the current trend of cp min difference is consistent with this pump design concept in terms of middle part loading shroud and hub unloading based on the minimum pressure criterion of cavitation inception the σ vi on the obs blade is lower than that on the ori blade with a difference above 1 0 which denotes a high potential of the obs blade to delay the cavitation theoretically the growth and collapsing of a spherical bubble are known to be governed by the rayleigh plesset equation in this case neglecting the second order terms surface tension and viscosity terms the bubble growth rate is degenerated as 21 r 2 p v p 3 ρ l where p is the ambient pressure and ρ l is the liquid density it is informed that the bubble growth is largely driven by the pressure difference when a cavitation nuclei expose to a low pressure region as a result the raised minimum pressures are unfavorable to the cavitation nuclei growth and development and then the blade cavitation is well depressed it can be elucidated that the raised minimum pressure is one dominate mechanism to control the blade cavitation fig 16 shows the root mean square rms pressure distribution on different spans for different spans the pressures gradually raise before each obstacle and culminate a local maximum value and then suddenly drop to a local minimum value as encountering the arc apex of each obstacle these sudden dropped pressures around the obstacles are much lower than the minimum pressure around the blade leading edge which implies that the obstacles would potentially trigger cavitation earlier the experimental observations show that the obstacle cavitation inception is much earlier than the blade cavitation and the cavitation inception index difference approaches 1 2 for this pump it should be noted that the shear cavitation inception is not only depending on the minimum pressure but also on the turbulent vortices franc and micheal 2005 in this sense the obstacles trigger another type of cavitation downstream to protect the blade leading edge from cavitating which equivalently enlarge the axial gap between igvs wake and cavitation in an alternative way the high pressure excited by the latter obstacle is originally conceived to depress the upstream cavitation but does not play the expected role which can be explained that the flows behind former obstacle contain too much energy to be depressed as indicated by the tke distributions in fig 17 in addition the turbulent flow after the latter obstacle still provide more energy to resist boundary layer separation occurred at the blade trailing edge this second pressure drop in span 0 7 is due to spanwise convection from the bottom of the blade as indicated by the streamlines in fig 17 under the acting of the centrifugal and coriolis accelerations the flow particles move towards the blade tip and are constrained by the obstacles the inclined line of the bubbly cavitation in fig 12a also gives evidence to these convection effects 4 4 decelerating effects apart from the absolute pressure enhancement effects of obstacles the pressure gradient alternations equally contribute to the cavitation control as informed by euler equation the pressure gradient term could change the situation of flow acceleration and then affect the cavitating flow as shown in fig 18 a the relative velocity distributions on the lines normal to the blade surface are presented to examine flow accelerations after the obstacle implemented the current mesh could resolve the velocity in the logarithmic layer which is representative to examine the boundary layer characteristics this postulation agrees well with the velocity distribution in fig 18b which denotes a rather thinner boundary layer around the leading edge that gradually thicken along the streamwise direction the obstacle is located outside of the local boundary layer as indicated in fig 18b under the acting of adverse pressure gradient apg formed by obstacles the flow particles are forcibly decelerated in the out region span 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 and therefore lead to the pressures raising according to the bernoulli s equation the velocity distributions in the boundary layer do not change significantly and perform the similar trend for both blades except for p4 line that is much close to the former obstacle it is seen that the obstacles mainly change the velocity in the outer region instead of the inner boundary layer when such an additional apg imposed different from the cloud cavitation on hydrofoil that sustains in a separated regime the blade cavitation within this pump with respect to small aoa is not subjected to flow separation hypothetically referred to the cloud cavitation control on hydrofoil the blade cavitation would still happen if the obstacles are virtually located in the laminar separation bubble however this is not consistent with current observations that the blade leading edge is almost free of cavities these facts further justify that the blade cavitation inception are largely depending upon the pressure distributions on the other hand the difference of cavitation inception index between ori and obs blade is approached to 1 0 as shown in fig 15 which nominally means that the cavitation would occur on obs blade as the σ vi decrease lower 1 0 than that of ori blade namely the cavitation performance would be shifted with a value of δcp min however the leading edge cavitation on obs blade is not observed to happen even at a shifted cavitation number by adding the δcp min this discrepancy attributes to the pressure gradient alternations that has a significant effect on the fluid inertial movement as governed by the momentum equation for a bubble growth the fluid inertia would dominate when the pressure difference terms p v p in eq 21 is constant d agostino and salvetti 2017 in this case the deceleration of fluid particle caused by the apg is similarly unfavorable to the cavitation bubble growth therefore the cavitation inception on the obs blade would perform different behaviors even though the same cp min is virtually reached as a summary the blade cavitation control is considerably attributable to both the pressure enhancement and flow deceleration 4 5 cavitation induced pressure fluctuations the blade cavitation in this waterjet pump with igvs is significantly modulated by the periodic unsteady inflows the blade cavitation after the obstacles implemented has been shifted in the blade middle part which is practically enlarged the axial gap with the igvs wakes in this sense the obstacle cavitation would be less sensitive to the periodic modulations upstream as a result the leading edge part that is free of cavities could efficiently avoid the drastic cavity collapsing under the inflow impacts the associated loading instabilities caused by non uniform and unsteady inflow will consequently be improved in some extent in order to fairly evaluate the control effects the cavitation developing stage ⅱ and ⅲ for ori and obs pump are compared since they both have close cavitation number figs 19 21 present the pressure spectra at the span 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 where the obstacles place the former obstacle and latter one is marked as 1 and 2 respectively for the original pump the pressure amplitude regarding to the igvs passing frequency f s 11 times shaft frequency ω is evidently high along the streamwise position where the cavitation develops especially for the span 0 6 and 0 7 comparatively it is showed that only a limited leading edge part of obstacle blade suffers from the periodic igvs wake impacts for the involved cavitation conditions owing to that the leading edge is free of cavities the flow around the obstacle is still affected by the inflow perturbations the pressure oscillations around each obstacle are correspondingly intensified for the non cavitating and cavitation case and the amplitude varies little as the obstacle cavitation developed which plausibly manifests that the obstacle cavitation is more stable and then fluctuates with a small amplitude as shown in figs 22 24 the blade cavitation for both ori and obs would both induce low frequency components on the thrust spectra that are below the igvs passing frequency f s these instabilities are supposed to be attributable to the cavity volume fluctuations ji et al 2011 as to the broadband noise in thrust spectra the streamwise pressure spectra at spans suggest that the leading edge part is thought to definitely contribute to these cavitation induced low frequency instabilities besides the low frequency regimes at the aft part of span 0 9 are obviously intensified due to the obstacle triggered cavities collapsing there it should be noted that the tip leakage flow also exhibits significant impact on the cavitating flow at the span 0 9 to introduce additional instabilities the spatial pressure spectra deterministically contribute to the global thrust performance as indicated in figs 22 24 the broadband low frequency is consistently present that is caused by the uneven and dynamic cavitation induced loading impingement on the ori and obs especially for the frequency below 300 hz that includes the igvs passing frequency f s it can be postulated that the cavitating flow in the pump may induce the low frequency vibration although they involve different cavitation types when the cavitation shifts on the middle part the low frequency components of the leading edge cavitation would be practically weaken with the depression of that by obstacles the spectral characteristics of impeller thrust involve much modulation information and cavitation dynamic behaviors which is not pursued here fig 25 and fig 26 examine the standard deviation in time domain and rms of thrust amplitude ranged 10 300 hz frequency of particular interest respectively both these second order statistics indicate that the thrust fluctuations and broadband low frequency noise could be reduced by the obstacles with a moderate amount although the turbulent shear cavitation is inevitably introduced the obstacles perform substantially potential to eliminate the low frequency instabilities induced by leading edge cavitation by passively shifting the cavities downstream to avoid the unsteady inflow perturbations which is of practical importance for the pumps with stringent requirement of vibration and noise 4 6 discussion although the obstacle method is originally utilized to hold back the re entrant jets that give rise to cloud cavitation it has been proved that the raised pressures induced by the obstacles could substantially depress the blade cavitation as well as pointed by franc and michael 2005 there have to be two physical necessities to produce a rough re entrant jet cavity thickness and apg for a pump operating at low aoa usually in terms of design point once the blade profile parameters are specified i e the camber curvature thickness distribution the loading and velocity distributions fundamentally determine the further developing pattern after the cavitation inception for these reasons the blade cavitation on the rotating blade with slender profile is less observed to shed as larger scale cavities triggered by the re entrant jet impingement in addition duttweiler and brennen 2002 had ever identified a steady side entrant jet on propeller surface which attributes to the spanwise flow gradient and does not result in cavity shedding similarly the inflow non uniformity in this pump leads to the uneven cavity distributions along the radical direction the absence of side entrant jet in this pump can be plausibly illustrated as the thin cavities that specifically develop on the slender blade with low aoa aside from the cavity thickness as a necessity for flow jets the cavity length has been theoretically confirmed to be responsible for various flow instabilities for a pump or hydrofoil cavitation tsujimoto et al 2008 accordingly the cavitation could be stabilized by controlling the cavity thickness and length as the blade cavitation developed a large scale cavitation patch shedding is also identified in this pump the reduced cavity length by obstacles is therefore favorable to depress that instability in general the blade leading edge is a prominent part that largely determines the energy conversion capability for a waterjet pump the leading edge flow impacts and cavities collapsing additionally give rise to undesirable vibration and noise the interactions of igvs wake and blade cavitation would enhance the pressure and cavity volume oscillations and hence worsen above damages although the shear cavitation is inevitably triggered by obstacles the leading edge remains free of cavities even at a sufficient low cavitation index the cavitation dynamic behaviors caused by inflow unsteadiness is consequently controlled by keeping a clean leading edge as shown in figs 19 21 the pressure oscillations around the leading edge of obs are much lower than that of ori impeller it has been demonstrated that the drastic cavity volume variations are mainly responsible for the pressure fluctuations to trigger vibration and noise ji et al 2011 2012 2013 the globally stable cavity pattern in the obs are consequently performing weaker impacts than that of ori model however the local pressure pulsations are more severe behind the obstacles since the flow becomes more turbulent there as a result the instabilities i e vibration and noise caused by cavity volume oscillations could be correspondingly suppressed by obstacles for waterjet pumps with igvs lastly it should be noted that the turbulent shear cavitation is considerably erosive in nature and a further structural optimization is necessarily required as observed the latter obstacle also triggers shear cavities and actually contributes little to the leading edge cavitation suppression a practical alternation for optimization is trying to remove the later obstacle to decrease the flow loss in addition the obstacle height can be redesign based on current research on the shear cavitation 5 concluding remarks this work explores the availability and mechanism of the obstacle method on the control of blade cavitation and related instabilities in a waterjet pump with igvs a pair of tandem obstacles are tentatively designed to place in the region of cavity extent to control the highly dynamic blade cavitation the experimental and numerical methods are collaboratively undertaken to elaborate on the cavitation characteristics and control mechanism from the aspects of cavitation patterns pressure and velocity distributions and loading instabilities when the obstacles are implemented it is observed that the leading edge cavities are hard to generate at the incipient moderate developing and developed stages in comparison with original impeller however the energetic shear cavitation that usually occurs in the cores of turbulent vortices is triggered after the obstacles with foamy wakes the unsteady numerical results elucidate that the raised pressures induced by the former obstacle are largely responsible for the blade cavitation control on the other hand the flow deaccelerating around the leading edge as a result of additional apg acting is equally unfavorable to the bubble grow it is concluded that both the pressure enhancement and pressure gradients alternations established by obstacles substantially contribute to the blade cavitation control owing to the presence of igvs the blade cavitation of this pump is periodically modulated by non uniform wake flows which yields a forced cavity oscillations with the igvs passing frequency the position shifted cavitation practically enlarges the axial gap with the igvs wakes to avoid the strong interactions and then to suppress the blade cavitation induced instabilities the pressure and thrust fluctuations is consequently controlled by stabilizing cavity volume oscillations it is shown that the thrust spectra total energy in the low frequency 10 300 hz of obstacle pump is reduced a moderate amount compared with that of original pump currently the local obstacles rough the smooth blade wall and force the bypass of flows with bifurcation phenomenon which inevitably introduce violent pressure fluctuations and additional hydraulic loss these perturbations eventually result in 6 0 head drop and 5 6 efficiency degradation at the design point as measured by the experiments last but not least the shear cavitation triggered by obstacle usually occurs in the highly turbulent regimes and the generation mechanism performs a major distinction with blade cavitation involved in the original pump this nature determines that the obstacle cavitation inception is earlier than the normal blade cavitation as observed it is basically hard to be depressed by the obstacle due to its turbulent nature in order to obtain a more fundamental understanding on this kind of cavitation the resolved turbulent models are thought to be employed to explore the mechanism in depth combined with the above aspects the obstacle application is believed to be a promising method to control the dynamic behaviors and related instabilities of blade cavitation in a waterjet pump with igvs in addition the leading edge free of cavities also help mitigate the damages of material erosion although the middle part where obstacles implement suffers from aggressive shear cavitation in the future works the obstacle approach will be further investigated to balance the tradeoff between the performance penalty and the control effects on cavitation instabilities including the optimization of obstacle geometries and configurations funding data this work was

20748,the blade cavitation in a waterjet pump presents highly dynamic behaviors under the inflow non uniformities and unsteadiness this work designs a pair of tandem obstacles attached on the blade suction surface to control blade cavitation within the waterjet pump the unsteady simulations and experimental observation of the cavitating flow in a water tunnel are jointly carried out to study the control mechanism and control effects of obstacles it is observed that the blade leading edge regimes before the obstacle are nearly free of cavities at the incipient moderate developing and fully developed cavitation stages whereas the shear cavitation is triggered after each obstacle the cavitation control mechanism of obstacles is substantially attributable to the raised absolute pressure and the flow deceleration imposed by the adverse pressure gradient apg alternations in particular the position shifted cavitation effectively weakens the interactions of inlet guide vanes igvs wake and blade cavitation and hence to avoid the dynamic loading impingement around the leading edge regimes although a 5 6 hydraulic efficiency reduction is introduced as a result the root mean square rms of 10 300 hz of the obstacle thrust spectra is degraded with a pronounced amount in the following work the geometries and positions of obstacles will be further optimized to improve the cavitation control effects keywords waterjet pump blade cavitation cavitation control obstacles experiments numerical simulation 1 introduction it is well known that cavitation happens on propellers or pumps would give rise to undesirable propulsive performance deterioration blade erosion vibration and noise kuiper 1981 van wijngaarden 2011 chen et al 2020 usually above the critical condition the global performance of waterjet pumps changes few whereas the cavitation is already present even through small amount of cavities produce in the incipient stage the erosion and noise emission have occurred prior to the performance breakdown due to unsteady nature of cavities ardnt 1981 brennen 1994 2006 the developed sheet and tip cavitation that commonly occurs on the propeller or waterjet pump would also interact with the hull and systems to bring about global surge instabilities duttweiler and brennen 2002 meanwhile the interactions between flow perturbations and blade cavitation would also introduce severe cavity and pressure oscillations for a pump such as the turbulent inflow and non uniform wakes korkut and atlar 2002 ji et al 2012 pereira et al 2016 in such a context cavitation control has increasingly received much attention to minimize these undesirable damages and improve the cavitation performance including the cavitation inception delay and vibration and noise performance improvement in particular various control methods have ever been developed to control dynamic pump cavitation such as the j grooves inducer choi et al 2006 polymer injection chahine et al 1993 flexible thread lee et al 2018 propeller optimization vesting and bensow 2011 air filled membrane lee at al 2015 biomimetic blade shi et al 2016 and blade roughness asnaghi at al 2021 although there are many solutions proposed to eliminate the cavitation damages a practical and targeted control approach is still substantially inadequate and under developed this work makes an attempt to employ the obstacle application to stabilize the blade cavitation that has been observed to present highly dynamic behaviors under the wake perturbations of inlet guide vanes igvs the obstacle method was originally proposed to hold back the re entrant jet flow to depress the cloud cavitation kawanami et al 1997 experimentally confirmed that the obstacles could efficiently block the re entrant jet and found that the spanwise obstacle ranging at 0 37 times chord length presented notable effects on the drag and noise reduction rather than streamwise arrangement subsequently pham et al 1999 sato et al 2002 zhao et al 2010 and zhang et al 2018 re examined the cloud cavitation mechanism and the control effects of obstacles with respect to cavity patterns noise emission lift drag oscillations and cavity strength etc experimentally or numerically and their results also provided further geometrical optimization of obstacle inside a pump apart from the re entrant jet prevention the pressure alternations triggered by obstacle have also been proved to be physically favorable to cavitation suppression li et al 2009 found that the cavities attached around the head of a revolution body could be depressed by the multiple grooves implementation which was attributable to the groove induced high pressure waves propagating towards upstream recently che et al 2019 studied the control mechanisms of obstacle bar for both attached and cloud cavitation on naca0015 by high speed video and dynamic pressure measurement their results illuminated that for the attached cavitation in absence of re entrant jet flow the increased upstream pressure excited by the obstacle could also suppress the leading edge cavitation it can be seen that the obstacle with appropriate arrangement would play multiple roles to control cavitation in terms of different mechanisms correspondingly the effects of obstacle re entrant jet prevention or pressure enhancement are believed to be equally effective to control cloud or attached cavitation occurred in pumps the blade cavitation within this pump has been observed to present a thin attached pattern and perform highly dynamic behaviors under the inflow non uniform condition alternatively by utilizing the excited high pressures the obstacles is tentatively designed to control the blade cavitation in this waterjet pump in this work the experimental and numerical approaches are jointly conducted to examine the control mechanism of obstacles on blade cavitation in the waterjet pump with igvs the body of this work is organized as follows in section 2 the experimental facilities and techniques adopted by this work are described including the measurement uncertainty assessment meanwhile combined with the observation of blade cavitation characteristics in this pump the implementation of obstacle proposal and design concept are introduced and hence preliminarily determines the basic geometrical parameters section 3 presents the mesh generation and numerical validation in detail for the original and obstacle pump section 4 comparatively examines the blade cavitation evolutions inside the pumps by high speed video and simulation pressure and velocity distributions and loading instabilities to elaborate on the cavitation control mechanism and effects of the obstacles finally the conclusions are summarized and drawn 2 experiment setup and test model 2 1 experiment setup the experiments are carried out in a water tunnel in the unit shanghai ship and shipping research institute the layout of the experimental system is shown in fig 1 a the pump system including shaft duct igvs and impeller component are presented in fig 1b the dimension of this water tunnel test section is 0 6 m 0 6 m square with a length of 2 6 m observation window the test pump system is installed in the center of the water tunnel with 0 degree shaft inclination the j25 dynamometer kempf remmers germany is instrumented in front of the pump to measure the thrust torque and rotation speed which are simultaneously recorded by the monitoring system the full scale of the thrust torque and rotation speed measurement is 3 kn 150 n m and 3000 rpm respectively with an uncertainly of 0 2 full scale f s the work velocity of this water tunnel is 3 12 m s which is measured by the venturi flow rate with an uncertainty of 0 5 f s the ambient pressure is measured by a static pressure transducer siemens c73451 a328 germany with a scale of 0 100 kpa and an accuracy of 0 25 f s the honeycombs are installed upstream to regulate the flow and degrade the turbulent intensity a nozzle shaped conduit is mounted before the test section to organize the flow with a contraction ratio of 5 96 a vacuum pump equipped downstream is used to adjust the tunnel pressure to create a cavitation environment before the experiments a degassing process is conducted to maintain the dissolved oxygen content at a stable value of 0 6 saturation about 5 ppm in the standard temperature and pressure condition two high speed cameras memrecam hx canon japan and motion pro y3 idt u s are used to capture cavitation images at a phase angle of 45 some lamps are placed to illuminate the test objective to produce uniform lights two high speed videos are simultaneously triggered to capture the dynamic pump cavitation with a sampling frequency of 15 k frames per second the focuses of two cameras are concentrating on the leading edge hx and tip of pump blade idt with respect to front and side views the images captured by camera 1 hx are used to analyze the typical blade cavitation patterns the performance data and cavitation images are acquired when the pump is stably operating for a while three typical cavitation stages are eventually selected for subsequent analysis as described in section 4 1 2 2 test model the basic parameters and operating conditions of this pump are listed in table 1 the obstacles are implemented on the original impeller without any other geometrical modifications as shown in fig 2 a the blade cavitation at the design point that is subject to a low angle of attack aoa presents as a thinner vapor filed pattern that initiates from the leading edge different from the typical cloud cavitation on hydrofoil the roller type behaviors associated with large scale shedding is not identified thus the idea to inhibit transient re entrant flow seems not that available in this waterjet pump an alternative to control cavitation is to enhance the pressures around the blade leading edge which might be also feasible to control the onset and development of cavitating flow referred to the obstacle arrangements on hydrofoil in kawanami et al 1997 pham et al 1999 sato et al 2002 zhao et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 che et al 2019 a pair of tandem obstacles are tentatively designed considering the local cavity extent and thickness on the pump blade the former obstacle close to the leading edge is conceived to enhance the pressures to depress the blade cavitation development the latter one is preliminarily designated to stabilize the wake flow induced by the former one as sketched in fig 2b the spanwise obstacles are supposed to arrange in the region where the cavitation is developing and the height of the obstacles could not exceed the local cavity thickness to break the normal internal flow thus the latter obstacle is slightly higher than that of the former one considering the thicker cavity thickness there the profile of obstacles is designed as a triangle with rounded edges to avoid steep gradients and strong shear stress with these considerations the basic geometrical parameters for this pump are given in table 2 and the sketch of obstacle profile is shown in fig 3 for simplicity the pump with obstacles is denoted as obs to distinguish it from the original impeller ori in the following sections the impeller is fabricated from aluminum material on a five axis computerized numerical control machine as shown in fig 4 the basic pump parameters are defined as follows to represent the operating conditions and the pump performance conveniently with the water tunnel experiments 1 q v i n π d 2

impeller diameter m ρ is the water density at 25 c and 1 atm kg m3 and p v is the saturated pressure of water at 25 c pa table 1 the uncertainty assessment of experimental results is required before the formal analysis during the experiments the variations of temperature and density of water medium tw ρ and the diameter of impeller d are insignificantly varied thus these variables could be safely neglected and assumed as constants during the experiments under the 0 95 confidence interval the uncertainty of v in p t n and m which are respectively denoted as δv in δp δt δn and δm these variables could correspondingly work out the uncertainty of flow rates δq and the uncertainty of head δh in this assessment the functional variables η and σ are calculated from the above independent variables

were also evaluated in the 0 95 confidence interval based on the propagation error method the relative uncertainty of η and σ is finally calculated as δη η 0 0374 and δσ σ 0 0095 respectively 3 numerical methodology 3 1 turbulence model and cavitation model the turbulent model and cavitation model employed by this work is unsteady sst and z g b respectively the unsteady shear stress transport sst k ω model with curvature correction and local turbulence viscosity correction is adopted to capture the dynamic cavitating flow the calculations are performed using the commercial package ansys cfx 18 0 the sst k ω model proposed by menter 1994 is a robust and reliable tool to predict separation and strong adverse pressure gradient of industrial flows accurately which combines the advantages of k ω near the wall with k ε model in the far field in addition the flows in a pump are sensitive to the rotating system thus an empirical method suggested by spalart and shur 1997 is embedded to constrain the production term the unsteady sst k ω turbulent model with curvature correction is well documented in ansys help 2017 and has been enabled in this study for the case of two phase flow simulation the regular sst k ω model usually over predicts the turbulence eddy viscosity and is therefore insufficient to capture the cavitation shedding behaviors accurately following the work of coutier delgosha et al 2003 a density function f ρ m is introduced to replace the mixture density ρ m to degrade the turbulence eddy viscosity μ t in the mixture regime the replace term is defined as 9 f ρ m ρ v ρ m ρ v n ρ l ρ v n 1 n 1 10 μ t f ρ m a 1 k max a 1 ω s f 2 where n is 10 while k and ω is the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent frequency respectively a 1 s and f 2 are the model coefficients based on the homogenous assumption zgb cavitation model zwart et al 2004 is developed from a simplified rayleigh plesset equation a cavitation process is governed by a continuity equation with the mass source term of vapor and given as 11 ρ m f v t ρ m u i f v x i m m where f v is the vapor mass fraction m is the liquid vaporization rate m is the vapor condensation rate the simplified rayleigh plesset equation rpe is utilized to characterize the condensation and vaporization process and thus to derive the respective cavitation rate by negating the second order terms in the rpe the equation is reduced as 12 3 2 d r b d t 2 p v p ρ l where r b is the simplified bubble radius p v is the saturated vapor pressure and p is the pressure at infinity therefore the deduced cavitation transfer rate can be written as 13 d m b d t ρ v d v b d t ρ v d d t 4 3 π r b 3 4 π ρ v r b 2 2 3 p v p ρ l where ρv is the vapor density and vb is the bubble volume assuming that there are nb bubbles per unit volume the volume fraction αv can be expressed as 14 α v v b n b 4 3 π r b 3 n b therefore the total mass transfer cavitation rate per unit volume is derived as 15 m 3 α v ρ v r b 2 3 p v p ρ l p p v the number of nucleation sites must decrease since there is the vapor volume fraction increases for the process of vaporization α v can be replaced by α nuc 1 α v eq 15 can be rewritten as follows 16 m c e 3 α n u c 1 α v ρ v r b 2 3 p v p ρ l p p v for the process of condensation it can be deduced as 17 m c c 3 α v ρ v r b 2 3 p v p ρ l p p v where α nuc is the volume fraction of nuclei c e and c c are empirical factors for the vaporization and the condensation processes with recommended values of 50 and 0 01 p v is the saturated vapor pressure at 25 c and evaluates as 3169 pa according to the nist table α nuc has the value of 5 10 4 and r b is the typical bubble size with the value of 1 10 6 3 2 numerical settings and validation the blockage ε a d c where a d is the disk area of propeller and c is the area of test section cross section for current water tunnel is 0 0872 that is less than the empirical criterion 0 1 as suggested by wilson 1994 hence the centered pump flows can be assumed to be negligibly affected by the confinement effects in light of this the computational domain of this work is safely constructed as an enlarged cylinder to completely preclude the wall effects and the results reliability for similar configurations with water tunnel experiment has been validated by kumar and mahesh 2017 and yu et al 2019 as shown in fig 5 the computational domain comprises three main parts i e a cylinder with a length of 16d and diameter of 8d a stator domain and a rotor domain for the sst model the automatic wall function is implemented in cfx solver which implies that the near wall resolution completely depends on the local grid distributions therefore the all hexahedral element meshes are generated for these domains as shown by the clipped middle plane and impeller surface as shown in fig 6 these meshes have the benefits of well suited node distributions and grid orthogonality the non dimensional distance y is evaluated to examine to the boundary layer resolution of near wall mesh the overall y on the obstacle impeller is below 100 except that on the local twisted faces regarding to about 200 due to the complex geometry as shown in fig 7 menter et al 2003a 2003b argued that for the order of y 100 the shifts of automatic wall function can guarantee that all solutions follow the logarithm profile with variations of less than 2 compared with the resolved case y 0 2 for the obstacle case the near wall mesh treatments even for a local high y satisfy the requirements of sst to simulate such a complex flow the grid independency study is provided in table 3 and fig 8 h cfd and h efd represent the experimental and numerical results respectively it is shown that the head error validated by the experiment data is gradually decreased with total mesh increment and the predicting results are converging at g3 case that is consequently selected as the final grid in terms of 6905912 and 7495074 hexahedra elements for the ori and obs model respectively the cfx solver uses an element based finite volume method which employs finite element shape functions to approximate the integration nodes the advection and diffusion terms for this calculation are discretized by high resolution scheme and the transient term is solved by the second order backward euler scheme these schemes enable the second order accuracy of the solutions for the temporal spatial discretization the boundary condition setups are shown in fig 5 wherein a uniform velocity profile with turbulent intensity 2 is set at the inlet that is consistent with the measured data the free slip wall is given on the outer domain and no slip wall condition is specified on the igvs impeller and duct walls the sliding mesh technology is adopted to simulate the rotor stator interference effects the transient frozen rotor model is employed to accomplish the interface data transfer between rotating and static domains the time step is required to ensure temporal discretion accuracy which directly corresponds with the courant number considering the compromise between robust accuracy and computational efficiency the time step is selected as time discretized interval corresponding to 1 passing for each time iteration loop with respect to a mean courant number of 5 68 the residual of velocity components and pressure term is below 10 5 and that of turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent frequency equation is below 10 4 in each time iteration the duration of this calculation lasts 11 rotating cycles and the first cycle is abandoned with the consideration of numerical instabilities the last 10 cycles are employed to analyze the flow characteristics for the cases of obstacle cavitation simulation we found that the cavitation patterns are always overestimated that could not accurately match with the experimental observations the deep reason is owing to that the obstacle cavitation is intimately correlated with the turbulent coherent structures that however have been averaged by current rans model in order to overcome this issue we empirically rematch the cavitation patterns within the obstacle pump by adjusting the ambient pressures eventually the cavitation index involved is corrected towards a high value with a constant gap of 0 9 4 results and discussion 4 1 pump performance hydraulic and cavitation performances are measured in the cavitation tunnel as presented in fig 9 and fig 10 in comparison with smooth original blade the spanwise obstacles are non streamlined and almost perpendicular to the inflow which unavoidably introduces extra hydraulic loss and reflects as performance penalty as shown in fig 9 compared with ori model the head of obs model drops approximately 6 at various flow rates the pump efficiency gap increases with the increment of flow rates with respect to 5 6 degradation at the design point for most of passive control methods the good cavitation performance and high hydraulic efficiency are usually contradictory such as the unloading design to improve the cavitation performance in the case of cavitation condition the head gap remains a nearly constant amount at different cavitation stages this phenomenon manifests that the global performance is less influenced by the obstacles under cavitation condition therefore for an integrated blade design the head compensation should consider before the obstacles designing the head drop point of ori and obs models is around the cavitation number 2 5 in general the critical npsh with respect to 3 head drop is widely employed to assess the pump suction performance however this work pays more attention on the control of cavitation instability that occurs before the head drops on the other hand it is observed that the bubbles would come out in the oncoming flow when the ambient pressure further decrease thus three equivalent stages for both models before the head drops are selected to study the control effects namely incipient moderate developing and developed stages as circled in fig 10 it should be noted that the obstacle cavitation that is strongly correlated to the turbulent vortices usually occurs earlier than the attached cavitation on original pump therefore in order to present a fair comparison there is a slight deviation of cavitation index for the inception stage 4 2 cavitation patterns for the pump flow at design point it is observed that the blade cavitation presents a form of sheet cavitation and develop to a patch cavitation pattern when the ambient pressure drops to a sufficient level this attached pattern is mainly attributable to the low aoa distributions at the design point based on the research on the leading edge cavitation dynamics of 2 hydrofoil farhat et al 2002 the sustainment of leading edge cavities can be assumed as the continuous feeding of explode nuclei rather than a shelter formed by laminar separation bubble in such framework the blade cavitation inception can be thought to be largely depending on the minimum pressure around the blade leading edge 18 σ vi c p min 19 c p min p min p 0 5 ρ n d 2 where σ vi is the incipient cavitation index and cp min is the minimum pressure coefficient around the blade leading edge once the cavitation incepts the cavities would inertially grow and develop downstream and finally collapse in the high pressure regimes the unsteady bubbles shedding at the end of cavities could trigger a local loading instability at the closure regimes what s more for this waterjet pump the blade cavitation is invariably disturbed by the periodic unsteady igvs wakes which would additionally lead to drastic cavity volume oscillations and then to induce dynamic blade loading this global instabilities with forced modulation actually contribute more to the blade vibrations these dynamic behaviors of blade cavitation could be demonstrated as a result of the inflow non uniformities and unsteadiness which are commonly happening on the propeller or pump with igvs or other obstructers upstream such as rudder of boat basically an effective way to depress the cavitation dynamic behaviors is to enlarge the axial gap between the igvs and rotor blades with the pressure alternations these instabilities are believed to be controlled by positioning obstacles on cavitation regime specifically the design of obstacles have been described in the test model section with accounting of cavitation characteristics of this pump this work equivalently selects three cavitation stages in terms of incipient developing moderate developing and fully developed stages to compare with respective stages on original pump figs 11 13 present the cavitation patterns captured by high speed video and unsteady numerical simulation at different instants regarding to 10 phase lag for adjacent images the abbreviations exp and num refer to the experimental and numerical results respectively for the cavitation stage ⅰ and ⅱ the cavitation predicted by the numerical method agrees well with the experiments except a slight overprediction around the blade root and the leading edge regime before the former obstacle is nearly free of cavities as the cavitation developing in contrast for the design point of ori blade the blade cavitation is observed to initiate from the leading edge and spatially uneven developing due to the spanwise difference of loading sensitivities besides the igvs wake would periodically impinge on the blade cavitation to induce severe cavity oscillations after the obstacle implemented the obstacle cavitation is observed to be more stable at different instants than the blade cavitation in original pump for the case of stage ⅲ as shown in fig 13 the cavitation on the ori nearly covers the blade middle and upper parts and large scale cavitation is observed to shed as a whole patch and to collapse downstream comparatively even at such a sufficient low cavitation number σ 2 432 the blade cavitation with obstacles is still hard to develop from the leading edge from the prospective of cavitation appearance the turbulent bubbly flows are consistently present behind each obstacle and the small scale cavities are partially shedding at the end of the bubbly cavities whereas the vapor filled cavitation attaches the leading edge of original blade by comparing the cavitation position and extension it is seen that the blade cavitation could be substantially suppressed by the obstacles although the shear cavitation are independently triggered after each obstacle as a result the cavitation induced instabilities such as the pressure and thrust fluctuations caused by the uneven and dynamic loading could be presumably controlled to some degree as the blade cavitation depression these aspects would be examined subsequently in addition the shear cavitation induced by the obstacles is found to be coherently present in the turbulent shear layers and its inception closely correlates to the local reynolds number in terms of the obstacle height and velocity magnitude franc and micheal 2005 for this reason the obstacle cavitation inception is usually earlier than that of blade cavitation the obstacle cavitation is a typical vortex cavitation that involves multi physical realizations and a high fidelity simulation usually requires access to a resolved turbulent model such as detach eddy simulation or large eddy simulation for which there has to be an empirical pressure adjustment to accommodate the experimental observations as mentioned previously currently the urans method has been validated to be able to capture the dynamic behaviors of pump cavitation which is reliable to elaborate on the cavitation control effects as well although the leading edge cavitation could be substantially controlled by raising the pressure and decelerating the flow turbulent wake cavitation is undesirably introduced by the obstacles a strong shear layer would be triggered as the flow encounters each obstacle locally this shear instability are further amplified by the perturbations upstream and then the flows evolves into turbulence associated with fertile vortices production with the ambient pressure decreasing the shear cavitation usually occurs in these low pressure cores of coherent vortices according to studies on shear cavitation both minimum pressure and pressure fluctuations are equally contribute to the shear cavitation inception franc and micheal 2005 these facts on shear cavitation technically implies the difficulties on its modelling by the urans model considering the nature of turbulent vortices the shear cavitation is much energetic and aggressive as presented in figs 11 13 the obstacle cavitation that performs with a frothy appearance is constructed by massive vapor filaments that will be subsequently entrained by the main flow and finally experiences severe collapsing in the high pressure regimes here non dimensional vorticity based on the obstacle height is defined as 20 ω z ω z h v t i p where ω z is the vorticity in the z direction h is the obstacle height and v tip is the velocity at blade tip fig 14 a presents the superimposition of non dimensional vorticity at non cavitating case and iso lines of 10 vapor volume fraction at σ 5 043 it is seen that the obstacle cavitation nearly initiate at the arc apex wherein the high sheared vortices produces fig 14b presents the superimposition of tke at non cavitating case and iso lines of 10 vapor volume fraction the cavitation regime approximately coincides with the high tke region which manifests that the obstacle cavitation development mainly rely on the turbulent level namely the fluid inertia basically the cavity behind the latter obstacle is longer than that of former one because the corresponding height although there appears to be a shelter provided by former one the high pressures and apg established by the later obstacle does not perform the expected effects to control the turbulent cavitation triggered by former one conversely the obstacle cavitation would give rise to significant damage when collapsing in the apg regime franc and micheal 2005 therefore in order to minimize the disadvantages of obstacle cavitation the turbulent structures will be resolved with the help of high fidelity cfd techniques to provide more optimization information on the obstacle height as a whole the obstacles design should reasonably consider the tradeoff between the blade cavitation control effects and the obstacle induced cavitation itself 4 3 pressure enhancement for the case of design point the pump flows are subjected to a low aoa condition that imply the blade cavitation inception and development largely depends on the minimum pressure and pressure distributions on the leading edge rather than the flow separation the research on the obstacle hydrofoil has experimentally demonstrated the pressure raising effects on the attached cavitation control che et al 2019 thus in order to shed light on the control mechanism in this pump the minimum pressure and statistical blade loadings are numerically examined fig 15 gives the minimum pressure coefficient cp min at initial phase angle around the leading edge at the spans of obstacles arranged it is seen that the cp min on the obs spans are globally higher than that of ori spans where the obstacle is placed the cp min gap is gradually reduced as closing to the blade tip regimes the reason responsible for this phenomenon is attributable to the spanwise loading sensitivities of perturbations that are determined by the loading specifications at the initial design stage basically the current trend of cp min difference is consistent with this pump design concept in terms of middle part loading shroud and hub unloading based on the minimum pressure criterion of cavitation inception the σ vi on the obs blade is lower than that on the ori blade with a difference above 1 0 which denotes a high potential of the obs blade to delay the cavitation theoretically the growth and collapsing of a spherical bubble are known to be governed by the rayleigh plesset equation in this case neglecting the second order terms surface tension and viscosity terms the bubble growth rate is degenerated as 21 r 2 p v p 3 ρ l where p is the ambient pressure and ρ l is the liquid density it is informed that the bubble growth is largely driven by the pressure difference when a cavitation nuclei expose to a low pressure region as a result the raised minimum pressures are unfavorable to the cavitation nuclei growth and development and then the blade cavitation is well depressed it can be elucidated that the raised minimum pressure is one dominate mechanism to control the blade cavitation fig 16 shows the root mean square rms pressure distribution on different spans for different spans the pressures gradually raise before each obstacle and culminate a local maximum value and then suddenly drop to a local minimum value as encountering the arc apex of each obstacle these sudden dropped pressures around the obstacles are much lower than the minimum pressure around the blade leading edge which implies that the obstacles would potentially trigger cavitation earlier the experimental observations show that the obstacle cavitation inception is much earlier than the blade cavitation and the cavitation inception index difference approaches 1 2 for this pump it should be noted that the shear cavitation inception is not only depending on the minimum pressure but also on the turbulent vortices franc and micheal 2005 in this sense the obstacles trigger another type of cavitation downstream to protect the blade leading edge from cavitating which equivalently enlarge the axial gap between igvs wake and cavitation in an alternative way the high pressure excited by the latter obstacle is originally conceived to depress the upstream cavitation but does not play the expected role which can be explained that the flows behind former obstacle contain too much energy to be depressed as indicated by the tke distributions in fig 17 in addition the turbulent flow after the latter obstacle still provide more energy to resist boundary layer separation occurred at the blade trailing edge this second pressure drop in span 0 7 is due to spanwise convection from the bottom of the blade as indicated by the streamlines in fig 17 under the acting of the centrifugal and coriolis accelerations the flow particles move towards the blade tip and are constrained by the obstacles the inclined line of the bubbly cavitation in fig 12a also gives evidence to these convection effects 4 4 decelerating effects apart from the absolute pressure enhancement effects of obstacles the pressure gradient alternations equally contribute to the cavitation control as informed by euler equation the pressure gradient term could change the situation of flow acceleration and then affect the cavitating flow as shown in fig 18 a the relative velocity distributions on the lines normal to the blade surface are presented to examine flow accelerations after the obstacle implemented the current mesh could resolve the velocity in the logarithmic layer which is representative to examine the boundary layer characteristics this postulation agrees well with the velocity distribution in fig 18b which denotes a rather thinner boundary layer around the leading edge that gradually thicken along the streamwise direction the obstacle is located outside of the local boundary layer as indicated in fig 18b under the acting of adverse pressure gradient apg formed by obstacles the flow particles are forcibly decelerated in the out region span 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 and therefore lead to the pressures raising according to the bernoulli s equation the velocity distributions in the boundary layer do not change significantly and perform the similar trend for both blades except for p4 line that is much close to the former obstacle it is seen that the obstacles mainly change the velocity in the outer region instead of the inner boundary layer when such an additional apg imposed different from the cloud cavitation on hydrofoil that sustains in a separated regime the blade cavitation within this pump with respect to small aoa is not subjected to flow separation hypothetically referred to the cloud cavitation control on hydrofoil the blade cavitation would still happen if the obstacles are virtually located in the laminar separation bubble however this is not consistent with current observations that the blade leading edge is almost free of cavities these facts further justify that the blade cavitation inception are largely depending upon the pressure distributions on the other hand the difference of cavitation inception index between ori and obs blade is approached to 1 0 as shown in fig 15 which nominally means that the cavitation would occur on obs blade as the σ vi decrease lower 1 0 than that of ori blade namely the cavitation performance would be shifted with a value of δcp min however the leading edge cavitation on obs blade is not observed to happen even at a shifted cavitation number by adding the δcp min this discrepancy attributes to the pressure gradient alternations that has a significant effect on the fluid inertial movement as governed by the momentum equation for a bubble growth the fluid inertia would dominate when the pressure difference terms p v p in eq 21 is constant d agostino and salvetti 2017 in this case the deceleration of fluid particle caused by the apg is similarly unfavorable to the cavitation bubble growth therefore the cavitation inception on the obs blade would perform different behaviors even though the same cp min is virtually reached as a summary the blade cavitation control is considerably attributable to both the pressure enhancement and flow deceleration 4 5 cavitation induced pressure fluctuations the blade cavitation in this waterjet pump with igvs is significantly modulated by the periodic unsteady inflows the blade cavitation after the obstacles implemented has been shifted in the blade middle part which is practically enlarged the axial gap with the igvs wakes in this sense the obstacle cavitation would be less sensitive to the periodic modulations upstream as a result the leading edge part that is free of cavities could efficiently avoid the drastic cavity collapsing under the inflow impacts the associated loading instabilities caused by non uniform and unsteady inflow will consequently be improved in some extent in order to fairly evaluate the control effects the cavitation developing stage ⅱ and ⅲ for ori and obs pump are compared since they both have close cavitation number figs 19 21 present the pressure spectra at the span 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 where the obstacles place the former obstacle and latter one is marked as 1 and 2 respectively for the original pump the pressure amplitude regarding to the igvs passing frequency f s 11 times shaft frequency ω is evidently high along the streamwise position where the cavitation develops especially for the span 0 6 and 0 7 comparatively it is showed that only a limited leading edge part of obstacle blade suffers from the periodic igvs wake impacts for the involved cavitation conditions owing to that the leading edge is free of cavities the flow around the obstacle is still affected by the inflow perturbations the pressure oscillations around each obstacle are correspondingly intensified for the non cavitating and cavitation case and the amplitude varies little as the obstacle cavitation developed which plausibly manifests that the obstacle cavitation is more stable and then fluctuates with a small amplitude as shown in figs 22 24 the blade cavitation for both ori and obs would both induce low frequency components on the thrust spectra that are below the igvs passing frequency f s these instabilities are supposed to be attributable to the cavity volume fluctuations ji et al 2011 as to the broadband noise in thrust spectra the streamwise pressure spectra at spans suggest that the leading edge part is thought to definitely contribute to these cavitation induced low frequency instabilities besides the low frequency regimes at the aft part of span 0 9 are obviously intensified due to the obstacle triggered cavities collapsing there it should be noted that the tip leakage flow also exhibits significant impact on the cavitating flow at the span 0 9 to introduce additional instabilities the spatial pressure spectra deterministically contribute to the global thrust performance as indicated in figs 22 24 the broadband low frequency is consistently present that is caused by the uneven and dynamic cavitation induced loading impingement on the ori and obs especially for the frequency below 300 hz that includes the igvs passing frequency f s it can be postulated that the cavitating flow in the pump may induce the low frequency vibration although they involve different cavitation types when the cavitation shifts on the middle part the low frequency components of the leading edge cavitation would be practically weaken with the depression of that by obstacles the spectral characteristics of impeller thrust involve much modulation information and cavitation dynamic behaviors which is not pursued here fig 25 and fig 26 examine the standard deviation in time domain and rms of thrust amplitude ranged 10 300 hz frequency of particular interest respectively both these second order statistics indicate that the thrust fluctuations and broadband low frequency noise could be reduced by the obstacles with a moderate amount although the turbulent shear cavitation is inevitably introduced the obstacles perform substantially potential to eliminate the low frequency instabilities induced by leading edge cavitation by passively shifting the cavities downstream to avoid the unsteady inflow perturbations which is of practical importance for the pumps with stringent requirement of vibration and noise 4 6 discussion although the obstacle method is originally utilized to hold back the re entrant jets that give rise to cloud cavitation it has been proved that the raised pressures induced by the obstacles could substantially depress the blade cavitation as well as pointed by franc and michael 2005 there have to be two physical necessities to produce a rough re entrant jet cavity thickness and apg for a pump operating at low aoa usually in terms of design point once the blade profile parameters are specified i e the camber curvature thickness distribution the loading and velocity distributions fundamentally determine the further developing pattern after the cavitation inception for these reasons the blade cavitation on the rotating blade with slender profile is less observed to shed as larger scale cavities triggered by the re entrant jet impingement in addition duttweiler and brennen 2002 had ever identified a steady side entrant jet on propeller surface which attributes to the spanwise flow gradient and does not result in cavity shedding similarly the inflow non uniformity in this pump leads to the uneven cavity distributions along the radical direction the absence of side entrant jet in this pump can be plausibly illustrated as the thin cavities that specifically develop on the slender blade with low aoa aside from the cavity thickness as a necessity for flow jets the cavity length has been theoretically confirmed to be responsible for various flow instabilities for a pump or hydrofoil cavitation tsujimoto et al 2008 accordingly the cavitation could be stabilized by controlling the cavity thickness and length as the blade cavitation developed a large scale cavitation patch shedding is also identified in this pump the reduced cavity length by obstacles is therefore favorable to depress that instability in general the blade leading edge is a prominent part that largely determines the energy conversion capability for a waterjet pump the leading edge flow impacts and cavities collapsing additionally give rise to undesirable vibration and noise the interactions of igvs wake and blade cavitation would enhance the pressure and cavity volume oscillations and hence worsen above damages although the shear cavitation is inevitably triggered by obstacles the leading edge remains free of cavities even at a sufficient low cavitation index the cavitation dynamic behaviors caused by inflow unsteadiness is consequently controlled by keeping a clean leading edge as shown in figs 19 21 the pressure oscillations around the leading edge of obs are much lower than that of ori impeller it has been demonstrated that the drastic cavity volume variations are mainly responsible for the pressure fluctuations to trigger vibration and noise ji et al 2011 2012 2013 the globally stable cavity pattern in the obs are consequently performing weaker impacts than that of ori model however the local pressure pulsations are more severe behind the obstacles since the flow becomes more turbulent there as a result the instabilities i e vibration and noise caused by cavity volume oscillations could be correspondingly suppressed by obstacles for waterjet pumps with igvs lastly it should be noted that the turbulent shear cavitation is considerably erosive in nature and a further structural optimization is necessarily required as observed the latter obstacle also triggers shear cavities and actually contributes little to the leading edge cavitation suppression a practical alternation for optimization is trying to remove the later obstacle to decrease the flow loss in addition the obstacle height can be redesign based on current research on the shear cavitation 5 concluding remarks this work explores the availability and mechanism of the obstacle method on the control of blade cavitation and related instabilities in a waterjet pump with igvs a pair of tandem obstacles are tentatively designed to place in the region of cavity extent to control the highly dynamic blade cavitation the experimental and numerical methods are collaboratively undertaken to elaborate on the cavitation characteristics and control mechanism from the aspects of cavitation patterns pressure and velocity distributions and loading instabilities when the obstacles are implemented it is observed that the leading edge cavities are hard to generate at the incipient moderate developing and developed stages in comparison with original impeller however the energetic shear cavitation that usually occurs in the cores of turbulent vortices is triggered after the obstacles with foamy wakes the unsteady numerical results elucidate that the raised pressures induced by the former obstacle are largely responsible for the blade cavitation control on the other hand the flow deaccelerating around the leading edge as a result of additional apg acting is equally unfavorable to the bubble grow it is concluded that both the pressure enhancement and pressure gradients alternations established by obstacles substantially contribute to the blade cavitation control owing to the presence of igvs the blade cavitation of this pump is periodically modulated by non uniform wake flows which yields a forced cavity oscillations with the igvs passing frequency the position shifted cavitation practically enlarges the axial gap with the igvs wakes to avoid the strong interactions and then to suppress the blade cavitation induced instabilities the pressure and thrust fluctuations is consequently controlled by stabilizing cavity volume oscillations it is shown that the thrust spectra total energy in the low frequency 10 300 hz of obstacle pump is reduced a moderate amount compared with that of original pump currently the local obstacles rough the smooth blade wall and force the bypass of flows with bifurcation phenomenon which inevitably introduce violent pressure fluctuations and additional hydraulic loss these perturbations eventually result in 6 0 head drop and 5 6 efficiency degradation at the design point as measured by the experiments last but not least the shear cavitation triggered by obstacle usually occurs in the highly turbulent regimes and the generation mechanism performs a major distinction with blade cavitation involved in the original pump this nature determines that the obstacle cavitation inception is earlier than the normal blade cavitation as observed it is basically hard to be depressed by the obstacle due to its turbulent nature in order to obtain a more fundamental understanding on this kind of cavitation the resolved turbulent models are thought to be employed to explore the mechanism in depth combined with the above aspects the obstacle application is believed to be a promising method to control the dynamic behaviors and related instabilities of blade cavitation in a waterjet pump with igvs in addition the leading edge free of cavities also help mitigate the damages of material erosion although the middle part where obstacles implement suffers from aggressive shear cavitation in the future works the obstacle approach will be further investigated to balance the tradeoff between the performance penalty and the control effects on cavitation instabilities including the optimization of obstacle geometries and configurations funding data this work was

20749,theoretical solutions including the morison equation have been widely used to estimate the wave forces exerted on offshore structures of vertical cylindrical configuration however none of those methods can accurately predict the wave force of the secondary load cycle induced by a steep wave acting on the cylinder in this study regular waves of different wave steepness are generated using an experimental wave flume with a piston type wavemaker and the forces exerted on the cylinders of three different diameters are investigated using the data fitting method the difference between the experimentally measured wave force and that calculated by the morison equation is empirically formulated and the effects of key non dimensional parameters on the force difference function are analyzed the results show that the amplitude and phase of the force difference function are mainly governed by the incident wave condition including the relative depth relative amplitude and relative elevation on the other hand the effect of the relative radius is negligible when the diameter to wavelength ratio satisfies the small scale structure condition the proposed equation is valid for predicting the non breaking regular wave forces exerted on a vertical cylinder when the secondary load cycle occurs and can be utilized in wave structure interaction problems keywords experimental wave flume regular wave secondary load cycle wave force morison equation 1 introduction many kinds of fixed floating and semi submerged offshore structures including production platforms and ocean research stations have been constructed for the development and exploration of marine resources and renewable energies various types of loads such as wind current and wave loads are continuously exerted on offshore structures and therefore the external force needs to be accurately predicted to ensure the safeties of offshore structures lee and hong 2020a b numerous studies employing an experimental wave flume and numerical wave tank have been conducted with the aim of accurately generating waves to reproduce the wave load the dominant load among the natural external loads dean and dalrymple 1991 presented a wave transfer function for piston and flap type wavemakers using the linear wave theory in their transfer function the wave height to stroke ratio is a function of the relative depth a host of studies have compared the results by wavemaker experiments and by the wave transfer function to verify the accuracy of the linear waves experimentally generated ursell et al 1960 krvavica et al 2018 lee et al 2020 to generate realistic oceanic waves using experimental wave flumes the higher order wave theory has been often utilized schäffer 1996 by the stokes perturbation equation madsen 1971 and flick and guza 1980 derived a second order wavemaker equation for piston and flap type wavemakers respectively and the limitation of the proposed theory was described by the use of the ursell number many offshore structures have vertical structural members with a circular cross section and therefore experiments and numerical studies for the estimation of the wave forces have mainly focused on circular cylinders in the long wave regime first order diffraction loads can be accurately predicted by the morison equation if the inertia term is retained malenica and molin 1995 morison et al 1950 reported that the wave force consists of two components the drag and inertia forces when unbroken surface waves are exerted on a cylindrical object by means of linear wave theory and measured data for small and medium scale structures with the diameter to wavelength ratio d l smaller than 0 2 the morison equation is still widely used in predicting the horizontal wave force however the morison equation is not capable of accurately predicting the wave force for the larger ratio of the diameter to wavelength because the wave diffraction effect is not trivial demirbilek and gaston 1985 based on the first order diffraction theory maccamy and fuchs 1954 derived a wave force equation for large scale structures with d l larger than 0 2 to predict the nonlinear components of wave load the inertia force term of the morison equation is modified and developed by rainey 1989 the linear and nonlinear wave forces are calculated by using the axial divergence term representing the rate of change in the added mass and the surface load variation corresponding to the change of the wetted area of a slender body rainey 1995 manners and rainey 1992 because higher order diffraction theory calculates the wave force more accurately the problem of higher harmonic wave force has been investigated taylor and hung 1987 analyzed the regular wave force using a second order theory with long wave approximation for deep water faltinsen et al 1995 suggested third order wave forces on a vertical cylinder known as the fnv formula using perturbation analysis malenica and molin 1995 also suggested a third order wave force solution applicable for the finite water depth region and newman 1996 extended a third order solution into the irregular wave problem in general wave forces predicted by conventional theories including the morison equation morison et al 1950 and maccamy fuchs equation maccamy and fuchs 1954 show the single sinusoidal in the time domain an additional short duration loading prior to the negative peak of wave force might appear when a wave with large steepness is exerted to a vertical column this phenomenon known as the secondary load cycle slc firstly observed by grue et al 1993 consists of higher order harmonic force components and a transient resonance ringing and a steady state resonance springing can be induced by the higher harmonic wave components of steep waves however none of the aforementioned theoretical approaches could predict the secondary load cycle that was observed in experiments and numerical studies therefore numerous experimental and numerical approaches have been attempted to explore the major variables that induce or have an effect on the generation of the slc chaplin et al 1997 recorded the wave force when non breaking focused waves are exerted on the fixed vertical cylinder the results showed that the magnitude of the slc is strongly correlated with the wave steepness k a where k and a are the wave number and wave amplitude respectively and it is reported that the measured peak force is larger than the force predicted by the morison equation grue and huseby 2002 suggested the condition for the slc to generate in the transient part of a regular wave train and defined the principal non dimensional parameters of the secondary load cycle they replaced the maximum amplitude of the horizontal particle velocity u m in the numerator of the froude number f r with the product of wave frequency ω and the maximum wave elevation η m and suggested the criterion of the froude number at which the slc starts to occur on the relative radius k r and relative wave elevation k η plane it is observed that the slc takes place when k r is in the range of 0 1 0 33 and f r exceeds 0 4 paulsen et al 2014 numerically investigated the physics of the slc by solving two phase incompressible navier stokes equations and found out that the maximum wave run up on the downstream side of the cylinder instead of the filling of the downstream cavity occurs prior to the slc bachynski and moan 2014 described the hydrodynamic criteria for ringing loads such as low keulegan carpenter number and small diameter wavelength ratio and numerically studied the third order loads exerted on a tension leg platform wind turbine tlpwt their results showed that the ringing phenomenon causes large extreme forces and has a considerable effect on the responses of tlpwts which have natural pitch bending periods around 3 to 4 s compared with measured data by grue and huseby 2002 fan et al 2018 validated the numerical wave tank established by the open source package waves2foam and the variables of the slc investigated in previous studies including the characteristic magnitude f i i duration t i i and characteristic time between the zero point and the local minimum of the wave force d t i i were empirically formulated by the relative diameter k d relative depth k h and relative wave height h h m they also pointed out that the characteristic parameters depend mainly on the relative diameter and wave steepness riise et al 2018 carried out the laboratory experiment with a bottom hinged cylinder under irregular deep water waves corresponding to the high frequency force peaks cases 3 5 times larger than the trough to trough frequency of the wave by using regression methods the effects of the dimensionless parameters keulegan carpenter number k c and f r on peaks of the slc were analyzed and it was shown that the slc and f r have the best correlation liu et al 2019 simulated breaking and non breaking waves passing through a cylinder and reported that in breaking and non breaking cases the slc occurs when f r is 0 277 and 0 34 respectively and becomes pronounced when f r is equal to or larger than 0 35 and 0 4 respectively chang et al 2019 suggested that the slc occurs about 0 2 0 25 trough to trough period after the main peak of the wave force using computational simulation and stated that high frequency components generating the secondary load cycle are about 13 times the trough to trough wave frequency through comparison of the wavelet spectra calculated by numerical simulation and the morison second order theory wang et al 2020a numerically investigated the slc when the waves with high keulegan carpenter number larger than 10 acts on the bottom mounted circular cylinder and reported that both k c and f r affect the magnitude of the slc also they suggested 3rd and 4th order harmonic forces are positively correlated with the vortex sizes and therefore the magnitude of the slc has a close relationship with the downstream vortex size wang et al 2020b numerically studied the slc and inline forces induced by the extreme freak wave acting on the bottom mounted vertical cylinder based on the two and three dimensional computational fluid dynamics models it was determined that when the freak wave is exerted the maximum and minimum inline forces including the high order nonlinear components cannot be accurately calculated by theoretical approaches such as the morison equation and the slender body theories they also pointed out that the magnitude of the slc is closely related to the vortex size and the non linear components of the inline force increase with increasing relative amplitude k a the slc for a focused wave passing a vertical cylinder has been investigated experimentally and numerically ghadirian and bredmose 2020 ghadirian and bredmose 2020 explained that the major cause of the slc is the negative pressure generated behind the cylinder after the maximum run up antolloni et al 2020 experimentally measured a wave induced vortex around a vertical cylinder employing the particle image velocimetry piv method and discussed the relationship between the slc and vortex formation the vortex formation due to flow separation effect evidently contributes to the slc but the secondary load cycle occurs even without vortex indicating that the slc is mainly related with a gravity wave effect as aforementioned the conditions for the slc to occur in the transient part of a regular wave train were suggested from the previous work grue and huseby 2002 and the effects on the magnitude duration and occurrence time of the slc were analyzed in the studies with the verified numerical wave tank fan et al 2018 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020a additional investigation using an experimental wave flume is needed to further elucidate dimensional and non dimensional wave forces by steep regular waves with various wave heights and wave periods in this work we investigate the wave force with the secondary load cycle acting on vertical cylinders of different diameters based on the results we propose a modified morison equation by which a non dimensional wave force can be predicted with high accuracy for non breaking regular waves with large steepness by means of an experimental wave flume regular waves with various periods and heights are generated and the measured time histories of the wave heights and forces are compared with those predicted by the stokes wave theory and morison equation respectively only the diameter to wavelength ratios for which the morison equation is applicable are considered and regular waves are generated with satisfying the condition that wave steepness is smaller than the critical wave steepness as in the previous study lee et al 2020 the effects of the critical non dimensional parameters such as the relative radius k r relative depth k h relative elevation k η and relative amplitude k a on the secondary load cycle are studied and a force difference function is introduced to accurately describe the non dimensional wave force the optimum values of the force difference function are obtained using the data fitting method and the proposed equation is verified by comparing the analytical results with the experimental data 2 methodology 2 1 experimental setup to measure the wave load exerted on a vertical circular cylinder experiments were carried out in a wave flume located in the physical experiment building at korea institute of ocean science and technology kiost as shown in fig 1 the experimental wave flume is 50 m long 1 2 m wide and 1 6 m deep along the length of the wave flume from 10 to 20 m the depth gradually decreases from 1 6 m to 1 25 m and the corresponding bottom slope m is 1 0 035 on average the frame and one side wall of the wave flume are made of stainless steel and the other side wall is made of tempered glass enabling visual observation a piston type wavemaker vti corporation spain made of glass fiber reinforced plastic and stainless steel was initially located 3 4 m away from the left end of the wave flume the dimensions of the wavemaker are width 1 18 m and height 1 6 m and the width is 2 cm narrower than the width of the flume to mitigate friction between the wavemaker and side walls of the flume the motion of the wavemaker is manipulated by the wave generation software awasys 7 and the height of the regular wave can be maximized up to 0 55 m with the maximum stroke of 1 2 m for wave periods ranging from 1 7 to 3 0 s a resistance type wave gauge placed on the front side of the wavemaker measures water surface elevation and controls the movement of the wavemaker which is utilized as an active reflection in addition passive absorbers are installed at both ends of the wave flume to suppress and minimize the wave reflection a detailed description of the wave flume is provided in oh et al 2020 a material polymethyl methacrylate was selected for fabricating the vertical cylinders as shown in fig 2 a because it is lightweight allowing easy placement of cylinders of different diameters during the experiments in addition it has almost no deformation due to the wave force resulting in rigid body motion vertical cylinders with diameters of 0 12 0 14 and 0 16 m length 1 m and thickness 0 01 m were fabricated to minimize the wave reflection against the vertical cylinder the cylinder was installed at the intersection of the flat bed and inclined bed which is 9 5 m away from the left end of the wave flume all experiments were carried out by fixing the water depth to 1 m leading to a submergence depth of the vertical cylinders of 0 33 m detailed descriptions of the vertical cylinders are listed in table 1 the time histories of the wave height and wave period for 30 s were measured by using a whm 1 capacitance type wave gauge sewon giyeon co ltd korea as shown in fig 2 b the mcs 10 sensor hbk germany measures the three dimensional forces and moments up to 2 kn and 0 15 knm respectively and was placed at the bottom of the steel plate to measure the wave load at the center of the steel plate there are 13 holes to which the mcs 10 sensor can be attached and the aluminum frame is connected to 8 holes on the border by bolts as shown in fig 2 c the structure was constructed by connecting the components in the order of frame steel plate force sensor cylinder cover and vertical cylinder the electrical signal of the wave force and moment converted by the sensor was recorded at a sampling rate of 50 hz from the data acquisition modules quantumx 1615b hbk germany 2 2 wave analysis a velocity potential should satisfy the continuity equation with the assumption of irrotational and incompressible fluid as well of no or negligibly small viscosity and the laplace equation is validated with the relationship between the velocity vector and the velocity potential dean and dalrymple 1991 there are numerous solutions for the laplace equation in the physics and engineering fields by using boundary conditions of the water wave such as water wave motion no flow on the sea bed no pressure on the water surface and lateral periodicity the velocity potential of the linear wave is expressed as a function of the x and z coordinates and time t as dean and dalrymple 1991 1 ϕ h 2 g ω cosh k h z cosh k h sin k x ω t where h is the wave height g is the gravitational acceleration h represents the water depth and k 2 π l and ω 2 π t are the wave number and wave frequency

the horizontal particle velocity is maximized at the wave crest and trough and the vertical particle velocity is the highest when the wave surface displacement becomes zero dean and dalrymple 1991 using the velocity potential function a transfer function representing the relation between the stroke of the wavemaker and the wave height is written by 5 h s 2 cosh 2 k h 1 sinh 2 k h 2 k h where s is the stroke of piston type wavemaker and k h represents the relative depth dean and dalrymple 1991 once the target wave height and period are determined the time history of the displacement of the wavemaker is expressed as 6 x piston s 2 sin ω t using perturbation theory the velocity potential can be expanded to include higher order terms the velocity potential for the second order stokes wave

motion of the wavemaker can be found in dean and dalrymple 1991 and madsen 1971 among various methods for calculating the wave force exerted on structures the choice of relevant method is decided according to the incident wave conditions and the relative dimensions of the structure xiong et al 2020 representative examples are the morison equation which is a semi empirical formula morison et al 1950 and the maccamy and fuchs theory that considers the diffraction effect maccamy and fuchs 1954 the former is employed to predict the wave force exerted on a small scale structure with a ratio of the diameter of the structure d to wavelength l smaller than 0 2 for large scale structures with d l larger than 0 2 the latter is used xiong et al 2020 all the experiments carried out in this work are included in the range d l 0 2 when the submerged depth is expressed as h s the wave force exerted on the vertical cylinder is defined by the morison equation which is the sum of the drag force f d and inertia force f i as follows 12 f h f d f i h s η 1 2 ρ c d d u x u x d z h s η ρ c m π d 2 4 u x t d z where f h is the horizontal wave force ρ represents the mass density of water d is the diameter of the vertical cylinder and η is the water surface elevation in eqs 2 and 8 in eq 12 c d and c m are the drag and inertia coefficients respectively and u x and u x t are the horizontal particle velocity and acceleration calculated from linear and stokes wave theories the reynolds number r e and keulegan carpenter number k c are dimensionless variables that define the relationship between the viscous force and inertia force when smooth circular cylinders are exposed to steady currents and oscillatory flow respectively and are expressed as 13 r e u m d ν ω η m d ν 14 k c u m t d π η m r where u m is the maximum amplitude of the horizontal particle velocity η m is the maximum wave elevation r is the radius of the cylinder and ν represents the kinematic viscosity c d and c m in eq 12 are determined by the reynolds and keulegan carpenter numbers respectively for example c d is maintained at a constant value of 1 2 in the sub critical range 300 r e 3 5 1 0 5 and abruptly decreases and converges to a value smaller than 1 when r e exceeds this range sumer and fredsøe 2006 c m is approximately 2 when k c 6 and it is reduced and converges to a value smaller than 2 when k c is larger than approximately 7 sumer and fredsøe 2006 sarpkaya 2010 the experimental conditions in this work satisfy the conditions of sub critical range of reynolds number and small keulegan carpenter number and the time series of wave heights and forces recorded in the experiments were verified by using the second order stokes wave theory and the morison equation the detailed theoretical and experimental derivation of the wave force can be found in sarpkaya 2010 and sumer and fredsøe 2006 and the values of c d and c m for the ranges of r e and k c are listed in table 2 3 validation studies in this section regular waves with small and large wave steepness were generated and the wave forces acting on cylinders of three different diameters were obtained the measured wave height and force were compared with the analytical solutions by stokes wave theory eq 8 and the morison equation eq 12 respectively and the differences between the two results were investigated firstly regular waves about 9 5 cm in height were generated with wave periods in the range from 0 994 to 2 248 s as listed in table 3 fig 3 a to c show the wave heights that were measured in cases i 4 ii 4 and iii 4 and calculated by stokes wave theory respectively overall both results are in good agreement although the magnitudes of the measured wave heights are slightly larger than those calculated by the analytical solution ursell et al 1960 carried out regular wave experiments and wave heights were measured within an error of 4 for 0 002 h l 0 03 lee and hong 2020b performed regular wave tests using the experimental wave flume in the following ranges of wave steepness 0 013 h l 0 045 and 0 025 h l 0 094 they found that the experimental wave heights were within an error of 4 1 in the former wave steepness range the experimental waves were accurately generated regardless of the relative depth when the wave steepness was equal to or smaller than 0 067 in the latter range similarly every wave steepness of cases i 4 ii 4 and iii 4 is within 0 031 to 0 032 which is analogous to those in the previous studies lee and hong 2020b ursell et al 1960 with errors within 4 in fig 3 d to f the measured wave force and the force calculated by the morison equation are compared the magnitude of the wave force increases as the diameter of the cylinder increases regardless of the diameter of the cylinder the minimum peaks of the measured wave force are slightly larger than the results calculated by the morison equation but both results are generally in good agreement consequently the wave height and force profiles measured in the experiment satisfy stokes wave theory and the morison equation when the ratio of the diameter to the incident wavelength is smaller than 0 2 and the wave steepness is within the range proposed in the previous studies lee and hong 2020b ursell et al 1960 in order to verify the accuracy of the measured wave height and force when the wave steepness exceeds 0 067 regular waves about 18 5 cm in height were generated with wave periods in the range from 1 045 to 2 246 s as listed in table 4 lee et al 2020 generated a steep regular wave using a piston type wavemaker and suggested that the waves break when the wave steepness exceeds 0 131 the maximum wave steepness of all the cases listed in table 4 is 0 104 satisfying the non breaking wave steepness condition suggested by the previous study lee et al 2020 cases iv 3 v 3 and vi 3 were selected to compare the measured wave heights with the solution by the stokes theory and the measured wave forces with the results calculated by the morison equation as shown in fig 4 a to c the magnitudes of the measured wave heights are slightly larger than those calculated by stokes theory while both results agree well in terms of the wave period however the measured wave forces presented in fig 4 d to f show additional fluctuation near the wave trough which is not considered by the morison equation such a phenomenon is called the secondary load cycle slc according to grue and huseby 2002 the froude number f r is one of the significant factors determining the occurrence of the slc and it is defined as 15 f r u m g d ω η m g d where ω is the wave frequency η m is the maximum wave elevation g is the gravitational acceleration and d is the diameter of the cylinder the analytical and experimental non dimensional forces for the variation of k a are shown in fig 5 a the non dimensional forces of cases i to iii open symbols are in close agreement with the analytical results although the slc did not occurs in cases i to iii the analytical value of k a and non dimensional force are underestimated than that of measured data it is because the wave height and wave force measured in the experiment are slightly larger than the analytical solution of stokes theory and the morison equation the difference between the analytical solution and measured data becomes larger when k a is equal to or larger than 0 15 this difference is more eminent in results of cases iv to vi filled symbols in 18 cases among cases iv 1 to vi 10 the slc occurs and the non dimensional force increases as the k a increases therefore it is clear that an eminent difference between the analytical and experimental wave force is generated owing to the slc it is concluded that the magnitude of the slc is correlated with the wave steepness as reported by chaplin et al 1997 grue and huseby 2002 pointed out that the slc occurs when f r exceeds 0 4 liu et al 2019 indicated that the critical froude number is 0 34 and 0 277 respectively under non breaking and breaking waves and the slc becomes pronounced when the number is equal to or larger than 0 4 and 0 35 recently wang et al 2020a demonstrated that the slc begins to occur when f r is about 0 167 and it becomes apparent when f r is equal to or larger than 0 22 chang et al 2019 also stated that f r 0 4 may be the transition line in this work the slc occurs in the range of f r between 0 391 and 0 515 with the critical froude number f r c r between 0 391 and 0 4 the non dimensional parameter k c also has an effect on the slc riise et al 2018 wang et al 2020a the minimum and maximum values of k c that cause the slc are 3 64 and 5 21 in this work and those of the previous works are 3 97 9 95 grue and huseby 2002 3 33 7 18 in non breaking cases liu et al 2019 3 93 11 51 in breaking cases liu et al 2019 5 142 10 279 chang et al 2019 and 11 01 20 26 wang et al 2020a therefore the critical froude number f r c r decreases with increasing k c as reported by wang et al 2020a however the ranges of k r and k η when the slc occurs were not consistent in the previous researches grue and huseby 2002 stated that the slc occurs in the range of k r between 0 1 0 33 and when k η is smaller than 0 3 meanwhile liu et al 2019 demonstrated that the slc begins to occur for all simulations when k η 0 151 and the maximum value of k η is 0 422 in this work the ranges of k r and k η are 0 130 0 297 and 0 215 0 347 respectively and the slc was also observed when k η 0 3 as aforementioned it is confirmed that the value of f r c r varies with k c from previous works and k c in eq 14 can also be expressed as a function of k r and k η as f r therefore the ranges of k r and k η where the slc occurs in the experiment or simulation can be changed by k c in fig 5 b all the experimental results in tables 3 and 4 curves by the maximum and minimum k c as well as f r 0 4 are plotted on the k r k η plane except for the two cases close to the threshold value f r of 0 391 and 0 395 all the cases of this work where the slc occurs reside within the curves by the maximum k c minimum k c and f r 0 4 also the minimum values of k η and k r inducing the slc are equal to or larger than the x and y coordinates of the f r 0 4 and maximum k c curve intersection and both the maximum values of k η and k r increase corresponding to the minimum k c curve because the range of k c changes by wave condition and diameter of the cylinder the ranges of k r and k η causing the slc also change by the varying k c similar to the results presented in fig 5 b the minimum and maximum values of k r and k η when the slc occurs are changed depending on the range of k c in the previous works therefore the reason why the ranges of k r and k η inducing the slc are different in each study can be explained by the maximum and minimum values of the k c in fig 5 c the measured data of the present study are plotted on k r k η plane together with experimental results of the previous studies grue and huseby 2002 liu et al 2019 chang et al 2019 according to the maximum and minimum k c from 3 33 to 11 51 of all the previous studies and our study the k r and k η of all cases when slc occurred satisfies the proposed k c rule comprehensively it is confirmed that the wave height obtained in the experiment is consistent with the analytical solution and the accuracy of the generated wave is verified additionally the wave force measured in the cases when the f r is smaller than the f r c r exactly corresponds to the calculated force by the morison equation however even if the incident wave satisfies the condition d l 0 2 it is difficult to precisely predict the wave force using the morison equation if the slc takes place 4 results and discussions for the regular waves acting on a vertical cylinder the horizontal wave force f h is expressed as a function of the following dimensional parameters fan et al 2018 16 f h f ρ g h h l d ν t where ρ and ν are the mass density and kinematic viscosity of water respectively g is the gravitational acceleration h and l are the wave height and wavelength of the incident wave respectively h represents the water depth and t is time by using dimensional analysis the non dimensional wave force is written as 17 f h ρ g h s d 2 f h l h l d l ν g l 3 t g l where h s is the submerged depth of the cylinder according to sumer and fredsøe 2006 and sarpkaya 2010 the viscous force is negligibly small because the inertial component of the wave force is larger than the viscous component if the keulegan carpenter number is small therefore the dimensionless parameter ν g l 3 that indicates the effect of fluid viscosity can be neglected fan et al 2018 as shown in figs 3 and 4 t g l can be replaced by a dimensionless parameter t t because the period of the wave force is dominated by the incident wave period additionally the remaining dimensionless parameters in eq 17 can be replaced by k a k h and k r respectively by using the wave number k 2 π l radius of cylinder r d 2 and wave amplitude a h 2 resulting in 18 f h f h ρ g h s d 2 f k a k h k r t t where k a is the ratio of wave height to wavelength the dimensionless parameter known as the relative amplitude and k h is the relative depth determined by the wave number and water depth these two parameters are the criteria for evaluating the accuracy of the wave height and wavelength generated by the wavemaker as mentioned in section 2 2 the relative radius k r and d l are non dimensional variables categorizing large or small scale structures when the wave condition satisfies d l 0 2 the wave force can be accurately predicted by using the morison equation all the experiments of the present study meet this criterion however additional fluctuation on the wave force induced by the secondary load cycle slc cannot be calculated by the morison equation if the difference between the force calculated by the morison equation and the measured wave force is expressed as a function of k a k h t t and k r the morison equation can be modified to accommodate this difference the force difference function δ f s l c is given by 19 δ f s l c f k a k h k r t t in the previous study fan et al 2018 dimensional parameters of the slc have been defined as characteristic magnitude characteristic duration and characteristic time between the zero point and the local minimum of the wave force on the force time plane in this work the non dimensional parameters of the slc are newly defined on the f h t t plane and are presented in fig 6 the chain and thick solid lines indicate non dimensional wave forces when the slc occurs and does not occur respectively and the difference δ f s l c between the force calculated by the morison equation and the measured wave force is illustrated by the area filled with thin solid lines on the basis of the t t axis the non dimensional wave force f h is divided into a positive force f p and negative force f n and the corresponding non dimensional periods are defined as t p and t n respectively furthermore t n is divided into t n 1 and t n 2 which correspond to the section from the point where f p becomes zero to the point where the chain and thick solid lines intersect and the section from the intersection to the upward crossing zero points respectively t i i is the non dimensional characteristic duration of the slc which is one of the variables defined by previous studies grue and huseby 2002 fan et al 2018 among the 45 cases shown in tables 3 and 4 the slc occurred in 18 cases and the detailed parameter values are listed in table 5 the measured wave force in cases 2 4 and 5 and the non dimensional force calculated by the morison equation are presented in fig 7 the time at which the fifth positive force peak occurs is converted into t 0 and nondimensionalized by the incident wave period t regardless of the diameter of the cylinder and incident wave condition the experimentally measured t t shows good agreement with the result calculated by the morison equation whereas the negative peak forces are different from the analytical solution due to the slc the non dimensional characteristic duration of the slc t i i in the present study varies from 0 151 to 0 185 which is slightly larger than 0 150 predicted by chaplin et al 1997 t i i values in the non breaking and breaking wave cases of the work by liu et al 2019 were measured as from 0 157 to 0 174 and from 0 143 to 0 242 respectively similarly t i i measured by wang et al 2020a changes within the ranges of 0 142 to 0 169 in cases 3 to 7 and 0 126 to 0 185 in cases 8 to 19 and t i i values in this study are also in the range reported by the previous study as for the regular wave t i i is observed in a larger range in the breaking wave rather than that of the non breaking wave also t i i tends to be measured over a wider range in focused waves compared to regular waves t n 1 values in cases iv 2 v 2 and vi 2 in fig 7 a to c and table 5 are larger than 0 221 and the negative path is distorted however t n 1 is measured as a smaller value between 0 191 and 0 204 because the negative path is slightly curved in fig 7 d to i in general regardless of the diameter of the cylinder the tendency of the value of t n 1 and the curvature of the negative path vary by the wave period and therefore the slc is predicted to vary sensitively with the incident wave condition the spectra of the non dimensional wave force calculated by the morison equation in eq 12 solid lines and that of measured data dotted lines are shown in fig 8 the frequencies f is nondimensionalized by dividing with the incident wave frequency ω and the largest magnitude is observed at f w 1 the other peaks are observed at integer multiples of the component f w and the magnitude decreases as the f w increases in the spectra calculated by the morison equation only the first to third harmonic wave forces are observed and the peak of second harmonic force is larger than that of the experimentally measured the high frequency wave forces are not observed by the morison equation while the harmonic wave forces higher than the third harmonic forces are obtained in the measured data when the slc occurs liu et al 2019 reported the spectra of one breaking wave with the slc case two non breaking waves with slc cases and the non breaking wave force without the slc case when the slc occurs the seventh harmonic wave force was observed from the breaking wave case while the fourth and fifth harmonic wave forces were yielded from non breaking wave cases liu et al 2019 however the second and third harmonic wave forces were observed from the non breaking wave case without the slc occurred liu et al 2019 this observation is analogous to the spectra results using the morison equation carried out in the present work liu et al 2019 demonstrated that the high frequency wave force is closely related to the existence of the slc similarly wang et al 2020a stated that the third and fourth order harmonic forces are very important for the slc consequently it is assumed that the difference between the force calculated by the morison equation and the measured wave force when the slc occurs in the non breaking regular wave is induced from the difference of the higher harmonic forces equal to or larger than the second harmonic force therefore the wave force can be estimated more accurately by correcting the difference of the second to the fourth harmonic forces between the force calculated by the morison equation and the measured wave force the force differences δ f s l c of the 18 obtained datasets in which the slc occurred are presented in fig 9 a in the case of k η 0 3 thin solid lines the maximum and minimum force differences are generated when t t is 0 17 and 0 32 respectively and the amplitudes of δ f s l c are analogous regardless of the incident wave condition the maximum and minimum force difference peaks occur when t t is 0 14 and 0 29 respectively for the case of k η 0 3 thick solid lines and the amplitude of the curve changes for the incident wave condition as aforementioned t n 1 and the curvature of the negative path tends to be categorized as two types depending on the wave condition regardless of the diameter of the cylinder similarly the shape of the δ f s l c is divided into two types based on k η of 0 3 all the δ f s l c are in the form of the summation of a number of sine functions regardless of the incident wave condition and the diameter of the cylinder as shown in fig 9 a similarly the spectra of the second and fourth harmonic wave forces in fig 8 show a large difference between the results calculated by the morison equation and the measured data these results imply that the force difference can be corrected by using two sine functions consequently once the wave force is expressed as the summation of a number of sine functions using a fast fourier transform analysis the force difference is expressed as the summation of the second and fourth harmonic components as 20 δ f s l c a 0 a 1 sin 2 2 π t t b 1 a 2 sin 4 2 π t t b 2 where a 1 and a 2 are the amplitudes of the two sine functions b 1 and b 2 are the phases for the k η value and a 0 is the constant value to make the force difference function zero when t t is equal to zero the non dimensional frequencies of the force difference function can be fixed as twice or four times the 2 π t t respectively from the second and fourth harmonic forces in fig 9 b the force differences of cases v 2 and v 4 are compared by applying the data fitting method to eq 20 and it is shown that the experimental results are in good agreement with the results by the proposed empirical formula for both cases the r squared value and root mean square error rmse for the two cases are 0 9949 and 0 9873 and 0 0037 and 0 0048 respectively indicating that the results are highly reliable in addition the averaged r squared value and rmse are 0 9880 and 0 0045 respectively when the force difference curve of the 18 experiment cases in which the slc occurs is fitted by eq 20 therefore the non dimensional force difference caused by the slc can be accurately described by the proposed empirical formula the relation between magnitude and phase of the force difference function by the data fitting method and the main parameters of the non dimensional force k h k a and k r are analyzed firstly the force difference function shown in fig 9 a can be categorized into two phases separated by k η 0 3 therefore with the average value the phase of the cases with the slc occurred can be defined as a constant value in accordance with the k η range as listed in table 6 the relationship between the amplitudes of δ f s l c obtained by the data fitting method and the non dimensional variables k h k a and k r are compared in fig 10 the amplitudes of a 1 are proportional to k h k a and k r and the r squared values are 0 965 0 955 and 0 788 respectively as shown in fig 10 d to f the summation of a 1 and a 2 is linearly correlated with k h k a and k r and the r squared values are 0 942 0 934 and 0 741 respectively by using the data fitting method the empirical formulas of a 1 and a 2 expressed as 21 a 1 0 0345 k h 0 0510 22 a 1 0 4406 k a 0 0663 23 a 1 0 3327 k r 0 0171 24 a 1 a 2 0 0358 k h 0 0244 25 a 1 a 2 0 4584 k a 0 0405 26 a 1 a 2 0 3394 k r 0 0121 the magnitude of the slc is dependent on the incident wave condition as reported by liu et al 2019 and the force difference δ f s l c increases as the duration t i i and magnitude of the slc increases fig 6 in specific as shown in fig 10 the first and second amplitudes of the δ f s l c are proportional to k h and k a respectively therefore similar to the magnitude of the slc the amplitude of δ f s l c has a close relationship with the incident wave condition when the diameter of the cylinder changes the slope of the curves in eqs 23 and 26 varies and the r squared values of k r amplitude curves are less accurate than that of k h and k a however when comparing for each diameter the r squared values of k r amplitude curves are calculated as 0 972 and 0 968 at d 1 0 978 and 0 975 at d 2 and 0 998 and 0 986 at d 3 respectively and the results are more accurate than those of the k h and k a both k c and f r which have significant effects on the magnitude of the slc are functions of k r and k η in the present study amplitudes of the δ f s l c are proportional to f r as reported by liu et al 2019 also amplitudes of the δ f s l c are inversely proportional to k c and therefore k c has effects on the magnitude of the slc as suggested by wang et al 2020a however when the diameter of the cylinder changes the slopes of the amplitude curves by k c and f r are varied similarly to the slope variation of the k r amplitude curves therefore it has a limitation to propose a normalized form of the force difference amplitudes with k r k c and f r which are influenced by the diameter of the cylinder regardless of the diameter the δ f s l c can be corrected more accurately by calculating a 1 and a 2 using the linear relationship of the k h or k a consequently the amplitude of the force difference can be expressed in terms of k a or k h and the phases of the force difference can be defined as a constant value according to the k η range using the force difference function the non dimensional morison equation can be modified as 27 f h f m p f m n δ f s l c where f m p and f m n are the positive and negative forces of the morison equation respectively and δ f s l c is the force difference induced by the slc the measured wave forces from cases 2 4 and 5 with slc occurred the wave forces calculated by the morison equation in eq 12 and the wave forces calculated by the proposed equation in eq 27 are plotted in fig 11 from table 6 the phases of the force difference function are used and the values of the first and second amplitudes are selected from eqs 21 and 24 a good agreement between the measured data and the calculated results by the empirical formula is observed in fig 11 this indicates that a reasonable non dimensional wave force can be expressed when the morison equation modified by δ f s l c which takes into account the force effect by the slc to verify the proposed force difference function the non dimensional wave forces calculated by the morison equation and modified morison equation are compared with the measured data in the frequency domain as shown in fig 12 compared with the spectra of measured data the peaks of the second and fourth harmonic wave forces calculated by the modified morison equation are more accurate than those by the morison equation it should be noted that the proposed force difference function enables the calculation of the force due to the slc which cannot be calculated by the morison equation and main variables including amplitudes and phases of the force difference function can be accurately predicted by use of the non dimensional parameters k h and k η however the proposed equation has several limitations the difference between the force calculated by the morison equation and the measured wave force can be described only for the non breaking regular waves which satisfy the d l 0 2 also only the second to fourth harmonic forces can be accurately corrected using the force difference function therefore it is limited to predict the non dimensional wave force when various waves inducing the high frequency wave force than the fourth harmonic force such as the focused wave breaking wave and regular waves with d l 0 2 further study is required for an additional term in the force difference function 5 summary and conclusions to evaluate the wave force acting on cylindrical types of offshore structures numerous theoretical approaches have been utilized however none of those could accurately predict the wave force when the secondary load cycle slc occurs the slc is one of the most important factors in the ringing phenomenon that induces intense vibration which can be destructive in offshore structures in this study the slc generated by steep non breaking regular waves exerted on a single vertical cylinder is studied using an experimental wave flume with a piston type wavemaker and a non dimensional wave force function is proposed by combining the morison equation with an empirical force difference function δ f s l c to evaluate the accuracy of the measured wave height and force 15 and 30 cases of regular waves in which the wave steepness satisfies 0 015 h l 0 062 and 0 030 h l 0 104 are generated and the wave heights and forces are compared with the solutions calculated by stokes wave theory and the morison equation respectively in all cases the ratio of the diameter of the cylinder d to the measured wavelength of the incident waves l satisfied the d l 0 2 which is criterion for applicability of the morison equation the wave heights periods and forces with the wave steepness equal to or smaller than 0 062 and the froude number f r 0 4 show good agreement with the analytical solution however the slc occurs in 18 cases where the wave steepness and f r exceed the aforementioned ranges and the substantial difference is observed between the force calculated by the morison equation and the measured wave force to describe the force difference the force difference function δ f s l c is proposed as the summation of two sine functions the correlation between the amplitude phase and non dimensional frequency of the δ f s l c and the following non dimensional parameters such as the relative elevation k η relative amplitude k a relative radius k r and relative depth k h are analyzed through a fast fourier transform analysis it is confirmed that the main force difference is induced by the second and fourth harmonic forces and the phases of the δ f s l c are divided on the basis of k η at the value of 0 3 the first amplitude of the force difference function is proportional to k h and k a and the summation of the amplitudes is also linearly correlated with the k h and k a it should be noted that the change due to the k r f r and keulegan carpenter number k c is also linearly correlated with the amplitudes of the δ f s l c but the slope of the linear relationship with the amplitude of force difference function changes by the variation of the diameter of the cylinder consequently the force difference caused by the slc appears to be mainly determined by the incident wave conditions particularly k h and k a when the ratio of the column diameter to wavelength is smaller than 0 2 this study shows that the developed force difference function is valid for predicting the wave forces when the slc is generated by the non breaking regular wave exerted on a single vertical cylinder however the force difference function is only applicable to the non breaking regular waves of d l smaller than 0 2 which is the requirement for the use of the morison equation therefore the force difference function has a limitation in describing the wave forces induced by the breaking wave focused wave and regular wave with d l 0 2 that cause the high frequency wave forces larger than fourth harmonic forces the proposed methodology might be beneficial for the studies including wave structure experiments and numerical simulation to investigate the slc problems under regular waves with d l 0 2 credit authorship contribution statement sangmin lee conceptualization methodology

20749,theoretical solutions including the morison equation have been widely used to estimate the wave forces exerted on offshore structures of vertical cylindrical configuration however none of those methods can accurately predict the wave force of the secondary load cycle induced by a steep wave acting on the cylinder in this study regular waves of different wave steepness are generated using an experimental wave flume with a piston type wavemaker and the forces exerted on the cylinders of three different diameters are investigated using the data fitting method the difference between the experimentally measured wave force and that calculated by the morison equation is empirically formulated and the effects of key non dimensional parameters on the force difference function are analyzed the results show that the amplitude and phase of the force difference function are mainly governed by the incident wave condition including the relative depth relative amplitude and relative elevation on the other hand the effect of the relative radius is negligible when the diameter to wavelength ratio satisfies the small scale structure condition the proposed equation is valid for predicting the non breaking regular wave forces exerted on a vertical cylinder when the secondary load cycle occurs and can be utilized in wave structure interaction problems keywords experimental wave flume regular wave secondary load cycle wave force morison equation 1 introduction many kinds of fixed floating and semi submerged offshore structures including production platforms and ocean research stations have been constructed for the development and exploration of marine resources and renewable energies various types of loads such as wind current and wave loads are continuously exerted on offshore structures and therefore the external force needs to be accurately predicted to ensure the safeties of offshore structures lee and hong 2020a b numerous studies employing an experimental wave flume and numerical wave tank have been conducted with the aim of accurately generating waves to reproduce the wave load the dominant load among the natural external loads dean and dalrymple 1991 presented a wave transfer function for piston and flap type wavemakers using the linear wave theory in their transfer function the wave height to stroke ratio is a function of the relative depth a host of studies have compared the results by wavemaker experiments and by the wave transfer function to verify the accuracy of the linear waves experimentally generated ursell et al 1960 krvavica et al 2018 lee et al 2020 to generate realistic oceanic waves using experimental wave flumes the higher order wave theory has been often utilized schäffer 1996 by the stokes perturbation equation madsen 1971 and flick and guza 1980 derived a second order wavemaker equation for piston and flap type wavemakers respectively and the limitation of the proposed theory was described by the use of the ursell number many offshore structures have vertical structural members with a circular cross section and therefore experiments and numerical studies for the estimation of the wave forces have mainly focused on circular cylinders in the long wave regime first order diffraction loads can be accurately predicted by the morison equation if the inertia term is retained malenica and molin 1995 morison et al 1950 reported that the wave force consists of two components the drag and inertia forces when unbroken surface waves are exerted on a cylindrical object by means of linear wave theory and measured data for small and medium scale structures with the diameter to wavelength ratio d l smaller than 0 2 the morison equation is still widely used in predicting the horizontal wave force however the morison equation is not capable of accurately predicting the wave force for the larger ratio of the diameter to wavelength because the wave diffraction effect is not trivial demirbilek and gaston 1985 based on the first order diffraction theory maccamy and fuchs 1954 derived a wave force equation for large scale structures with d l larger than 0 2 to predict the nonlinear components of wave load the inertia force term of the morison equation is modified and developed by rainey 1989 the linear and nonlinear wave forces are calculated by using the axial divergence term representing the rate of change in the added mass and the surface load variation corresponding to the change of the wetted area of a slender body rainey 1995 manners and rainey 1992 because higher order diffraction theory calculates the wave force more accurately the problem of higher harmonic wave force has been investigated taylor and hung 1987 analyzed the regular wave force using a second order theory with long wave approximation for deep water faltinsen et al 1995 suggested third order wave forces on a vertical cylinder known as the fnv formula using perturbation analysis malenica and molin 1995 also suggested a third order wave force solution applicable for the finite water depth region and newman 1996 extended a third order solution into the irregular wave problem in general wave forces predicted by conventional theories including the morison equation morison et al 1950 and maccamy fuchs equation maccamy and fuchs 1954 show the single sinusoidal in the time domain an additional short duration loading prior to the negative peak of wave force might appear when a wave with large steepness is exerted to a vertical column this phenomenon known as the secondary load cycle slc firstly observed by grue et al 1993 consists of higher order harmonic force components and a transient resonance ringing and a steady state resonance springing can be induced by the higher harmonic wave components of steep waves however none of the aforementioned theoretical approaches could predict the secondary load cycle that was observed in experiments and numerical studies therefore numerous experimental and numerical approaches have been attempted to explore the major variables that induce or have an effect on the generation of the slc chaplin et al 1997 recorded the wave force when non breaking focused waves are exerted on the fixed vertical cylinder the results showed that the magnitude of the slc is strongly correlated with the wave steepness k a where k and a are the wave number and wave amplitude respectively and it is reported that the measured peak force is larger than the force predicted by the morison equation grue and huseby 2002 suggested the condition for the slc to generate in the transient part of a regular wave train and defined the principal non dimensional parameters of the secondary load cycle they replaced the maximum amplitude of the horizontal particle velocity u m in the numerator of the froude number f r with the product of wave frequency ω and the maximum wave elevation η m and suggested the criterion of the froude number at which the slc starts to occur on the relative radius k r and relative wave elevation k η plane it is observed that the slc takes place when k r is in the range of 0 1 0 33 and f r exceeds 0 4 paulsen et al 2014 numerically investigated the physics of the slc by solving two phase incompressible navier stokes equations and found out that the maximum wave run up on the downstream side of the cylinder instead of the filling of the downstream cavity occurs prior to the slc bachynski and moan 2014 described the hydrodynamic criteria for ringing loads such as low keulegan carpenter number and small diameter wavelength ratio and numerically studied the third order loads exerted on a tension leg platform wind turbine tlpwt their results showed that the ringing phenomenon causes large extreme forces and has a considerable effect on the responses of tlpwts which have natural pitch bending periods around 3 to 4 s compared with measured data by grue and huseby 2002 fan et al 2018 validated the numerical wave tank established by the open source package waves2foam and the variables of the slc investigated in previous studies including the characteristic magnitude f i i duration t i i and characteristic time between the zero point and the local minimum of the wave force d t i i were empirically formulated by the relative diameter k d relative depth k h and relative wave height h h m they also pointed out that the characteristic parameters depend mainly on the relative diameter and wave steepness riise et al 2018 carried out the laboratory experiment with a bottom hinged cylinder under irregular deep water waves corresponding to the high frequency force peaks cases 3 5 times larger than the trough to trough frequency of the wave by using regression methods the effects of the dimensionless parameters keulegan carpenter number k c and f r on peaks of the slc were analyzed and it was shown that the slc and f r have the best correlation liu et al 2019 simulated breaking and non breaking waves passing through a cylinder and reported that in breaking and non breaking cases the slc occurs when f r is 0 277 and 0 34 respectively and becomes pronounced when f r is equal to or larger than 0 35 and 0 4 respectively chang et al 2019 suggested that the slc occurs about 0 2 0 25 trough to trough period after the main peak of the wave force using computational simulation and stated that high frequency components generating the secondary load cycle are about 13 times the trough to trough wave frequency through comparison of the wavelet spectra calculated by numerical simulation and the morison second order theory wang et al 2020a numerically investigated the slc when the waves with high keulegan carpenter number larger than 10 acts on the bottom mounted circular cylinder and reported that both k c and f r affect the magnitude of the slc also they suggested 3rd and 4th order harmonic forces are positively correlated with the vortex sizes and therefore the magnitude of the slc has a close relationship with the downstream vortex size wang et al 2020b numerically studied the slc and inline forces induced by the extreme freak wave acting on the bottom mounted vertical cylinder based on the two and three dimensional computational fluid dynamics models it was determined that when the freak wave is exerted the maximum and minimum inline forces including the high order nonlinear components cannot be accurately calculated by theoretical approaches such as the morison equation and the slender body theories they also pointed out that the magnitude of the slc is closely related to the vortex size and the non linear components of the inline force increase with increasing relative amplitude k a the slc for a focused wave passing a vertical cylinder has been investigated experimentally and numerically ghadirian and bredmose 2020 ghadirian and bredmose 2020 explained that the major cause of the slc is the negative pressure generated behind the cylinder after the maximum run up antolloni et al 2020 experimentally measured a wave induced vortex around a vertical cylinder employing the particle image velocimetry piv method and discussed the relationship between the slc and vortex formation the vortex formation due to flow separation effect evidently contributes to the slc but the secondary load cycle occurs even without vortex indicating that the slc is mainly related with a gravity wave effect as aforementioned the conditions for the slc to occur in the transient part of a regular wave train were suggested from the previous work grue and huseby 2002 and the effects on the magnitude duration and occurrence time of the slc were analyzed in the studies with the verified numerical wave tank fan et al 2018 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020a additional investigation using an experimental wave flume is needed to further elucidate dimensional and non dimensional wave forces by steep regular waves with various wave heights and wave periods in this work we investigate the wave force with the secondary load cycle acting on vertical cylinders of different diameters based on the results we propose a modified morison equation by which a non dimensional wave force can be predicted with high accuracy for non breaking regular waves with large steepness by means of an experimental wave flume regular waves with various periods and heights are generated and the measured time histories of the wave heights and forces are compared with those predicted by the stokes wave theory and morison equation respectively only the diameter to wavelength ratios for which the morison equation is applicable are considered and regular waves are generated with satisfying the condition that wave steepness is smaller than the critical wave steepness as in the previous study lee et al 2020 the effects of the critical non dimensional parameters such as the relative radius k r relative depth k h relative elevation k η and relative amplitude k a on the secondary load cycle are studied and a force difference function is introduced to accurately describe the non dimensional wave force the optimum values of the force difference function are obtained using the data fitting method and the proposed equation is verified by comparing the analytical results with the experimental data 2 methodology 2 1 experimental setup to measure the wave load exerted on a vertical circular cylinder experiments were carried out in a wave flume located in the physical experiment building at korea institute of ocean science and technology kiost as shown in fig 1 the experimental wave flume is 50 m long 1 2 m wide and 1 6 m deep along the length of the wave flume from 10 to 20 m the depth gradually decreases from 1 6 m to 1 25 m and the corresponding bottom slope m is 1 0 035 on average the frame and one side wall of the wave flume are made of stainless steel and the other side wall is made of tempered glass enabling visual observation a piston type wavemaker vti corporation spain made of glass fiber reinforced plastic and stainless steel was initially located 3 4 m away from the left end of the wave flume the dimensions of the wavemaker are width 1 18 m and height 1 6 m and the width is 2 cm narrower than the width of the flume to mitigate friction between the wavemaker and side walls of the flume the motion of the wavemaker is manipulated by the wave generation software awasys 7 and the height of the regular wave can be maximized up to 0 55 m with the maximum stroke of 1 2 m for wave periods ranging from 1 7 to 3 0 s a resistance type wave gauge placed on the front side of the wavemaker measures water surface elevation and controls the movement of the wavemaker which is utilized as an active reflection in addition passive absorbers are installed at both ends of the wave flume to suppress and minimize the wave reflection a detailed description of the wave flume is provided in oh et al 2020 a material polymethyl methacrylate was selected for fabricating the vertical cylinders as shown in fig 2 a because it is lightweight allowing easy placement of cylinders of different diameters during the experiments in addition it has almost no deformation due to the wave force resulting in rigid body motion vertical cylinders with diameters of 0 12 0 14 and 0 16 m length 1 m and thickness 0 01 m were fabricated to minimize the wave reflection against the vertical cylinder the cylinder was installed at the intersection of the flat bed and inclined bed which is 9 5 m away from the left end of the wave flume all experiments were carried out by fixing the water depth to 1 m leading to a submergence depth of the vertical cylinders of 0 33 m detailed descriptions of the vertical cylinders are listed in table 1 the time histories of the wave height and wave period for 30 s were measured by using a whm 1 capacitance type wave gauge sewon giyeon co ltd korea as shown in fig 2 b the mcs 10 sensor hbk germany measures the three dimensional forces and moments up to 2 kn and 0 15 knm respectively and was placed at the bottom of the steel plate to measure the wave load at the center of the steel plate there are 13 holes to which the mcs 10 sensor can be attached and the aluminum frame is connected to 8 holes on the border by bolts as shown in fig 2 c the structure was constructed by connecting the components in the order of frame steel plate force sensor cylinder cover and vertical cylinder the electrical signal of the wave force and moment converted by the sensor was recorded at a sampling rate of 50 hz from the data acquisition modules quantumx 1615b hbk germany 2 2 wave analysis a velocity potential should satisfy the continuity equation with the assumption of irrotational and incompressible fluid as well of no or negligibly small viscosity and the laplace equation is validated with the relationship between the velocity vector and the velocity potential dean and dalrymple 1991 there are numerous solutions for the laplace equation in the physics and engineering fields by using boundary conditions of the water wave such as water wave motion no flow on the sea bed no pressure on the water surface and lateral periodicity the velocity potential of the linear wave is expressed as a function of the x and z coordinates and time t as dean and dalrymple 1991 1 ϕ h 2 g ω cosh k h z cosh k h sin k x ω t where h is the wave height g is the gravitational acceleration h represents the water depth and k 2 π l and ω 2 π t are the wave number and wave frequency respectively and where t is the wave period and l is the wavelength using the velocity potential in eq 1 the water surface elevation η the horizontal and vertical particle velocities are given by 2 η h 2 cos k x ω t 3 u x ϕ x h 2 g k ω cosh k h z cosh k h cos k x ω t 4 u z ϕ z h 2 g k ω sinh k h z cosh k h sin k x ω t the horizontal and vertical particle velocities have a phase difference of 90 the horizontal particle velocity is maximized at the wave crest and trough and the vertical particle velocity is the highest when the wave surface displacement becomes zero dean and dalrymple 1991 using the velocity potential function a transfer function representing the relation between the stroke of the wavemaker and the wave height is written by 5 h s 2 cosh 2 k h 1 sinh 2 k h 2 k h where s is the stroke of piston type wavemaker and k h represents the relative depth dean and dalrymple 1991 once the target wave height and period are determined the time history of the displacement of the wavemaker is expressed as 6 x piston s 2 sin ω t using perturbation theory the velocity potential can be expanded to include higher order terms the velocity potential for the second order stokes wave is expressed by summing the first order term in eq 1 and additional second order term as 7 ϕ h 2 g ω cosh k h z cosh k h sin k x ω t 3 32 h 2 ω cosh 2 k h z sinh 4 k h sin 2 k x ω t with the use of second order theory the water surface elevation particle velocities and motion of the wavemaker are described as 8 η h 2 cos k x ω t h 2 k 16 cosh k h sinh 3 k h 2 cosh 2 k h cos 2 k x ω t 9 u x ϕ x h

piston s 2 sin ω t h 2 32 h 3 cosh k h sinh 3 k h 2 s h sin 2 ω t the waves of various heights and periods in this research are generated using second order wave theory in eq 11 more details about the motion of the wavemaker can be found in dean and dalrymple 1991 and madsen 1971 among various methods for calculating the wave force exerted on structures the choice of relevant method is decided according to the incident wave conditions and the relative dimensions of the structure xiong et al 2020 representative examples are the morison equation which is a semi empirical formula morison et al 1950 and the maccamy and fuchs theory that considers the diffraction effect maccamy and fuchs 1954 the former is employed to predict the wave force exerted on a small scale structure with a ratio of the diameter of the structure d to wavelength l smaller than 0 2 for large scale structures with d l larger than 0 2 the latter is used xiong et al 2020 all the experiments carried out in this work are included in the range d l 0 2 when the submerged depth is expressed as h s the wave force exerted on the vertical cylinder is defined by the morison equation which is the sum of the drag force f d and inertia force f i as follows 12 f h f d f i h s η 1 2 ρ c d d u x u x d z h s η ρ c m π d 2 4 u x t d z where f h is the horizontal wave force ρ represents the mass density of water d is the diameter of the vertical cylinder and η is the water surface elevation in eqs 2 and 8 in eq 12 c d and c m are the drag and inertia coefficients respectively and u x and u x t are the horizontal particle velocity and acceleration calculated from linear and stokes wave theories the reynolds number r e and keulegan carpenter number k c are dimensionless variables that define the relationship between the viscous force and inertia force when smooth circular cylinders are exposed to steady currents and oscillatory flow respectively and are expressed as 13 r e u m d ν ω η m d ν 14 k c u m t d π η m r where u m is the maximum amplitude of the horizontal particle velocity η m is the maximum wave elevation r is the radius of the cylinder and ν represents the kinematic viscosity c d and c m in eq 12 are determined by the reynolds and keulegan carpenter numbers respectively for example c d is maintained at a constant value of 1 2 in the sub critical range 300 r e 3 5 1 0 5 and abruptly decreases and converges to a value smaller than 1 when r e exceeds this range sumer and fredsøe 2006 c m is approximately 2 when k c 6 and it is reduced and converges to a value smaller than 2 when k c is larger than approximately 7 sumer and fredsøe 2006 sarpkaya 2010 the experimental conditions in this work satisfy the conditions of sub critical range of reynolds number and small keulegan carpenter number and the time series of wave heights and forces recorded in the experiments were verified by using the second order stokes wave theory and the morison equation the detailed theoretical and experimental derivation of the wave force can be found in sarpkaya 2010 and sumer and fredsøe 2006 and the values of c d and c m for the ranges of r e and k c are listed in table 2 3 validation studies in this section regular waves with small and large wave steepness were generated and the wave forces acting on cylinders of three different diameters were obtained the measured wave height and force were compared with the analytical solutions by stokes wave theory eq 8 and the morison equation eq 12 respectively and the differences between the two results were investigated firstly regular waves about 9 5 cm in height were generated with wave periods in the range from 0 994 to 2 248 s as listed in table 3 fig 3 a to c show the wave heights that were measured in cases i 4 ii 4 and iii 4 and calculated by stokes wave theory respectively overall both results are in good agreement although the magnitudes of the measured wave heights are slightly larger than those calculated by the analytical solution ursell et al 1960 carried out regular wave experiments and wave heights were measured within an error of 4 for 0 002 h l 0 03 lee and hong 2020b performed regular wave tests using the experimental wave flume in the following ranges of wave steepness 0 013 h l 0 045 and 0 025 h l 0 094 they found that the experimental wave heights were within an error of 4 1 in the former wave steepness range the experimental waves were accurately generated regardless of the relative depth when the wave steepness was equal to or smaller than 0 067 in the latter range similarly every wave steepness of cases i 4 ii 4 and iii 4 is within 0 031 to 0 032 which is analogous to those in the previous studies lee and hong 2020b ursell et al 1960 with errors within 4 in fig 3 d to f the measured wave force and the force calculated by the morison equation are compared the magnitude of the wave force increases as the diameter of the cylinder increases regardless of the diameter of the cylinder the minimum peaks of the measured wave force are slightly larger than the results calculated by the morison equation but both results are generally in good agreement consequently the wave height and force profiles measured in the experiment satisfy stokes wave theory and the morison equation when the ratio of the diameter to the incident wavelength is smaller than 0 2 and the wave steepness is within the range proposed in the previous studies lee and hong 2020b ursell et al 1960 in order to verify the accuracy of the measured wave height and force when the wave steepness exceeds 0 067 regular waves about 18 5 cm in height were generated with wave periods in the range from 1 045 to 2 246 s as listed in table 4 lee et al 2020 generated a steep regular wave using a piston type wavemaker and suggested that the waves break when the wave steepness exceeds 0 131 the maximum wave steepness of all the cases listed in table 4 is 0 104 satisfying the non breaking wave steepness condition suggested by the previous study lee et al 2020 cases iv 3 v 3 and vi 3 were selected to compare the measured wave heights with the solution by the stokes theory and the measured wave forces with the results calculated by the morison equation as shown in fig 4 a to c the magnitudes of the measured wave heights are slightly larger than those calculated by stokes theory while both results agree well in terms of the wave period however the measured wave forces presented in fig 4 d to f show additional fluctuation near the wave trough which is not considered by the morison equation such a phenomenon is called the secondary load cycle slc according to grue and huseby 2002 the froude number f r is one of the significant factors determining the occurrence of the slc and it is defined as 15 f r u m g d ω η m g d where ω is the wave frequency η m is the maximum wave elevation g is the gravitational acceleration and d is the diameter of the cylinder the analytical and experimental non dimensional forces for the variation of k a are shown in fig 5 a the non dimensional forces of cases i to iii open symbols are in close agreement with the analytical results although the slc did not occurs in cases i to iii the analytical value of k a and non dimensional force are underestimated than that of measured data it is because the wave height and wave force measured in the experiment are slightly larger than the analytical solution of stokes theory and the morison equation the difference between the analytical solution and measured data becomes larger when k a is equal to or larger than 0 15 this difference is more eminent in results of cases iv to vi filled symbols in 18 cases among cases iv 1 to vi 10 the slc occurs and the non dimensional force increases as the k a increases therefore it is clear that an eminent difference between the analytical and experimental wave force is generated owing to the slc it is concluded that the magnitude of the slc is correlated with the wave steepness as reported by chaplin et al 1997 grue and huseby 2002 pointed out that the slc occurs when f r exceeds 0 4 liu et al 2019 indicated that the critical froude number is 0 34 and 0 277 respectively under non breaking and breaking waves and the slc becomes pronounced when the number is equal to or larger than 0 4 and 0 35 recently wang et al 2020a demonstrated that the slc begins to occur when f r is about 0 167 and it becomes apparent when f r is equal to or larger than 0 22 chang et al 2019 also stated that f r 0 4 may be the transition line in this work the slc occurs in the range of f r between 0 391 and 0 515 with the critical froude number f r c r between 0 391 and 0 4 the non dimensional parameter k c also has an effect on the slc riise et al 2018 wang et al 2020a the minimum and maximum values of k c that cause the slc are 3 64 and 5 21 in this work and those of the previous works are 3 97 9 95 grue and huseby 2002 3 33 7 18 in non breaking cases liu et al 2019 3 93 11 51 in breaking cases liu et al 2019 5 142 10 279 chang et al 2019 and 11 01 20 26 wang et al 2020a therefore the critical froude number f r c r decreases with increasing k c as reported by wang et al 2020a however the ranges of k r and k η when the slc occurs were not consistent in the previous researches grue and huseby 2002 stated that the slc occurs in the range of k r between 0 1 0 33 and when k η is smaller than 0 3 meanwhile liu et al 2019 demonstrated that the slc begins to occur for all simulations when k η 0 151 and the maximum value of k η is 0 422 in this work the ranges of k r and k η are 0 130 0 297 and 0 215 0 347 respectively and the slc was also observed when k η 0 3 as aforementioned it is confirmed that the value of f r c r varies with k c from previous works and k c in eq 14 can also be expressed as a function of k r and k η as f r therefore the ranges of k r and k η where the slc occurs in the experiment or simulation can be changed by k c in fig 5 b all the experimental results in tables 3 and 4 curves by the maximum and minimum k c as well as f r 0 4 are plotted on the k r k η plane except for the two cases close to the threshold value f r of 0 391 and 0 395 all the cases of this work where the slc occurs reside within the curves by the maximum k c minimum k c and f r 0 4 also the minimum values of k η and k r inducing the slc are equal to or larger than the x and y coordinates of the f r 0 4 and maximum k c curve intersection and both the maximum values of k η and k r increase corresponding to the minimum k c curve because the range of k c changes by wave condition and diameter of the cylinder the ranges of k r and k η causing the slc also change by the varying k c similar to the results presented in fig 5 b the minimum and maximum values of k r and k η when the slc occurs are changed depending on the range of k c in the previous works therefore the reason why the ranges of k r and k η inducing the slc are different in each study can be explained by the maximum and minimum values of the k c in fig 5 c the measured data of the present study are plotted on k r k η plane together with experimental results of the previous studies grue and huseby 2002 liu et al 2019 chang et al 2019 according to the maximum and minimum k c from 3 33 to 11 51 of all the previous studies and our study the k r and k η of all cases when slc occurred satisfies the proposed k c rule comprehensively it is confirmed that the wave height obtained in the experiment is consistent with the analytical solution and the accuracy of the generated wave is verified additionally the wave force measured in the cases when the f r is smaller than the f r c r exactly corresponds to the calculated force by the morison equation however even if the incident wave satisfies the condition d l 0 2 it is difficult to precisely predict the wave force using the morison equation if the slc takes place 4 results and discussions for the regular waves acting on a vertical cylinder the horizontal wave force f h is expressed as a function of the following dimensional parameters fan et al 2018 16 f h f ρ g h h l d ν t where ρ and ν are the mass density and kinematic viscosity of water respectively g is the gravitational acceleration h and l are the wave height and wavelength of the incident wave respectively h represents the water depth and t is time by using dimensional analysis the non dimensional wave force is written as 17 f h ρ g h s d 2 f h l h l d l ν g l 3 t g l where h s is the submerged depth of the cylinder according to sumer and fredsøe 2006 and sarpkaya 2010 the viscous force is negligibly small because the inertial component of the wave force is larger than the viscous component if the keulegan carpenter number is small therefore the dimensionless parameter ν g l 3 that indicates the effect of fluid viscosity can be neglected fan et al 2018 as shown in figs 3 and 4 t g l can be replaced by a dimensionless parameter t t because the period of the wave force is dominated by the incident wave period additionally the remaining dimensionless parameters in eq 17 can be replaced by k a k h and k r respectively by using the wave number k 2 π l radius of cylinder r d 2 and wave amplitude a h 2 resulting in 18 f h f h ρ g h s d 2 f k a k h k r t t where k a is the ratio of wave height to wavelength the dimensionless parameter known as the relative amplitude and k h is the relative depth determined by the wave number and water depth these two parameters are the criteria for evaluating the accuracy of the wave height and wavelength generated by the wavemaker as mentioned in section 2 2 the relative radius k r and d l are non dimensional variables categorizing large or small scale structures when the wave condition satisfies d l 0 2 the wave force can be accurately predicted by using the morison equation all the experiments of the present study meet this criterion however additional fluctuation on the wave force induced by the secondary load cycle slc cannot be calculated by the morison equation if the difference between the force calculated by the morison equation and the measured wave force is expressed as a function of k a k h t t and k r the morison equation can be modified to accommodate this difference the force difference function δ f s l c is given by 19 δ f s l c f k a k h k r t t in the previous study fan et al 2018 dimensional parameters of the slc have been defined as characteristic magnitude characteristic duration and characteristic time between the zero point and the local minimum of the wave force on the force time plane in this work the non dimensional parameters of the slc are newly defined on the f h t t plane and are presented in fig 6 the chain and thick solid lines indicate non dimensional wave forces when the slc occurs and does not occur respectively and the difference δ f s l c between the force calculated by the morison equation and the measured wave force is illustrated by the area filled with thin solid lines on the basis of the t t axis the non dimensional wave force f h is divided into a positive force f p and negative force f n and the corresponding non dimensional periods are defined as t p and t n respectively furthermore t n is divided into t n 1 and t n 2 which correspond to the section from the point where f p becomes zero to the point where the chain and thick solid lines intersect and the section from the intersection to the upward crossing zero points respectively t i i is the non dimensional characteristic duration of the slc which is one of the variables defined by previous studies grue and huseby 2002 fan et al 2018 among the 45 cases shown in tables 3 and 4 the slc occurred in 18 cases and the detailed parameter values are listed in table 5 the measured wave force in cases 2 4 and 5 and the non dimensional force calculated by the morison equation are presented in fig 7 the time at which the fifth positive force peak occurs is converted into t 0 and nondimensionalized by the incident wave period t regardless of the diameter of the cylinder and incident wave condition the experimentally measured t t shows good agreement with the result calculated by the morison equation whereas the negative peak forces are different from the analytical solution due to the slc the non dimensional characteristic duration of the slc t i i in the present study varies from 0 151 to 0 185 which is slightly larger than 0 150 predicted by chaplin et al 1997 t i i values in the non breaking and breaking wave cases of the work by liu et al 2019 were measured as from 0 157 to 0 174 and from 0 143 to 0 242 respectively similarly t i i measured by wang et al 2020a changes within the ranges of 0 142 to 0 169 in cases 3 to 7 and 0 126 to 0 185 in cases 8 to 19 and t i i values in this study are also in the range reported by the previous study as for the regular wave t i i is observed in a larger range in the breaking wave rather than that of the non breaking wave also t i i tends to be measured over a wider range in focused waves compared to regular waves t n 1 values in cases iv 2 v 2 and vi 2 in fig 7 a to c and table 5 are larger than 0 221 and the negative path is distorted however t n 1 is measured as a smaller value between 0 191 and 0 204 because the negative path is slightly curved in fig 7 d to i in general regardless of the diameter of the cylinder the tendency of the value of t n 1 and the curvature of the negative path vary by the wave period and therefore the slc is predicted to vary sensitively with the incident wave condition the spectra of the non dimensional wave force calculated by the morison equation in eq 12 solid lines and that of measured data dotted lines are shown in fig 8 the frequencies f is nondimensionalized by dividing with the incident wave frequency ω and the largest magnitude is observed at f w 1 the other peaks are observed at integer multiples of the component f w and the magnitude decreases as the f w increases in the spectra calculated by the morison equation only the first to third harmonic wave forces are observed and the peak of second harmonic force is larger than that of the experimentally measured the high frequency wave forces are not observed by the morison equation while the harmonic wave forces higher than the third harmonic forces are obtained in the measured data when the slc occurs liu et al 2019 reported the spectra of one breaking wave with the slc case two non breaking waves with slc cases and the non breaking wave force without the slc case when the slc occurs the seventh harmonic wave force was observed from the breaking wave case while the fourth and fifth harmonic wave forces were yielded from non breaking wave cases liu et al 2019 however the second and third harmonic wave forces were observed from the non breaking wave case without the slc occurred liu et al 2019 this observation is analogous to the spectra results using the morison equation carried out in the present work liu et al 2019 demonstrated that the high frequency wave force is closely related to the existence of the slc similarly wang et al 2020a stated that the third and fourth order harmonic forces are very important for the slc consequently it is assumed that the difference between the force calculated by the morison equation and the measured wave force when the slc occurs in the non breaking regular wave is induced from the difference of the higher harmonic forces equal to or larger than the second harmonic force therefore the wave force can be estimated more accurately by correcting the difference of the second to the fourth harmonic forces between the force calculated by the morison equation and the measured wave force the force differences δ f s l c of the 18 obtained datasets in which the slc occurred are presented in fig 9 a in the case of k η 0 3 thin solid lines the maximum and minimum force differences are generated when t t is 0 17 and 0 32 respectively and the amplitudes of δ f s l c are analogous regardless of the incident wave condition the maximum and minimum force difference peaks occur when t t is 0 14 and 0 29 respectively for the case of k η 0 3 thick solid lines and the amplitude of the curve changes for the incident wave condition as aforementioned t n 1 and the curvature of the negative path tends to be categorized as two types depending on the wave condition regardless of the diameter of the cylinder similarly the shape of the δ f s l c is divided into two types based on k η of 0 3 all the δ f s l c are in the form of the summation of a number of sine functions regardless of the incident wave condition and the diameter of the cylinder as shown in fig 9 a similarly the spectra of the second and fourth harmonic wave forces in fig 8 show a large difference between the results calculated by the morison equation and the measured data these results imply that the force difference can be corrected by using two sine functions consequently once the wave force is expressed as the summation of a number of sine functions using a fast fourier transform analysis the force difference is expressed as the summation of the second and fourth harmonic components as 20 δ f s l c a 0 a 1 sin 2 2 π t t b 1 a 2 sin 4 2 π t t b 2 where a 1 and a 2 are the amplitudes of the two sine functions b 1 and b 2 are the phases for the k η value and a 0 is the constant value to make the force difference function zero when t t is equal to zero the non dimensional frequencies of the force difference function can be fixed as twice or four times the 2 π t t respectively from the second and fourth harmonic forces in fig 9 b the force differences of cases v 2 and v 4 are compared by applying the data fitting method to eq 20 and it is shown that the experimental results are in good agreement with the results by the proposed empirical formula for both cases the r squared value and root mean square error rmse for the two cases are 0 9949 and 0 9873 and 0 0037 and 0 0048 respectively indicating that the results are highly reliable in addition the averaged r squared value and rmse are 0 9880 and 0 0045 respectively when the force difference curve of the 18 experiment cases in which the slc occurs is fitted by eq 20 therefore the non dimensional force difference caused by the slc can be accurately described by the proposed empirical formula the relation between magnitude and phase of the force difference function by the data fitting method and the main parameters of the non dimensional force k h k a and k r are analyzed firstly the force difference function shown in fig 9 a can be categorized into two phases separated by k η 0 3 therefore with the average value the phase of the cases with the slc occurred can be defined as a constant value in accordance with the k η range as listed in table 6 the relationship between the amplitudes of δ f s l c obtained by the data fitting method and the non dimensional variables k h k a and k r are compared in fig 10 the amplitudes of a 1 are proportional to k h k a and k r and the r squared values are 0 965 0 955 and 0 788 respectively as shown in fig 10 d to f the summation of a 1 and a 2 is linearly correlated with k h k a and k r and the r squared values are 0 942 0 934 and 0 741 respectively by using the data fitting method the empirical formulas of a 1 and a 2 expressed as 21 a 1 0 0345 k h 0 0510 22 a 1 0 4406 k a 0 0663 23 a 1 0 3327 k r 0 0171 24 a 1 a 2 0 0358 k h 0 0244 25 a 1 a 2 0 4584 k a 0 0405 26 a 1 a 2 0 3394 k r 0 0121 the magnitude of the slc is dependent on the incident wave condition as reported by liu et al 2019 and the force difference δ f s l c increases as the duration t i i and magnitude of the slc increases fig 6 in specific as shown in fig 10 the first and second amplitudes of the δ f s l c are proportional to k h and k a respectively therefore similar to the magnitude of the slc the amplitude of δ f s l c has a close relationship with the incident wave condition when the diameter of the cylinder changes the slope of the curves in eqs 23 and 26 varies and the r squared values of k r amplitude curves are less accurate than that of k h and k a however when comparing for each diameter the r squared values of k r amplitude curves are calculated as 0 972 and 0 968 at d 1 0 978 and 0 975 at d 2 and 0 998 and 0 986 at d 3 respectively and the results are more accurate than those of the k h and k a both k c and f r which have significant effects on the magnitude of the slc are functions of k r and k η in the present study amplitudes of the δ f s l c are proportional to f r as reported by liu et al 2019 also amplitudes of the δ f s l c are inversely proportional to k c and therefore k c has effects on the magnitude of the slc as suggested by wang et al 2020a however when the diameter of the cylinder changes the slopes of the amplitude curves by k c and f r are varied similarly to the slope variation of the k r amplitude curves therefore it has a limitation to propose a normalized form of the force difference amplitudes with k r k c and f r which are influenced by the diameter of the cylinder regardless of the diameter the δ f s l c can be corrected more accurately by calculating a 1 and a 2 using the linear relationship of the k h or k a consequently the amplitude of the force difference can be expressed in terms of k a or k h and the phases of the force difference can be defined as a constant value according to the k η range using the force difference function the non dimensional morison equation can be modified as 27 f h f m p f m n δ f s l c where f m p and f m n are the positive and negative forces of the morison equation respectively and δ f s l c is the force difference induced by the slc the measured wave forces from cases 2 4 and 5 with slc occurred the wave forces calculated by the morison equation in eq 12 and the wave forces calculated by the proposed equation in eq 27 are plotted in fig 11 from table 6 the phases of the force difference function are used and the values of the first and second amplitudes are selected from eqs 21 and 24 a good agreement between the measured data and the calculated results by the empirical formula is observed in fig 11 this indicates that a reasonable non dimensional wave force can be expressed when the morison equation modified by δ f s l c which takes into account the force effect by the slc to verify the proposed force difference function the non dimensional wave forces calculated by the morison equation and modified morison equation are compared with the measured data in the frequency domain as shown in fig 12 compared with the spectra of measured data the peaks of the second and fourth harmonic wave forces calculated by the modified morison equation are more accurate than those by the morison equation it should be noted that the proposed force difference function enables the calculation of the force due to the slc which cannot be calculated by the morison equation and main variables including amplitudes and phases of the force difference function can be accurately predicted by use of the non dimensional parameters k h and k η however the proposed equation has several limitations the difference between the force calculated by the morison equation and the measured wave force can be described only for the non breaking regular waves which satisfy the d l 0 2 also only the second to fourth harmonic forces can be accurately corrected using the force difference function therefore it is limited to predict the non dimensional wave force when various waves inducing the high frequency wave force than the fourth harmonic force such as the focused wave breaking wave and regular waves with d l 0 2 further study is required for an additional term in the force difference function 5 summary and conclusions to evaluate the wave force acting on cylindrical types of offshore structures numerous theoretical approaches have been utilized however none of those could accurately predict the wave force when the secondary load cycle slc occurs the slc is one of the most important factors in the ringing phenomenon that induces intense vibration which can be destructive in offshore structures in this study the slc generated by steep non breaking regular waves exerted on a single vertical cylinder is studied using an experimental wave flume with a piston type wavemaker and a non dimensional wave force function is proposed by combining the morison equation with an empirical force difference function δ f s l c to evaluate the accuracy of the measured wave height and force 15 and 30 cases of regular waves in which the wave steepness satisfies 0 015 h l 0 062 and 0 030 h l 0 104 are generated and the wave heights and forces are compared with the solutions calculated by stokes wave theory and the morison equation respectively in all cases the ratio of the diameter of the cylinder d to the measured wavelength of the incident waves l satisfied the d l 0 2 which is criterion for applicability of the morison equation the wave heights periods and forces with the wave steepness equal to or smaller than 0 062 and the froude number f r 0 4 show good agreement with the analytical solution however the slc occurs in 18 cases where the wave steepness and f r exceed the aforementioned ranges and the substantial difference is observed between the force calculated by the morison equation and the measured wave force to describe the force difference the force difference function δ f s l c is proposed as the summation of two sine functions the correlation between the amplitude phase and non dimensional frequency of the δ f s l c and the following non dimensional parameters such as the relative elevation k η relative amplitude k a relative radius k r and relative depth k h are analyzed through a fast fourier transform analysis it is confirmed that the main force difference is induced by the second and fourth harmonic forces and the phases of the δ f s l c are divided on the basis of k η at the value of 0 3 the first amplitude of the force difference function is proportional to k h and k a and the summation of the amplitudes is also linearly correlated with the k h and k a it should be noted that the change due to the k r f r and keulegan carpenter number k c is also linearly correlated with the amplitudes of the δ f s l c but the slope of the linear relationship with the amplitude of force difference function changes by the variation of the diameter of the cylinder consequently the force difference caused by the slc appears to be mainly determined by the incident wave conditions particularly k h and k a when the ratio of the column diameter to wavelength is smaller than 0 2 this study shows that the developed force difference function is valid for predicting the wave forces when the slc is generated by the non breaking regular wave exerted on a single vertical cylinder however the force difference function is only applicable to the non breaking regular waves of d l smaller than 0 2 which is the requirement for the use of the morison equation therefore the force difference function has a limitation in describing the wave forces induced by the breaking wave focused wave and regular wave with d l 0 2 that cause the high frequency wave forces larger than fourth harmonic forces the proposed methodology might be beneficial for the studies including wave structure experiments and numerical simulation to investigate the slc problems under regular waves with d l 0 2 credit authorship contribution statement sangmin lee conceptualization methodology
